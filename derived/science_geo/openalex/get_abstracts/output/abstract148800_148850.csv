However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating Cbfa1 activity. This work examines the role of the MAPK pathway in regulating Cbfa1-dependent transcription. Stimulation of MAPK by transfecting a constitutively active form of MEK1, MEK(SP), into MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells increased endogenous OCN mRNA, while a dominant negative mutant, MEK(DN), was inhibitory. MEK(SP) also stimulated activity of a 147-base pair minimal OCN promoter, and this stimulation required an intact copy of OSE2, the DNA binding site for Cbfa1. Effects of MEK(SP) were specific to Cbfa1-positive osteoblast-like cells. A purified His-tagged Cbfa1 fusion protein was directly phosphorylated by activated recombinant MAPK in vitro. Furthermore, 32P metabolic labeling studies demonstrated that MEK(SP) clearly enhanced phosphorylation of Cbfa1 in intact cells, while MEK(DN) decreased phosphorylation. The specific MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited extracellular matrix-dependent up-regulation of the OCN promoter, indicating that the MAPK pathway and, presumably, Cbfa1 phosphorylation are also required for responsiveness of osteoblasts to extracellular matrix signals. This study is the first demonstration that Cbfa1 is controlled by MAPKs and suggests that this pathway has an important role in the control of osteoblast-specific gene expression.

Production of this matrix is followed by induction of a set of genes associated with terminally differentiated cells, including osteocalcin (OCN), bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, and the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor, and ultimately, mineralization of the matrix (1.Gerstenfeld L.C.

Until recently, however, little was known about the transcriptional events regulating matrix-induced gene expression. In 1995, Ducy and Karsenty (6.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) characterized osteoblast-specific element 2 (OSE2), a cis-acting sequence in the promoter of the murine OCN gene 2 (mOG2) that is required for its expression in osteoblastic cells (7.Frendo J.L.

The factor that binds this element, initially termed Osf2, was subsequently identified as Cbfa1, a member of the Cbf/Runt family of transcription factors, which share a DNA binding motif that is homologous to the Drosophila protein, Runt (8.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). Cbfa1, which is also known as PEBP2αA1 and AML3, is essential for the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal precursors, since homozygous Cbfa1 −/− mice show a complete lack of functional osteoblasts (9.Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Moreover, this factor is required for bone matrix synthesis by differentiated osteoblasts (11.Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), indicating that it regulates osteoblast gene expression at multiple levels. We recently showed that Cbfa1 at least in part mediates the response of preosteoblasts to matrix signals (12.Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Specifically, ECM production by murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells dramatically increases OSE2-dependent transcription of the OCN promoter andin vitro binding of Cbfa1 to the OSE2 sequence. This stimulation requires an α2β1integrin-collagen interaction, thus linking for the first time matrix production with osteoblast-specific transcription. Interestingly, this increase in transcriptional activity is not accompanied by a significant change in Cbfa1 mRNA or protein, suggesting that Cbfa1 is activated either by a posttranslational modification or through an accessory factor. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway provides a plausible link between cell surface integrin activation by ECM and subsequent stimulation of Cbfa1-dependent transcription. Consistent with this model, Takeuchi and co-workers showed that the binding of type I collagen to the α2β1integrin of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts activates MAPK and that this activation is necessary for ECM-dependent stimulation of the bone marker, alkaline phosphatase (14.Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to further explore the involvement of the MAPK pathway in osteoblast differentiation and function by directly testing the effects of an exogenously added MAPK pathway intermediate on Cbfa1-dependent transcription. As will be shown, transfection of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells with a constitutively active MAPK kinase stimulates expression of both endogenous OCN mRNA and an mOG2 promoter-driven reporter construct. MAPK-dependent transcription of this promoter requires both Cbfa1 and its DNA binding site, OSE2. Furthermore, transcriptional activation is accompanied by phosphorylation of Cbfa1, thus providing evidence that a MAPK-dependent phosphorylation cascade regulates Cbfa1 activity. α-[32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-mouse Cbfa1 serum was prepared in rabbit using a synthetic peptide as described previously (13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytic grade. Subclone 4 and subclone 42 MC3T3-E1 cells (MC-4 cells and MC-42 cells), two previously described strongly differentiating subclonal lines (12.Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15.Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), were maintained in ascorbic acid-free α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1% penicillin/streptomycin. F9 teratocarcinoma (from the American Type Culture Collection) and ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (16.Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Laurie McCauley (University of Michigan School of Dentistry) were grown in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 cells (from the American type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning mOG2 promoter inserts and multimeric oligonucleotides into the p4luc promoterless luciferase expression vector as described previously (6.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The Cbfa1 expression plasmids, pCMV5Cbfa1, pCMV5Cbfa1(Δ1–108), and pCMV5Cbfa1(Δ258–528), containing cDNAs encoding either wild type Cbfa1 or deletions thereof under cytomegalovirus promoter control, were also described previously (17.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pCMV5β-gal expression plasmid, used as a negative control for Cbfa1 overexpression experiments, was constructed by ligating a full-length bacterial β-galactosidase cDNA from plasmid pRSVβ-gal into theHindIII/BamHI sites of the pCMV5 vector. Expression plasmids pCMV5MEK(SP) and pCMV5MEK(DN), encoding, respectively, a constitutively active and dominant negative mutant of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1), were also previously described (18.Wu X. Noh S.J. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19.Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The vector expressing His-tagged mouse Cbfa1 fusion protein was constructed as follows. Mouse Cbfa1 cDNA was generated by PCR from the originally reported Osf2/Cbfa1 cDNA (8.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar) using a 5′ primer built in the SphI site (5′-TTTGCATGCTGGTTAATCTCTGCAGGT-3′) and a 3′ primer with aSalI site (5′-TTTGTCGACTCAATATGGCCG-3′) and digested withSalI and SphI. The gel-purified fragment was ligated into the SphI/SalI sites of pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cDNA encoding the N terminus of mouse Cbfa1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ primer (5′-TTTCTCGAGTGGTTAATCTCTGCAGGT-3′) with a XhoI site and 3′ primer containing an EcoRI site (5′-TTTGAATTCGCTCACGTCGCTCATCT-3′). The resulting product contains nucleotides 91–333 of the reported Osf2/Cbfa1 cDNA (8.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XhoI andEcoRI and ligated into XhoI/EcoRI sites of pTrc His A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The encoded protein contains 3 kDa from vector sequence including the poly-His tag and a total of 81 amino acids from the Cbfa1 cDNA to give a molecular mass of approximately 13 kDa. This includes 38 amino acids encoded by 5′ sequence in the cDNA that was reported to be upstream from the preferred translation start site (17.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length and N-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography using a ProBond column kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western blotting with a specific Cbfa1 antibody confirmed an apparent molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa for full-length Cbfa1 and 13–15 kDa for the N-terminal Cbfa1 fragment (result not shown). All cell lines were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 unless indicated otherwise. After 24 h, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmid plus 0.05 μg of pRL-SV40, containing a cDNA for Renilla reformis luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were then cultured in growth media for 24 h and then switched to medium containing 0.1% FBS to minimize the impact of serum growth factors on MAPK signaling. After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested and assayed using the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Whole cell extracts were prepared by harvesting cells in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% SDS, 2m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuel), and probed with a specific rabbit anti-mouse Cbfa1 antiserum as described previously (13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cell layers as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (20.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA were fractionated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper as described by Thomas (21.Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). The mouse OCN cDNA was from Dr. John Wozney (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) (22.Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Bueker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert was excised from plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis before labeling with α-[32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridizations were performed as described previously using a Bellco Autoblot hybridization oven (4.Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and quantitatively scanned using a Packard A2024 InstantImager. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with cDNA to 18 S rRNA (23.Renkawitz R. Gerbi S.A. Glatzer K.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 173: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of purified His-tagged fusion proteins was conducted in 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, in the presence of 0.5 μl (300 units) of recombinant activated MAPK (Calbiochem). Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 25 μl. Boiling with 20 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer terminated the reaction. Aliquots were then analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. COS-7 cells were transfected and cultured for 30 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS and then transferred to and incubated for 12 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. Labeling was conducted for 5 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1% FBS (dialyzed against phosphate-free DMEM) and 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per ml. Preparation of nuclear extracts was described previously (12.Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were precleaned twice with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min followed by pelleting of beads. 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-Cbfa1 antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected upon the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Precipitates were suspended one time in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the immunoprecipitated complexes were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 32P incorporation was measured using a Packard A2024 InstantImager. All transfection data are reported as means ± S.D. based on triplicate independent cell cultures from a representative experiment. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and qualitatively identical results were obtained. Previous studies showed that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the ECM-stimulated induction of alkaline phosphatase, an osteoblast-related enzyme (14.Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Specifically, forced expression of a MAPK-specific phosphatase inhibited matrix-induced alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells, while introduction of a constitutively active MAPK kinase enhanced this activity. To determine whether the MAPK pathway can stimulate the transcriptional activity of an osteoblast-related gene, we performed a similar set of experiments using expression of both the endogenous OCN gene and an mOG2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter as assays. Our strategy involved transfection of cells with MEK(SP), an expression plasmid that encodes a constitutively active form of MEK1 (also known as MAPK kinase). This dual specificity kinase would then activate the MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, the terminal kinases in the MAPK pathway. Transfection of MC-4 cells with MEK(SP) expression plasmid followed by 24 h of growth in low serum medium to suppress the activation of endogenous MAPK pathways by serum growth factors resulted in a 2-fold increase in OCN expression over that found in cells transfected with a control vector expressing β-galactosidase (Fig. 1, right two lanes). In contrast, transfection of cells with MEK(DN), which encodes a dominant negative MEK1 mutant suppressed basal levels of OCN mRNA in cells grown in 10% serum (Fig. 1, left two lanes). As shown in Fig. 2, MEK(SP) and MEK(DN) had similar effects on the expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a 147-base pair mOG2 promoter (p147-luc), which has been shown to have osteoblast-specific, matrix-induced activity (6.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar,13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar); i.e. MEK(SP) stimulated promoter activity, while MEK(DN) was inhibitory. However, when a 2-base pair mutation that renders the OSE2 sequence nonfunctional as a Cbfa1 binding site was introduced into this promoter fragment, both MEK(SP) stimulation and MEK(DN) suppression were abolished. Two additional studies were carried out to confirm the involvement of OSE2 and its binding partner, Cbfa1, in the MEK response. In the first, the ability of MEK(SP) to stimulate transcription of OSE2/34-luc, a reporter plasmid containing six copies of OSE2 upstream of a minimal 34-base pair mOG2 promoter, was examined in Cbfa1-positive (MC-4 and ROS17/2.8 cells) and Cbfa1-negative cell lines (Fig.3). A Western blot confirmed that only the two osteoblast-like cell lines expressed immunoreactive Cbfa1 protein (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3, B–E, MEK(SP) stimulated the low basal activity of OSE2/34-luc only in Cbfa1-positive cells; MEK(SP) stimulated luciferase activity 5-fold in MC-4 and 2.5-fold in ROS17/2.8 cells, while MEK(DN) had no effect. As shown in Fig. 3 B, OSE1/34-luc, a reporter plasmid containing six copies of OSE1, which is the other known osteoblastic-specific enhancer in the mOG2 promoter (6.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), was only slightly stimulated by MEK(SP). Furthermore, this stimulation was not dependent on the presence of an intact OSE1 site because it was not abolished by mutation (compare results with OSE1/34-luc versusOSE1mt/34-luc plasmids). Therefore, of the two known osteoblast-specific elements in the mOG2 promoter, only OSE2 is specifically stimulated by MEK, and this stimulation is only seen in cells that contain Cbfa1. The second study examined effects of MEK(SP) and MEK(DN) on cells transfected with OSE2/34-luc and a Cbfa1 expression plasmid (Fig.4). In both MC-4 and ROS17/2.8 cell lines, transfection with Cbfa1 increased basal promoter activity, and this stimulation was enhanced an additional 6–11-fold by MEK(SP), but not by MEK(DN) (A and B). Furthermore, as expected, Cbfa1 and MEK(SP) responsiveness in MC-4 cells was totally lost with mutation of the OSE2 sequence in the reporter plasmid (OSE2mt/34-luc reporter plasmid; Fig. 4 A). Transfection of the two nonosteoblastic cell lines (COS-7 or F9 cells) with the Cbfa1 expression plasmid increased the very low basal OSE2/34-luc activity approximately 5–10 fold, and this activity was stimulated an additional 8–18-fold by the MEK(SP) expression plasmid (Fig. 4,C and D). The MEK(DN) plasmid had no consistent effect on Cbfa1-dependent activity in F9 or COS-7 cells. Thus, both COS-7 and F9 cells acquired the ability to be stimulated by MEK(SP) when they were transfected with the Cbfa1 plasmid. Taken together, these results indicate that MAPK stimulation of OCN transcription requires binding of Cbfa1 to OSE2. We next addressed whether MEK could also stimulate the phosphorylation of Cbfa1in vitro and in intact cells. First, the ability of MAPK to phosphorylate a recombinant His-tagged Cbfa1 fusion protein was examined in vitro. As shown in Fig.5 A, incubation of fusion protein purified by nickel affinity chromatography with active MAPK, but not heat-inactivated MAPK, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, yielded a labeled band of the expected size on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, an N-terminal Cbfa1 fusion protein, missing residues 44–528, was not labeled although it contains several MAPK consensus phosphorylation sites. We next performed32P metabolic labeling studies to establish whether intact cells phosphorylate Cbfa1 and to assess the relationship between this phosphorylation and MAPK-stimulated gene expression. COS-7 cells were transfected as in Fig. 4 D with plasmids expressing β-galactosidase or Cbfa1 alone or Cbfa1 with MEK(SP) or MEK(DN). Cells were then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and nuclear extracts were prepared for Western blots or immunoprecipitation and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5 B, only samples transfected with the Cbfa1 expression plasmid gave a positive signal on Western blots. This analysis verified that amounts of Cbfa1 protein were similar in all three conditions. Replicate samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cbfa1 antibody, and 32P was visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 5 C) or quantified with an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) (Fig.5 D). Only samples transfected with the Cbfa1 vector contained immunoprecipitated 32P. Furthermore, cells co-transfected with MEK(DN) showed reduced incorporation, while those treated with MEK(SP) showed a 2.1-fold increase in 32P incorporation. Thus, Cbfa1 can be phosphorylated in intact cells, and this phosphorylation is increased by exogenous MEK(SP) but not by MEK(DN). As a first step in the identification of the residues necessary for MEK responsiveness, we conducted cotransfection experiments with two previously described Cbfa1 deletion mutants (17.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both deletions were in areas of the Cbfa1 sequence containing potential MAPK phosphorylation sites. These studies showed that COS-7 cells cotransfected with expression vectors encoding OSE2/34-luc, MEK(SP), and a Cbfa1 construct lacking the entire proline-serine-threonine (PST) domain (258–528) exhibited none of the reporter stimulation observed in cells transfected with wild type Cbfa1 (Fig.6). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 108 amino acids of Cbfa1, while greatly reducing the basal transactivation ability of the protein, did not effect the magnitude of MEK-induced stimulation. This result is consistent with the in vitro phosphorylation study shown in Fig. 5 A, which failed to detect 32P labeling of a 44-amino acid N-terminal Cbfa1 fragment. Taken together, these results suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway is able to regulate bone-specific OCN transcription through phosphorylation of residues in the PST domain of Cbfa1. The studies described above exclusively used transfected MEK1 expression vectors as a means of activating MAPK. The experiment shown in Fig. 7 examined whether MAPK signaling is necessary for activation of the OCN promoter by ECM synthesis. This study used MC-42 cells, a highly differentiating MC3T3-E1 subclone containing stably integrated copies of a 1.3-kb mOG2-luc reporter plasmid. Previous worked showed that ECM-dependent induction of luciferase activity in these cells parallels induction of the endogenous OCN mRNA (12.Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 10 days in control or ascorbic acid-containing medium (to induce ECM synthesis) and then treated for 6 h with increasing concentrations of the specific MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, PD98059 (24.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). This compound selectively inhibited ECM-dependent promoter activity by approximately 70%. Effects of PD98059 were specific in that this compound did not alter the luciferase activity of control cultures; nor did it reduce either cell DNA or protein (result not shown). The concentration of PD98059 required for maximal inhibition of ECM-dependent promoter activity (100 μm) is in the range reported by others as being necessary to block both MEK1- and MEK2-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK (25.Hodge C.

However, the molecular mechanism of Cbfa1 action is unknown. This study provides the first evidence that the MAPK pathway is important for Cbfa1-dependent transcription. We show that activation of MAPK signaling by transfection of preosteoblast cells with a constitutively active form of MEK1 induces transcription of the osteoblast-specific OCN gene and that this activation is accomplished through modulation of Cbfa1 transcriptional activity coincident with phosphorylation of Cbfa1. Furthermore, specific inhibition of the MAPK pathway was shown to selectively and rapidly block ECM-dependent activity of the OCN promoter. Activation of osteoblast-specific gene expression requires a complex and poorly understood dialogue between bone cells and their ECM. This laboratory and others showed that osteoblasts must secrete an ECM before they will express osteoblast-related genes such as OCN in vitro (1.Gerstenfeld L.C. Chipman S.D. Glowacki J. Lian J.B.

An important component of this response is the interaction of osteoblasts with type I collagen via α2β1 and α1β1 integrins (13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14.Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol.

Because the ECM-dependent increase in OCN gene transcription requires an intact promoter binding site for Cbfa1 (i.e. OSE2) and is accompanied by increased binding of Cbfa1 to OSE2 DNA in the absence of any change in Cbfa1 protein levels, we hypothesized that Cbfa1 must undergo some type of activation process to become transcriptionally active (13.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of Cbfa proteins with a common β subunit represents one potential mechanism for activating this class of transcription factors (29.Ogawa E. Inuzuka M. Maruyama M. Satake M. Naito-Fujimoto M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. Virology. 1993; 194: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For example, binding of Cbfa2 to Cbfβ stimulates DNA binding and transcriptional activity and is essential for the in vivo function of Cbfa2 (AML1) in hematopoiesis (30.Wang Q. Stacy T. Miller J.D. Lewis A.F. Gu T.L. Huang X. Bushweller J.H. Bories J.C. Alt F.W. Ryan G. Liu P.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Binder M. Marin-Padilla M. Sharpe A.H. Speck N.A.

Although we have not examined whether matrix signals affect the ability of Cbfa1 to heterodimerize with other nuclear factors, heterodimer formation with Cbfβ is unlikely due to the presence of a unique QA domain in the N-terminal region of Cbfa1, which blocksin vitro heterodimerization with the β subunit (17.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice heterozygous for the Cbfβ deletion do not exhibit skeletal abnormalities, which would be expected if Cbfa1 function required Cbfβ (30.Wang Q. Stacy T. Miller J.D. Lewis A.F. Gu T.L. Huang X. Bushweller J.H. Bories J.C. Alt F.W. Ryan G. Liu P.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Binder M. Marin-Padilla M. Sharpe A.H. Speck N.A.

Covalent modification is another potential route for Cbfa1 regulation. Because previous studies pointed to involvement of the MAPK pathway in the stimulation of osteoblast-specific gene expression by ECM (14.Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that Cbfa1 activity could be regulated by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation. Our demonstration that transfection of osteoblasts with a constitutively active MEK1 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Cbfa1 may point to a general mechanism for regulating gene expression in osteoblasts. The MAPK pathway is a major point of convergence for a variety of intracellular signals initiated by ECM-integrin interaction (32.Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), growth/differentiation factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (33.Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and mechanical stimulation (34.Schmidt C. Pommerenke H. Durr F. Nebe B. Rychly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5081-5085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, there is considerable cross-talk between this pathway and other signaling events such as those mediated by protein kinase C (35.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and BMPs (36.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Celeste A. Harris S.E. Ghosh-Choudhury G. Bone. 1998; 23: F012Google Scholar). The canonical model for MAPK activation after either receptor tyrosine kinase liganding or integrin occupancy involves dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase or, in the case of integrins, phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK. In either case, phosphorylation is followed by recruitment of an adapter protein-guanine nucleotide exchange protein complex (GRB2-mSOS), leading to GTP exchange and activation of Ras. Ras binds and activates the serine/threonine kinase, Raf, which phosphorylates and activates the dual specificity kinase, MEK. MEK subsequently phosphorylates and activates MAPK (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Two extracellular signal-regulated kinases (1 and 2) can subsequently stimulate gene expression by phosphorylating specific transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 37.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). We are clearly at the very early stages of investigating what is likely to be a complex set of related pathways for regulating Cbfa1 action. Our work highlights several directions for future study. First, although a recombinant MAPK was able to stimulate the in vitro phosphorylation of Cbfa1, we do not yet know whether MAPK can directly phosphorylate Cbfa1 in vivo. It is equally plausible that effects of MEK(SP) transfection on Cbfa1 are indirect and mediated by other signal transduction pathways that are directly activated by MAPK. Similarly, inhibitor studies showing a requirement for MEK1 and MEK2 in the activation of the OCN promoter by ECM synthesis do not address the possibility of there being additional steps between MAPK and Cbfa1. Interestingly, AML1, which plays a major role in hematopoiesis and cell transformation in leukemias, is phosphorylated and activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (38.Tanaka T. Kurokawa M. Ueki K. Tanaka K. Imai Y. Mitani K. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y. Kadowaki T. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3967-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the two phosphorylated serine residues in the PST domain of AML1 are conserved in Cbfa1, we found no changes in MEK responsiveness after these sites were mutated, indicating that other regions of the PST domain must be required for MAPK activation. 2G. Xiao and R. T. Franceschi, unpublished results. We are currently examining the Cbfa1 sequence in greater detail to identify sites in the 260-amino acid PST domain necessary for phosphorylation and biological activity and to determine if these sites are direct substrates for MAPK. A second area for future work deals with the identification of the ECM-associated signals regulating Cbfa1 and elucidation of the overall pathway for transcriptional activation. As noted above, a large number of signals can stimulate the MAPK cascade, but only a select number of these factors can affect osteoblast differentiation. It is likely that MAPK stimulation must be presented together with other appropriate stimuli for Cbfa1 activation to take place. For example, a recent study by Suzawa and co-workers showed that the ECM of MC3T3-E1 cells contains BMP2 and BMP4 and that these factors, together with type I collagen, are necessary for the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity observed when MC3T3-E1 cells are plated on ECM isolated from previously differentiated cells (39.Suzawa M. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Kato S. Ueno N. Miyazono K. Matsumoto T. Fujita T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that cells in chronic contact with their ECM, as is the case during osteoblast differentiation, may use a distinct mechanism to activate the MAPK cascade that involves protein kinase C and cytoskeleton-associated factors (35.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Future work will be required to resolve the degree to which other matrix molecules and non-MAPK signal transduction pathways are involved in the response of osteoblasts to their ECM."
https://openalex.org/W2005955483,"Regulation of the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its postreceptor substrates are essential determinants of insulin signal transduction. However, little is known regarding the molecular interactions that influence the balance of these processes, especially the phosphorylation state of postinsulin receptor substrates, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The specific activity of four candidate protein-tyrosine phosphatases (protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), SH2 domain-containing PTPase-2 (SHP-2), leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), and leukocyte antigen-related phosphatase) (LRP) toward IRS-1 dephosphorylation was studied using recombinant proteins <i>in vitro</i>. PTP1B exhibited the highest specific activity (percentage dephosphorylated per μg per min), and the enzyme activities varied over a range of 5.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>. When evaluated as a ratio of activity <i>versus</i> IRS-1 to that <i>versus p</i>-nitrophenyl phosphate, PTP1B remained significantly more active by 3.1–293-fold, respectively. Overlay blots with recombinant Src homology 2 domains of IRS-1 adaptor proteins showed that the loss of IRS-1 binding of Crk, GRB2, SHP-2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase paralleled the rate of overall IRS-1 dephosphorylation. Further studies revealed that the adaptor protein GRB2 strongly promoted the formation of a stable protein complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and catalytically inactive PTP1B, increasing their co-immunoprecipitation from an equimolar solution by 13.5 ± 3.3-fold (<i>n</i> = 7; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Inclusion of GRB2 in a reaction mixture of IRS-1 and active PTP1B also increased the overall rate of IRS-1 tyrosine dephosphorylation by 2.7–3.9-fold (<i>p</i> < 0.01). These results provide new insight into novel molecular interactions involving PTP1B and GRB2 that may influence the steady-state capacity of IRS-1 to function as a phosphotyrosine scaffold and possibly affect the balance of postreceptor insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2085047894,"A cDNA encoding a novel multispecific organic anion transporter, OAT4, was isolated from a human kidney cDNA library. The OAT4 cDNA consisted of 2210 base pairs that encoded a 550-amino acid residue protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains.

Northern blot analysis revealed that OAT4 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the placenta as well as in the kidney. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, OAT4 mediated the high affinity transport of estrone sulfate (K m = 1.01 μm) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (K m = 0.63 μm) in a sodium-independent manner. OAT4 also mediated the transport of ochratoxin A. OAT4-mediated transport of estrone sulfate was inhibited by several sulfate conjugates, such asp-nitrophenyl sulfate, α-naphthyl sulfate, β-estradiol sulfate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. By contrast, glucuronide conjugates showed little or no inhibitory effect on the OAT4-mediated transport of estrone sulfate. OAT4 interacted with chemically heterogeneous anionic compounds, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, sulfobromophthalein, penicillin G, and bile salts, whereas tetraethylammonium, an organic cation, did not.

The transcellular transport of organic anions has been demonstrated in other tissues where the tissue-specific barrier system exists.

We also suggested the existence of OAT3 in blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (17.Kusuhara H. Sekine T. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Kojima R. Cha S.H. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Thus, the transporter molecules, which are likely to act as efflux system of xenobiotics in blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, have just begun to be identified. In the placenta, the presence of a tissue-barrier system has been also predicted. However, little is known as to the mechanisms by which the placenta carries out this barrier function. The fetus is very vulnerable to foreign substances that enter the fetal circulation, and numerous drugs have been known to cause developmental defects in the fetus. Moreover, the fetus generates harmful metabolites, such as organic anions. Since the fetal kidney and liver possess limited capacity for the secretion, it is probable that the placenta plays the primary role in the excretion of these toxic compounds from the fetus. In the present study, we report the isolation of a novel member of the multispecific organic anion transporter family, OAT4. A high level of mRNA expression of OAT4 was detected in the placenta as well as in the kidney. EST (expressed sequence tag) data base were searched for “query OAT1,” and an EST clone (H12876) was identified. The [32P]dCTP-labeled probe was synthesized from the clone H12876 and used for the screening of a human kidney cDNA library. A nondirectional cDNA library was prepared from human kidney poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) using the Superscript Choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The screening of the cDNA library by H12876 was performed as described elsewhere (17.Kusuhara H. Sekine T. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Kojima R. Cha S.H. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 10 ng of the capped OAT4 cRNA and incubated in Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES) containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 18 °C. After 2 to 3 days of incubation, uptake and efflux experiments were performed at room temperature in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) as described elsewhere (17.Kusuhara H.

We repeated each experiment more than two times to confirm the results. The representative results are shown in Figs. 3 to 7. The kinetic parameters were obtained by an iterative nonlinear least squares method using a MULTI program (26.Yamaoka K. Tanigawara T. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J.

The concentration used for [3H]estrone sulfate was 50 nm. The inhibitor concentration was 5 μm. The values were expressed as a percentage of [3H]estrone sulfate uptake in OAT4-expressing oocytes in the absence of the inhibitor (mean ± S.E.; n = 8–10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A commercially available hybridization blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues (human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern (MTN)TM blot, CLONTECH) was used for the Northern blot analysis for OAT4. We used an OAT4 cDNA fragment (position numbers 1355–1758) as a probe, whose nucleotide sequence showed 60% identity to the corresponding region of human OAT1 and less than 60% identity to those of rat OAT1, rat OAT2, and rat OAT3. The master blot filter was hybridized with the probe overnight at 42 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filter was washed finally in a high stringency condition (0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). An EST data base search identified an EST clone, H12876, which showed significant identity to OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3. A human kidney cDNA library was screened using H12876 as a probe, and a cDNA encoding a novel membrane protein (OAT4) was isolated. OAT4 cDNA consisted of 2210 base pairs encoding a 550-amino acid residue protein. Fig. 1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of human OAT4 in the alignment with those of human OAT1, rat OAT2, and rat OAT3. The amino acid sequence of OAT4 showed 44, 43, 38, and 43% identity to those of human OAT1, rat OAT1, rat OAT2, and rat OAT3, respectively. OAT4 also showed significant identity to rat OCT1 (35%) (27.Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), rat OCT2 (33%) (28.Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K.-i. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and rat OCT3 (36%) (29.Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) predicted 12 membrane-spanning domains in OAT4 (hydropathy plot not shown). As is the case in the members of the OAT and OCT families,N-glycosylation sites (residues 39, 56, 99, 310, 353) and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites (residue 65, 164, 224, 225, 279, 319, 326, 428, 529) were predicted in the sequence of OAT4 (Fig. 1). The expression of OAT4 mRNA in human tissues was investigated (Fig.2). A strong mRNA band was detected only in the kidney (2.7 kilobases) and placenta (2.4 kilobases). No hybridization signals were detected with mRNAs isolated from other tissues, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, thymus, spleen, liver, small intestine, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the size of mRNA bands detected in the kidney and the placenta were different, we screened a human placenta cDNA library using H12876as a probe and isolated a positive full-length cDNA clone. The sequencing of this clone revealed that the cDNAs isolated from the kidney (the present OAT4 cDNA clone) and the placenta were identical, except that the placenta clone possessed a shorter untranslated 5′ region. Using the Xenopus oocytes expression system, we investigated transport of organic anions by OAT4 (Fig.3). The uptake rates of [3H]estrone sulfate, [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-s), and [3H]ochratoxin A in oocytes expressing OAT4 were much higher than those of control oocytes. A very low rate of uptake ofp-aminohippurate (a prototypical substrate of OAT1) via OAT4 was also demonstrated. Fig. 4 shows the transport properties of estrone sulfate via OAT4. The cell-associated count of [3H]estrone sulfate increased linearly until 2.5 h of incubation in OAT4-expressing oocytes. This result indicates that OAT4 not only binds but also translocates estrone sulfate into cytoplasm (Fig. 4 A). The uptake rate of estrone sulfate via OAT4 was not affected by replacement of the extracellular sodium with lithium or choline (Fig. 4 B). In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 C, the trans-stimulatory effect of estrone sulfate on OAT4-mediated efflux of estrone sulfate was examined. The efflux of estrone sulfate was not trans-stimulated in the presence of extracellular estrone sulfate (0.2 and 2 μm). The concentration dependence of OAT4-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate and [3H]DHEA-s was examined (Fig. 5). OAT4-mediated uptake of these two compounds showed saturable kinetics and followed the Michaelis-Menten equation. Nonlinear regression analyses yieldedK m values of 1.01 ± 0.15 μm and 0.63 ± 0.04 μm and V maxvalues of 1.78 ± 0.16 pmol/h/oocyte and 1.26 ± 0.04 pmol/h/oocyte for estrone sulfate and DHEA-s, respectively. To investigate the substrate selectivity of OAT4, inhibition study was performed. cis-Inhibitory effect of 5, 50, and 500 μm concentrations of various compounds on OAT4-mediated [3H]estrone sulfate (50 nm) uptake was investigated (Fig. 6). Because of its cytotoxic effect, 100 μm sulfobromophthalein was used instead of 500 μm. Five μm of unlabeled estrone sulfate and sulfobromophthalein showed definite inhibitory potency. Probenecid, indomethacin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, furosemide, bumetanide, and corticosterone (a neutral steroid hormone) exhibited modest but dose-dependent inhibitory activity at 5 and 50 μm. Penicillin-G, cholic acid, and taurocholic acid showed much weaker inhibition. In contrast, 500 μm p-aminohippuric acid (PAH), glutaric acid, salicylic acid, and azidothymidine did not show inhibitory activity. β-Estradiol, tetraethylammonium (an organic cation), and Na2SO4 (an inorganic sulfate) also did not show any inhibitory effect on OAT4-mediated [3H]estrone sulfate uptake. Since in the result shown in Fig. 3, a very low rate of uptake of PAH via OAT4 was demonstrated, we examined the inhibitory potency of PAH at higher concentrations. The result indicated that high concentrations of PAH (more than several mm) inhibited OAT4-mediated uptake of estrone sulfate (data not shown). Interaction of OAT4 with several sulfate conjugates and glucuronide conjugates was also examined (Fig.7). Five μm sulfate conjugates (estrone-s, DHEA-s, p-nitrophenyl-s, α-naphthyl-s, 4-methylumbelliferyl-s, and β-estradiol-s) showed inhibitory potency on OAT4-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate. At 100 μm, all of the sulfate conjugates except minoxidil sulfate potently inhibited OAT4 (data not shown). In contrast, all of the glucuronide conjugates with similar side chains showed no inhibition at 5 μm. Even at 500 μm, only chloramphenicol glucuronide and α-naphthyl-β-glucuronide showed inhibitory potency (data not shown). In the present study, we reported the isolation of OAT4. OAT4 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the placenta as well as in the kidney and mediated the transport of anionic compounds, including sulfate conjugates. Fetal blood is separated from the maternal blood circulation by the polarized cells, i.e. syncytiotrophoblast, which possess carrier-mediated transport pathways similar to those in the renal proximal tubules and intestinal epithelial cells. Substantive knowledge on the placental transfer of essential compounds from the maternal body to the fetus has been gained, and the expressions of nutrient transporters such as glucose transporters (31.Shin B.-C. Fujikura K. Suzuki T. Tanaka S. Takata K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3397-4004Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), amino acid transporters (32.Matthews J.C. Beveridge M.J. Malandro M.S. Rothstein J.D. Campbell-Thompson M. Verlander J.W. Kilberg M.S. Novak D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a vitamin transporter (33.Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and nucleoside transporters (34.Griffiths M. Yao S.Y.M. Abidi F. Phillips S.E.V. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) have been identified in the placenta. These carrier proteins facilitate the supply of essential compounds to the developing fetus. In contrast, little is known regarding the elimination pathways for toxic compounds from the fetus. Since the fetal kidney and liver possess a limited capacity for excretion (35.Morgan D.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1997; 24: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the placenta probably plays the primary role in the elimination of the toxic compounds from the fetus. The present study demonstrated a high level of expression of OAT4 in the placenta and the multiple substrate recognition by OAT4. Rat OAT2 (16.Sekine T. Cha S.H. Tsuda M. Apiwattanakul N. Kanai Y. Endou H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and human OAT3 (36.Race J.E. Grassl S.M. Williams W.J. Holtzman E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1999; 255: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) 2S. H. Cha, T. Sekine, Y. Kanai, and H. Endou, unpublished observation. are not expressed in the placenta. The expression of human OAT1 in the placenta was extremely weak or none. Thus, OAT4 is predominantly expressed in the placenta among OAT isoforms and is likely to mediate the excretion of toxic anionic substances from the fetal body. Recently, two candidate excretory pathways have been identified in the placenta. ABCP (37.Allikmets R. Shriml L.M. Hutchinson A. Romano-Spica V. Dean M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5337-5339PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the ABC superfamily, and OCT3 (29.Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15971-15979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) were demonstrated to be expressed in the placenta. Both of the members of the ABC transporter superfamily and OCT family mediate the elimination of xenobiotics from the body. The entity “placental barrier” may be composed of these xenobiotics transporters, including OAT4. The placenta is a unique endocrine organ producing peptide hormones and steroid hormones. The placenta synthesizes a large amount of steroid hormones, especially estrogens (38.Branchaud C.L. Goodyer C.G. Lipowski L.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 56: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the placenta, estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) are synthesized from DHEA-s or 16α-OH DHEA-s, both of which are derived from the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the fetus and placenta function together as an endocrine unit for the production of estrogen, which is important for continuation of the pregnancy. DHEA-s, however, shows undesirable effects (e.g. intrauterine growth retardation) on the fetus, at high blood concentrations (39.Schuetz J.D. Kauma S. Guzelian P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Efficient uptake of DHEA-s by the placenta, therefore, is required not only for the production of estrogen but also for the protection of fetus from the cytotoxicity of DHEA-s. Among OAT isoforms, OAT3 also mediates the high affinity transport of estrone sulfate (17.Kusuhara H. Sekine T. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Kojima R. Cha S.H. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, as stated above, the expression of OAT3 in the human placenta is little or none. It is probable that OAT4 is localized in the trophoblast membrane facing the fetal blood and mediates the placental uptake of DHEA-s, although the localization of OAT4 in the placenta has not yet been identified. OAT1 shows affinity for compounds possessing negative or partial negative charge(s) and an appropriately sized hydrophobic core (3.Ullrich K.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6.Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,13.Apiwattanakul N. Sekine T. Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Nakajima N. Sophasan S. Endou H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that β-estradiol showed no inhibitory effect on the OAT4-mediated uptake of estrone sulfate whereas β-estradiol sulfate showed a strong inhibitory effect suggests that the anionic moiety is essential for substrate recognition by OAT4. p-Nitrophenyl sulfate and α-naphthyl sulfate were shown to interact with OAT4. Thus, the binding site of OAT4 can accept variable sizes of the hydrophobic side chain (from the phenyl moiety to the steroid core) of the sulfate conjugates. In contrast, glucuronide conjugates with similar hydrophobic side chains showed no or little inhibitory effect on OAT4-mediated transport. The glucuronide moiety might be too large to be accepted by OAT4. Thus, the interaction of OAT4 with the hydrophilic part (negatively charged site) of the substrate seems rather stringent. The molecular mechanism underlying the multispecific substrate recognition by OAT4 is considered to depend largely on the nonspecific hydrophobic interaction between the heterogeneous and variably sized hydrophobic structures of the substrates and OAT4. The present study showed that OAT4 is expressed in the kidney as well as in the placenta. The other OAT isoforms, OAT1 (6.Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Martel F. Ording N. Grundemann D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), candidate members of the OAT family, are exclusively expressed in the kidney. Thus, OAT isoforms are commonly expressed in the kidney. Previously, it had been suggested that a single multispecific organic anion transporter (the PAH transporter) is responsible for the basolateral uptake of a number of anionic substances (1.Moller J.V. Sheikh M.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1983; 34: 315-358Google Scholar, 2.Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 3.Ullrich K.J. J. Membr.

However, the renal organic anion transport system is more complex than has been predicted, and the renal proximal tubules are equipped with an array of OAT isoforms. Five hundred μm PAH and glutaric acid, high affinity substrates of OAT1 (6.Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), showed no or very little inhibitory activity on OAT4-mediated estrone sulfate transport. Salicylate, a good substrate of OAT2 (16.Sekine T. Cha S.H. Tsuda M. Apiwattanakul N. Kanai Y. Endou H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), also showed weak inhibitory effect on OAT4-mediated transport. Azidothymidine and penicillin G, both of which potently inhibited OAT3-mediated transport (17.Kusuhara H. Sekine T. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Kojima R. Cha S.H. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), showed minimal effect on OAT4. Thus, OAT4 shows a distinct substrate selectivity, and the isoforms of the OAT family cover a large variety of anionic substances and execute the efficient tubular secretion of organic anions. The transport mechanism of OAT4 (in other words, the driving force of OAT4) is an important issue that should be clarified. OAT1 is a tertiary active organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger in physiological condition, and OAT1-mediated transport of organic anions is indirectly coupled to the Na+ ion in the extracellular medium (2.Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 43.Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). The energetically uphill transport of organic anions via OAT1 is accelerated by outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient (6.Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 7.Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which is maintained by sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter (2.Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 43.Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Transport activity via OAT4 did not directly depend on the extracellular sodium ion. trans-Stimulatory effect was not demonstrated in the present study. Thus, the driving force of OAT4-mediated transport still remains to be elucidated. Likewise, the driving forces of OAT2 and OAT3 also have not been clarified yet. Recently, a distinct organic anion transporter, oatp1, was revealed to be an organic anion/glutathione exchanger (44.Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Unspecified endogenous substances might be the counterion in the transport of OAT4. Further studies are required to address this issue. In conclusion, we report the molecular cloning of OAT4. OAT4 is exclusively expressed in the placenta and the kidney. OAT4 mediates the high affinity transport of estrone sulfate and DHEA-s and shows affinity for a variety of anionic substances. OAT4 is likely to mediate the placental uptake of DHEA-s, a precursor of estrogen. Furthermore, OAT4 may play the major role in the excretion of toxic anionic substances from the fetal body."

Using this recombinant protein, we demonstrated that sFRP-1 and Wg (wingless) interact in enzyme-linked immunosorbent and co-precipitation assays. Surprisingly, a derivative lacking the cysteine-rich domain retained the ability to bind Wg. Cross-linking experiments performed with radioiodinated sFRP-1 provided definitive evidence that sFRP-1 and Wg bind directly to each other. Besides detecting a cross-linked complex consistent in size with 1:1 stoichiometry of sFRP-1 and Wg, we also observed a larger complex whose size suggested the presence of a second sFRP-1 molecule. The formation of both complexes was markedly enhanced by an optimal concentration of exogenous heparin, emphasizing the potential importance of heparan-sulfate proteoglycan in Wnt binding and signaling. sFRP-1 exerted a biphasic effect on Wg activity in an armadillo stabilization assay, increasing armadillo level at low concentrations but reducing it at higher concentrations.

They specify cell polarity and fate, stimulate proliferation, and contribute to the patterning of tissue in many animal models. Wnt signaling also has been strongly implicated in the development of neoplasia. Although the prevalence of wnt overexpression in human cancer is still an open question, constitutive activity of Wnt signaling because of mutations in downstream effectors or modulators occurs with a high frequency in certain malignancies. In particular, mutations in APC (encoded by the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene) and β-catenin occur in 80–90% of human colon carcinomas (3.Korinek V. Barker N.

A block in this process, either because of mutations or Wnt activity, causes an elevation in cytosolic β-catenin, which accumulates in the nucleus where it can combine with DNA binding proteins of the TCF-LEF family (8.Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

Science. 1998; 281: 1438-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The identification of Wnt receptors was hampered for many years because of the inability to purify Wnt proteins and label them for classical binding experiments. This is still a problem, because the proteins tend to remain associated with the cell surface or extracellular matrix (16.Papkoff J. Schryver B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,17.Bradley R.S. Brown A.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fortunately, there are now sources of soluble, biologically active Wnt proteins available for binding studies (18.van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R.

For instance, ectopic expression of particular Fz family members resulted in binding of Wg to the cell surface and in Wnt signaling as indicated by increases in armadillo (Arm),1 theDrosophila ortholog of β-catenin (21.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). However, there have been no cross-linking experiments to verify that Wnt proteins bind directly to Fzs. Nonetheless, a specific portion of the Fz extracellular domain was reported to be responsible for the observed cellular binding of Wg and transduction of Wnt signaling (21.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). This region consists of ∼120 amino acid residues and was designated the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) because it contained 10 cysteine residues that were conserved in all the known Fz family members (eight differentfz genes in vertebrates and additional genes in various invertebrate species (29.Wang Y.

The carboxyl-terminal portion of these proteins often contains segments rich in positively charged residues, and two (sFRP-1 and FrzB/sFRP-3) were reported to bind tightly to heparin (33.Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When engineered to remain anchored to the cell membrane via a glycolipid tag, sFRP-2 and sFRP-3 conferred Wg binding to the cell surface (32.Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M. Gilbert D.J.

Moreover, co-expression of sFRP family members with selected Wnts in earlyXenopus embryos caused inhibition of Wnt-dependent duplication of the dorsal axis (30.Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H.

Development. 1998; 125: 4767-4776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-precipitation studies suggested that they could associate with Wnts and thereby block ligand interaction with Fzs, the presumptive signal-transducing membrane receptor (31.Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos Jr., M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 39.Xu Q. D'Amore P.A. Sokol S.Y.

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that sFRP-1 binds directly to Wnt protein, and if so, to determine what portions of sFRP-1 were required for this interaction. Given that both sFRP-1 and Wnt proteins bind heparin (33.Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To facilitate this work, we developed a recombinant expression system that yielded large quantities of purified, sFRP-1 protein and utilized a previously described source of soluble, biologically active Wg (19.Cumberledge S. Krasnow M.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results from ELISA, co-precipitation, and cross-linking experiments provided compelling evidence of direct binding between sFRP-1 and Wg. This binding was strongly influenced by heparin. Surprisingly, the Fz-related CRD was not required for binding. Moreover, sFRP-1 exhibited a biphasic effect on Wg signaling, enhancing Wg-dependent stabilization of Arm at low concentrations but inhibiting stabilization at high concentrations. These findings establish that sFRPs can regulate Wnt activity and provide a new perspective regarding their biological effects and mode of action. MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Colorado Serum Company) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Drosophila S2 cells and S2HSWg cells transfected with a heat shock promoter/Wg construct (18.van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R.

All three S2 lines were cultured in Schneider's Drosophilamedium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 25 °C in atmospheric air. Wg-containing and S2 control media were generated as described previously (44.Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Unless stated otherwise, all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. After brief washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20, 150 mmNaCl) for 2 h. Following five washes with TTBS, membranes were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 (for a typical final concentration of 1–2 μg/ml) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/TTBS. sFRP-1 rabbit antisera were raised either against a synthetic amino-terminal peptide (33.Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Monoclonal antibody to Wg, mAb 4D4, first prepared in Dr. Stephen Cohen's lab, was a gift from the Nusse lab; antibodies to the c-Myc and polyhistidine epitopes were from Invitrogen. After five washes with TTBS, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:2000 in 0.5% BSA/TTBS. Following five more washes with TTBS, bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using X-Omat AR film (Kodak). For immunoprecipitation, Wg-containing medium (80 μl) was preincubated with individual sFRP-1 derivatives (300 nm) for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, anti-Myc (0.2 μg) was added to the samples, which were then incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sample volumes were adjusted to 500 μl with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 6.7 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C in a rotary shaker, samples were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Final pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 4 min, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The human sFRP-1 NotI-SmaI cDNA fragment (33.Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) was subcloned into an XhoI site in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). To prepare derivatives containing c-Myc and polyhistidine epitopes at their carboxyl termini, cDNAs encoding full-length sFRP-1 or deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction with primers that introducedEcoRV and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The sequences comprising the various derivatives are indicated in Fig. 2 A. Purified polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into the pcDNA3.1Myc/His, C(−) expression vector (Invitrogen), and plasmid samples prepared from transformed DH5-α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The fidelity of cDNAs was verified by sequence analysis. MDCK cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of DNA of the various sFRP-1 constructs, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Mass cultures were selected with Geneticin (500 μg/ml) for 21 days. To isolate clonal cell lines, mass cultures were subcultured at a 1:50,000 dilution in collagen-coated wells and subsequently transferred to culture dishes for further analysis. Expression of recombinant protein was determined by immunoblotting equal quantities of total protein from conditioned medium and/or cell lysates. For large scale preparations, sFRP-1/MDCK transfectants were grown in T175 flasks until confluent. After washing with PBS, the cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and conditioned media were collected every 3 days for five to seven consecutive harvests. Media were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and filtration (pore size, 0.4 μm; Corning). Subsequently, media were concentrated ∼40-fold by ultrafiltration in a stirred chamber apparatus (Amicon M2000) using a Millipore YM membrane with either a 10- or 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Concentrated samples were snap-frozen for subsequent purification. Native sFRP-1 was purified with HiTrap-Heparin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS/0.3 m NaCl. After applying the sample to the column, the resin was washed with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer. Protein was eluted with a step gradient of increasing NaCl concentration. Aliquots from representative fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting or silver staining (Bio-Rad). sFRP-1 derivatives containing Myc/histidine epitopes were purified in a similar manner, only using HiTrap Chelating Affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resin (1.0 ml) was washed with 5.0 ml of water, charged with 0.5 ml of 0.1 mNiSO4, and washed again with 5.0 ml of water. Following equlibration with 50 mm phosphate/10 mmimidazole buffer (pH 7.4), protein was eluted with a step gradient of increasing imidazole concentration. Selected fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and silver staining. Typically, sFRP-1 derivatives were recovered with 0.1 m imidazole. The identity of individual sFRP-1 preparations was verified by microsequencing with an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 476). For sFRP-ΔCRD, 30 rounds of Edman degradation were carried out to ensure that the entire CRD was deleted. sFRP-1 diluted in 0.02% NaN3/PBS was incubated in 96-well Falcon ELISA plates (300 ng/50 μl/well) for 2 h at 37 °C. After decanting, all wells were filled with 4% BSA/0.02% NaN3/PBS and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Following five washes with TAPS (0.05% Tween-20 in 0.02% NaN3/PBS), 50-μl aliquots of Wg-containing or S2 control medium diluted in 1% BSA/TAPS were incubated overnight at room temperature. After five washes with TAPS, 50 μl/well of Wg mAb diluted in 1% BSA/TAPS to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml was incubated in wells for 2 h at 37 °C. Another five washes in TAPS were followed by a 2-h treatment at 37 °C with 1:400 dilution of conjugated alkaline phosphatase-goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). After a final set of five washes with TAPS, 2 mg/mlp-nitrophenolphosphate (Sigma) in carbonate buffer (0.1m Na2CO3, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 9.8) was added. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured with an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). When the solid phase assay was performed with the various sFRP-1 derivatives, wells were coated with 60 nm solutions of the respective derivatives. ELISA competition experiments were performed as described above, except the indicated concentrations of sFRP-1 derivatives were preincubated with Wg conditioned medium for 45 min at room temperature prior to addition to wells that had been coated with native sFRP-1. sFRP-1 was iodinated as described previously (49.Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Finch P.W. Florio C. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12767-12770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of sFRP-1 was reacted with 1 mCi of Na125I in the presence of 30 μg/ml chloramine T for 30–60 s. After addition of 80 μg/ml sodium metabisulfite, the reaction mixture was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (bed volume, 0.3 ml) equilibrated in 0.1% BSA/PBS. Labeled sFRP-1 was eluted with equilibration buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl and stored in frozen aliquots. Approximately 50 μl of Wg-containing or control medium was incubated with 1 μCi of 125I-sFRP-1 for 40 min at room temperature. In some experiments, varying concentrations of heparin (12 kDa from porcine intestine; Fisher) or unlabeled sFRP-1 were also present (see figures for details). After addition of 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) cross-linking agent (Pierce), the incubation continued for 20 min. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm glycine/1 mmTris-HCl, and the mixture was incubated with Wg mAb (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and 50 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry, samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 4 min, and briefly microfuged to facilitate transfer. Protein samples were resolved in 8% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE. After fixation in 20% methanol/10% acetic acid for 45 min, the gel was dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) for autoradiography. This assay was performed as described previously (44.Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with two primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-Arm antibody N27A at 1:50 and mouse monoclonal anti-HSP70 at 1:200,000 and one secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by treating the blots with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then exposing them to x-ray film. Equal loading of total protein was confirmed by inspection of the HSP70 protein band in each sample lane. To generate a plentiful supply of sFRP-1 protein, we stably transfected MDCK cells with a pcDNA3.1 vector containing the coding sequence of human sFRP-1. MDCK cells have favorable properties for recombinant expression because they grow rapidly and, once confluent, can remain attached to plastic for several weeks in serum-free medium. Consequently, several sequential harvests of conditioned medium can be collected from the same monolayer. A one-step preparative scheme involving heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography was sufficient to purify sFRP-1 from concentrated conditioned medium (Fig. 1 A). Typically we recovered 0.25–0.50 mg of sFRP-1/liter of medium from the transfected mass culture. Silver staining and immunoblot analysis confirmed the purity and identity of the recombinant protein that eluted from heparin-Sepharose with 1.0 m NaCl (Fig. 1,B and C). The protein band in both analyses usually was broad and occasionally resolved into two or three components (Fig. 1 B, inset), indicative of microheterogeneity. This was borne out by microsequencing, which revealed that the majority of protein had an amino-terminal sequence beginning at Ser-31, one residue downstream from the proposed signal peptide cleavage site (33.Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Two other sequences, beginning at Asp-41 and Phe-50, also were obtained and presumably resulted from partial proteolysis. Glycosylation may account for additional heterogeneity. 2A. Üren and J. S.

To optimize the yield of recombinant protein, clonal lines were isolated from the mass culture, and their conditioned media were screened for sFRP-1 content (Fig. 1 D). Clone 11 cells (lane 11 in Fig. 1 D) were expanded for large scale preparations and yielded 2–4 mg of sFRP-1/liter of conditioned medium. We generated a series of deletion mutants that would allow us to correlate binding properties with particular regions of the sFRP-1 molecule. To facilitate detection and purification, c-Myc and polyhistidine epitope tags were attached to the carboxyl terminus of each derivative (Fig.2 A). The sFRP-Δ1 sequence extends through amino acid residue 171, a short distance beyond the CRD. sFRP-Δ2 and sFRP-Δ3 contain progressively more of the carboxyl-terminal region. Included within sFRP"
https://openalex.org/W2077747679,"The A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) is one of four receptor subtypes for adenosine and is expressed in a broad spectrum of tissues. In order to study the function of A3AR, a mouse line carrying a mutant A3 allele was generated. Mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the A3AR gene,A3AR −/−, are fertile and visually and histologically indistinguishable from wild type mice. The lack of a functional receptor in the A3AR −/− mice was confirmed by molecular and pharmacological analyses. The absence of A3AR protein expression in the A3AR −/− mice was demonstrated by lack ofN 6-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzyl)adenosine binding to bone marrow-derived mast cell membranes that were found to express high levels of A3AR in wild type mice. InA3AR −/− mice, the density of A1and A2A adenosine receptor subtypes was the same as inA3AR +/+ mice as determined by radioligand binding to brain membranes. Additionally, A2B receptor transcript expression was not affected by ablation of theA3AR gene. A3AR −/− mice have basal heart rates and arterial blood pressures indistinguishable fromA3AR +/+ mice. Functionally, in contrast to wild type mice, adenosine and the A3AR-specific agonist, 2-chloro-N 6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5′-N-methyl-carboxamide (2-Cl-IB-MECA), elicit no potentiation of antigen-dependent degranulation of bone marrow-derived mast cells fromA3AR −/− mice as measured by hexosaminidase release. Also, the ability of 2Cl-IB-MECA to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α productionin vivo was decreased in A3AR −/−mice in comparison to A3AR +/+ mice. The A2A adenosine receptor agonist, 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylamino)-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, produced inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α production in both A3AR −/− andA3AR +/+ mice. These results show that the inhibition in vivo can be mediated by multiple subtypes, specifically the A3 and A2A adenosine receptors, and A3AR activation plays an important role in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2159092431,"Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is a member of a coactivator family that enhance the activation of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-stimulated transcription factors. To study the regulation of SRC-1 by signaling pathways in the cell, the major phosphorylation sites of SRC-1 were identified in COS-1 cells using a combination of in vivo labeling with [32P]H3PO4, modified manual Edman degradation, phosphoamino acid analysis, endoproteinase digestion, and mutagenesis of the SRC-1 phosphorylation sites. Seven phosphorylation sites were identified in SRC-1: serine 372, serine 395, serine 517, serine 569, serine 1033, threonine 1179, and serine 1185. All the sites contained consensus sequences for the serine/threonine-proline-directed family of protein kinases, and two sites (serine 395 and threonine 1179) contained a perfect consensus sequence for the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (Erk-1 and Erk-2). Furthermore, Erk-2 phosphorylated threonine 1179 and serine 1185 (and to a lesser extent, serine 395) in vitro, suggesting the importance of this pathway for SRC-1 regulation. Treatment of cells expressing SRC-1 with epidermal growth factor enhanced the ligand-dependent, progesterone receptor-mediated activation of a target reporter gene. These results identify phosphorylation as a regulatory modification of SRC-1 and provide a basis upon which to identify signaling pathways that regulate SRC-1 function and, consequently, modify steroid/nuclear receptor action.

Our laboratory proposed a two-step model for steroid receptor induction of gene expression in which liganded receptor recruits coactivator proteins that can 1) open up local chromatin structure through its intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, and 2) contribute to the stabilization of the preinitiation complex at the promoter (3.Jenster G.

SRC-1 has an intrinsic HAT activity and also recruits other strong HATs, such as P300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) (13.Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J.X. Mizzen C.A.

Recent evidence has suggested that certain functions of coactivators and corepressors (a class of proteins that interact with sequence-specific transcription factors to repress their effect on gene transcription) can be modulated by a number of different signal transduction pathways. Interaction of the corepressor N-CoR with the estrogen receptor is decreased by treatment with forskolin and epidermal growth factor (14.Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M.

Tyrosine kinase signaling pathways were similarly shown to disrupt interactions of the corepressor SMRT with the thyroid hormone receptor, v-Erb A, and retinoic acid receptors.

Whereas most studies have examined the role of CBP as a signal-regulated coactivator for several different classes of transcription factors, including members of the steroid receptor superfamily, no studies have focused on SRC-1 as a potential regulatory target. Given the importance that SRC-1 has for steroid-mediated responses in mammals (23.Xu J. Qiu Y. Demayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), a study of the regulation of SRC-1 is important for predicting steroid-dependent responses in various tissues. To predict which kinases may be important in regulating SRC-1 activity, the major phosphorylation sites in SRC-1 expressed in COS-1 cells were identified. Furthermore, the effect of activation of MAP kinase on SRC-1-mediated progesterone receptor activation and the role of progesterone treatment in modulating SRC-1 phosphorylation were examined. This information will allow a determination of those signaling pathways that regulate SRC-1 function through alterations in SRC-1 phosphorylation.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense, 5′-TCGAGCCGCCACCATGAGAGGTTCTCATCATCATCATCATCATCTAGAAGATCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGCGGTGGTACTCTCCAAGAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGATCTTCTAGAGTAC-3′) was inserted 5′ to the SRC-1 sequence, which added 6 histidine residues to the expressed protein. An N-terminal deletion mutant of SRC-1 (amino acids 409–1441) was created by transferring Xcm I/Swa I digested SRC-1 into the XbaI (5′) and SmaI (3′) sites of the pSVL plasmid along with a double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense, 5′-CGCGCCGCCACCATGAGAGGTTCTCATCATCATCATCATCATTCCAACAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGTTGGAATGATGATGATGATGATGAGAACCTCTCATGGTGGCGG-3′) inserted 5′ to the SRC1 sequence. A second N-terminal deletion of SRC-1 (amino acids 783–1441) was prepared by digesting the first deletion mutant with BglII (within the His6oligonucleotide) and BamHI (within the SRC-1 coding sequence) and religating the plasmid. Mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene Quick Change kit. SRC-1 sequence and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. SRC-1 expression in COS-1 cells was obtained using a nonrecombinant adenovirus DNA transfer procedure (25.Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochem. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, polylysine-coupled adenovirus was prepared and then mixed with plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA binds to the adenovirus particle through the polylysine chains. The adenovirus-plasmid particles were then added to cells, and the plasmid DNA was carried into the cells along with the adenovirus. COS-1 cells were plated in 150-mm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) that had been treated with dextran-coated charcoal, and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 24 h after plating, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM without FBS to prepare the cells for the adenovirus infection. SRC-1 expression plasmid (0.1 μg/dish) was mixed with adenovirus (virus to cell ratio, 400:1) and the resulting mixture was added to the dishes. Two hours postinfection, DMEM with FBS was added to the dishes to give a final concentration of 2.5% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the phosphate-free medium was removed and replaced with phosphate-free DMEM with 1% dialyzed, stripped FBS. 2–4 mCi of [32P]H3PO4 (0.13–0.26 mCi/ml) was added to each dish, and cells were cultured for 12–14 h at 37 °C prior to harvest. Medium containing [32P]H3PO4 was removed from the dishes, and 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was added to the dishes and subsequently aspirated off to remove any residual radiolabeled medium. COS-1 cells were scraped from the dishes, and the cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2.5 ml of a denaturing homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.4 m sodium chloride, 5 mm α-monothioglycerol, 8 m urea, protease inhibitor mix). The resulting mixture was passed through an 18 gauge needle three times. Following centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, 47.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin was added to the supernatant to reduce the urea concentration to 0.4 m and prepare the supernatant for SRC-1 immunopurification. 0.2 ml of swollen protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with 25 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with 0.25 ml of clone 1135 anti-SRC-1 antibody tissue culture supernatant overnight at 4 °C. The beads were transferred to a 3-ml column, and the column was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. SRC-1 was then immunopurified by passing the entire supernatant (50 ml) over the immunoaffinity column over a 2–3-h period. The column was washed with 200 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Purified SRC-1 was eluted from the column with 1 m acetic acid, and the eluted fractions were placed in a SpeedVac Concentrator® (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) overnight to evaporate the acetic acid. Purified SRC-1 was electrophoresed on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and the wet gel was exposed to X-AR film (Eastman Kodak) for 1–2 h. The phosphorylated SRC-1 band was cut out of the gel, and the gel slice was incubated with 50% methanol for 1 h followed by incubation with HPLC grade water for 30 min. The gel slice was ready for endoproteinase digestion. For trypsin digestion, the gel slice was incubated in 0.5 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of trypsin was added to the gel slice every 4 h at 37 °C for a total of 12 h. For Arg-C digestion, the gel slice was incubated in 0.5 ml of 100 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6, and 1.25 μg of Arg-C (0.1 μg/μl in 50 mm Tris, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8) was added to the gel slice four times over a 24-h period at 37 °C. For Lys-C digestion, the gel slice was incubated in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, and 1.25 μg of Lys-C (0.1 μg/μl in buffer supplied by the manufacturer) was added to the gel slice four times over a 24 h period at 37 °C. The released phosphopeptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (26.Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphopeptides were loaded onto a C-18 reversed-phase HPLC column, and the phosphopeptides were eluted from the column using a 0–45% gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 90 min. Phosphopeptide peaks were detected with a Packard model IC Flo-One radioactive flow detector. HPLC fractions were evaporated using a SpeedVac, and phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a 25% alkaline polyacrylamide gel (27.West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Individual phosphopeptides were eluted from the dried gel as described previously (26.Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional analysis of SRC-1 phosphopeptides was carried out using the HTLE-7000 electrophoresis system from CBS Scientific (Del Mar, CA) as described previously (28.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, SRC-1 phosphopeptides were spotted onto 20 × 20-cm thin layer cellulose plates and separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis at 1000 V for 35 min in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% v/v formic acid, 7.8% v/v acetic acid). The cellulose plates were then placed in a chromatography tank containing phosphochromatography buffer (38% (v/v) n-butanol, 25% (v/v) pyridine, 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid) for 6–8 h to separate the phosphopeptides in the second dimension. The dried cellulose plate was then exposed to X-AR film. Individual phosphopeptides were isolated by scraping and collecting the cellulose from the plate, and the phosphopeptide was released from the cellulose with 50% formic acid. Phosphopeptides purified by alkaline polyacrylamide gels or two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis were subjected to modified manual Edman degradation as described previously to identify the phosphorylation sites (26.Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphopeptides were covalently coupled to Sequelon-AA discs and subjected to consecutive cycles of the Edman degradation. After each cycle, the disc was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to cleave and release the N-terminal amino acid, and the released 32P was determined by Cerenkov counting. Tryptic phosphopeptides were also subjected to secondary endoproteinase digestion with Asp-N and Glu-C as described previously to further identify the phosphorylation sites (26.Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31034-31040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tryptic phosphopeptides were treated with either 0.1 μg of Asp-N in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C or with 0.5 μg of Glu-C in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer for 8 h at 37 °C. Untreated phosphopeptides were incubated in either Asp-N or Glu-C buffer in the absence of endoproteinase for 8 h at 37 °C for comparison. The doubly digested peptides were then electrophoresed on a 25% alkaline polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (28.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purified SRC-1 was electrophoresed on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. SRC-1 was detected using anti-SRC-1 antibody (clone 1135) followed by chemiluminescent detection using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SRC-1 was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer plasmid (Invitrogen) followed by infection of SF9 cells with the recombinant virus as described previously (29.Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The SF9 cell pellets were extracted in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm monothioglycerol, protease inhibitor mix (Sigma)) by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer on ice and purified by immunoprecipitation. The SRC-1-bound protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with kinase reaction buffer (final concentration, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) and 1–3 μl of Erk-2 with a final specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP of 33,000 dpm/pmol ATP, in a final reaction volume of 40 μl. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer followed by electrophoresis on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The phosphorylated SRC-1 band was visualized by autoradiography and cut out of the gel, and the gel slice was subjected to trypsin digestion. The released SRC-1 phosphotryptic peptides were separated by C-18 reversed-phase HPLC or two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps and subjected to secondary protease digestion, phosphoamino acid analysis, and alkaline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. COS-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE. Briefly, COS-1 cells were plated on six-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM with 5% FBS that had been treated with dextran-coated charcoal. 24 h after plating, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM without FBS containing LipofectAMINE (2 μl/well), hPRB (10 ng/well), GRE2E1bCAT reporter (400 ng/well), and either pCR3.1-hSRC-1A (3.Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were harvested and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles in 250 mm Tris, pH 8. Cell extracts were prepared for standard CAT assays normalized to protein concentration. Each sample was done in triplicate ± S.E. Endogenous expression of SRC-1 in COS-1 and other cell lines was too low to permit an identification of the SRC-1 phosphorylation sites. 2B. Rowan, unpublished observations. To increase SRC-1 expression, an adenovirus-mediated DNA transfer technique was used to express SRC-1 in COS-1 cells. This method resulted in high efficiency DNA transfer and, consequently, a higher percentage of transfected cells than could be achieved with a conventional transient transfection procedure (25.Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochem. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of progesterone treatment on SRC-1 phosphorylation, SRC-1, human progesterone receptor B and the GRE2E1bCAT reporter were coexpressed in COS-1 cells, and the cells were labeled in vivo with [32P]H3PO4 in the presence or absence of 10−8m progesterone for 16 h. Treatment with progesterone did not significantly alter the overall level of phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). Phosphorimage analysis of the SRC-1 32P signal revealed that there was a slight decrease in the overall level of SRC-1 phosphorylation in response to progesterone treatment (23% ± 2% S.E. for three experiments) when normalized to the amount of SRC-1 protein present by densitometric scans of the ECL Western blot. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps show no consistent differences in the intensity of the SRC-1 tryptic phosphopeptides in the presence and absence of progesterone treatment (Fig. 1 B). These results are in marked contrast to steroid-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the progesterone receptor (30.Denner L.A. Weigel N.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W.

SRC-1 was highly phosphorylated on multiple sites, as indicated by the numerous tryptic phosphopeptide peaks detected by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2 A) and the large number of phosphopeptides bands detected on alkaline polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 B). The major phosphopeptides bands were numbered (1.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 2.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T.

Sequence information could not be obtained for low stoichiometry phosphorylation sites and for several of the phosphopeptides that were detected at later retention times (62–75 min; Fig. 2 B). It is possible that several of these phosphopeptides were partial tryptic digestion products of phosphopeptides 1–6. In order to determine the number of phosphopeptides that were present in the N-terminal region of SRC-1, two N-terminal deletions of SRC-1 were prepared (aa 409–1441 and 783–1441). These deletion constructs, as well as full-length SRC-1 (aa 1–1441), were expressed in COS-1 cells and labeled in vivo with [32P]H3PO4, and the tryptic phosphopeptides were separated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2 C). To identify the spots on the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map that corresponded to phosphopeptides 1–6 from Fig. 2 B, individual phosphopeptides were scraped from the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map and e"
https://openalex.org/W2075835114,"The mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) (R = A or G) gene possesses several hot spots for pathogenic mutations. A point mutation at nucleotide position 3243 or 3271 is associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes and maternally inherited diabetes with deafness. Detailed studies on two tRNAsLeu(UUR) with the 3243 or 3271 mutation revealed some common characteristics in cybrid cells: (i) a decreased life span, resulting in a 70% decrease in the amounts of the tRNAs in the steady state, (ii) a slight decrease in the ratios of aminoacyl-tRNAsLeu(UUR) versusuncharged tRNAsLeu(UUR), and (iii) accurate aminoacylation with leucine without any misacylation. As a marked result, both of the mutant tRNA molecules were deficient in a modification of uridine that occurs in the normal tRNALeu(UUR) at the first position of the anticodon. The lack of this modification may lead to the mistranslation of leucine into non-cognate phenylalanine codons by mutant tRNAsLeu(UUR), according to the mitochondrial wobble rule, and/or a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis. This finding could explain why two different mutations (3243 and 3271) manifest indistinguishable clinical features."
https://openalex.org/W1974585689,"In mammalian cells, single-base lesions, such as uracil and abasic sites, appear to be repaired by at least two base excision repair (BER) subpathways: “single-nucleotide BER” requiring DNA synthesis of just one nucleotide and “long patch BER” requiring multi-nucleotide DNA synthesis. In single-nucleotide BER, DNA polymerase β (β-pol) accounts for both gap filling DNA synthesis and removal of the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) of the abasic site, whereas the involvement of various DNA polymerases in long patch BER is less well understood. Recently, we found that β-pol plays a role in mammalian cell extract-mediated long patch BER, in that formation of a key excision product, 5′-dRP-trinucleotide (5′-dRP-N3), is dependent upon β-pol (Dianov, G. L., Prasad, R., Wilson, S. H., and Bohr, V.A. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13741–13743). The structure-specific endonuclease flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) has also been suggested to be involved in long patch BER excision. Here, we demonstrate by immunodepletion experiments that 5′-dRP-N3excision in long patch BER of uracil-DNA in a human lymphoid cell extract is, indeed, dependent upon FEN1. Next, we reconstituted the excision step of long patch BER using purified human proteins and an oligonucleotide substrate with 5′-dRP at the margin of a one-nucleotide gap. Formation of the excision product 5′-dRP-N3 was dependent upon both strand displacement DNA synthesis by β-pol and FEN1 excision. FEN1 stimulated strand displacement DNA synthesis of β-pol. FEN1 acting either alone, or without DNA synthesis by β-pol, produced a two-nucleotide excision product, 5′-dRP-N1, but not 5′-dRP-N3. These results demonstrate that human FEN1 and β-pol can cooperate in long patch BER excision and specify the predominant excision product seen with a cell extract.

To remove damage and maintain the integrity of the genome, a number of DNA repair pathways are maintained. The major repair pathway protecting cells against single-base DNA damage is thought to be base excision repair (BER),1 although other pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and methyltransferase-mediated error-free repair can also be involved. BER is initiated by enzymatic removal of the altered base or by spontaneous chemical hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond connecting the damaged base to the sugar phosphate back-bone (1.Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 2.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). Repair of the resulting abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site occurs in cell extracts through alternate BER subpathways that have been differentiated by their repair patch sizes and the enzymes involved (3.Forsina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandodo A. Doglitti E. J. Biol.

These subpathways are designated as “single-nucleotide BER” (one-nucleotide gap filling) and “long patch BER” (multi-nucleotide gap filling, varying from 2 to ∼10 nucleotides). Single-nucleotide BER of uracil-DNA has been reconstituted with four purified human enzymes (6.Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schär P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

This single-nucleotide BER is a sequential process initiated by uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) base removal, and followed by AP endonuclease (APE) incision of the AP site (10.Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E.

DNA ligase I does not act until the 5′-dRP group is removed (7.Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Thus, coordination of the enzymatic activities required to complete this BER subpathway depends on the removal of the 5′ sugar phosphate moiety (7.Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R.

Lack of such coordination or a 5′ sugar phosphate group that is refractory to the dRP lyase of β-pol, such as a reduced sugar in the AP site, may lead to repair in a fashion other than single-nucleotide BER, which is the preferred subpathway for the normal AP site (4.Klungland A.

Long patch BER, an alternate means of repair of single-base lesions, is capable of operating in the same mammalian cell extract as single-nucleotide BER. Long patch BER was suggested to be proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent, but β-pol-independent since long patch BER was observed in a β-pol null cell extract and this repair was inhibited by anti-PCNA antibody. Such repair was found to be more active on plasmid substrates than oligonucleotide substrates (5.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Doglitti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17.Matsumoto Y. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Other studies had implicated PCNA-dependent polymerases, such as DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) or DNA polymerase ε (pol ε), in long patch BER (17.Matsumoto Y. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21.Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). However, Klungland and Lindahl (4.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) demonstrated that long patch BER can be reconstituted with an oligonucleotide DNA substrate and purified enzymes including either pol δ or β-pol. These results indicated that PCNA is not essential for in vitro long patch BER and that β-pol can also function in long patch BER. While the precise role of various DNA polymerases in long patch BER remains unclear, Dianov et al. (22.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), using a combination of β-pol null and wild-type cell extracts and a β-pol neutralizing antibody, have recently demonstrated the major role of β-pol in long patch repair of uracil-DNA in human cell extracts. They found that release of a predominant long patch BER excision product by cell extracts was β-pol-dependent. Recent work has suggested that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) plays a role in long patch BER (23.DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol.

In long patch BER, the enzyme was suggested to release the 5′-dRP moiety as a part of a short oligonucleotide when cleavage is combined with strand displacement DNA synthesis(25, 28). To further address the role of β-pol in long patch BER and its potential for combined action with FEN1 to mediate the excision step, we used oligonucleotide DNA substrates along with purified human β-pol and FEN1 to reconstitute the long patch BER excision reaction. The results show that the reconstituted system forms the characteristic long patch BER excision product 5′-dRP-N3, which is observed in cell extract-mediated repair. Release of this product by FEN1 is dependent upon strand displacement DNA synthesis by β-pol. Furthermore, strand displacement synthesis by β-pol is stimulated by FEN1, indicating a functional cooperation between these proteins. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by high pressure liquid chromatography were obtained from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). [α-32P]ddATP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and polynucleotide kinase were from Promega (Madison, WI). Recombinant wild-type human β-pol and mutants K72A and R283A were overexpressed and purified as described previously (29.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Human APE and UDG with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus were purified as described (30.Strauss P.R.

Normal human lymphoid cells AG9387 were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Cells were grown in the medium recommended by the supplier. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3–5 g of cells as described (32.Manely J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), and dialyzed overnight against Buffer A containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 12 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, and 0.1m KCl. Extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Plasmid containing histidine-tagged human FEN1 gene was kindly provided by Dr. M. R. Lieber (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). FEN1 protein was purified on Ni2+-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen, Cambridge, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two milligrams of purified FEN1 were covalently coupled to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the supplier, and the resin was transferred to a column. The column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) and used for purification of polyclonal antibodies raised against human FEN1. Antibodies were loaded in phosphate-buffered saline, and the column was washed with 20 column volumes of the same buffer. Antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and 500-μl fractions were collected into tubes containing 50 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Affinity-purified FEN1 antibody (1 mg) was covalently coupled to 0.5 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose, and the resin was transferred to a column. The column was equilibrated with Buffer A, and 2 mg of whole cell extract in 0.5 ml of Buffer A was passed through the column five times serially to deplete the FEN1 protein. Double-stranded closed circular DNA containing a solitary uracil (U-DNA) was constructed as described (33.Dianov G.L. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) by priming single-stranded M13 DNA with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide32pUCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATTGGGTACCG for internally labeled U-DNA and 32pCCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATTGGGTACCG for the control DNA substrate. To prepare the 32P-labeled duplex oligodeoxynucleotide, a 34-mer template was annealed with a complementary DNA strand that contained either a reduced AP site (3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran) or a uracil residue at position 16. A flap containing DNA was prepared by annealing a 34-mer template with 15-mer and 23-mer 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. Prior to assembly of the excision reaction, the DNA substrate (55 nm) was pretreated with UDG (11 nm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was then supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 11 nm APE and incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Due to the lability of the APE-treated DNA, the DNA substrate was prepared just before adding the components for the excision assay (see below). A 34-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing a reduced AP site or a uracil residue at position 16, or a 23-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide with a uracil residue at the 5′ end, was labeled at the 3′ end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]ddATP. The complementary DNA strands were annealed by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min, and the solution was allowed to slowly cool to 25 °C.32P-Labeled duplex oligonucleotides were separated from unincorporated [α-32P]ddATP using a Nensorb-20 column according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was lyophilized, resuspended in H2O, and stored at −30 °C. Dephosphorylated 23-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing a uracil residue at the 5′ end was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The 34-mer template was then annealed with 15-mer and 23-mer 32P-labeled oligonucleotides by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min, and allowing the solution to slowly cool to 25 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a Nensorb-20 column according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. 32P-Labeled duplex oligonucleotide, thus prepared, had a 4-nt flap (Fig. 2). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was lyophilized, resuspended in H2O, and stored at −30 °C. The standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50–100 ng of internally labeled U-DNA (Fig.1 a), 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 4% glycerol, 50 μm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, dCTP, 1 μg of single-stranded carrier oligonucleotide (30-mer), and 20 μg of cell extract. DNA repair synthesis reactions were carried out at 32 °C for the indicated times. After the reaction excision products were stabilized by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and incubated for 30 s on ice. Formamide-dye solution (12 μl) was added, and the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, as described below. The excision reaction was reconstituted in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, with or without 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP, and UDG and APE-pretreated 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide substrate (50 nm). The reaction was initiated by adding FEN1 to 20 nm and the appropriate dilutions of wild-type β-pol or mutants of β-pol, as indicated in the figure legends. Note that all reaction mixtures also contained UDG (10 nm) and APE (10 nm). Incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and the product was stabilized by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. The stabilized DNA product was recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8, and visualized by autoradiography. Standardized substrate and product molecules, which were characterized with use of various molecular size markers, served as size markers. DNA synthesis was performed under similar reaction conditions as described for the excision assay, except that 2.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity 1 × 106 dpm/pmol) was used instead of 20 μm dCTP. The reaction products were analyzed as above. Involvement of FEN1 in long patch BER had been suggested (4.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar,24.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); however, any active role of FEN1 in cell extract-mediated long patch BER of a natural AP site has remained unclear. To further examine the role of FEN1 in long patch BER, we first prepared a closed circular DNA substrate for in vitro BER reaction that contained a32P phosphate group immediately 5′ to uracil in a solitary uracil:guanine base pair (Fig.1 a). A requirement for FEN1 in long patch BER in a human lymphoid cell extract was examined. One fraction of the extract was depleted (>90%) of FEN1 by immunoaffinity column chromatography; the FEN1 depletion was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-FEN1 antibody (Fig. 1 b). The FEN1-depleted and normal cell extracts were then assayed for long patch BER excision. Release of the 32P sugar phosphate-containing oligomeric excision product found earlier (i.e.5′-dRP-N3) (22.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was measured. The results indicate that formation of this excision product was strongly decreased in the FEN1-depleted extract (Fig. 1 c). Excision activity in the FEN1-depleted extract was restored (∼75% of that observed in normal extract) by addition (200 ng) of purified FEN1 (Fig. 1 d). These results confirmed that FEN1 is involved in long patch BER excision of 5′-dRP-N3 by human cell extracts. To study the activities of FEN1 in a reconstituted long patch BER excision system, a homogeneous preparation of recombinant human FEN1 was used (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2 b). Flap excision activity of this enzyme was characterized using several relevant oligonucleotide DNA substrates (as shown in Fig. 2 a) containing either a reduced AP site sugar (termed F), a normal uracil residue, or a duplex containing a 4-nt flap with uracil at the 5′ end. These DNA substrates were pretreated with UDG and APE for removal of the uracil residue and 5′ incision at the AP site prior to addition of FEN1. Analysis of FEN1 utilization of these DNA substrates showed that FEN1 did not remove the 5′-dRP moiety by itself from any of the substrates, but instead excised 5′-dRP as part of an oligonucleotide whether the sugar was in the reduced or the normal form (data not shown). The β-pol dRP lyase activity rapidly removes the dRP moiety from the preincised AP site (Fig. 3 a, lane 5), but was not able to cleave either the reduced sugar phosphate (Fig. 3 a, lane 2) or the normal 5′ dRP moiety on a 4-nt flap DNA structure (Fig. 3 a,lanes 8 and 11). With substrates 1 and 2, FEN1 slowly excised 5′ dRP as a part of the dinucleotide from the 5′ end, leaving an 18-mer (Fig. 3 a, lanes 3 and 6). FEN1 readily cleaved the 4-nt flap DNA substrate, releasing 5′-dRP-N4 from the 5′ end of the labeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 a, lanes 9 and 12). Next, we examined whether β-pol could influence the excision activity of FEN1 on substrates 1 and 2 in the absence of strand displacement DNA synthesis; the reaction mixtures did not contain dNTPs. FEN1 alone had a relatively weak excision activity releasing the sugar phosphate and 1 nt from substrates 1 and 2, as noted above. β-pol stimulated this activity modestly, i.e. 2–3-fold (Fig. 3, b andc, compare lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results are in accord with reports that FEN1 has strong flap excision activity, does not release the 5′ dRP by itself, and that excision resulting in a 2-nt gap is the predominant FEN1 activity with substrates similar to those used in the experiment in Fig. 3 (34.Price A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Having characterized our preparation of purified FEN1, we next reconstituted excision in long patch BER using reaction mixtures with substrates 1 and 2, 5 nm β-pol, dNTPs, and 20 nm FEN1 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the main excision product in this system with substrates 1 and 2 (Fig. 4) corresponded to 5′-dRP-N3. This was observed earlier with uracil-DNA plasmid substrate and crude extract from human lymphoid cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (22.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Utilization of substrate and formation of 5′-dRP-N3 in the complete reconstituted system were greater than in reactions without β-pol, where a modest amount of the18-mer product, representing 5′-dRP-N1 excision, was formed. In Fig. 4 b(lane 2), note that the β-pol dRP lyase had converted most of the substrate remaining to the 19-mer. These results indicate that excision in long patch BER of uracil-DNA and tetrahydrofuran-DNA characteristic for human whole cell extracts can be reconstituted with the purified enzymes and oligonucleotide substrates used in this experiment. To further examine any requirement for the DNA synthesis and dRP lyase activities of β-pol in the excision step, we used two previously characterized site-directed mutants of β-pol, K72A and R283A. The alanine mutant of Lys-72 is significantly reduced in dRP lyase activity, but retains full DNA polymerization activity (16.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the alanine mutant of Arg-283 is significantly reduced in DNA polymerase but has full dRP lyase activity (36.Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Thomas G.W. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These mutants and wild-type β-pol were compared in the reconstituted excision reaction. The reaction mixtures contained dNTPs to allow DNA synthesis by β-pol. As noted above, FEN1 in the absence of β-pol produced a small amount of the 18-mer, reflecting a 2-nt excision product (Fig.4 c, lane 1). In the presence of wild-type β-pol or the dRP lyase-defective mutant (K72A), the product was a 16-mer, reflecting excision of 5′-F-N3, which was cleaved from the 5′ end of the labeled DNA strand. (Fig. 4 c,lanes 2 and 3). However, such a product was not observed with the DNA polymerase-defective mutant (R283A) (Fig. 4 c, lane 4); product formation in this case was consistent with the activity of FEN1 alone. These results demonstrate a requirement for β-pol-dependent DNA synthesis in FEN1 excision in this reconstituted system. Although β-pol DNA synthesis was required, the β-pol dRP lyase activity was not. Formation of the 16-mer and the 5′-dRP-N3 excision products in the reconstituted system occurs through the combined action of FEN1 and β-pol. To test whether FEN1 influences DNA synthesis by β-pol, we examined DNA polymerase activity using a reaction mixture containing all dNTPs and the reduced sugar (substrate 2) or a normal AP site (substrate 1) DNA substrate. With both DNA substrates, β-pol in the absence of FEN1 filled the single-nucleotide gap by adding one nucleotide to the primer creating a labeled 16-mer; only negligible amounts of longer primer extension products were observed (Fig.5, a and b,lanes 1). In contrast, when the reaction mixtures also contained FEN1, longer products were synthesized (Fig. 5,a and b, lanes 2) corresponding mainly, but not exclusively, to a 4-nucleotide primer extension product. Thus, FEN1 was capable of altering the DNA synthesis activity of β-pol, changing the polymerase activity from 1-nt gap filling exclusively to a combination of 4-nt strand displacement/gap filling plus 1-nt gap filling. The 4-nt primer extension product observed in these experiments correlates with complete gap filling to replace the 4-nt excision product described above, i.e.5′-dRP-N3 or 5′-F-N3. To further examine the influence of FEN1 on β-pol strand displacement DNA synthesis, we conducted incubations using a 10-fold higher level of β-pol, but the same amount of FEN1 that was used in the experiments above. The results indicated a significant amount of strand displacement/primer extension DNA synthesis by β-pol alone at this higher concentration, as expected from earlier work (37.Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Wilson S.H. Singhal R.K. Zmudzka B.Z. Warren S.T. Wells R.D. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1998: 693-968Google Scholar). However, a strong increase in strand displacement/primer extension synthesis by β-pol was observed when β-pol was present in excess along with FEN1. This stimulation was sufficient such that very little one nucleotide addition product was observed, in contrast to reactions without FEN1 (Fig. 6, a andb, compare lanes 1 and 2), and there was not preferential accumulation of the 4-nt primer extension product. These results and those above indicate that FEN1 can stimulate strand displacement DNA synthesis by β-pol and also that the controlled strand displacement and primer extension synthesis to produce the 4-nt addition product (Fig. 5) depends upon the β-pol balance or concentration in the system. We examined the influence of DNA substrate structure on the β-pol primer extension product size distribution. As noted above in Figs. 5 and 6, β-pol alone preferentially added 1 nt to the primer and little strand displacement DNA synthesis was observed. In the presence of FEN1, β-pol formed both 1-nt addition products and longer products representing strand displacement. We reasoned that strand displacement DNA synthesis mediated by FEN1 could be related to an effect on the downstream oligonucleotide and/or to a direct effect on the polymerase. As shown in Fig. 7, the FEN1-dependent stimulation of β-pol synthesis was not seen in the absence of a downstream oligonucleotide (Fig. 7, comparelanes 1 and 2). The stimulation also was not observed with substrate 6, which is a gapped substrate lacking a 5′ phosphate in the gap (compare lanes 3 and4 with lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that the effect of FEN1 requires a 5′ phosphate-bearing downstream oligonucleotide, and may be mediated by FEN1 binding to and altering the gap ahead of the polymerase. Recently, Dianov et al. (22.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) examined the excision products formed in long patch BER in mammalian cell extracts. The main excision product during BER of a uracil-containing plasmid DNA substrate was a short 5′-dRP-containing oligomer, 5′-dRP-N3. Formation of this product was markedly decreased in the absence of β-pol, suggesting a role of this DNA polymerase in long patch BER excision. Similarly, the FEN1 immunodepletion experiments described here, using human lymphoid cell extracts (Fig.1), suggest a role of FEN1 in long patch BER. Purified FEN1 was shown here to remove flaps with 5′-dRP in otherwise double-stranded DNA and, based upon this known activity, had already been implicated in the long patch BER subpathway (4.Klungland A.

In this report, we reconstituted the excision step of long patch BERin vitro using oligonucleotide substrates and purified human enzymes including β-pol and FEN1. Under appropriate conditions, the purified enzymes excised a 4-nt product from the 5′ end of the DNA substrate strand; this product was identical to the excision product formed in vitro by the human lymphoid cell and the mouse embryonic fibroblast extracts (cf. Fig. 2 and Ref. 22.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Formation of this excision product was dependent upon DNA synthesis by β-pol and upon FEN1. The role of FEN1 in formation of the 4-nt excision product appears to be complex. FEN1 stimulated strand displacement by β-pol, thereby assisting in formation of a flap DNA substrate, which in turn is excised by the FEN1 flap nuclease activity. These results are consistent with the idea that, if the dRP moiety is not processed, the cell can switch from single-nucleotide BER to long patch BER. Interestingly, when β-pol DNA synthesis was measured under the excision assay conditions, there was preferential gap-filling of 1 or 4 nt, respectively, depending on the presence of FEN1. Further, the strong stimulation in strand displacement activity of β-pol by FEN1 (Figs. 5 and 6) clearly points to an important functional cooperation between these enzymes and also to the idea that FEN1 and β-pol may combine to mediate long patch BER beginning with synthesis of the first nucleotide. Our data indicate that FEN1 can participate in long patch BER if an appropriate DNA substrate is available and that a functional interaction between FEN1 and β-pol may control excision product size in long patch BER. FEN1 alone releases the AP site sugar phosphate as part of a very short oligomer (dRP+ 1-nt oligo), but this was a relatively weak activity (Figs. 3 and 4). Purified FEN1 efficiently cleaves the DNA substrates that contain a 4-nt 5′ flap at a DNA nick. The 2-nt releasing activity was modestly stimulated (2–3-fold) by β-pol, again suggesting a functional partnership between these two proteins. In vitro experiments with mammalian cell extracts had indicated that an AP site is repaired preferentially by the β-pol-dependent single-nucleotide BER subpathway, as opposed to the long patch BER (5.Fortini P.

The DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease steps were rapid, and the rate-limiting step was removal of the 5′-dRP moiety by the dRP lyase activity of β-pol. These results contributed to the idea that the 5′-dRP-containing intermediate will accumulate during BER and that this intermediate may be involved in the choice of BER subpathway. Thus, if the 5′-dRP moiety is not removed, continued DNA synthesis could lead to strand displacement and eventual FEN1 excision, resulting in the long patch BER subpathway. The subpathway choice in BER of an AP site could, therefore, depend upon partitioning between dRP lyase activity or strand displacement DNA synthesis. If the sugar in the AP site is altered and is not a substrate for dRP lyase, strand displacement DNA synthesis would be the preferred next step in the repair mechanism (4.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Finally, having established that there is combined action by β-pol and FEN1, efforts to identify interactions between these two proteins are worthwhile. However, the mechanism of the FEN1 effect clearly involves the 5′ margin in the gapped DNA substrate. Thus, FEN1 could exert its effect through binding to and altering the DNA polymerase substrate, such that strand displacement synthesis is facilitated. It is noted that Meyer and co-workers (41.Rein D.C. Recupero A.J. Reed M. Meyer R.R. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. The Eukaryotic Nucleus. 1. The Telford Press, Inc., Caldwell, NJ1990: 95-124Google Scholar) found co-purification of FEN1 (DNase IV) and β-pol from rat hepatoma cell extract, and suggested that the two proteins exist as a complex in cells. Using purified β-pol and FEN1, we have been unable to demonstrate an interaction between these two enzymes (data not shown). We thank Drs. Thomas A. Kunkel, William C. Copeland, William A.

Whereas ceruloplasmin in plasma is produced and secreted by hepatocytes, in the brain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is expressed on the surface of astrocytes. By using a cDNA cloning approach, we have now determined that the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is generated by alternative RNA splicing. The splicing occurs downstream of exon 18 and replaces the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the secreted form with an alternative 30 amino acids that signal GPI anchor addition. RNase protection analysis demonstrates that the GPI-anchored form is the major form in the brain, whereas the secreted form predominates in the liver. Individuals with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin, have severe iron deposition in a number of organs, including the brain where it results in neurodegeneration.

It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes, including ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase, and its presence in heme imparts the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen and the ability of cytochrome oxidase to reduce oxygen to water. However, free iron is highly toxic because of its ability to generate free radicals. Ferrous (Fe(II)) iron can generate the highly reactive superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in the presence of molecular oxygen (1.Gutteridge J. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: S16-S21Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Consequently, iron metabolism is tightly regulated, and a variety of proteins have evolved to bind, transport, and sequester iron (2.De Silva D. Askwith C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Transferrin, the major iron transport protein in plasma, transports iron from sites of storage, such as the liver, to tissues utilizing iron. Ceruloplasmin, the major ferroxidase in plasma (300–400 μg/ml), promotes iron incorporation into transferrin as transferrin only binds ferric (Fe(III)) iron (3.Osaki S. Johnson D. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct evidence for a role of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism in vivo is provided by studies of patients with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin due to null mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene (4.Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Harris Z. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R. Gitlin J. Proc.

These patients have severe iron deposition in a variety of organs, including the brain where it results in neurodegeneration. The neurodegeneration appears to be due to an increased generation of free radicals by the accumulated iron. Indeed, there is a dramatic increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation products in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with aceruloplasminemia (7.Miyajima H. Fujimoto M. Kohno S. Kaneko E. Gitlin J. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A number of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Hallervorden-Spatz disease are also associated with abnormal iron deposition and free radical injury in the central nervous system (CNS)1 (8.Gerlach M. Ben-Shachar D. Riederer P. Youdim M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Although ceruloplasmin is generally considered a plasma protein secreted by the liver, we recently demonstrated that a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is localized to the surface of astrocytes in the CNS (9.Patel B.N.

Hepatocytes, which produce the ceruloplasmin present in serum, do not express the GPI-anchored form. The transcript coding for serum ceruloplasmin has been cloned from human (10.Koschinsky M.L. Funk W.D. van Oost B.A. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), rat (11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) liver cDNA libraries, and only a single gene has been identified (13.Royle N. Irwin D. Koschinsky M. MacGillivray R. Hamerton J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This report describes the cloning and expression of a novel alternatively spliced transcript for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. We also demonstrate that, in contrast to the liver which expresses mainly the secreted form, the brain expresses primarily the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. Since a lack of ceruloplasmin leads to excessive iron deposition in the brain and neurodegeneration, the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin likely plays a crucial role in iron metabolism in the CNS. In order to screen the cDNA library, a probe proximal to the 3′ end of the open reading frame (ORF) of the rat serum ceruloplasmin transcript was generated by RT-PCR using primers based on published sequence (Ref. 11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number, L33869). The primers were FP1 (forward primer), 5′-GCA TGC TCG GTC CAC TGA TTC-3′, and RP1 (reverse primer), 5′-AAC ATT TTC CCA TTG ATA GCA T-3′. These primers amplify a 481-base pair product corresponding to nucleotides 2399–2879 of the ORF of the rat serum ceruloplasmin transcript. The probe was used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed rat C6 glioma cDNA library prepared by D. Feinstein (Cornell University). The library was made in Lambda Zap II using the EcoRI-XhoI directional cloning procedure and contained an original complexity of 1 × 106 clones. 3 × 105 clones were screened according to Sambrook et al. (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.55Google Scholar). Twenty positive clones were obtained and were purified by two subsequent rounds of screening with the same probe. Two of the largest cDNA inserts were sequenced by automated fluorescence sequencing (Bio S&T). The complete sequences were aligned with the published sequence for rat serum ceruloplasmin (11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the program MegAlign (DNASTAR). Full-length cDNA clones were generated by RT-PCR using the Perkin-Elmer XL PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin was amplified from C6 glioma RNA using the following primers: CFP1 (common forward primer), 5′-GAC CTC GAG ATC GCG GGC TCC AAG AGG-3′, and GPIRP1 (GPI reverse primer), 5′- GAC GGA TCC ATT TAA ATA TGG CGT GAT AGC ACA-3′. The cDNA for the secreted (serum) form of ceruloplasmin was amplified from rat liver RNA using the following primers: CFP1 and SRP1 (serum reverse primer), 5′-GAC GGA TCC TTC ATC TGT CCA TCG GCA TTA CC-3′. To generate the expression construct, the PCR products were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEUK-C1 (CLONTECH). For the transfections, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, vitamins, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) on either 60-mm culture dishes or 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well cell culture plates until 50–70% confluent. Calcium phosphate-mediated transfections were performed using the ProFection system (Promega). The medium was replaced 24 h following the transfection and immunocytochemistry was performed the following day on live cells grown on the coverslips. At the same time, the cells and conditioned media were harvested from the 60-mm dish cultures for immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. Immunocytochemistry was performed on live cells grown on coverslips using a monoclonal antibody to ceruloplasmin (mAb 1A1; see Ref. 9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and visualized with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as described previously (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For some experiments, cells transfected with the cDNA for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) before immunocytochemistry. Cells transfected in 60-mm dishes were harvested with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 200 mm (isotonic) triethanolamine (pH 7.4). 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in a final volume of 250 μl containing 5 units/ml protease-free PI-PLC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Control cells were treated identically but without PI-PLC. Cells were subsequently washed by centrifugation, plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 10 min and immunostained with the mAb 1A1. Transfected cells were harvested as described above, resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium azide, and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml; aprotinin, 2 μg/ml; pepstatin, 1 μg/ml), vortexed to extract membrane proteins, and centrifuged. 1-ml aliquots of the resulting supernatants as well as the conditioned media were incubated with purified mAb 1A1 (20 μg) for 4 h at 4 °C, and then 100 μl of packed protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and incubated for another 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, extracted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the supernatants were electrophoresed and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed as described previously (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), using a polyclonal rabbit anti-ceruloplasmin antibody (Dako). The ceruloplasmin probe for the RNase protection experiments was generated by RT-PCR using rat brain RNA. The primers used were GPIFP1 (GPI forward primer), 5′-GTA TGT GAT GGC TAT GGG CAA TGA-3′, and GPIRP2 (GPI reverse primer), 5′-CCT GGA TGG AAC TGG TGA TGG A-3′. These primers amplify a product of 449 base pairs from the transcript for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin, corresponding to nucleotides 2928–3376 of the ORF. The product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced using the ThermoSequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the OpenGene automated sequencer (Visible Genetics). The RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (15.Bottai D. Dunn R.J. Ellis W. Maler L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 389: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pGEM-T plasmid containing the ceruloplasmin insert was linearized with either NotI or NcoI and transcribed using either T7 RNA polymerase (antisense probe) or Sp6 RNA polymerase (sense probe), respectively, using [∝-32P]CTP to label the probe. The probe was gel-purified and 1 × 106 cpm hybridized with 20 μg of total RNA from either rat liver, C6 glioma cells, neonatal (postnatal day 3) rat brain, or adult (2-month-old) rat brain in 80% formamide solution at 65 °C overnight. The samples (500 μl) were then treated with 2 μl of RNase mixture (5 units/μl RNase A and 0.25 units/μl RNase T1) for 30 min, followed by 20 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C. Samples were precipitated and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 murea gel. This probe yields a 449-nucleotide protected fragment for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin and a 236-nucleotide fragment for the secreted form. The rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion) generates a 316-nt protected fragment. The sizes of the protected fragments were confirmed using an RNA ladder generated by transcribing fragments of known size. Our previous biochemical data indicated that the GPI-anchored form and the secreted (serum) form of ceruloplasmin were highly similar, suggesting that they probably differed only in the extreme C terminus (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In order to clone the putative alternatively spliced transcript for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin, an oligo(dT)-primed C6 glioma cDNA library was screened with a probe proximal to the end of the ORF for the secreted form of rat ceruloplasmin (11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty clones were obtained with insert sizes that ranged from 1 to 3.6 kb. Complete DNA sequences for two of the larger clones (insert sizes of 2.9 and 3.6 kb) were aligned with the cDNA sequence for the secreted form of rat ceruloplasmin (11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that both clones encoded a novel transcript that was essentially identical to that for secreted ceruloplasmin except for a short terminal segment of the ORF as well as the 3′-untranslated region. The largest (3.6 kb) cDNA clone contained the complete ORF for this alternatively spliced form of ceruloplasmin as well as 12 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region and 260 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region. A comparison with the known exon-intron boundaries of human serum ceruloplasmin (16.Daimon M. Yamatani K. Igarashi M. Fukase N. Kawanami T. Kato T. Tominaga M. Sasaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reveals that the novel cDNA differs from the cDNA for the secreted form downstream of exon 18 (nucleotide 3163 of the ORF). This alternatively spliced transcript encodes a protein of 1084 amino acids compared with 1059 amino acids for secreted ceruloplasmin. The mature proteins, lacking the leader peptide of 19 amino acids, are 1065 and 1040 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). The ORF of the novel cDNA substitutes the C-terminal 5 amino acids of secreted ceruloplasmin with 30 alternative amino acids. The alternative stretch of 30 amino acids is predominantly non-polar, as it is for all known GPI-anchored proteins, with a large fraction of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). In addition, this stretch of amino acids also contains, proximally, a potential site for GPI anchor addition. GPI anchors are added to a small amino acid (denoted the ω amino acid) upstream of the non-polar C-terminal signal peptide, with concomitant cleavage of the signal peptide (17.Udenfried S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The first amino acid of the alternative peptide, the alanine, is a good candidate for the ω position. GPI anchor addition also requires small amino acids immediately following the ω amino acid, which are denoted the ω + 1 and ω + 2 amino acids. The serines immediately following the alanine are ideal candidates for these positions. Thus, it appears that this alternatively spliced ceruloplasmin with its alternative C-terminal tail satisfies all the known requirements for GPI anchor addition. To demonstrate conclusively that the alternatively spliced transcript codes for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin, full-length cDNA clones for the alternatively spliced form, as well as the secreted form were generated by RT-PCR and subcloned into the pEUK-C1 mammalian expression vector. These ceruloplasmin expression vectors were transfected into HEK 293T cells and analyzed for expression by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Cells transfected with the novel cDNA clone demonstrated intense cell surface immunofluorescence labeling with a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1A1) to rat ceruloplasmin (Fig. 2,A and B). This monoclonal antibody is species-specific and only recognizes native rat ceruloplasmin (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18.Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells transfected with the cDNA for secreted ceruloplasmin did not show cell surface labeling with the monoclonal antibody to ceruloplasmin (Fig. 2, C and D). This lack of staining is identical to that of non-transfected (control) cells (Fig. 2, E and F). The novel cDNA clone therefore codes for a membrane-bound form of ceruloplasmin. To confirm that both groups of transfected cells were expressing ceruloplasmin, the conditioned media and detergent extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated with mAb 1A1 (in order to exclude bovine ceruloplasmin present in fetal bovine serum) and Western-blotted with a polyclonal antibody to ceruloplasmin. The Western blot demonstrates that ceruloplasmin is associated predominantly with the cells when transfected with the cDNA for the alternatively spliced form of ceruloplasmin (Fig. 3). The estimated size of this protein of 135 kDa is similar to the size of GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin purified from rat astrocytes or C6 glioma cells (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, ceruloplasmin is found predominantly in the culture medium of cells transfected with the cDNA for the secreted form (Fig. 3). This ceruloplasmin appears slightly smaller (132 kDa) than that produced by the cells transfected with the novel cDNA transcript. The larger size of the latter is consistent with it being GPI-anchored, as the GPI anchor, which is added following cleavage of the C-terminal signal peptide, contributes approximately 1.5–3 kDa to the size of most GPI-anchored proteins, depending on the carbohydrate and lipid composition of the anchor (17.Udenfried S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Finally, we sought to demonstrate conclusively that the ceruloplasmin expressed on the surface of the cells transfected with the novel cDNA was in fact GPI-anchored and not attached by another means (i.e. a protein anchor). To this end, the transfected cells were treated with PI-PLC, an enzyme that specifically cleaves GPI anchors from GPI-anchored proteins (19.Low M. Kincade P. Nature. 1985; 318: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This treatment eliminated cell surface labeling with the monoclonal antibody to ceruloplasmin (Fig.4, A and B). Control cells, transfected with the same clone and treated identically but without PI-PLC, showed strong surface labeling (Fig. 4,C and D). These findings provide further evidence that the novel alternatively spliced transcript codes for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. To estimate the relative abundance of the transcripts for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin and secreted ceruloplasmin, RNase protection assays were performed on rat brain, liver, and C6 glioma cells, using a probe that spans nucleotides 2928–3376 of the cDNA for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin. The probe is fully protected by the transcript for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin to yield a fragment of 449 nucleotides, and it is partially protected by the transcript for secreted ceruloplasmin to yield a fragment of 236 nucleotides. Adult and neonatal rat brain express almost exclusively the transcript for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin (Fig. 5). Only a small amount of the transcript for the secreted form is expressed in the brain. There is no significant difference in expression between adult and neonatal brain. In contrast, rat liver expresses predominantly the transcript for secreted ceruloplasmin although a lower level of the transcript for the GPI-anchored form is also found. C6 glioma cells express predominantly the transcript for GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin, with lower levels of the secreted form. These results indicate that whereas the liver produces predominantly the secreted form of ceruloplasmin, the brain produces, almost exclusively, the GPI-anchored form. The GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin was recently identified in our laboratory using protein biochemical techniques (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). By using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1A1), ceruloplasmin was shown to be expressed on the surface of astrocytes in the mammalian brain (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as well as by leptomeningeal cells and fibroblasts in a number of tissues including the liver (18.Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, hepatocytes, which produce the ceruloplasmin present in serum, do not express the GPI-anchored form. 2B. N. Patel and S. David, unpublished observations. Our earlier peptide mapping studies indicated that GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin and serum ceruloplasmin are highly similar, suggesting that they probably differ only in the extreme C-terminal segment (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The possibility that these two different forms of ceruloplasmin might be produced by alternative RNA splicing was suggested by the work of Mollgard and co-workers (20.Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K. Saunders N. Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These investigators demonstrated that ceruloplasmin expressed byXenopus oocytes following microinjection of mRNA from fetal human liver was secreted by the oocytes, whereas injection of mRNA from fetal human brain led to the expression of ceruloplasmin that was retained by the cells. We now show that the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is generated by alternative RNA splicing and that it is the predominant form in the brain. The complete cDNA sequences for human (10.Koschinsky M.L. Funk W.D. van Oost B.A. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), rat (11.Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) serum ceruloplasmin have been reported previously, and whereas the exon-intron boundaries have been mapped only for the human cDNA (16.Daimon M. Yamatani K. Igarashi M. Fukase N. Kawanami T. Kato T. Tominaga M. Sasaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the boundaries are likely to be similar in the rat and mouse due to the high degree of sequence conservation (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The novel transcript for ceruloplasmin differs from the transcript for secreted ceruloplasmin downstream of exon 18. This alternative splicing leads to the replacement of the final 5 amino acids found in secreted ceruloplasmin with an alternative 30 amino acids in the novel form. This alternative C-terminal tail is relatively hydrophobic and represents a good signal peptide for GPI anchor addition (17.Udenfried S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Transfection of the full-length cDNA for the novel alternatively spliced form of ceruloplasmin into HEK 293T cells confirmed that it does indeed code for a membrane-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. In addition, treating these cells with PI-PLC, an enzyme that specifically cleaves GPI anchors from GPI-anchored proteins, eliminates the cell surface localization of ceruloplasmin. Cells transfected with the cDNA for the secreted form do not express ceruloplasmin on the cell surface but, in contrast, secrete it into the medium. Together, these data indicate that the novel alternatively spliced transcript does, in fact, code for the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. This membrane-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is expected to retain ferroxidase activity as it maintains all the ligands for the active site copper atoms, and the alternative C-terminal tail is unlikely to affect the overall structure of ceruloplasmin as the C terminus of the secreted protein is located outside the β-barrel structure (21.Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 22.Lindley P. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammer B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we have previously shown that GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin, released from the surface of C6 glioma cells with PI-PLC, possesses oxidase activity (9.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays on rat brain and liver, using a probe that recognizes transcripts for both the GPI-anchored and secreted forms of ceruloplasmin, showed that the brain expresses almost exclusively the transcript for the GPI-anchored form. In contrast, liver expresses a large amount of the transcript for the secreted form. This is consistent with observations that the liver produces large amounts of ceruloplasmin for secretion into the circulation. In addition, the liver also contains a lower amount of the transcript for the GPI-anchored form that is likely to be expressed by connective tissue fibroblasts. Because ceruloplasmin from the circulation does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier and levels of soluble ceruloplasmin in the cerebrospinal fluid are extremely low, at less than 1 μg/ml compared with 300–400 μg/ml in plasma (23.Bell J. Fryer A. Collins M. Marshall T. Jones P. Strange R. Hume R. Neuropath. Appl. Neurobiol. 1991; 17: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it would appear that the GPI-anchored form, produced within the brain, is the major form of ceruloplasmin in that organ. Other investigators have reported ceruloplasmin expression in the mammalian CNS, primarily by Northern blot analysis using probes that recognize both alternatively spliced transcripts (24.Thomas T. Schreiber G. Jaworowski A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25.Gaitskhoki V. Voronina O. Denezhkina V. Pliss M. Puchkova L. Shvartsman A. Neifakh S. Biokhimiia. 1990; 55: 927-937PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Yang F.M. Friedrichs W.E. Cupples R.L. Bonifacio M.J. Sanford J.A. Horton W.A. Bowman B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10780-10785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ceruloplasmin has been localized to astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry (20.Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K. Saunders N. Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More recently, Gitlin and colleagues (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27.Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have localized ceruloplasmin expression by in situ hybridization to various populations of astrocytes in the CNS, with the greatest expression in astrocytes surrounding the brain microvasculature. These and other investigators (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27.Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28.Levin L. Geszvain K. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar) have also detected ceruloplasmin expression in retinal astrocytes and Muller glia by in situ hybridization. The data we present in this paper suggests that the ceruloplasmin detected in the CNS by these investigators is predominantly the GPI-anchored form. Why ceruloplasmin is alternatively spliced to produce the GPI-anchored form in the CNS is not known. However, it is known that compared with proteins anchored to the surface by a protein anchor, GPI-anchored proteins, which are found in selectively lipid-enriched microdomains, have a much greater degree of lateral mobility within the lipid bilayer (17.Udenfried S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, the GPI anchor has been identified as an apical targeting signal for various cell types (29.Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 637-640PubMed Google Scholar). This combination of features might help achieve a high localized concentration of ceruloplasmin where required, for example in the perivascular processes of astrocytes, and facilitate the interaction of ceruloplasmin with other proteins involved in iron transport. Another unique feature of GPI-anchored proteins is that they can be transferred from the plasma membrane of one cell to another at sites of cell-cell contact (30.Kooyman D.L. Byrne G.W. McClellan S. Nielsen D. Tone M. Waldmann H. Coffman T.M. McCurry K.R. Platt J.L. Logan J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This mechanism might permit cells that do not express GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin to acquire the protein from adjacent astrocytes expressing it. This might be significant in vivo, since ceruloplasmin has been localized to both astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry (20.Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K. Saunders N. Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) although neurons do not appear to express ceruloplasmin mRNA (12.Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.D. Dugan L.L. Giltin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27.Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The role of ceruloplasmin in vivo is most convincingly demonstrated by studies of individuals with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin. These patients exhibit severe dementia and movement disorders, associated with iron deposition and neurodegeneration in a number of brain regions, including the striatum and dentate nucleus (4.Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Harris Z. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R. Gitlin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 6.Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The neurodegeneration is likely due to the generation of oxygen free radicals via the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. Indeed, Miyajima et al. (7.Miyajima H. Fujimoto M. Kohno S. Kaneko E. Gitlin J. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have observed a large increase in lipid peroxidation products in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with aceruloplasminemia. Furthermore, treating patients with the iron chelator desferrioxamine reduces the progression of neurological symptoms (31.Miyajima H. Takahashi Y. Kamata T. Shimizu H. Sakai N. Gitlin J.D. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The iron deposition in the tissues of patients with aceruloplasminemia suggests that the role of ceruloplasmin in vivo is to prevent excessive intracellular iron accumulation. Ceruloplasmin may achieve this by either promoting iron efflux or by inhibiting iron uptake, and recent in vitro data suggest that ceruloplasmin might perform both of these functions. A role for ceruloplasmin in iron efflux was originally suggested by Osaki and colleagues (3.Osaki S. Johnson D. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based on the observation that the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin promoted iron incorporation into transferrin. Indeed, in combination with transferrin, ceruloplasmin has been shown to promote iron efflux from cells in vitro (32.Young S. Fahmy M. Golding S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A potential role for ceruloplasmin in iron efflux from cells is also suggested by the recent identification of a ceruloplasmin homologue, named Hephaestin, which is expressed by the intestine and which is required for the movement of iron out of intestinal epithelial cells (33.Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Mice mutant for Hephaestin are unable to release iron from the intestinal epithelial cell, where it accumulates, and consequently the animals have severe anemia. Interestingly, Hephaestin, which is 50% homologous to ceruloplasmin and thought to possess ferroxidase activity, is a transmembrane protein that appears to be localized to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Hephaestin is thought to interact with an iron transport protein to permit the efflux of iron out of these cells. The GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin could potentially perform a similar function, promoting iron efflux from cells in the CNS. This putative interaction of a ferroxidase with an iron transport protein has certain similarities with an iron uptake system in yeast in which a cell surface ferroxidase, Fet3, is required for iron uptake by an iron transport protein, Ftr1 (34.Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 35.Stearman R. Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, unlike the single-celled yeast, the interaction of the GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin with an iron transporter on mammalian cells may lead to iron release rather than uptake. In addition to promoting iron efflux, ceruloplasmin might also prevent intracellular iron accumulation by inhibiting iron uptake by a transferrin-independent iron uptake system that has been identified in various cell types (2.De Silva D. Askwith C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This system requires the reduction of Fe(III) iron to Fe(II) iron at the cell surface for uptake to occur (2.De Silva D. Askwith C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This iron uptake system might be particularly important for cells that do not express the transferrin receptor, such as astrocytes (36.Roskams A. Connor J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 31: 421-427Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin would counteract this reduction of iron at the cell surface and thus limit uptake by this system. Indeed, this possibility is supported by the observation that ceruloplasmin inhibits iron uptake by a transferrin-independent iron uptake system in vitro (37.Richardson D. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is not known if the lack of GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin in the CNS is directly responsible for the iron deposition and neurodegeneration seen in aceruloplasminemia or whether this is a secondary consequence of the systemic iron overload. However, in the most common disorder of iron metabolism, hereditary hemochromatosis, severe iron deposition occurs in most systemic organs, including the liver, but iron deposition does not occur in the CNS, and consequently, neurological symptoms are not observed (38.Bothwell T.H. MacPhail A.P. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 55-71PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the lack of GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin in the CNS is likely to be primarily responsible for the iron deposition and neurodegeneration in aceruloplasminemia. Whether a reduction in the level of GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin in specific regions of the CNS might contribute to the pathology seen in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases in which excessive iron accumulation occurs needs to be examined.

The DNA polymerase ζ of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for error-prone repair following DNA damage and consists of a complex between three proteins, scRev1, scRev3, and scRev7. Here we describe a candidate human homolog of S. cerevisiae Rev7 (hREV7), which was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the human homolog of S. cerevisiae Rev3 (hREV3). The hREV7 gene product displays 23% identity and 53% similarity with scREV7, as well as 23% identity and 54% similarity with the human mitotic checkpoint protein hMAD2. hREV7 is located on human chromosome 1p36 in a region of high loss of heterozygosity in human tumors, although no alterations of hREV3 or hREV7 were found in primary human tumors or human tumor cell lines. The interaction domain between hREV3 and hREV7 was determined and suggests that hREV7 probably functions with hREV3 in the human DNA polymerase ζ complex. In addition, we have identified an interaction between hREV7 and hMAD2 but not hMAD1. While overexpression of hREV7 does not lead to cell cycle arrest, we entertain the possibility that it may act as an adapter between DNA repair and the spindle assembly checkpoint.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Such DNA alterations include reactive oxygen damage, deamination, loss of nucleotides, nucleotide modifications, and DNA strand breaks. DNA damage repair has evolved to cope with these environmental and mutagen-induced DNA alteration and plays a central role in maintaining the genetic stability of the organism (2.Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 3.Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).Extensive studies of bacterial and yeast systems have identified components of the DNA repair machinery. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, pyrimidine dimers induced by UV radiation damage are corrected by the RAD3 excision repair, the RAD6 postreplication repair, and the RAD52recombinational repair pathways (for a review see Ref. 4.Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the removal of UV damage by the RAD6 pathway occurs by both error-free and error-prone (mutagenic) mechanisms (5.Lawrence C.W. O'Brien T. Bond J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,6.Lawrence C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mutagenic repair of UV damage has been shown to require the UVrevertible genes, REV1, REV3, andREV7, a lesion bypass polymerase complex consisting of a deoxycytidyl-transferase (Rev1), a polymerase catalytic subunit (Rev3), and a polymerase accessory protein (Rev7) (for review see Refs. 7.Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar and8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This polymerase complex has been termed polymerase ζ.Both the genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the polymerase ζ is capable of translesion DNA synthesis across abasic sites, pyrimidine dimers, and modified nucleotides (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

In the case of abasic sites, the Rev1 deoxycytidyl transferase appears to introduces a cytosine opposite the lesion (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The Rev1 gene product displays weak homology with bacterial UmuC protein, which functions in damage-induced SOS mutagenesis in Escherichia coli (12.Larimer F.W. Perry J.R. Hardigree A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 230-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial RecA-activated UmuD′2C in concert with polymerase III appears to perform a similar function to the yeast polymerase ζ (13.Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,14.Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10348-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Rev3 gene product contains several of the conserved sequence motifs found in DNA polymerases and appears to form a complex with Rev7 protein to construct the DNA polymerase ζ complex (7.Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Morrison A. Christensen R.B. Alley J. Beck A.K. Bernstine E.G. Lemontt J.F. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Rev7 gene product has no reported similarities to any known proteins, and its function is unknown (16.Torpey L.E. Gibbs P.E. Nelson J. Lawrence C.W. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Recently, hREV3, the likely human homolog of S. cerevisiaeRev3 (scRev3), was identified and found to be almost twice the size of the scRev3 product (17.Xiao W.

A. 1998; 95: 6876-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that hREV3 might function in a similar way to scRev3. The human homologs of scRev1 and scRev7 have not been not reported.Chromosomal instability is thought to be one of several underlying causes of cancer development (20.Boveri, T. (1914) Fischer, JenaGoogle Scholar, 21.Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J. Kane M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1994; 75: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Moreover, spindle assembly checkpoint genes have been found to play important roles in maintaining chromosome integrity (for a review, see Refs. 23.Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24.Allshire R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25.Gorbsky G.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The spindle assembly checkpoint appears to prevent the early onset of anaphase in cell cycle until all of the mitotic spindles are attached to the kinetochores on chromosomes and all of the chromosomes are aligned properly at the metaphase plate. Mutants of the spindle assembly checkpoint have been identified in S. cerevisiae based on a defect in M phase cell cycle arrest after treatment with a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, which include the following:MAD (mitotic arrest-deficient) 1–3 and BUB(budding uninhibited by benzimidazole) 1–3 (26.Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 27.Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T.

Genetics. 1999; 152: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, serial studies in S. cerevisiae have also identified other genes that appear to take part in the M phase cell cycle arrest and include MPS1 (monopolar spindle 1), CDC55 (cell division cycle 55), and CDC28 (cyclin-dependent kinase) (30.Weiss E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 31.Li X. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32.Wang Y. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).The human homologs of these S. cerevisiae spindle assembly checkpoint genes have also been identified. hMAD2 was isolated in a screen for high copy number suppressors of thiabendazole sensitivity in yeast cells lacking CBF1, a component of the kinetochore (33.Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). hMAD1 was isolated as a cellular target of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 oncoprotein Tax using a yeast two-hybrid screen (34.Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). hBUB1 and hBUBR1were isolated by expressed sequence tag (EST)2 search as homologous genes with S. cerevisiae scBUB1 (35.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), whereashBUB3 was isolated in an EST search for homolog(s) ofscBUB3 (36.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although these genes have been identified in human cells as possible spindle assembly checkpoint genes, their definitive relationship to the spindle assembly process is not fully understood. Interestingly, rare mutations of hBUB1 have been found in colorectal tumors (35.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar).Here, we describe the identification of a candidate for hREV7, the human homolog of the scRev7 protein. Interestingly, hREV7 displays significant homology to hMAD2. The hREV7 gene was initially identified based on its strong interaction with hREV3 using the yeast two-hybrid system. We have additionally characterized the interaction regions between hREV7 with hREV3 using a combination of yeast two-hybrid and GST fusion in vitro binding systems and further demonstrate hREV7 interaction with hMAD2 but not hMAD1. Although we found no effect on G2-M arrest by overexpression hREV7 in human cells, these results appear to support the notion that the human mutagenic bypass DNA polymerase ζ contacts the spindle assembly checkpoint via hMAD2, which in turn associates with hMAD1 and/or the CDC20·APC complex.DISCUSSIONTwo polymerase systems appear to exist in eucaryotic cells that are capable of bypass synthesis across damaged nucleotides in DNA (8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): polymerase ζ (composed of Rev1, Rev3 and Rev7) and polymerase η (the product of the RAD30 gene) (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The human homolog of Rad30, hRAD30, has recently been identified as the gene responsible for xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) variant (XP-V), a rare hereditary skin cancer predisposition syndrome (47.Kuwamoto K. Miyauchi-Hashimoto H. Isei T. Horio T. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1999; 15: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48.Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). This result suggests that polymerase bypass synthesis is an important component of the cellular DNA repair and genome maintenance functions.Here we have identified the likely human homolog of scRev7, hREV7, the accessory subunit of polymerase ζ. This identification is based on its lack of interaction with hMAD1 and strong interaction with the catalytic core of polymerase ζ, hREV3, which we previously identified and cloned from the EST data base. 3Y. Murakumo, T. Roth, D. Rasio, C. M. Croce, and R. Fishel, unpublished results. An enhancement of polymerase ζ catalytic activity is required to confirm a functional role for this candidate hREV7 and is in progress.We have also detailed an interaction region on hREV3 (residues 1776–2195) that appears responsible for the strong association with the hREV7 protein. The hREV7 binding region of hREV3 does not appear to overlap the consensus polymerase motifs characteristic of DNA polymerases. Immunoprecipitation studies appear to confirm an interaction between hREV3 and hREV7 in vivo (data not shown). Despite an intensive search, we have found no alterations of either hREV3 or hREV7 in human primary tumors or human tumor cell lines. These results either suggest that inactivation of hREV3 or hREV7 does not promote tumorigenesis or that one or both of these genes are essential for cellular survival.The efficiency of error-free translesion synthesis by polymerase η across UV-induced thymine-thymine dimers appears to be more than 70%in vitro (46.Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae polymerase ζ can also replicate passed a thymine-thymine dimer orN-2-acetylaminofluorene lesion, but the efficiency of this translesion synthesis is only about 10% (10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 11.Baynton K. Bresson Roy A. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, approximately 3% of the REV3 bypass synthesis contained mutations. These results support the notion that polymerase η is the likely polymerase responsible for the RAD6 error-free UV repair pathway, while polymerase ζ is the likely polymerase for the RAD6 error-prone UV repair pathway (8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the “fill-in” synthesis associated with double strand break repair in S. cerevisiae can also be mutagenic, and this mutagenic repair is dependent on scREV3 (49.Holbeck S.L. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The function of scREV7 in polymerase ζ is unknown. However, the polymerase activity of scRev3 is approximately 20–30 times more efficient when scRev7 is present (10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We consider several functions for hREV7: 1) targeting DNA polymerase ζ to lesion-containing DNA; 2) maintaining the structure/function of DNA polymerase ζ; and 3) controlling the cell cycle or cellular conditions that promote appropriate DNA polymerase ζ function in vivo.The study of spindle assembly checkpoint is an active area of research, and many genes have been implicated in this complicated process (50.Hardwick K.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). hMAD2 is believed to be the key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The MAD2 protein has been shown to bind MAD1 and also forms a complex with CDC20-APC to prevent activation of APC (34.Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 51.Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Recently, a sequence conservation (HORMA) implicated in a variety of protein-protein interactions as well as oligomerization was identified in comparisons of scMad2, scRev7, scHop1 (a meiotic-synaptonemal complex component), and several other proteins (52.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 284-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 53.Kironmai K.M. Muniyappa K. Friedman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hREV7 protein contains this HORMA domain, which may ultimately be the region responsible for interaction with hREV3 and/or hMAD2.Overexpression of Schizosaccharomyces pombe spMad2 orS. cerevisiae scMsp1 or scBub1 results in cell cycle arrest at M phase (50.Hardwick K.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 54.Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 55.Farr K.A. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2738-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We produced stable transfectants capable of regulated hREV7 overexpression. Examination of three such cell lines that showed dramatic overexpression of hREV7 has revealed no alterations of the cell cycle. We have not eliminated the possibility of an effect of hREV7 overexpression on damage-induced M-phase arrest. We consider the possibility that hREV7 may act as an adapter for DNA repair and spindle assembly checkpoint. This idea is based on the strong interaction between hREV7 and both the bypass polymerase catalytic subunit hREV3 and the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein hMAD2. Moreover, we have demonstrated that these three proteins appear capable of forming a multiprotein complex in vitro. Unfortunately, the lack of available and/or useful antibody reagents has precluded demonstration of an interaction between hREV7 and hMAD2in vivo. Thus, this in vitro interaction must be regarded with some skepticism. Details of any role for hREV7 in polymerase ζ activity and/or the spindle assembly checkpoint await further study. DNA damage is induced by a variety of endogenous and exogenous factors (1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Such DNA alterations include reactive oxygen damage, deamination, loss of nucleotides, nucleotide modifications, and DNA strand breaks. DNA damage repair has evolved to cope with these environmental and mutagen-induced DNA alteration and plays a central role in maintaining the genetic stability of the organism (2.Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 3.Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Extensive studies of bacterial and yeast systems have identified components of the DNA repair machinery. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, pyrimidine dimers induced by UV radiation damage are corrected by the RAD3 excision repair, the RAD6 postreplication repair, and the RAD52recombinational repair pathways (for a review see Ref. 4.Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the removal of UV damage by the RAD6 pathway occurs by both error-free and error-prone (mutagenic) mechanisms (5.Lawrence C.W. O'Brien T. Bond J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,6.Lawrence C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mutagenic repair of UV damage has been shown to require the UVrevertible genes, REV1, REV3, andREV7, a lesion bypass polymerase complex consisting of a deoxycytidyl-transferase (Rev1), a polymerase catalytic subunit (Rev3), and a polymerase accessory protein (Rev7) (for review see Refs. 7.Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar and8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This polymerase complex has been termed polymerase ζ. Both the genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the polymerase ζ is capable of translesion DNA synthesis across abasic sites, pyrimidine dimers, and modified nucleotides (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 11.Baynton K. Bresson Roy A. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the case of abasic sites, the Rev1 deoxycytidyl transferase appears to introduces a cytosine opposite the lesion (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The Rev1 gene product displays weak homology with bacterial UmuC protein, which functions in damage-induced SOS mutagenesis in Escherichia coli (12.Larimer F.W. Perry J.R. Hardigree A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 230-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial RecA-activated UmuD′2C in concert with polymerase III appears to perform a similar function to the yeast polymerase ζ (13.Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,14.Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10348-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Rev3 gene product contains several of the conserved sequence motifs found in DNA polymerases and appears to form a complex with Rev7 protein to construct the DNA polymerase ζ complex (7.Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Morrison A. Christensen R.B. Alley J. Beck A.K. Bernstine E.G. Lemontt J.F. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Rev7 gene product has no reported similarities to any known proteins, and its function is unknown (16.Torpey L.E. Gibbs P.E. Nelson J. Lawrence C.W. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, hREV3, the likely human homolog of S. cerevisiaeRev3 (scRev3), was identified and found to be almost twice the size of the scRev3 product (17.Xiao W. Lechler T. Chow B.L. Fontanie T. Agustus M. Carter K.C. Wei Y.F. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18.Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Fishel, unpublished results.Human cells expressing an hREV3 antisense RNA fragment grew normally but appeared slightly more sensitive to UV and displayed little or no UV-induced mutagenesis (18.Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6876-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that hREV3 might function in a similar way to scRev3. The human homologs of scRev1 and scRev7 have not been not reported. Chromosomal instability is thought to be one of several underlying causes of cancer development (20.Boveri, T. (1914) Fischer, JenaGoogle Scholar, 21.Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J. Kane M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1994; 75: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Moreover, spindle assembly checkpoint genes have been found to play important roles in maintaining chromosome integrity (for a review, see Refs. 23.Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24.Allshire R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25.Gorbsky G.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The spindle assembly checkpoint appears to prevent the early onset of anaphase in cell cycle until all of the mitotic spindles are attached to the kinetochores on chromosomes and all of the chromosomes are aligned properly at the metaphase plate. Mutants of the spindle assembly checkpoint have been identified in S. cerevisiae based on a defect in M phase cell cycle arrest after treatment with a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, which include the following:MAD (mitotic arrest-deficient) 1–3 and BUB(budding uninhibited by benzimidazole) 1–3 (26.Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 27.Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 28.Li R. Havel C. Watson J.A. Murray A.W.

Genetics. 1999; 152: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, serial studies in S. cerevisiae have also identified other genes that appear to take part in the M phase cell cycle arrest and include MPS1 (monopolar spindle 1), CDC55 (cell division cycle 55), and CDC28 (cyclin-dependent kinase) (30.Weiss E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 31.Li X. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32.Wang Y. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The human homologs of these S. cerevisiae spindle assembly checkpoint genes have also been identified. hMAD2 was isolated in a screen for high copy number suppressors of thiabendazole sensitivity in yeast cells lacking CBF1, a component of the kinetochore (33.Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). hMAD1 was isolated as a cellular target of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 oncoprotein Tax using a yeast two-hybrid screen (34.Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). hBUB1 and hBUBR1were isolated by expressed sequence tag (EST)2 search as homologous genes with S. cerevisiae scBUB1 (35.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), whereashBUB3 was isolated in an EST search for homolog(s) ofscBUB3 (36.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although these genes have been identified in human cells as possible spindle assembly checkpoint genes, their definitive relationship to the spindle assembly process is not fully understood. Interestingly, rare mutations of hBUB1 have been found in colorectal tumors (35.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification of a candidate for hREV7, the human homolog of the scRev7 protein. Interestingly, hREV7 displays significant homology to hMAD2. The hREV7 gene was initially identified based on its strong interaction with hREV3 using the yeast two-hybrid system. We have additionally characterized the interaction regions between hREV7 with hREV3 using a combination of yeast two-hybrid and GST fusion in vitro binding systems and further demonstrate hREV7 interaction with hMAD2 but not hMAD1. Although we found no effect on G2-M arrest by overexpression hREV7 in human cells, these results appear to support the notion that the human mutagenic bypass DNA polymerase ζ contacts the spindle assembly checkpoint via hMAD2, which in turn associates with hMAD1 and/or the CDC20·APC complex. DISCUSSIONTwo polymerase systems appear to exist in eucaryotic cells that are capable of bypass synthesis across damaged nucleotides in DNA (8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): polymerase ζ (composed of Rev1, Rev3 and Rev7) and polymerase η (the product of the RAD30 gene) (9.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The human homolog of Rad30, hRAD30, has recently been identified as the gene responsible for xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) variant (XP-V), a rare hereditary skin cancer predisposition syndrome (47.Kuwamoto K. Miyauchi-Hashimoto H. Isei T. Horio T. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1999; 15: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48.Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). This result suggests that polymerase bypass synthesis is an important component of the cellular DNA repair and genome maintenance functions.Here we have identified the likely human homolog of scRev7, hREV7, the accessory subunit of polymerase ζ. This identification is based on its lack of interaction with hMAD1 and strong interaction with the catalytic core of polymerase ζ, hREV3, which we previously identified and cloned from the EST data base. 3Y. Murakumo, T. Roth, D. Rasio, C. M. Croce, and R. Fishel, unpublished results. An enhancement of polymerase ζ catalytic activity is required to confirm a functional role for this candidate hREV7 and is in progress.We have also detailed an interaction region on hREV3 (residues 1776–2195) that appears responsible for the strong association with the hREV7 protein. The hREV7 binding region of hREV3 does not appear to overlap the consensus polymerase motifs characteristic of DNA polymerases. Immunoprecipitation studies appear to confirm an interaction between hREV3 and hREV7 in vivo (data not shown). Despite an intensive search, we have found no alterations of either hREV3 or hREV7 in human primary tumors or human tumor cell lines. These results either suggest that inactivation of hREV3 or hREV7 does not promote tumorigenesis or that one or both of these genes are essential for cellular survival.The efficiency of error-free translesion synthesis by polymerase η across UV-induced thymine-thymine dimers appears to be more than 70%in vitro (46.Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae polymerase ζ can also replicate passed a thymine-thymine dimer orN-2-acetylaminofluorene lesion, but the efficiency of this translesion synthesis is only about 10% (10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 11.Baynton K. Bresson Roy A. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, approximately 3% of the REV3 bypass synthesis contained mutations. These results support the notion that polymerase η is the likely polymerase responsible for the RAD6 error-free UV repair pathway, while polymerase ζ is the likely polymerase for the RAD6 error-prone UV repair pathway (8.Friedberg E.C. Gerlach V.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the “fill-in” synthesis associated with double strand break repair in S. cerevisiae can also be mutagenic, and this mutagenic repair is dependent on scREV3 (49.Holbeck S.L. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The function of scREV7 in polymerase ζ is unknown. However, the polymerase activity of scRev3 is approximately 20–30 times more efficient when scRev7 is present (10.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We consider several functions for hREV7: 1) targeting DNA polymerase ζ to lesion-containing DNA; 2) maintaining the structure/function of DNA polymerase ζ; and 3) controlling the cell cycle or cellular conditions that promote appropriate DNA polymerase ζ function in vivo.The study of spindle assembly checkpoint is an active area of research, and many genes have been implicated in this complicated process (50.Hardwick K.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). hMAD2 is believed to be the key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The MAD2 protein has been shown to bind MAD1 and also forms a complex with CDC20-APC to prevent activation of APC (34.Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 51.Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Recently, a sequence conservation (HORMA) implicated in a variety of protein-protein interactions as well as oligomerization was identified in comparisons of scMad2, scRev7, scHop1 (a meiotic-synaptonemal complex component), and several other proteins (52.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 284-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 53.Kironmai K.M. Muniyappa K. Friedman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hREV7 protein contains this HORMA domain, which may ultimately be the region responsible for interaction with hREV3 and/or hMAD2.Overexpression of Schizosaccharomyces pombe spMad2 orS. cerevisiae scMsp1 or scBub1 results in cell cycle arrest at M phase (50.Hardwick K.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 54.Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W.

We produced stable transfectants capable of regulated hREV7 overexpression. Examination of three such cell lines that showed dramatic overexpression of hREV7 has revealed no alterations of the cell cycle. We have not eliminated the possibility of an effect of hREV7 overexpression on damage-induced M-phase arrest. We consider the possibility that hREV7 may act as an adapter for DNA repair and spindle assembly checkpoint. This idea is based on the strong interaction between hREV7 and both the bypass polymerase catalytic subunit hREV3 and the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein hMAD2. Moreover, we have demonstrated that these three proteins appear capable of forming a multiprotein complex in vitro.

K4K20-S4 was 2–3-fold more potent against protozoa and RBC, yet K4K20-S4 was more potent by 2 orders of magnitude against bacteria. K4-S4 had similar behavior as K4K20-S4, but K20-S4 and analogous negative charge substitutions were as active as dermaseptin S4 or had reduced activity. Binding experiments suggested that potency enhancement was not the result of increased affinity to target cells. In contrast, potency correlated well with aggregation properties. Fluorescence studies indicated that K20-S4 and all negative charge substitutions were as aggregated as dermaseptin S4, whereas K4-S4 and K4K20-S4 were clearly less aggregated. Overall, the data indicated that N-terminal domain interaction between dermaseptin S4 monomers is responsible for the peptide's oligomerization in solution and, hence, for its limited spectrum of action. Moreover, bell-shaped dose-response profiles obtained with bacteria but not with protozoa or RBC implied that aggregation can have dramatic consequences on antibacterial activity. Based on these results, we tested the feasibility of selectivity reversal in the activity of dermaseptin S4. Tampering with the composition of the hydrophobic domains by reducing hydrophobicity or by increasing the net positive charge affected dramatically the peptide's activity and resulted in various analogs that displayed potent antibacterial activity but reduced hemolytic activity. Among these, maximal antibacterial activity was displayed by a 15-mer version that was more potent by 2 orders of magnitude compared with native dermaseptin S4. These results emphasize the notion that peptide-based antibiotics represent a highly modular synthetic antimicrobial system and provide indications of how the peptide's physico-chemical properties affect potency and selectivity.

Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 4: 277-304Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 2.Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 3.Hancock R.E.W.

Antimicrobial peptides display a large heterogeneity in primary and secondary structures but share common features such as amphipathy and net positive charge. These features seem to form the basis for their cytotoxic function. Although their precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, antimicrobial peptides are believed to kill the target cell by destabilizing the ordered structure of the cell membrane via either a “barrel stave” mechanism or a nonpore carpet-like mechanism (4.Epand M.E. Shai Y. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5.Shai Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides are potentially active against a large spectrum of microorganisms, yet they are generally nontoxic for normal mammalian cells. The molecular basis for this selectivity is also ill defined but believed to result from differences inherent to the lipid composition of target versus nontarget cells, such as membrane fluidity and negative charge density. Indeed, a large body of experimental data demonstrates that factors affecting membranolytic properties include peptide amphipathy and positive charge distribution (6.Frohlich D.R Wells A.W. Int. J.

Moreover, isomers composed of all d-amino acids display identical potency as the all l-amino acid counterparts. This finding represents one of the more fascinating aspects that evolved from the investigation of their mechanism of action, since it implies that if their antimicrobial activity is not mediated by interaction with specific receptors, peptide-based antibiotics could escape some of the mechanisms involved in multidrug resistance. Dermaseptins are a large family of antimicrobial peptides (28–34 amino acids) expressed in the skin of tree frogs belonging to the phyllomedusinae genus (13.Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore S.D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 3: 8824-8830Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14.Mor A. Nicolas P. Eur. J.

They are linear polycationic peptides, structured in amphipathic α-helix in apolar solvents (16.Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with cytolytic activity in vitro against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, yeast, and filamentous fungi). Using phospholipid liposomes or live cells, the selective antimicrobial action of these peptides was shown to be mediated by selective interaction of the amphipathic α-helix moiety with the plasma membrane phospholipids (7.Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10.Strahilevitz J. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y.

Jacks T.J. Grimm C. Walsh T.J. Med. Mycol. 1998; 36: 291-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to cell permeabilization. Dermaseptins were shown also to be potent killers of nongrowing and slowly growing bacteria (19.Jouenne T. Mor A. Bonato H. Junter G.A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1998; 42: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential interest in the eradication of bacteria placed in a dormant state and/or subject to low oxygen tension, which are major factors affecting susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents, thus leading to drug resistance. More recently, the potential interest of dermaseptins, alone or in combination with mild heating, in killing spoilage yeast was demonstrated (20.Coot P.J. Holyoak C.D. Bracey D. Ferdinando D.P. Pearce J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2160-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among natural dermaseptins, dermaseptin S4 is highly toxic to erythrocytes, in contrast to other dermaseptin members, such as dermaseptin S3 (12.Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shay Y. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBC),1 dermaseptin S3 selectively killed the intraerythrocytic parasite unlike dermaseptin S4 that was toxic to both the parasite and its host cell. Investigation of the molecular basis for this selective cytotoxicity showed that both dermaseptin S3 and S4 were highly lipophilic as they bound with similar affinity to phosphatidylserine/phosphatidyl choline vesicles and were equally potent in permeabilizing them. However, both NMR and fluorescence methods indicated that dermaseptin S4 was in a higher aggregation state in aqueous solutions, compared with dermaseptin S3. This led to the proposal that the peptide's aggregation state in solution might be an important factor affecting selective cytotoxicity (12.Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shay Y. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed experiments designed to assess the consequences of dermaseptin S4 aggregation in solution. We prepared one set of analogs where Asp replaced Met in position 4, Asn in position 20 or both positions. In another set of analogs, the same positions were substituted with Lys. These analogs were investigated in terms of organization in solution and in terms of cytolytic potency. The results reported, support the notion that peptide aggregation in solution affects considerably cytotoxic properties. HMP-linked polyamide/Kieselguhr resin (Pepsin KA), Fmoc-amino acids, pentafluorophenyl, and 3-hydroxy-2,3-dehydro-4-oxobenzotriazine esters were from Milligen/Bioresearch. All other reagents for peptide synthesis and cell cultures were analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using mQ double-distilled water (Millipore Corp.). The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method, applying the Fmoc active ester chemistry as described (14.Mor A. Nicolas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After removal of the Fmoc from the N-terminal amino acid, the peptide was cleaved from the resin with a mixture of 85:5:5:5 trifluoroacetic acid/para-cresol/H2O/thioanisole (10 mg of resin-bound peptide in a 1-ml mixture). The trifluoroacetic acid was then evaporated, and the peptide was precipitated with ether followed by washing with ether (six times). The crude peptides were extracted from the resin with 30% acetonitrile in water and purified to chromatographic homogeneity in the range of 98 to >99% by reverse-phase HPLC (Alliance-Waters) equipped with an automatic injector, photodiode array UV detector, and Millennium integration software. HPLC runs were performed on a semipreparative C4 column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (1%/min), both solvents containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry in order to confirm their composition. Peptides were stocked as lyophilized powder at −20 °C. Prior to being tested, fresh solutions were prepared in water, vortexed, sonicated, and centrifuged and then diluted in the appropriate medium. Peptide labeling at the N-terminal amino acid with a fluorescent probe was performed by treating 10 mg of resin-bound peptide with 0.8 ml of dimethylformamide containing 20% piperidine in an Eppendorf test tube, in order to remove the Fmoc protecting group of the N-terminal amino acid of the linked peptide. The mixture was agitated for 10 min and then centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The resin-bound peptide was rinsed three times in dimethylformamide before adding a 0.3-ml solution of Lissamine rhodamine chloride (10 mg/ml) in dry dimethylformamide containing 7% (v/v) diisopropylethylamine. After a 24-h incubation (stirred in the dark at room temperature), the resin-bound peptide was washed thoroughly with dimethylformamide (three times) and diethyl ether/dichloromethane (1:1) and dried at 40 °C (4 h), and then the peptide was cleaved from the resin, precipitated with ether, extracted, and purified as described above. Human blood was rinsed three times in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) by centrifugation for 1 min at 2700 × g, and then 2.5 × 108 RBC suspended in 50 μl of PBS were added to Eppendorf test tubes containing 200 μl of peptide solutions (serial 2-fold dilutions in PBS), PBS alone (for base-line values), or distilled water (for 100% hemolysis). After incubation (3 h under agitation at 37 °C), samples were centrifuged, and the hemolytic activity was assessed as a function of hemoglobin leakage by measuring the absorbance of 200 μl of supernatant (405 nm). Statistical data were obtained from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Antibacterial activity was assessed against Escherichia coli (TG1), Yersinia kristensenii (ATCC 33639), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(ATCC 27853) cultured in 2xty medium (16 g/liter trypton, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4). Inocula of 106bacteria/ml were used. The cell populations were estimated by optical density measurements at 620 nm referred to a calibration curve. 100 μl of bacterial suspension were added to 100 μl of culture medium containing no peptide or various peptide concentrations (serial 2-fold dilutions) in 96-well plates (Nunk). Inhibition of proliferation was determined by optical density measurements (620 nm) after the incubation period (3, 16, and 16 h, respectively, for E. coli, Y. kristensenii, and P. aeruginosa) at 37 °C. Antiprotozoan activity was assessed against the promastigote form of a Leishmania major clinical isolate (provided by the parasitology laboratory of Hadassa-Hebrew University, Jerusalem). Inhibition of the proliferation assay was performed by adding 2 × 105 L. major promastigotes (100 μl) to 100 μl of culture medium (RPMI 1640 complemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin) in 96 well plates (Nunk) containing zero or various peptide concentrations (serial 2-fold dilutions). After the incubation period (3 h, 27 °C), the number of cells was determined by counting an aliquot from each culture on a Neubauer cell counter under a microscope (Olympus IX70). Reversibility of inhibition was determined by washing the samples (three centrifugation cycles, 15 min each, at 10,000 ×g for bacteria and 5,000 × g forLeishmania), resuspending the pellets, and de novo incubation overnight in peptide-free fresh medium. To assess peptide binding, the supernatants of preparations used for the bioassays were analyzed in HPLC basically as described (12.Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shay Y. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with the following variation. Cells were added to Eppendorf tubes containing various peptide concentrations in the appropriate culture medium (total volume of 250 μl). After the incubation period, samples were centrifuged, and 100 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC as detailed above. Peptide identification was based on retention time and spectral analysis. The amount of peptide present in the supernatant (free peptide) was calculated using standard curves of known concentrations for each peptide. Alternatively, binding of the rhodaminated peptides was assessed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant (excitation, 535 nm; emission, 590 nm) compared with standard calibration curves using a Spectrafluor Plus microplate reader (TECAN, Austria). The data were processed with the DeltaSoft 3analysis program (Princeton University). The aggregational properties of dermaseptins s4 and analogs in aqueous solution were determined using rhodaminated peptides as described (12.Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shay Y. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of free rhodamine or rhodaminated peptide stock solutions (1 mg/ml in Me2SO) were successively added to 1 ml of PBS, and the fluorescence was recorded (excitation, 559 nm; emission, 583 nm) on a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter. Disruption of the self-quenched fluorescence of the polymers was obtained by measuring the fluorescence 120 min after the addition of 1 unit of proteinase K (Sigma) to a 0.35 μm concentration of each peptide. Alternatively, the rhodaminated peptides were titrated in PBS onto 96-well plates (final volume, 200 μl), starting from stock solutions in Me2SO. Fluorescence (excitation, 535 nm; emission, 590 nm) was measured using a Spectrafluor Plus apparatus (TECAN). Confocal microscope imaging of samples treated with rhodaminated dermaseptins was performed on nonfixed cells, using an MRC 1024 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). The microscope (Axiovert 135M; Zeiss, Germany) is equipped with a × 63 objective (Apoplan; NA 1.4). For rhodamine excitation, an argon ion laser adjusted at 514 nm (emission, 580 df 32 nm) was used. Zseries were carried out using 0.18-μm steps between each focal plane. The peptide hydropathic index was calculated according to Kyte-Doolittle scale (23.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), making use of a hydrophobic scale containing hydrophobicity parameters for all 20 amino acids. The scale represents the estimated free energy of transfer of amino acids from an aqueous environment to a hydrophobic environment. It was extracted from experimental solubility measurements of amino acids in ethanol. Toward better understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the selective cytotoxicity of peptide-based antibiotics, we used a three-step strategy in which three generations of dermaseptin S4 analogs (substituted, deleted, and combined substituted-deleted analogs) were progressively designed and tested (the peptides and their designations are listed in Table I). The resulting data are reported separately for each generation of analogs.Table IStructural and biological properties of dermaseptin S4 and analogsPeptideAmino acid sequenceChargeHIaHydropathic index, using the Kyte-Doolittle scale (23).IC50bPeptide concentration causing 50% growth inhibition of E. coli (mean ± S.D.).LC50cPeptide concentration causing 50% lysis of RBC (mean ± S.D.).RSIdRelative selectivity index, the ratio of LC50/IC50 of a given analog relative to that of dermaseptin S4.μmμmS4ALWMTLLKKVLKAAAKAALNAVLVGANA428.940 ± 51.4 ± 0.21D20-S4——————-D——–328.975 ± 61.2 ± 0.10.5D4-S4—D————————323.569 ± 112.3 ± 0.31D4D20-S4—D—————D——–223.5805 ± 11.5K20-S4——————-K——–528.543 ± 81.2 ± 0.40.8K4-S4—K————————523.11 ± 0.52 ± 0.157K4K20-S4—K—————K——–622.70.3 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.148S4-(1–20)——————–415.29 ± 15 ± 116S4-(1–16)—————-411.320 ± 123 ± 133S4-(1–12)————39.853 ± 0.510054S4-(5–16)————44.7>80>8029S4-(5–28)————————422.33.5 ± 0.516.5 ± 0.5135S4-(9–28)——————–319.3>8024 ± 1<9S4-(13–28)—————-119.1>8040<14K4-S4-(1–16)—K————55.52.5 ± 0.557 ± 3651K4-S4-(1–16)a—K————NH265.50.43 ± 0.110 ± 0.5664K4-S4-(1–15)a—K———–NH259.40.38 ± 0.120 ± 11503K4-S4-(1–13)a—K———NH255.81.35 ± 0.157 ± 31206K4-S4-(1–10)a—K——NH244.140 ± 1>100>71a Hydropathic index, using the Kyte-Doolittle scale (23.Kyte J.

Open table in a new tab This step involved investigation of dermaseptin S4 and six substitution analogs designed to assess the effect of charge on cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was assessed against 2 groups of cells selected on the basis of accessibility to their plasma membrane,i.e. cells that allow access (RBC and L. major) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Y. kristensenii and P. aeruginosa) whose plasma membrane is protected by a complex physical barrier of external membranes. Concomitantly, we investigated the peptides organization in solution, using the same peptides labeled selectively at their N-terminal amino acid with rhodamine. Incubation of erythrocytes for 3 h in the presence of dermaseptin S4 resulted in massive hemoglobin release corresponding to 50% cell lysis at a peptide concentration of approximately 1 μm (Fig. 1) and 100% RBC lysis at 3 μm (Fig. 5, lower panel). Negative or positive charge monosubstitutions did not affect the peptide's hemolytic potency. Disubstitutions, on the other hand, had a noticeable effect. Thus, negative charges resulted in reduced hemolytic potency (D4D20-S4 was 4–5-fold less hemolytic), and positive charges resulted in increased hemolytic potency (K4K20-S4 was 2-fold more hemolytic).Figure 5Dose-response profiles for growth inhibition of E. coli (upper panel) and hemolytic activity (lower panel) of dermaseptin S4 and the first generation analogs after a 3-h exposure in culture medium at 37 °C.

Thus, dermaseptin S4 was potent in inducing lysis ofL. major promastigotes (LC50 2 μm), D4D20-S4 was 5-fold less potent, and K4K20-S4 was 2-fold more potent than the native peptide. Monosubstitutions, positive or negative charges, did not dramatically affect the antileishmanial activity. Contrary to the hemolytic activity, dermaseptin S4 was revealed to be a weak inhibitor of growth of E. coli, barely achieving 50% inhibition at 40 μm. Negative charge mono- or disubstitutions further weakened the peptide's antibacterial activity. Interestingly, however, some positive charge substituted peptides displayed potent antibacterial activity. Thus, K4-S4 and K4K20-S4 were 40- and 100-fold more potent, respectively, than the native peptide. K20-S4 on the other hand, was as active as dermaseptin S4 (Fig. 1). All remaining peptides were not able to produce 100% bacterial killing up to 100 μm (not shown). The results of the proteolytic experiments are shown in Fig.2. The black columns represent the fluorescence at 583 nm (characteristic of rhodamine emission peak) of the rhodaminated peptides (0.35 μm) in solution, before proteolytic cleavage. At equal concentrations, the rhodaminated peptides displayed clear differences in their fluorescence intensity, especially when compared with Rho(K4K20)S4. The addition of proteinase K caused dequenching of fluorescence (white columns), indicating that the peptides were aggregated to various extents. As expected, when the peptides were cleaved by proteinase K, they exhibited very similar levels of fluorescence. In addition, Fig. 3 A depicts a typical result of the fluorescence plot versus the concentration of rhodaminated peptides. The linear nature of the Rho(K4K20)S4 and Rho(K4)S4 plots, at least up to low μm concentrations, suggests that these peptides do not change their state in this concentration range.Figure 3Dose-response relationships.

The aggregational state of dermaseptin S4 was not reduced by negative charge substitutions. In contrast, positive charge monosubstitution in position 4, but not in position 20, reduced the peptide's aggregation state. Peptide aggregation was further reduced in disubstituted K4K20-S4. To verify whether rhodamination affected the peptides cytotoxic properties, the rhodaminated versions of S4, K20-S4, and K4K20-S4 were examined in parallel to the nonlabeled versions. No significant difference was observed in their antiprotozoan or hemolytic potency as previously observed (7.Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10.Strahilevitz J. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y.

Interestingly, the order of aggregation states displayed by the rhodaminated peptides correlated nicely with antibacterial potency of dermaseptin S4 and its analogs (Fig. 3 B). Whereas all aggregated analogs (D4-S4, D20-S4, D4D20-S4, and K20-S4) were weakly active against E. coli, the least aggregated peptide (K4K20-S4) was the most active. K4-S4 displayed an intermediate behavior. Moreover, the same correlation was found using other Gram-negative bacteria such asY. kristensenii and P. aeruginosa (Fig. 3,C and D, respectively). These results suggested furthermore that K4K20-S4 too might aggregate at high concentrations. To verify that possibility and assess its implications, the cytotoxicity of K4K20-S4 was investigated at some 100-fold higher concentration (stock solution of 1 mm). At 200 μm, K4K20-S4 was revealed to be devoid of activity against E. coli (Fig.4 A). Gradual recovery of activity could be obtained by performing serial 2-fold dilutions in the culture medium. Activity was fully recovered at around 10–20 μm, and the low peptide concentrations were less potent (IC50 was increased 2–3-fold compared with stock solutions of 10 μm). Similar behavior (reduced potency at high peptide concentrations followed by recovery after dilution) was observed with other Gram-negative bacteria (Y. kristenseniiand P. aeruginosa) where, at the highest concentration tested (150 μm), the peptide lost close to 50% of its potency against either bacteria (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). Contrasting with the antibacterial results, the antiprotozoan activity and the hemolytic activity of K4K20-S4 were not reduced at high peptide concentrations (Fig. 4, D and E, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2158045853,"TFIIH is a multisubunit protein complex involved in RNA polymerase II transcription and nucleotide excision repair, which removes a wide variety of DNA lesions including UV-induced photoproducts. Mutations in the DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits of TFIIH, XPB and XPD, are associated with three inherited syndromes as follows: xeroderma pigmentosum with or without Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. By using epitope-tagged XPD we purified mammalian TFIIH carrying a wild type or an active-site mutant XPD subunit. Contrary to XPB, XPD helicase activity was dispensable for in vitro transcription, catalytic formation of trinucleotide transcripts, and promoter opening. Moreover, in contrast to XPB, microinjection of mutant XPD cDNA did not interfere with in vivo transcription. These data show directly that XPD activity is not required for transcription. However, during DNA repair, neither 5′ nor 3′ incisions in defined positions around a DNA adduct were detected in the presence of TFIIH containing inactive XPD, although substantial damage-dependent DNA synthesis was induced by the presence of mutant XPD both in cells and cell extracts. The aberrant damage-dependent DNA synthesis caused by the mutant XPD does not lead to effective repair, consistent with the discrepancy between repair synthesis and survival in cells from a number of XP-D patients.

A wide variety of DNA lesions, including UV-induced photoproducts and bulky chemical adducts, can be removed by this multienzyme system. After recognition of a damaged site, a region around the lesion is locally unwound, and two incisions flanking the lesion are made on the damaged strand. The subsequent removal of the damaged oligonucleotide is succeeded by gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation to restore the original DNA sequence (1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W.

The XPC-hHR23B complex, which binds with high affinity to DNA damage and represents the primary damage recognition factor (6.Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M.

This provides a substrate for the structure-specific endonucleases ERCC1-XPF and XPG, which incise the damaged strand asymmetrically on the 5′ and 3′ sides, respectively. In addition to its role in NER, TFIIH is one of five basal transcription factors required for accurate initiation of transcription of protein coding genes by RNA polymerase II (Refs. 9.Gerard M.

In the initiation reaction, TFIIH is required for the ATP-dependent formation of melted regions around the transcription start site (12.Holstege F.C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This requirement is alleviated by a pre-melted promoter region (12.Holstege F.C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M.

TFIIH consists of nine subunits for which all genes have been cloned (16.Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina Gomez D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M.

Several enzymatic activities have been identified for TFIIH and attributed to individual subunits; both of the largest two components, XPB and XPD, are DNA-dependent ATPases and DNA helicases (18.Schaeffer L.

Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), whereas CDK7 is a protein kinase that is capable of phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (21.Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.-P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Non-lethal defects in the two helicase subunits, XPB and XPD, give rise to the inherited disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome (CS) combined with XP, or trichothiodystrophy (TTD) (22.Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 30: 1912-1921Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Some of the clinical features of these syndromes, such as UV sensitivity and predisposition to skin cancer (characteristic for XP), may be due to defective functioning of TFIIH in NER, whereas other symptoms, such as severe growth retardation, neurodysmyelination (XP/CS and TTD), and brittle hair (TTD), may be caused by a subtle defect in the transcriptional activity of TFIIH (see Refs. 23.Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J.

Mutations in the XPD gene frequently result in an unaccounted for property in which XP-D cell lines have relatively high levels of damage-dependent DNA synthesis which does not generally correlate with residual repair activity and UV sensitivity (25.Johnson R.T. Squires S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Paterson M.C. Middlestadt M.V. MacFarlane S.J. Gentner N.E. Weinfeld M. Eker A.P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 6 (suppl.): 161-176Crossref Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the biochemical defects associated with mutations in TFIIH, we examined the contribution of the XPD-associated enzymatic activities to TFIIH function. An XPD mutant was used with a defined single amino acid change in the Walker type A nucleotide-binding motif (consensus GXGKT), lysine to arginine at position 48 (K48R), which preserves the positive charge. Biochemical analysis of the corresponding mutation in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of XPD, Rad3p, has demonstrated that this mutation dramatically impairs ATP hydrolysis, although the protein retains the ability to bind ATP (27.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying the same mutation are viable but UV-sensitive (27.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 28.Sung P. Guzder S.N. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10821-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the effect of an active-site XPD mutant on mammalian TFIIH function. We provide direct evidence that XPD helicase activity is dispensable for basal transcription. In contrast, we show that XPD helicase activity is required for the formation of both the 5′ and 3′ incision around a site of DNA damage. The mutation in the nucleotide binding domain encoded by the XPD cDNA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide p142 5′-TCAGGCACCGGGCGAACAGTATCCCTG-3′. The desired mutation was verified by sequence analysis, and XPD wild type and mutant cDNAs were cloned as EcoRI fragments into eukaryotic expression vector pSVL, a modified pSVM vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), yielding plasmids pM52 and pM124, and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), yielding plasmids pM264 and pM265. The C-terminal HA epitope tag was added by PCR using primers p117 5′-GCCGAAACCAGTGTCGCCCT-3′ (5′ primer) and p240 5′-AGGAATTCTCAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATCCGAGCTGCTGAGCAATCTGCTC-3′ (3′ primer). PCR products were cloned intoSacII-EcoRI sites of pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced to ensure the absence of any PCR-generated errors. Eukaryotic expression vectors containing cDNA encoding wild type and K48R mutant HA-tagged XPD were generated by ligation of theEcoRI-ScaI and theScaI-EcoRI cDNA fragments into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3, yielding plasmids pM435 and pM436. Cell lines UV435.12 and UV436.1 expressing wild type and K48R mutant HA-tagged XPD cDNA, respectively, were generated by transfection of CHO UV5 cells with plasmids pM435 and pM436 using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as suggested by the manufacturer. After selection with G418 (0.75 mg/ml), independent clones were isolated and tested for expression by immunoblotting of cell lysates using anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from 3 liters of suspension culture of either cell line (29.Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a heparin-Ultrogel column (IBF, France) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.1 mKCl and step-eluted in buffer A containing 0.1, 0.22, 0.4, and 1.0m KCl. The 0.4 m KCl fraction containing all of the TFIIH was incubated for 16 h with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 250 μg of monoclonal antibody 12CA5, essentially as described before (30.Winkler G.S.

The resin was recovered by centrifugation (3 min, 1000 rpm) and washed 3 times in buffer T (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 17% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.4 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and twice in buffer T containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Bound TFIIH was eluted from the resin in two washes with the latter buffer supplemented with 2.0 mg/ml HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) for 1 h at 30 °C. TFIIH was dialyzed to remove the peptide in buffer T containing 0.05 m KCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 for enzymatic and NER analysis or buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 17% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 m KCl; BSA was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) for transcriptional analysis and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. During purification, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C, except where noted otherwise. Purified TFIIH was analyzed for ATPase, CTD kinase, and DNA helicase activities as described before (30.Winkler G.S. Vermeulen W. Coin F. Egly J.-M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weeda G. J. Biol.

Analysis of transcription activity was carried out with highly purified or homogeneous preparations of recombinant human TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and affinity-purified RNA polymerase II from calf thymus as detailed before (12.Holstege F.C.P.

Reactions (20 μl volume) contained 12 ng of TBP, 50 ng of TFIIB, 80 ng of TFIIF, 30 ng of RNA polymerase II, 75 ng of TFIIE, and TFIIH as indicated and contained 12 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm DTT, and 120 μg/ml BSA. Standard transcription reactions contained 100 ng of linearized pΔML (200) template (14.Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) containing the adenovirus major late promoter, 60 μm ATP, 60 μm UTP, 10 μm[α-32P]CTP (80 Ci/mmol), and 120 μm3′-OMeGTP, as described (15.Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For analysis of tri- and 15-nucleotide RNA product formation, 5 ng of AdML + 3G or AdML + 15G template DNA (372-base pair PvuII fragment), respectively, were used (31.Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 24: 7468-7480Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Partial non-template DNA sequences (underlined are the natural transcription start site and the first G residue) are as follows: AdML + 3G, 5′-CCTCACGCTCTTCCTCTAGAGTC-3′, and AdML + 15G, 5′-CCTCACTCTCTTCCTCTAGAGTC-3′. After preincubation in the above described reaction mixture for 45 min at 30 °C, nucleotides were added (60 μm ATP, 3 μm [α-32P]CTP (267 Ci/mmol), 10 μm UTP, 120 μm 3′-OMeGTP, and reactions were incubated for the indicated time. Reactions were analyzed as described by 20% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 19:1), 8.3 m urea gel electrophoresis, after inactivation of RNA polymerase II by heating for 3 min at 68 °C and alkaline phosphatase treatment (31.Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 24: 7468-7480Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For the KMnO4 analysis of open complex formation, radiolabeled probe (0.2–0.4 ng ofEcoRI-HindIII AdML + 15G fragment, labeled at the non-template strand (12.Holstege F.C.P. Van der Vliet P.C.

After this preincubation, nucleotides (60 μm ATP, 10 μm CTP, 10 μm UTP, and 120 μm 3′-OMeGTP) were added and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Two μl of a freshly prepared 160 mmKMnO4 was added for 20 s after which reactions were stopped by addition of 2 μl of 14.4 mβ-mercaptoethanol. DNA was cleaved at modified residues by piperidine and analyzed on 7% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 19:1), 8.3 m urea gel electrophoresis as described (12.Holstege F.C.P.

Reactions contained plasmid randomly damaged withN-acetyl-AAF and an equal amount of undamaged control plasmid with a different size, the indicated amounts of extracts and purified protein, and labeled nucleotides as described before (32.Wood R.D.

After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, DNA was isolated, linearized, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Covalently closed circular DNA containing a single 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG)-cisplatin cross-link (Pt-GTG) was produced as described (5.Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Repair was carried out in 8.5-μl reaction mixtures for the fully defined reconstituted reactions or in 10-μl reaction mixtures for the cell extract complementation. Repair reactions were carried out in buffer containing 45 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 μg BSA, and 2 mm ATP. Complementation reactions were supplemented with 40 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt) and 0.5 μg of creatine kinase. Each reconstituted reaction contained 50 ng of RPA, 45 ng of XPA, 10 ng of XPC-hHR23B complex, 50 ng of XPG, 20 ng of ERCC1-XPF complex, and either 1.5 μl of HeLa TFIIH Heparin fraction IV (34.Marinoni J.C. Rossignol M.E. Egly J.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or 1.5 and 3 μl TFIIH containing wild type or K48R mutant XPD subunit. Following preincubation for 10 min at 30 °C, 50 ng of Pt-GTG was added, and reactions were continued for 90 min at 30 °C (5 and 30 min, respectively, for complementation reactions). Reactions were stopped by rapid freezing. Six ng of an oligonucleotide was added, complementary to the excised DNA fragment and with 4 extra G residues at the 5′ end. The excision products were radiolabeled with 0.1 units of Sequenase version 2.0 polymerase and 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, separated on a 14% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, and visualized by autoradiography as described (35.Shivji M.K.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Henderson D.S. DNA Repair Protocols: Eukaryotic Systems. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). For the detection of 3′ and 5′ incisions, the (Pt-GTG) plasmid was digested with AvaII at 140 base pairs 3′ from the lesion, radiolabeled at the 3′ end using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and [α-32P]dTTP, and purified over a G-50 Sephadex column. Repair reactions were performed as in the dual incision assay, and DNA products were analyzed by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (7.Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Microinjection of cDNA expression plasmids in nuclei of XP-D primary fibroblasts (XP1BR and XP6BE) as well as control cells (C5RO) was performed as described previously (36.Vermeulen W. Scott R.J. Potger S. Muller H.J. Cole J. Arlett C.F. Kleijer W.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weeda G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at least 3 days prior to injection cells were fused with inactivated Sendai virus and seeded onto coverslips. After nuclear injection of cDNA constructs, cells were incubated in normal culture medium for 24 h to allow expression of the injected DNA molecules. Subsequently, UDS was determined after UV-C irradiation (15 J/m2), incubation for 2 h in [3H]thymidine-containing culture medium, fixation, and in situ autoradiography. Grains above nuclei were counted. RNA synthesis was determined by counting autoradiographic grains above the nuclei of injected cells, after labeling with [3H]uridine during a pulse-labeling period of 1 h in normal culture medium. Transfections of CHO UV5 (37.Weber C.A. Kirchner J.M. Salazar E.P. Takayama K. Mutat. Res. 1994; 324: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and human HD2 (38.Johnson R.T. Squires S. Elliott G.C. Koch G.L.E. Rainbow A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 76: 115-133PubMed Google Scholar) cells with plasmids pM265 and pM266 were performed using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as described by the manufacturer. After selection with G418 (0.75 mg/ml for CHO cells; 0.3 mg/ml for HD2 cells), single clones were isolated and selected for expression of wild type and mutant XPD by immunoblot analysis. UV survival was assayed using [3H]thymidine incorporation (39.Sijbers A.M. Van der Spek P.J. Odijk H. Van den Berg J. Van Duin M. Westerveld A. Jaspers N.G.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Briefly, 3 days after irradiation with UV, proliferating cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (4 h), followed by a chase (2 h). Cells were washed and lysed in 0.05n NaOH. Quantification of the [3H]thymidine incorporation by liquid scintillation counting provides a measure of cell viability. For analysis of unscheduled DNA synthesis, cells were plated onto glass coverslips. After 24 h, cells were irradiated, pulse-labeled in [3H]thymidine-containing culture medium for 2 h, fixed, and subjected to in situautoradiography (36.Vermeulen W. Scott R.J. Potger S. Muller H.J.

To investigate the role of ATP hydrolysis by the XPD helicase subunit of TFIIH during NER and transcription initiation, we isolated TFIIH complexes containing wild type and mutant XPD protein. A cDNA encoding wild type XPD containing a C-terminal HA epitope tag and a cDNA encoding a similarly HA-tagged K48R mutant protein were generated. In the mutant, the highly conserved lysine residue in the Walker type A nucleotide binding motif was replaced by the similarly charged arginine (GKT → GRT, see Fig.1 A). UV-sensitive, NER-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells from complementation group 2 (UV5), carrying a mutation in the XPD gene, were transfected with cDNA encoding wild type and K48R protein, respectively, and independent clones stably expressing HA-tagged XPD were isolated. By using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from two selected clones expressing wild type and mutant HA-tagged XPD, respectively, shows a specific band at the expected molecular mass of XPD (Fig. 1 B). The protein level of the wild type and K48R mutant appeared comparable. The ability of HA-tagged XPD to correct the defective repair of UV5 cells was assessed by determining the UV survival of the transfected cells. The results presented in Fig. 1 C show that a cDNA encoding HA-tagged XPD is able to confer UV resistance to UV5 cells close to the level of untagged XPD cDNA and in the range of the parental repair-proficient cell line AA8. This indicates that addition of the HA epitope tag does not negatively influence the function of the XPD protein in NER. To obtain highly purified wild type and K48R XPD complexes from whole-cell extracts (WCE), a fast and efficient two-step purification protocol was employed, previously developed for the purification of HA-tagged XPB containing TFIIH. This protocol consists of chromatography on heparin-Ultrogel and anti-HA immunosorption followed by peptide elution (30.Winkler G.S. Vermeulen W. Coin F. Egly J.-M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weeda G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Isolated complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with silver nitrate (Fig. 1 D). In addition to XPD, proteins with molecular masses ranging from 32 to 90 kDa were identified corresponding to all nine known TFIIH subunits as is indicated in the figure (Fig.1 D). As expected, the bands corresponding to XPD and the three CAK components (CDK7, Cyclin H, and MAT-1) were more prominent as compared with the other TFIIH subunits. This is in agreement with the finding that XPD resides in two complexes, TFIIH and XPD-CAK (40.Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We were not able to separate efficiently XPD-CAK and TFIIH by subsequent chromatography as their purification properties are very similar. However, since the staining patterns of the wild type and K48R mutant fractions were almost identical, the activities of the HA fractions could be directly compared. Several enzymatic activities are associated with TFIIH (41.Roy R. Schaeffer L. Humbert S. Vermeulen W. Weeda G. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9826-9832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17300-17308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig.2, A and D, and data from similar experiments showed that the ATPase activity of the K48R complex is reduced to about half of the wild type level. The residual activity is most likely derived only from the second DNA-dependent ATPase subunit of TFIIH, XPB. The reduction we observe is similar to that seen using recombinant TFIIH lacking the XPD subunit (47.Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.-M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both the XPD and XPB subunits contribute significantly to the ATPase activity of TFIIH. The DNA helicase activities were compared using a radiolabeled 24-mer oligonucleotide annealed to single-stranded M13 DNA. This substrate design allows measurement of DNA helicase activity independent of helicase polarity. As shown in Fig. 2, B and D, wild type XPD complex is able to release annealed oligonucleotide from the M13 DNA. However, within the limits of detection, the mutant K48R XPD complex added in the same quantity appears to be completely deficient in the ability to release the labeled oligonucleotide. This result indicates that the XPD DNA helicase is absolutely required for the DNA-unwinding activity of TFIIH measured in this assay, irrespective of DNA polarity. The fact that both the TFIIH-associated ATPase and DNA helicase activities are severely affected is consistent with the notion that the introduced point mutation in the nucleotide binding motif of XPD abolishes its associated enzymatic activities. Finally, we characterized the kinase activity that is able to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, RPB1. Equal amounts of both wild type and K48R XPD complexes were incubated with a synthetic tetra-repeat heptapeptide corresponding to the conserved repeat of RPB1 in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. The CTD peptide was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner with similar efficiency by both wild type and K48R XPD complexes (Fig. 2, C andE). To investigate whether the K48R effect on ATPase and helicase activity has consequences for the function of TFIIH in basal transcription, we tested both wild type and mutant XPD fractions in RNA polymerase II-mediated in vitro transcription assays. Wild type and K48R XPD complexes were incubated in the presence of homogenous recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and highly purified RNA polymerase II, linearized DNA template containing the adenovirus major late promoter, and ribonucleotides. Interestingly, correctly initiated transcripts were produced in the presence of either wild type and K48R XPD complex (Fig.3 A). This was specifically due to TFIIH activity in both wild type and K48R mutant preparations sin"

We have developed a cytosol-dependent in vitro assay utilizing adenovirus nucleocapsids to examine the requirements for adenovirus docking to the nuclear pore complex and for DNA import into the nucleus. Our assay reveals that adenovirus DNA import is blocked by a competitive excess of classical protein nuclear localization sequences and other inhibitors of nuclear protein import and indicates that this process is dependent on hsc70. Previous work revealed that the hexon (coat) protein of adenovirus is the only major protein on the surface of the adenovirus nucleocapsid that docks at the nuclear pore complex. This, together with our finding that in vitro nuclear import of hexon is inhibited by an excess of classical nuclear localization sequences, suggests a role for the hexon protein in adenovirus DNA import. However, recombinant transport factors that are sufficient for hexon import in permeabilized cells do not support DNA import, indicating that there are other as yet unidentified factors required for this process.

The classical signals that specify nuclear protein import (nuclear localization sequences (NLSs)) are short stretches of amino acids rich in basic residues, although other classes of NLSs have been described recently (1.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2.Standiford D.M. Richter J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transport of NLS-bearing proteins into the nucleus requires the participation of soluble cytosolic factors (3.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The advent of a cytosol-dependent in vitro assay for nuclear import (3.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) has led to the identification of a number of these factors (4.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), namely importin-α (also called the NLS receptor and karyopherin-α), importin-β (also called p97 and karyopherin-β), Ran (TC4), and NTF2 (also called p10 and pp15). An initial step in the import of proteins containing classical NLSs occurs in the cytoplasm, where the substrate binds to the receptor importin-α. Subsequently, this complex docks at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC together with importin-β. The complex is then translocated through a central gated channel of the NPC into the nuclear interior. Movement of the import complex through the NPC requires Ran and NTF2 (5.Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 6.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 7.Paschal B.M. Delphin C.

Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the precise role of these components is unclear. An additional protein, hsp/hsc70, has been shown to be required for import of some substrates (e.g. the large T-antigen protein (9.Shi Y. Thomas J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)), but not of others (e.g. the glucocorticoid receptor (10.Yang J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5088-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)).Most viruses that replicate in the nucleus must use the NPC to introduce their genome into the nucleoplasm. Although it is known that the gated channel of the NPC can expand up to ∼25 nm in diameter to allow signal-mediated transport (11.Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), this is still considerably smaller than the diameters of many viruses known to replicate in the nucleus. For example, the diameters of SV40, adenovirus, and herpesvirus are 45–50, 60–90, and 120–200 nm, respectively. Enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza manage to circumvent the physical barrier of the NPC by releasing the genome from their large capsids during entry into the cytoplasm. The genome is subsequently transported through the NPC as a flexible protein-nucleic acid complex that appears to utilize a classical NLS-mediated pathway (12.O'Neill R.E. Jaskunas R. Blobel G. Palese P. Moroianu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22701-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13.Gallay P. Stitt V. Mundy C. Oettinger M. Trono D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most non-enveloped viruses must undergo restructuring for the import of their genomes into the nucleus. Both the DNA and associated capsid proteins of SV40 are transported into the nucleus after infection of cells, but the structural state of the nucleocapsid during import has not yet been characterized (14.Yamada M. Kasamatsu H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 119-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the DNA viruses such as adenovirus, baculovirus, and hepadnavirus all appear to only partially uncoat at various stages of entry into the host cell (15.Waris M. Halonen P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 397: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16.Shenk T. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 979-1016Google Scholar). In the case of adenovirus, the early events of infection such as cell attachment and internalization have been partially defined (17.Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar, 18.Wickham T.J. Mathius P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), but little is known about the transport of adenovirus DNA into the nucleus. As adenovirus is a strong candidate for gene therapy applications (21.Robbins P.D. Tahara H. Ghivizzani S.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), it is important to obtain a detailed understanding of the interactions between this virus and the host cell.Adenovirus is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus containing 11–15 different virus-encoded polypeptides and a linear genome of ∼36 kilobase pairs (22.Stewart P.L. Fuller S.D. Burnett R.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The total mass of the nucleocapsid is estimated to be 150 MDa (22.Stewart P.L. Fuller S.D. Burnett R.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The major capsid protein is the hexon coat protein. The capsid contains 240 hexon trimers, which form an icosahedron with 12 vertices and 20 facets. At the vertices are the fiber proteins, which contain a primary cell-surface attachment site (17.Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Anchoring each fiber to the capsid is the penton protein, which contains a secondary binding site whose recognition is a precursor to internalization (18.Wickham T.J. Mathius P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 19.Wickham T.J. Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Stabilizing the capsid are several other minor proteins that either associate with hexons alone (proteins VI, VIII, and IX) or strengthen the association between hexon and penton proteins (proteins IIIa and IX). The DNA is condensed with proteins V, VII, and μ and the covalently attached terminal protein, which together form the viral core.The adenovirus capsid is a very stable structure that protects the viral genome against harsh environmental conditions. The virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated internalization in coated pits, where the combination of the energy of binding and the acidic environment of the early endosome is thought to cause a series of cooperative structural changes in the capsid (20.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). These structural changes appear to facilitate fusion with the endosomal membrane and penetration into the cytoplasm (23.Patterson S. Oxford J.S. Vaccine. 1986; 4: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as well as potentiate the loss of certain capsid proteins. By the time it is delivered to the cytoplasm, the virus loses the fiber penton, peripentonal hexon proteins, and the capsid-stabilizing proteins (proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX) (20.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The nucleocapsid resulting from these rearrangements docks with the NPC, where it appears to undergo further disassembly, allowing its DNA to enter the nuclear interior (20.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Because cellular nucleoprotein particles (e.g. messenger ribonucleoproteins) can be transported through the NPC by the machinery that mediates protein transport (4.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), adenovirus similarly might exploit the cellular nuclear protein import machinery for the import of its DNA into the nuclei of infected cells.Here we use a digitonin-permeabilized cell assay to analyze the interaction of nucleocapsid derived from adenovirus type 2 with the NPC and the transport of viral DNA into the nucleus. Our results indicate that adenovirus DNA import utilizes components of the classical protein import machinery and hsp/hsc70. Furthermore, our findings, in conjunction with previous work, indicate that the major capsid protein (hexon) has an important role in viral DNA import. Since recombinant factors for classical NLS-mediated import are insufficient to support adenovirus DNA import, additional components appear to be involved. We discuss the possibility that these are involved in nucleocapsid uncoating at the NPC.DISCUSSIONHere we describe an assay for the import of adenovirus DNA into the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells. In this assay, a large amount of nucleocapsid becomes associated with the NPC within 30 min, as documented by both immunofluorescence staining and thin-section electron microscopy. A significant amount of viral DNA is subsequently imported into the nucleus by 45–60 min, as monitored by in situ hybridization. We have used this assay to define the requirements for adenovirus DNA import and to begin a mechanistic analysis of this process. As discussed in detail below, our experiments indicate that the docking of adenovirus to the NPC is a prerequisite for DNA import and that docking (and possibly subsequent steps) involves the hexon protein and components of the machinery for nuclear import of proteins containing basic amino acid-type NLSs. Although we could reconstitute adenovirus DNA import in vitro with cytosol and demonstrated a requirement for hsp/hsc70, the four classical nuclear protein import factors together with hsc70 are insufficient to reconstitute viral DNA import in permeabilized cells.Our results showing that WGA blocks the docking of adenovirus at the NPC and the internalization of viral DNA are consistent with the effects of WGA in vivo (29.Greber U.F. Suomalainen M. Stidwill R.P. Boucke K. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our electron microscopic data showing that nucleocapsids dock directly at the NPC prior to the appearance of adenovirus DNA in the nucleus closely resemble electron microscopic observations made for in vivoadenovirus infection (34.Dales S. Chardonnet Y. Virology. 1973; 56: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35.Puvion-Dutilleul F. Puvion E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 22-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36.Cepko C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1982; 31: 407-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, our assay reflects some of the basic features of adenovirus DNA import that have been described previously with in vivo studies and is likely to be physiologically relevant.Nucleocapsid docking at the NPC appears to be a necessary precondition for DNA import since blocking the association of nucleocapsid with the nuclear envelope in vitro either with WGA or with an excess of a protein conjugate containing a classical NLS also inhibits the import of viral DNA into the nucleus. Further support for nucleocapsid docking at the NPC as a requirement for DNA import is the finding that the kinetics of DNA import in vitro (this study) andin vivo (29.Greber U.F. Suomalainen M. Stidwill R.P. Boucke K. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) are significantly slower than the kinetics of nucleocapsid binding at the NPC. This conclusion is also supported by immunofluorescence localization experiments involving cells infected with adenovirus that suggest that the DNA-associated protein VII (and presumably the associated DNA) is released from the capsid only after the nucleocapsid docks at the nuclear envelope (29.Greber U.F. Suomalainen M. Stidwill R.P. Boucke K. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).A variety of data suggest that the hexon coat protein is the principal targeting determinant for adenovirus binding to the nuclear envelope.A priori, the fact that the hexon has karyophilic properties, as shown in our in vitro studies, and is the major protein on the surface of the viral capsid both in our in vitro assay and in vivo (22.Stewart P.L. Fuller S.D. Burnett R.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) implicates it as the principal agent responsible for docking to the NPC. Further evidence for this is the fact that excess basic amino acid-type NLSs competitively inhibit the import of purified hexon protein as well as the docking of the nucleocapsid to the NPC. It is unclear whether the role of the hexon protein is simply to dock the nucleocapsid to the NPC or to engage more distal components of the NLS-mediated import machinery for the import of the adenovirus DNA-protein complex into the nucleus. Other candidate proteins for this second function are proteins VII and V, which are associated with viral DNA in the nucleus and may be co-imported with the latter (29.Greber U.F. Suomalainen M. Stidwill R.P. Boucke K. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Although it is known that hexon trimers efficiently enter the nucleus during viral assembly (36.Cepko C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1982; 31: 407-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), an NLS on the hexon has not yet been defined. However, scrutiny of the primary structure of the hexon protein reveals several sequences that have basic amino acid-type NLS character. One is at position 279 in the amino acid sequence, and others occur at positions 567, 780, and 807. Although there are fewer basic amino acids in each of these sequences than in the prototypical NLS of the SV40 T-antigen, the amino acid sequence starting at position 279 shares at least a superficial similarity with a number of sequences known to have NLS function (for a comprehensive list, see Ref. 37.Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar). However, it must be pointed out that the hexon may not possess a linear, continuous stretch of basic amino acids that serves as an NLS. Instead, some of the sites mentioned above may combine in the folded three-dimensional structure to form an active NLS. Finally, although less likely, the hexon may altogether lack an intrinsic NLS, but could rely on specifically binding to a host cytosolic protein that does possess an NLS.Previous observations have suggested a role for hsp/hsc70 in the infective pathway of adenovirus. Immunolocalization studies in infected cells have shown that hexon protein and hsp/hsc70 associate after release from the early endosome (31.Niewiarowska J. D'Halluin J.C. Belin M.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that hsp/hsc70 may act on the nucleocapsid before docking with the NPC. One possible function of this binding could be to induce conformational changes in the nucleocapsid that expose NLSs. Consistent with this model, previous studies have shown that the hexon protein undergoes conformational changes during uncoating (16.Shenk T. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 979-1016Google Scholar). Although purified hexon is imported into the nucleus and must therefore have an easily accessible NLS, this signal may be concealed in the nucleocapsid until a conformational change involving hsp/hsc70 or some other component exposes it. It is tantalizing to speculate that the hexon in the intact adenovirus nucleocapsid has a concealed NLS to protect the latter from the host's immune system since most basic amino acid-type NLSs are charged, hydrophilic, exposed, and thus highly antigenic.A second possible function for hsc70 could be to disassemble the nucleocapsid at the NPC. Because capsid disassembly must occur before viral DNA can be imported (20.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), it may be that this step is blocked by the antibodies to hsp70. Docking with components of the NPC may catalyze the conversion of nucleocapsid to a disassembled state, and hsc70 could stabilize the disassembled state, consistent with its role as a chaperone protein (38.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Alternatively, hsp/hsc70 could actively unfold the capsid. Finally, hsc70 may act directly on components of the NPC itself, and it is their activity that is essential for the translocation of viral DNA into the nucleus. In yeast, hsp/hsc70 has been suggested to play a role in the binding of the NLS both to its receptor and on the NPC itself during protein import (39.Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our data do not allow us to precisely identify the site of hsp/hsc70 activity in the import pathway of adenovirus. It may be that hsp/hsc70 plays a role in several steps in the infective pathway of adenovirus discussed above.Permeabilized cell nuclear import assays similar to the one we describe for adenovirus have been employed in the study of two lipid enveloped viruses that replicate in the nuclei of infected cells: influenza virus (12.O'Neill R.E. Jaskunas R. Blobel G. Palese P. Moroianu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22701-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and woodchuck hepadnavirus (40.Kann M. Bischof A. Gerlich W.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A simple ribonucleoprotein complex of influenza virus, consisting of nucleoprotein and the RNA genome, is sufficient for the import of the influenza genome in vitro and for the production of infectious virus in vivo (12.O'Neill R.E. Jaskunas R. Blobel G. Palese P. Moroianu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22701-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, a complex of hepadnavirus DNA and viral polymerase is sufficient to transport the hepadnavirus genome into the nucleus in vitro (40.Kann M. Bischof A. Gerlich W.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A combination of the cytosolic factors that can reconstitute import of proteins with basic amino acid-type NLSs in permeabilized cells is also sufficient to reconstitute import of the influenza RNA in vitro (12.O'Neill R.E. Jaskunas R. Blobel G. Palese P. Moroianu J. J. Biol.

In particular, when the adenovirus nucleocapsid is introduced into a permeabilized cell nuclear transport assay, a combination of the cytosolic factors that support nuclear import of substrates with basic amino acid-type NLSs together with hsc70 is insufficient to reconstitute adenovirus DNA import, although DNA import is supported by complete cytosol. The unknown cytosolic factors required for adenovirus DNA import could be involved in nucleocapsid uncoating at the NPC and/or in translocation through the pore. It is expected that thein vitro assay reported here will permit detailed biochemical analysis of these components, which are expected to be key to adenovirus infectivity. Proteins are imported into the nucleus through aqueous channels that span the nuclear envelope called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs).1 Whereas ions and molecules less than ∼20–40 kDa can diffuse passively through the NPC, larger proteins are transported by saturable pathways that are energy- and signal-dependent. The classical signals that specify nuclear protein import (nuclear localization sequences (NLSs)) are short stretches of amino acids rich in basic residues, although other classes of NLSs have been described recently (1.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2.Standiford D.M. Richter J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transport of NLS-bearing proteins into the nucleus requires the participation of soluble cytosolic factors (3.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The advent of a cytosol-dependent in vitro assay for nuclear import (3.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) has led to the identification of a number of these factors (4.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), namely importin-α (also called the NLS receptor and karyopherin-α), importin-β (also called p97 and karyopherin-β), Ran (TC4), and NTF2 (also called p10 and pp15). An initial step in the import of proteins containing classical NLSs occurs in the cytoplasm, where the substrate binds to the receptor importin-α. Subsequently, this complex docks at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC together with importin-β. The complex is then translocated through a central gated channel of the NPC into the nuclear interior. Movement of the import complex through the NPC requires Ran and NTF2 (5.Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 6.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 7.Paschal B.M. Delphin C.

Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the precise role of these components is unclear. An additional protein, hsp/hsc70, has been shown to be required for import of some substrates (e.g. the large T-antigen protein (9.Shi Y. Thomas J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)), but not of others (e.g. the glucocorticoid receptor (10.Yang J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5088-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Most viruses that replicate in the nucleus must use the NPC to introduce their genome into the nucleoplasm. Although it is known that the gated channel of the NPC can expand up to ∼25 nm in diameter to allow signal-mediated transport (11.Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), this is still considerably smaller than the diameters of many viruses known to replicate in the nucleus. For example, the diameters of SV40, adenovirus, and herpesvirus are 45–50, 60–90, and 120–200 nm, respectively. Enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza manage to circumvent the physical barrier of the NPC by releasing the genome from their large capsids during entry into the cytoplasm. The genome is subsequently transported through the NPC as a flexible protein-nucleic acid complex that appears to utilize a classical NLS-mediated pathway (12.O'Neill R.E. Jaskunas R. Blobel G. Palese P. Moroianu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22701-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13.Gallay P. Stitt V. Mundy C. Oettinger M. Trono D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most non-enveloped viruses must undergo restructuring for the import of their genomes into the nucleus. Both the DNA and associated capsid proteins of SV40 are transported into the nucleus after infection of cells, but the structural state of the nucleocapsid during import has not yet been characterized (14.Yamada M. Kasamatsu H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 119-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the DNA viruses such as adenovirus, baculovirus, and hepadnavirus all appear to only partially uncoat at various stages of entry into the host cell (15.Waris M. Halonen P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 397: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16.Shenk T. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 979-1016Google Scholar). In the case of adenovirus, the early events of infection such as cell attachment and internalization have been partially defined (17.Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A.

Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), but little is known about the transport of adenovirus DNA into the nucleus. As adenovirus is a strong candidate for gene therapy applications (21.Robbins P.D. Tahara H. Ghivizzani S.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), it is important to obtain a detailed understanding of the interactions between this virus and the host cell. Adenovirus is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus containing 11–15 different virus-encoded polypeptides and a linear genome of ∼36 kilobase pairs (22.Stewart P.L. Fuller S.D. Burnett R.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The total mass of the nucleocapsid is estimated to be 150 MDa (22.Stewart P.L. Fuller S.D. Burnett R.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The major capsid protein is the hexon coat protein. The capsid contains 240 hexon trimers, which form an i"

Double-headed (heavy meromyosin-like) and single-headed (subfragment 1-like) fragments of mouse myosin V were expressed in Sf9 cells, and intact myosin V was purified from mouse brain. The actin-activated MgATPase of the tissue-purified myosin V, and its expressed fragments had a high V(max) and a low K(ATPase). Calcium regulated the MgATPase of intact myosin V but not of the fragments. Both the MgATPase activity and the in vitro motility were remarkably insensitive to ionic strength. Myosin V and its fragments translocated actin at very low myosin surface densities. ADP markedly inhibited the actin-activated MgATPase activity and the in vitro motility. ADP dissociated from myosin V subfragment 1 at a rate of about 11.5 s(-1) under conditions where the V(max) was 3.3 s(-1), indicating that, although not totally rate-limiting, ADP dissociation was close to the rate-limiting step. The high affinity for actin and the slow rate of ADP release helps the myosin head to remain attached to actin for a large fraction of each ATPase cycle and allows actin filaments to be moved by only a few myosin V molecules in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2022992564,"The cardiac affects of the purine nucleoside, adenosine, are well known. Adenosine increases coronary blood flow, exerts direct negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects, and exerts indirect anti-adrenergic effects. These effects of adenosine are mediated via the activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors. There is increasing evidence that caveolae play a role in the compartmentalization of receptors and second messengers in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Several reports demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors redistribute to caveolae in response to receptor occupation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that adenosine A1 receptors would translocate to caveolae in the presence of agonists. Surprisingly, in unstimulated rat cardiac ventricular myocytes, 67 ± 5% of adenosine A1receptors were isolated with caveolae. However, incubation with the adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-chlorocyclopentyladenosine induced the rapid translocation of the A1 receptors from caveolae into non-caveolae plasma membrane, an effect that was blocked by the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. An adenosine A2areceptor agonist did not alter the localization of A1receptors to caveolae. These data suggest that the translocation of A1 receptors out of caveolae and away from compartmentalized signaling molecules may explain why activation of ventricular myocyte A1 receptors are associated with few direct effects.

Adenosine increases coronary blood flow and exerts direct negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects (1.Belardinelli L. Shryock J.C. Song Y. Wang D. Srinivas M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). There is also significant evidence that adenosine reduces both reversible and irreversible myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury (2.Lasley R.D. Pelleg A. Belardinelli L. Effects of Extracellular Adenosine and ATP on Cardiomyocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1998: 133-172Google Scholar). The cardiac effects of adenosine are mediated by the activation of specific extracellular adenosine receptor subtypes, A1, A2a, and A3, located on vascular smooth muscle, coronary endothelial cells, and cardiac myocytes (1.Belardinelli L. Shryock J.C. Song Y. Wang D. Srinivas M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The adenosine A1 receptor subtype is localized primarily on cardiac myocytes (1.Belardinelli L. Shryock J.C. Song Y. Wang D. Srinivas M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The adenosine A1 receptor is a 36-kDa, seven-transmembrane domain protein localized to the sarcolemma (3.Linden J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2668-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Agonist binding induces a conformational change in the receptor, which facilitates its interaction with an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi) (3.Linden J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2668-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). With the exception of the ferret, adenosine A1 receptor occupation does not significantly alter contractility, intracellular calcium, or cAMP concentration in normal mammalian ventricular myocardium (4.Song Y. Belardinelli L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1233-C1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, A1 receptor occupation does reduce β-adrenergic receptor-induced increases in all of the above parameters. Although the anti-adrenergic effect of adenosine is well studied, evidence of other signal transduction mechanisms mediated by adenosine A1receptor occupation in ventricular myocardium is lacking. The fact that other receptors in ventricular myocytes, which presumably couple to the same Gi protein, produce direct effects (5.Brown J.H. Buxton I.L. Brunton L.L. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 532-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Minshall R.D. Nakamura F. Becker R.P. Rabito S.F. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7.Barry W.H.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1183-1190PubMed Google Scholar) raises the question of why adenosine A1 receptor activation is associated with so few effects. One explanation for the lack of direct adenosine A1 receptor effects may be the relatively low receptor density in ventricular myocardium compared with atrial tissue (9.Musser B. Morgan M.E. Leid M. Murray T.F. Linden J. Vestal R.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the receptor is inefficiently coupled to Gi proteins and second messengers. Coupling efficiency may be due, in part, to the grouping of receptors and second messengers in microdomains for rapid and selective activation or deactivation of intracellular signaling mechanisms. Caveolae are cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich plasma membrane microdomains that have been shown to serve as a scaffold for receptors and second messengers (10.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Caveolae are present in most cell types and are abundant in cardiomyocytes (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). There are several reports that G protein-coupled receptors redistribute to caveolae in response to receptor occupation (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12.Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W.

In addition, other studies have documented that specific second messenger systems, including heterotrimeric G proteins, are concentrated in caveolae (for review, see Ref. 10.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Although the role of caveolae in cardiac signal transduction has not been well studied, it has been reported that muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes localize to caveolae after agonist stimulation (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because adenosine and acetylcholine exert similar effects in ventricular myocardium (14.Linden J. Hollen C.E. Patel A. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors would promote translocation of the receptors into caveolae. Surprisingly, we found that in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, adenosine A1 receptors were associated with caveolae in unstimulated cells, whereas activation of the adenosine A1 receptors induced the receptors to translocate out of caveolae. Mouse IgGs directed against caveolin-3, clathrin, and eNOS were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit IgGs directed against the adenosine A1 receptor were supplied by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) and Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse IgG directed against the human transferrin receptor was supplied by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs were supplied by Cappel (West Chester, PA). Super Signal® chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce. The cholesterol determination kit was from Wako (Richmond, VA). [3H]Acetate (5.21 Ci/mmol) were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Adenosine receptor agonists (CCPA,1 CGS 21680) and antagonist (DPCPX) were obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Adenosine deaminase and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were obtained from Sigma. All animals in this study received humane care according to the guidelines set forth by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication 86-23, revised 1996). Ventricular myocytes were dissociated from adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) using collagenase and hyaluronidase as described previously (15.Narayan P. Valdivia H.H. Mentzer R.M. Lasley R.D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resulting cell suspension was washed twice with enzyme-free buffer, and suspended in normal HEPES buffer (1.0 mm CaCl2, pH = 7.4) to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Typically, over 70% of the cells were rod-shaped, trypan blue-excluding ventricular myocytes. Caveolae were isolated as described previously (16.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Ten to 15 μg of purified caveolae were isolated from three rat heart preparations with this method. Alkaline phosphatase was measured by the method of Engstrom (17.Engstrom L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 52: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Galactosyltransferase and NADPH-cytochromec reductase were assayed using methods adapted from Graham (18.Graham J. Higgins J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 1993; 19Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase was measured with a standard kit from Sigma. The mass of cholesterol was determined as described previously (19.Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cellular fractions were processed as described previously (16.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Three groups (n = 2–3 experiments/group) of cells were studied. To provide enough protein sample for the fractionation of cell lysates, the cardiomyocyte yield from three hearts was combined in a single experiment. All myocyte suspensions were performed in the presence of adenosine deaminase (2 units/ml) to degrade endogenous adenosine. Control myocytes were suspended at room temperature in 7 ml of HEPES buffer (∼3–4 mg of protein/ml) with periodic mixing. A second group of myocytes was incubated with the adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N 6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA, 200 nm) for 15 min. The suspension was then centrifuged (1000 × g), and the pellet was washed three times with normal HEPES buffer (10 ml). After the final wash, the myocyte pellet was processed to isolate caveolae as described above. Group 3 myocytes were initially pretreated with the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 200 nm) for 5 min prior to the addition of CCPA (200 nm). One additional experiment was performed in which myocytes were incubated with the adenosine A2a receptor agonist 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)- phenethylamino-5′-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine (CGS 21680, 100 nm) as described for CCPA. Immunogold localization of caveolin-3 (20 nm gold) and A1 receptors (5 nm gold) was performed using whole mount plasma membrane preparations as described previously (20.Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We defined the presence of caveola in ventricular myocytes by an established isolation procedure (16.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In brief, ventricular myocytes were lysed and a postnuclear supernatant generated. The postnuclear supernatants were separated into cytosol, plasma membrane, and intracellular membrane (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, etc.) fractions by centrifugation in Percoll. The plasma membranes were then sonicated and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation to isolate caveolae. Similar to other cell type studies, the caveola fraction from ventricular myocytes contained less than 0.4% of the protein found in the initial postnuclear supernatant fraction (TableI).Table ICharacterization of rat ventricular cardiomyocyte subcellular fractionsSubcellular fractionProteinGalactosyltransferaseNADPH- cytochromec reductaseμg%%Postnuclear supernatant3210 ± 123100 ± 7.0100 ± 9.3Cytosol1502 ± 638 ± 0.516 ± 7.4Intracellular membranes1463 ± 8691 ± 8.282 ± 9.6Plasma membranes192 ± 261.1 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.4Caveola membranes9 ± 1.8NDNDVentricular cardiomyocytes were subfractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of protein in each subcellular fraction was determined by Lowry assay.

Open table in a new tab Ventricular cardiomyocytes were subfractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of protein in each subcellular fraction was determined by Lowry assay. Galactosyltransferase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activities were measured in each fraction and normalized with respect to the values obtained for the postnuclear supernatant fractions. ND, level of enzymatic activity was below the sensitivity of the assay. Presented data are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments, n = 3. The most probable contaminates of the plasma membrane and caveola fractions are the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Therefore, we measured the amount of NADPH-cytochrome reductase (endoplasmic reticulum) and galactosyltransferase (Golgi) activity in each of the subcellular fractions (Table I). The majority of the activities were associated with the intracellular membranes. The plasma membrane contained less than 2% of the total postnuclear supernatant activities, and the caveola fraction did not contain any detectable NADPH cytochrome reductase or galactosyltransferase activity. To ensure that the caveola fraction was not contaminated with other plasma membrane domains, 5 μg (Fig.1 A) or 3% (Fig.1 B) of each subcellular fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for various caveola and non-caveola proteins. The equal protein loads in Fig. 1 A illustrate the relative enrichment of each protein in the caveola fraction, whereas the proportional protein loads in Fig. 1 B illustrate total protein distribution. Caveolin-3, a marker for muscle caveolae, was highly enriched in the caveola fraction. In addition, eNOS, which has been shown to directly interact with caveolin (21.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), was also enriched in the caveola fraction. The non-caveola proteins, clathrin and transferrin, were excluded from the caveola fraction. The yield of caveolin-3 and eNOS in the caveola fraction was determined by immunoblot analysis in the linear range of detection (data not shown). The estimated yield, with respect to the plasma membrane fraction, of caveolin-3 was 61 ± 6% and eNOS was 69 ± 8%. Caveolae are highly enriched in cholesterol (16.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To further characterize the myocyte caveola fraction, we used an enzymatic kit to determine the mass of cholesterol associated with each fraction. Fig.2 demonstrates that the caveola fraction, which contained 24 μg of cholesterol, was 7.4-fold more enriched in cholesterol than the plasma membrane fraction, which contained 79 μg of cholesterol. The subcellular distribution of A1receptors under basal conditions was determined in ventricular myocytes incubated in HEPES buffer supplemented with adenosine deaminase. Three percent of each subcellular fraction was analyzed for the presence of A1 receptors by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Under these conditions, A1 receptors were highly concentrated (67 ± 5% with respect to the plasma membrane) in the caveola fraction (Fig. 3 A, Buffer). Similar results were obtained in two other groups of control myocytes. We next determined the subcellular localization of A1receptors after incubating myocytes with the A1 receptor agonist CCPA. Treatment with CCPA caused the quantitative removal of A1 receptors out of the caveola fraction (Fig.3 A, CCPA). Similar results were obtained when this treatment was repeated in additional myocytes. Quantification of the immunoreactive bands demonstrated that greater than 90% of the signal originally detected in the caveola fraction was now detected in the plasma membrane fraction (data not shown). To verify that this caveola to plasma membrane translocation was selective for A1 receptors, two additional protocols were performed. In the first, pretreatment of myocytes with the A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX prior to addition of CCPA prevented the redistribution of the receptor (Fig. 3 A, CCPA +DPCPX). Finally, treatment of cells with the A2aagonist CGS 21680 did not affect the caveola localization of the A1 receptor (Fig. 3 A, CGS). Immunoblots for caveola and non-caveola marker proteins demonstrated that CCPA treatment did not alter the yield or purity of caveolae (Fig.3 B). Recently, Stan et al. (22.Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggested that subcellular fractionation methods to isolate caveolae are contaminated with vesicles with similar biophysical properties as caveolae. Therefore, to verify that A1 receptors are associated with caveolae, we used caveolin-3 IgG to immunoprecipitate caveola membranes from isolated caveolae. Isolated ventricular myocytes were incubated in control or CCPA-supplemented HEPES buffer for 15 min, then processed to immunoprecipitate caveolae with caveolin-3 IgG. The precipitated material and the remaining supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with IgGs for eNOS, A1 receptor, and caveolin-3. Caveolin-3 co-immunoprecipitated eNOS and the A1 receptor from caveolae isolated from cells treated with buffer (Fig. 4, Buffer). However, caveolin-3 only co-immunoprecipitated eNOS from caveolae isolated from cells treated with CCPA (Fig. 4, CCPA). Approximately 10% of caveolin-3, eNOS, and A1 receptor was not precipitated with caveolin-3 IgG. We have shown by subfractionation and immunoprecipitation that A1 receptors are localized to caveolae. To confirm these findings in an independent manner, A1 receptors were localized by immunoelectron microscopy. Cells were treated with buffer (Fig. 5 A) or CCPA (Fig.5 B) as described above. The membranes were then processed to localize caveolin-3 (arrowheads) and A1receptors (arrows). Caveolin-3 and A1 receptors were found over small invaginations on the membrane surface that had the characteristic appearance of caveolae in buffer-treated cells. However, after CCPA treatment, only caveolin-3 was associated with these small invaginations. This is the first report of adenosine receptor association with caveolae. Under basal conditions, ventricular myocyte A1receptors were localized primarily in caveolae. However, after agonist (CCPA) binding, A1 receptors translocated from the caveolae to the plasma membrane fraction. This effect was blocked by prior treatment with the selective A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX, indicating that this phenomenon is agonist-specific. This unique pattern of receptor localization may explain, in part, the lack of direct effects of A1 receptor in ventricular myocytes. The A1 receptor is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors containing a seven-transmembrane-spanning domain. There are several reports that similar G protein-coupled receptors, e.g. angiotensin II (12.Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), bradykinin B2 (13.Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and endothelin A (23.Chun M. Liyanage U.D. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and muscarinic receptors (13.Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are present in caveolae. However, the present results indicate that, in contrast to these receptors, the A1 receptor translocates out of, rather than into, caveolae with receptor activation. There are at least two differences between ventricular myocyte A1 receptors and these other G protein-coupled receptors, which may explain this unique relationship of A1receptors with caveolae. First, angiotensin II, bradykinin, and endothelin have been reported to increase intracellular calcium and exert direct inotropic effects in ventricular myocytes (5.Brown J.H. Buxton I.L. Brunton L.L. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 532-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Minshall R.D. Nakamura F. Becker R.P. Rabito S.F. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7.Barry W.H. Matsui H. Bridge J.H. Spitzer K.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 382: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, A1 receptor occupation is not associated with these effects (4.Song Y. Belardinelli L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1233-C1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another difference is the phenomenon of receptor desensitization. Angiotensin II, bradykinin B2, and endothelin A receptors all desensitize within minutes of receptor activation (24.Abdellatif M.M. Neubauer C.F. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25.Blaukat A. Abd Alla S.A. Lohse M.J. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26.Cyr C. Kris R.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22 Suppl. 8: S11-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been hypothesized that receptor movement into caveolae may play a role in this phenomenon (27.de Weerd W.F. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cardiac A1 receptors desensitize only after several hours to days of continuous agonist treatment (28.Lee H.T. Thompson C.I. Hernandez A. Lewy J.L. Belloni F.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1916-H1927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that movement out of caveolae is also associated with desensitization because agonist-induced translocation of epidermal growth factor receptor out of caveolae is associated with rapid desensitization (29.Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our observation of A1 receptor translocation from caveolae to sarcolemma after agonist treatment is the opposite of that reported for the ventricular myocyte muscarinic M2 receptor (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This is surprising, given the fact that A1 and muscarinic M2 receptors exert a nearly identical pertussis toxin-sensitive anti-adrenergic effect in ventricular myocytes. However, muscarinic receptors have several properties unique from A1 receptors, which may explain these different associations with caveolae. The muscarinic agonist carbachol, at doses similar to that used by Feron et al. (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), increases inositol phosphate turnover, intracellular Ca2+, and contractility in ventricular myocytes (5.Brown J.H. Buxton I.L. Brunton L.L. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 532-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it appears that muscarinic M2 receptors may exert direct effects in ventricular myocytes via coupling to eNOS (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similar to the observations of Feron et al. (11.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we observed in the present study that eNOS is localized in caveolae. Finally, it has been reported that muscarinic M2 receptors can be desensitized with brief agonist exposure (30.Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The A1 receptor antibody used in this study (Chemicon International) was raised against the third extracellular domain of the rat adenosine A1 receptor gene (amino acids 163–176). In addition to the 36-kDa band (the A1 receptor is a 36-kDa protein), the antibody also cross-reacted with a 74-kDa band. Ciruelaet al. (31.Ciruela F. Casado V. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) also observed a 74-kDa band in several tissues (brain, kidney, lung) in several species (rat, pig, lamb) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the same peptide sequence of the rat A1 receptor. They reported that this band was converted to a 39-kDa form after agonist binding. We observed similar results in the present study, although agonist binding did not convert all of the higher molecular weight band to the lower molecular weight form. The mechanistic explanation for this observation is not known. Identical results were obtained with an Alpha Diagnostic International antibody generated against the same epitope (data not shown). Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that A1receptor movement between caveolae and sarcolemma is dependent on occupation of the receptor by an A1 agonist. First, all studies were performed in the presence of adenosine deaminase to degrade endogenously released adenosine. The subsequent addition of the A1 receptor agonist CCPA, which is relatively selective for A1 receptors, resulted in the movement of the receptor from caveolae to sarcolemmal membranes. At the concentration used in the present study, there is no evidence that CCPA activates cardiac myocyte A2a or A3 receptors. In addition, the A2a agonist CGS 21680 did not induce A1receptor translocation from caveolae. Finally, DPCPX, which is a highly selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (32.Martens D. Lohse M.J. Schwabe U. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), completely blocked the effects of CCPA. Since this is the first report of the localization of the A1 receptor in caveolae, it is not known whether A1 receptor translocation out of caveolae activates or terminates signaling. There are reports that inhibitory G protein subunits are localized in caveolae (33.Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. Galbiati F. Sargiacomo M. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar), and cardiac A1receptors couple primarily to Gαi subunits (34.Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar). Two components of the only known pathway that A1 receptor activation modulates in ventricular myocardium, β-adrenergic receptors and adenylyl cyclase, have been reported to be localized in light vesicular fractions which may be caveolae (35.Maisel A.S. Motulsky H.J. Insel P.A. Science. 1985; 230: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36.Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cardiac adenylyl cyclase can be inhibited in vitro by the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide (37.Toya Y. Schwencke C. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2025-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the location of A1 receptors is likely to significantly influence the ability of the receptors to couple to downstream signaling events. It has recently been reported that stimulation of rat cardiac myocytes with endothelin is associated with the recruitment of PKC-α and -ε isoforms to the caveolae fraction (38.Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Henry et al. (39.Henry P. Demolombe S. Puceat M. Escande D. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) previously reported that A1 receptor stimulation of ventricular myocytes induced a transient cytosol to membrane translocation of PKC-δ. Since endothelin, but not A1, receptor stimulation is associated with direct effects in myocytes, it is possible that A1 receptor stimulation may recruit PKC- δ out of caveolae, where PKC signaling may be physiologically important. In summary, we have demonstrated that, in contrast to other G protein-coupled receptors, A1 receptors translocate out of caveolae with agonist binding. The molecular consequences of this translocation are not known. Future studies will elucidate the relationship between A1 receptors, caveolae, and signal transduction."

Likewise, inheritance of a mutant allele of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) results in the development of retinoblastoma and/or osteosarcoma, and both alleles are often mutated or inactivated in sporadic forms of these and other cancers. We now demonstrate that the product of the RB1 gene, Rb, regulates the expression of the murine Brca1 and human BRCA1 genes through its ability to modulate E2F transcriptional activity. TheBrca1 gene is identified as an in vivo target of E2F1 in a transgenic mouse model. The Brca1 promoter contains E2F DNA-binding sites that mediate transcriptional activation by E2F1 and repression by Rb. Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16 INK4a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The human BRCA1 promoter also contains a conserved E2F site and is similarly regulated by E2F1 and Rb.

A general role for BRCA1 in cell growth control is suggested by BRCA1's growth-regulated and ubiquitous expression pattern (1.Marquis S.T. Rajan J.V. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xu J. Yin G.Y. Abel K.J.

Involvement of BRCA1 in DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation have all been suggested. The BRCA1 protein associates with the RAD51 DNA repair factor as well as the BRCA2 and BARD1 proteins (5.Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M.

These proteins colocalize in nuclear foci, termed “dots,” that dissipate upon DNA damage and may reappear at replication structures containing PCNA (7.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). BRCA1 is also found in complexes containing RNA polymerase II and has a carboxyl-terminal acidic region that can function as a transcriptional activation domain (8.Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M.

Several recent reports have demonstrated that BRCA1 physically associates with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and functions as a transcriptional coactivator for p53 (11.Zhang H. Somasundaram K.

This correlates with the ability of BRCA1 to significantly augment transcriptional activation of the bax gene by p53 (11.Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). BRCA1 can also induce apoptosis through the p53-independent stimulation of GADD45 expression and the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway (14.Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A.

Inactivation of the Rb tumor suppressor, through mutation of theRB1 gene or deregulation of cyclin D-associated kinase activity, is a common event in many cancers (15.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Recent data suggests that the resultant activation of E2F transcription factors contributes to tumor development (16.Pierce A.M. Fischer S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R. Martinez L.A. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1998; 18: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The Rb-E2F pathway regulates the expression of many genes whose products are required for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Transcriptional activation of at least some of these genes, such as cyclin E, is associated with the loss of proliferation control as a consequence of Rb inactivation (19.Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Bradley E. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20.Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In addition to unchecked proliferation, inactivation of Rb can also lead to p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis (22.Morgenbesser S.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. DePinho R. Nature. 1994; 371: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 23.Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This also appears to involve deregulation of E2F-dependent transcription. At least one member of the E2F family, E2F1, can induce both p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis when overexpressed (24.Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that the ability of E2F1 to transcriptionally activate thep19 ARF /p14 ARF tumor suppressor gene may be involved in E2F1's ability to induce apoptosis (25.DeGregori J. Leone G.

Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The p19 ARF /p14 ARF protein activates p53 by inhibiting the action of Mdm2 (30.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G.

Although it is likely that E2F1 regulates the expression of additional pro-apoptotic genes, these targets remain to be identified. As a model to study the role of deregulated E2F activity in cancer, we have developed a transgenic mouse model in which E2F1 expression is targeted to squamous epithelial tissue by a keratin 5 (K5) promoter. Increased E2F1 activity results in hyperplasia, hyperproliferation, and p53-dependent apoptosis in the epidermis of K5 E2F1 transgenic mice (16.Pierce A.M. Fischer S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R. Martinez L.A. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8858-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Dependent on the experimental context, K5 E2F1 transgenic mice are found to be either predisposed or resistant to tumor development (16.Pierce A.M. Fischer S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R. Martinez L.A. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, we analyzed alterations in gene expression in transgenic epidermis and primary keratinocytes. We found that the murine homologue of BRCA1 is up-regulated in K5 E2F1 transgenic cells and tissue. Analysis of the murine Brca1promoter demonstrates that this is a direct effect and that cell cycle regulatory factors such as Rb, cyclin D1, and p16 INK4a controlBrca1 gene expression through modulation of E2F transcriptional activity. The human BRCA1 gene promoter is also found to be regulated by E2F1 and Rb. Primary keratinocytes were cultured from newborn K5 E2F1 transgenic and wild type sibling mice as described previously (16.Pierce A.M. Fischer S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from keratinocytes using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) per the manufacturer's protocol, separated by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membrane. Epidermal RNA was isolated from dorsal skin by submerging skin in DEPC1-treated H20 at 55 °C for 30 s and transferring skin to DEPC-treated H20 at 4 °C for 30 s. Skin was then placed in Tri Reagent on ice, secured by a glass slide, and the epidermis was scrapped off using a scalpel. Epidermis scrapes in Tri Reagent were transferred to corex tubes and extracted per the manufacturer's protocol. Epidermal RNA was poly(A)-selected using the Fast Track kit (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's instructions. Murine cDNA probes were received from ATCC (c-myc and γ-actin), Dr. Joe Nevins (cdc2), and Dr. Susan Fischer (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). TheBrca1 probe (nucleotides 5913–6179) was generated using reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to wild type Brca1 promoter sequences or a version containing a mutated E2F binding site were generated and end-labeled for use as probe. The E2F binding site in the Brca1 promoter oligonucleotide is underlined and the mutated nucleotides are shown in bold: Brca1 wt, 5′-TCTATCTAAAATTCCCGCGCTCTCCGT-3′; Brca1 E2F−, 5′-TCTATCTAAAATTCCAACGCTCTCCGT-3′. Alternatively, an end-labeled, 100-base pair DNA fragment derived from the adenovirus E2 gene promoter was used as probe and unlabeledBrca1 oligonucleotides used as competitors. The E2 promoter contains two classical E2F sites (TTTCGCGC) in inverse orientation 17 base pairs apart. NIH3T3 nuclear extract or recombinant E2F1/DP1 (containing equal amounts of GST-E2F1 and GST-DP1) were incubated with the radiolabeled probe in binding buffer (4 mm Tris-HCl, 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol) containing about 0.2 ng of the radiolabeled DNA fragment and 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA for 25 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE (0.0225 m Tris borate, 0.0005 m EDTA) at 4 °C, the gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed. MurineBrca1 promoter sequences from +6 to −1003 were isolated by PCR and cloned into pGL3 vector (Promega) to create Brca1-luc (wt). Brca1-luc (E2F−) was made by introducing mutations in the E2F sites at −27 and −62 by replacing a fragment from +6 to −74 with a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing appropriate base changes. Brca1-luc (+6 to −539) wild type and E2F− versions were made by removing Brca1 sequences from −539 to −1003 from Brca1-luc (+6 to −1003). The human BRCA1 luciferase plasmid (−567) was a kind gift from Bernard Futscher (Arizona Cancer Center) (33.Rice J.C. Massey-Brown K.S. Futscher B.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1807-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus expression vectors encoding E2F1, DP1, cyclin D1, Cdk4, Rb, and p16 INK4a have been described (34.Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 35.Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 and C33A cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine or calf serum and replated 24 prior to transfection. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using pfx-3 lipid (Invitrogen). The cells were starved for 24 during the transfection and another 24 following transfection with DMEM containing 0.3% FBS. Cells were harvested with luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was measured in a Turner TD-20e Luminometer. C33A cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method and incubated in media containing 10% FBS for 48 before harvesting and assaying luciferase activity. Previously we demonstrated that the cyclin E gene is overexpressed approximately 6-fold in primary keratinocytes isolated from K5 E2F1 transgenic mice (17.Pierce A.M. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Schneider-Broussard R. Martinez L.A. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8858-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that several other genes previously identified as E2F targets, such as cdc2 and c-myc, are only minimally up-regulated in these transgenic cells (Fig. 1). The expression of several control genes, including γ-actin, is similar in primary keratinocytes isolated from either K5 E2F1 transgenic mice or wild type siblings. On the other hand, the murine homologue of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene, Brca1, is expressed in K5 E2F1 transgenic keratinocytes at a level at least 4-fold over that found in nontransgenic cells (Fig. 1 A). To verify that increased E2F1 activity can stimulate Brca1 expression in vivo, Northern blot analysis was performed on poly(A)-selected RNA isolated from the epidermis of K5 E2F1 mice (Fig. 1 B). The steady-state level of Brca1 message in the epidermis of transgenic mice was greater than 10-fold over that found in nontransgenic control epidermis after correction using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression as a control (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that Brca1gene expression is highest in tissues containing rapidly proliferating cells such as the testes, thymus, and epidermis (1.Marquis S.T. Rajan J.V. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xu J. Yin G.Y. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Chodosh L.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4.Lane T.F. Deng C. Elson A. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2712-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The transcription factors responsible for this proliferation-associated expression of the Brca1 gene have not been identified. Examination of the Brca1 gene promoter (36.Chambers J.A. Solomon E. Genomics. 1996; 38: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) identified two potential E2F binding sites immediately upstream of exon 1 (ATTCCCGC at −27 and CTTCCCGC at −62) that closely match the consensus sequence identified as optimal for E2F1 binding (37.Tao Y.X. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether E2F transcription factors could bind the Brca1 promoter, an EMSA was performed using recombinant E2F1 and DP1 proteins and a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the Brca1promoter region containing the putative proximal E2F site as probe. Recombinant E2F1/DP1 was found to bind the probe containing the wild type Brca1 promoter sequences but not a similar probe containing a mutated E2F site (Fig.2 A). An EMSA was also performed using nuclear extract from NIH3T3 cells and a fragment from the adenovirus E2 gene promoter. In this experiment the double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the wild type Brca1 promoter sequence was found to efficiently compete for cellular E2F DNA-binding complexes, while the Brca1 oligonucleotide containing the mutant E2F site did not compete (Fig. 2 B). To examine transcriptional regulation of theBrca1 gene by E2F, we isolated sequences 5′ to exon 1 of theBrca1 gene from mouse genomic DNA using PCR and cloned theBrca1 promoter region upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. In serum-starved NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of E2F1, in conjunction with its heterodimerization partner DP1, transcriptionally activated the Brca1 promoter and this response was lost when the E2F binding sites were mutated (Fig.3 A). The activity of the mutant Brca1 promoter was approximately 5-fold higher than the wild type promoter in these Rb-positive cells forced into quiescence by serum withdrawal, indicating that the E2F sites can function as negative regulatory elements. A similar type of regulation has been shown for several other E2F target genes and is due to the binding of E2F repressor complexes containing Rb or Rb family members (34.Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 35.Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Lam E.W. Watson R.J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The repressive effect of Rb on the activity of the Brca1promoter could be demonstrated more directly in the Rb-deficient cell line C33A. Brca1 promoter activity was significantly repressed by expression of wild type Rb but not by expression of a Rb mutant defective in E2F binding (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of the E2F binding sites in the Brca1 promoter abolished repression by Rb. Regulators of Rb activity were also found to modulate expression of theBrca1 promoter through the E2F sites. Cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding cyclin D1 and Cdk4 caused a derepression of the wild type Brca1 promoter in quiescent NIH3T3 cells but had only a modest effect on the E2F site mutant promoter (Fig.3 C). Coexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a blocked the ability of cyclin D1/Cdk4 to stimulate Brca1 promoter activity (Fig. 3 D). The humanBRCA1 gene has been shown to be growth-regulated with kinetics consistent with it being a target for E2F-dependent transcriptional control (2.Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20994-20997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Analysis of the human BRCA1 promoter identified a region that is highly homologous to a region in the murine Brca1 promoter (Fig. 4 A). Within this conserved sequence is the proximal E2F site we demonstrated to bind E2F factors (see Fig. 2). To examine regulation of the humanBRCA1 gene by the Rb-E2F pathway, a BRCA1promoter-luciferase plasmid (33.Rice J.C. Massey-Brown K.S. Futscher B.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1807-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was used in similar cotransfection experiments as presented in Fig. 3. The human BRCA1 promoter was transactivated in a dose-dependent manner by coexpression of E2F1 and DP1 much like the murine Brca1promoter (Fig. 4 B). At the highest concentration of E2F1 expression vector, BRCA1 promoter activity was induced 5-fold in these quiescent cells. Moreover, BRCA1 promoter activity was repressed 15-fold by expression of wild type Rb, but not by a mutated Rb unable to bind E2F transcription factors, in the Rb-negative C33A cell line. These findings demonstrate that the Rb-E2F pathway also regulates the human BRCA1 gene. The data presented establish the Brca1/BRCA1 gene as a target for E2F-dependent transcriptional regulation. TheBrca1 promoter behaves very similarly to several other E2F-regulated promoters such as B-myb and E2F1(34.Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 35.Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Lam E.W. Watson R.J.

In quiescent cells, E2F is found in association with Rb and Rb-related proteins and these complexes function as active repressors of transcription (40.Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 42.Weintraub S.J. Prater C.A. Dean D.C.

This is likely why the wild type Brca1 promoter has lower activity than the E2F site mutant promoter in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells but not in C33A tumor cells that lack Rb. This model is supported by the finding that expression of cyclin D1/Cdk4, which phosphorylates Rb and releases E2F, can stimulate expression from the Brca1 promoter in quiescent cells and that this is inhibited by coexpression of p16 INK4a. The human BRCA1 gene appears to be similarly regulated given the conserved E2F site in the BRCA1 promoter and its responsiveness to E2F1 and Rb. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the Brca1/BRCA1 gene is a downstream target for the p16 INK4a -cyclin D-Rb-E2F pathway that is frequently mutated in cancers. What is the functional significance of Brca1/BRCA1regulation by the Rb-E2F pathway? BRCA1 appears to be part of a multimeric complex that colocalizes with PCNA to sites of DNA replication following DNA damage (6.Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T.

Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). E2F regulates a large number of genes involved in DNA synthesis, including genes encoding nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes and DNA replication factors (25.DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 46.Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). If BRCA1 was found to participate in DNA replication, BRCA1 would join this category of E2F target genes. BRCA1 has also recently been shown to associate with Rb and to suppress proliferation (47.Aprelikova O.N. Fang B.S. Meissner E.G. Cotter S. Campbell M. Kuthiala A. Bessho M. Jensen R.A. Liu E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11866-11871Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). E2F1 up-regulates the expression of Rb as a means to repress its own activity (48.Shan B. Chang C.Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). If BRCA1 is also involved in repressing E2F-dependent transcription in conjunction with Rb, than stimulation of BRCA1 expression could be part of a negative feedback mechanism to suppress E2F activity. Other recent data demonstrate that BRCA1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis through its ability to modulate transcription. BRCA1 directly binds p53 and can stimulate the p53-dependent transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic genes such as bax (11.Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 12.Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, induction of BRCA1 expression results in the transcriptional activation of GADD45 in a p53-independent manner (14.Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This leads to the activation of JNK/SAPK and the rapid induction of apoptosis. Thus, the transcriptional activation ofBrca1/BRCA1 by E2F1 may result in the stimulation of both p53-dependent and JNK/SAPK-dependent apoptotic pathways. We have recently demonstrated up-regulation of several genes in K5 E2F1 transgenic keratinocytes that are downstream targets of p53, as well as other genes involved in apoptosis (49.Wang A. Pierce A.M. Judson-Kremer K. Gaddis S. Aldaz C.M. Johnson D.G. MacLeod M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in agreement with this suggestion. If this is the case, then BRCA1 would be an additional effector, along with p19 ARF and perhaps others, of the apoptotic response that occurs in cells that have lost Rb function. Loss of BRCA1 function, as occurs in familial breast cancer, may therefore increase the survival of cells that have acquired mutations resulting in Rb inactivation. This role for BRCA1 does not rule out additional functions for BRCA1, such as a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. In fact, it is quite possible that BRCA1 is induced and augments p53 and JNK/SAPK activities in response to both cell cycle deregulation and DNA damage and that both functions are important for BRCA1's tumor suppressive activity.

https://openalex.org/W1983344060,"Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation has been shown to stimulate the expression of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases via generation of DNA damage and/or reactive oxygen species. Matrix-degrading metalloproteinases promote UVB-triggered detrimental long term effects like cancer formation and premature skin aging. Here, we were interested in identifying components of the signal transduction pathway that causally link UVB-mediated DNA damage and induction of matrix-degrading metalloproteinase (MMP)-1/interstitial collagenase and MMP-3/stromelysin-1 in human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. The activity of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, a downstream target of the FK506-binding protein-12/rapamycin-associated protein kinase (FRAP) kinase (RAFT1, mTOR), was identified to be 4.8 ± 0.8-fold, and MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein levels 2.4- and 11.5-fold increased upon UVB irradiation compared with mock-irradiated controls. The FRAP kinase inhibitor rapamycin and the DNA repair inhibitor aphidicolin significantly suppressed the UVB-mediated increase in p70 ribosomal S6 kinase activity by 50–65% and MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein levels by 34–68% and 42–88% compared with UVB-irradiated fibroblasts. By contrast, the interleukin-1β-mediated increase in MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein levels could not be suppressed by rapamycin. Collectively, our data suggest that the FRAP-controlled p70 ribosomal S6 kinase is an essential component of a DNA damage-dependent, but not of the interleukin-1/cell membrane receptor-dependent signaling."

The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily includes luminal amino-terminal (e.g. type I) transmembrane glycoproteins with two or more Ig-like domains such as p58/KIR2DL3, FcγRIIB, Ig-like transcripts as well as the mouse PIR-B. The other group is comprised of CD94/NKG-2, CD72, and the mouse Ly49 and NKR-P1 which are cytoplasmic amino-terminal (e.g. type II) transmembrane proteins expressing C-type lectin extracellular architecture. The existence of complementary proteins expressing similar extracellular domains as the inhibitory receptors, while having distinctive transmembrane and frequently truncated cytoplasmic tails, suggests similar ligand-binding specificities but contrasting signaling capabilities for each individual of the protein pair. The truncated protein would have cellular activating properties, in contrast with its ITIM-bearing counterpart which would inhibit cell signaling through recruitment of SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP phosphatases (9.Vély F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar) seemingly via their respective carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains (12.Vély F. Nunes J.A. Malissen B. Hedgecock C.J. Eur. J.

We now present evidence of a novel pair of receptors expressing a single extracellular Ig-like domain that we have designated as “paired immunoglobulin-likereceptor” (PILR)α and PILRβ to distinguish their putative inhibitory and activating gene products, respectively. The ITIM-bearing receptor PILRα recruits SHP-1 via its amino-terminal SH2 domain and is likely to have cellular inhibitory potential. The lack of a cytoplasmic tail and the presence of the transmembrane lysine residue in the second receptor PILRβ suggest its potential activating function. Both genes map cytogenetically to human chromosome 7. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection except where indicated.

The T cell-derived KG-1, Jurkat and K562 cell lines were maintained in RPMI, 10% FBS. The B cell-derived cell lines WIL2-NS, Namalwa, Daudi, and Raji were maintained in RPMI, 10% inactivated FBS. The 6F11 B cell line was cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine and 15% FBS. The macrophage 28SC cell line was maintained in Iscove's medium supplemented with 0.03 mm thymidine, 0.1 mmhypoxanthine, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS. NK-92ci cells (ImmuneMedicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) transformed with a pCep-IL-2 construct were maintained by selection in interleukin-2-free Myelocult medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). SHP-1 was precipitated and detected using a monoclonal antibody (mAb; P17320; Transduction Laboratories) or an in-house polyclonal antibody (pAb; 237, see Ref. 15.Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PILRα cDNA was subcloned in-frame with a carboxyl-terminal triple HA tag. The HA epitope was precipitated with a high affinity rat anti-HA mAb (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and detected with a mouse mAb (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Separate membranes were also probed with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-ubiquitin pAb (U-5379; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated to goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) and detection relied on enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Screening of a human mammary gland cDNA library (CLONTECH) with the SHP-1-C455S catalytic mutant (16.Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. The full-length SHP-1-C455S was cloned into SalI-restricted pBTM116-Src by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures and thus was fused in-frame with the carboxyl terminus of the DNA binding domain of the bacterial activator LexA. pBTM116-Src contains a mutant c-Src kinase expression cassette designed for the phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues in yeast (17.Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The pBTM116-Src-SHP-1-C455S construct was then used to transform the yeast reporter strain, L40α (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacz). Following transformation using Li2+ acetate (18.Gietz D. St-Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), L40α expressing pBTM116-Src-SHP-1-C455S was further transformed with the library. Positive interactors were isolated according to the manufacturer's specifications (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The positive control consisted of a pBTM-116-cnx1+ and pGADGH-hus5+ combination kindly provided by M. Pelletier and D.Y. Thomas 2M. Pelletier and D. Y. Thomas, unpublished data. (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). cDNA sequences were determined and subjected to the BLAST search of the NCBI data bases. The target sequence of interest was used as a probe for screening of cDNA libraries. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by random labeling of the PILRα PCR product using Ready-to-Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP. Placenta, acute myelocytoma leukemia (KG-1), bone marrow, and leukocyte cDNA libraries were screened using the labeled probes. Positive clones were subjected to PCR using λ GT11-specific primers. Single and double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of PILRα-HA, i.e. Y269F, Y298F, Y269F/Y298F, were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. 293T cells were transfected either alone or in combination with SHP-1 by calcium phosphate precipitation. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were treated with pervanadate (100 μm, 30 min at 37 °C), a phosphatase inhibitor that induces maximal tyrosine phosphorylation (19.O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice. Solubilized extracts were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies followed by protein A- or protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and revealed by standard immunoblotting techniques. 293T cells were transiently transfected with PILRα-HA. Following immunoprecipitation with an HA-directed antibody, immune complexes were washed and denatured, and N-glycosylation status was determined by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 5 milliunits ofN-glycosidase F (PNGase:F, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) while a parallel series of experiments determinedO-glycosylation status by incubation with 1 milliunit of neuraminidase (to remove sialic acid residues, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and/or 1 milliunit of endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycosidase, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The various reactions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. To test for the presence of covalently bound ubiquitin in the 55-kDa expressed PILRα-HA species, transiently transfected 293T cells were treated with pervanadate, and HA-bound immunoprecipitates were collected, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed with an anti-ubiquitin pAb. A 300-base pair segment encoding either the amino-terminal SH2 domain (SH2(N)) or the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (SH2(C)) of SHP-1 were generated by PCR amplification of human SHP-1 cDNA (20.Yu Z. Hoglinger O. Jaramillo M.L. Banville D. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3687-3694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SHP-1.SH2(N) and SHP-1.SH2(C) GST fusion proteins were produced inEscherichia coli DH5α cultures transformed with the corresponding plasmid and induced with 25 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 22 h at 28 °C. The GST fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein expression and purity were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed on a BIAcore apparatus using CM5-sensor chips (Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The tyrosyl-phosphorylated (pY) synthetic peptides, KDDGIV(pY)ASLALSSSTS and PQNETL(pY)SVLKA, corresponding, respectively, to the Tyr-269- and Tyr-298-based motifs contained in PILRα were immobilized at 0.5 mg/ml on the Biosensor chip. Immobilization efficiency was verified using the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb. GST-SH2 domain fusion proteins (see above) were initially dialyzed in 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 3.4 mm EDTA (HBS). The GST fusion proteins (0.5–2000 nm), diluted in HBS, 0.05% P20, were injected over the test surfaces at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Regeneration of the Biosensor chip using 46 mmHCl, 1 m NaCl did not result in loss of subsequent signal. Dissociation constants (K D) were calculated by saturation (nonlinear regression) analysis as well as by kinetic analysis (e.g. the ratio of k off andk on determined using BIAevaluation software; Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane were hybridized consecutively with32P-labeled full-length PILRα cDNA and with32P-labeled β-actin cDNA probes. The level of expression in a series of human cells was also examined. Total RNAs from the individual cell lines were extracted by the TriZOL method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and enriched in poly(A)+ RNA by passage on oligo(dT) spun columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten μg of poly(A)+ RNA were loaded per lane, transferred to membrane, probed as above, and then washed (maximum stringency being 2 × 15 min, 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 55 °C). The sequence of the 5′-untranslated region was amplified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends from Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH), whereas the genomic organization of PILRα and PILRβ genes was partially determined using the proofreading Taqpolymerase GenomeWalkerTM kit (CLONTECH). A SHP-1-C455S catalytic mutant was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human mammary gland cDNA library. 4.5 × 106 clones were screened to reveal 24 interactors able to grow on Trp−/Leu−/His− medium and able to induce β-galactosidase activity (Fig.1). These positive clones were sequenced and identified as a novel ITIM-bearing protein, subsequently named PILRα, as well as known interactors of SHP-1 namely SHPS-1 (21.Veillette A. Thibaudeau E. Latour S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22719-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), EGFRBP-Grb2 (22.Kon-Kozlowski M. Pani G. Pawson T. Siminovitch K.A. J. Biol.

Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The sequence of the novel interactor was extended by PCR amplification of the target cDNA library and was ultimately confirmed following its use as a probe in the cDNA library screening which yielded the full-length sequence. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence, indicating a theoretical mass of 31.8 kDa, are depicted in Fig. 2. Structurally the gene product does not contain an IgG domain per se, although the single extracellular cysteine residue (Cys-125) is flanked by a motif, e.g.YXCXVXL, reminiscent of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-based motif, e.g.(F/Y)XCX(V/A)XH, involved in the intradomain disulfide bond of immunoglobulin and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins (PROSITE data base; reference number PS00290). This same segment bears a slight homology to extracellular regions of sialoadhesin (24.Crocker P.R. Mucklow S. Bouckson V. McWilliam A. Willis A.C. Gordon S. Milon G. Kelm S. Bradfield P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4490-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a potential N-glycosylation site (NX(T/S)), numerous serine and threonine residues capable of beingO-glycosylated, a transmembrane domain, and three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, two of which, e.g. Tyr-269 and Tyr-298, reside within an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of human PILRα. The signal peptide (underlined), the transmembrane region (bold, underlined), a potential N-glycosylation site (boxed), and putative binding sites for SHP-1 SH2 domains (shaded) are indicated. The AATAAA polyadenylation signal is also shown (bold). The bold numbers to theright indicate the nucleotide position, and theitalicized numbers indicate the amino acid position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine protein-protein interactions, 293T cells were co-transfected with PILRα-HA and SHP-1 and treated with pervanadate. Fig.3 demonstrates that PILRα-HA is phosphorylated in 293T cells (Fig. 3 A, top), that PILRα-HA and SHP-1 co-precipitate (Fig. 3 A, middle), and that tyrosine phosphorylation was essential for binding to SHP-1 (Fig.3 A, bottom). In addition, confirmation that the association occurred in vivo was accomplished by co-immunoprecipitation of PILRα-HA as part of an immune complex containing the SHP-1-D421A substrate-trapping mutant (25.Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). PILRα-HA migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa rather than the expected theoretical molecular mass of 36 kDa. The 55-kDa molecular mass includes 4.6 kDa contributed by the triple HA tag. The significant difference between the deduced and the apparent molecular mass of PILRα-HA on Western blotting led to the examination of the glycosylation and/or ubiquitination status of this protein. Samples of PILRα-HA immunoblotted for ubiquitin did not reveal any signal (data not shown). Digestion of immunoprecipitates with either PNGase:F or with neuraminidase plus O-glycosidase revealed shifts in the migration of expressed PILRα-HA. The combination of PNGase:F and neuraminidase plus O-glycosidase reduced the molecular mass to approximately 42 kDa thus revealing that post-translation addition of N- and O-linked carbohydrate residues accounts for a substantial portion of expressed 55-kDa PILRα-HA (Fig. 4). The role of the ITIM-based tyrosine residues of PILRα-HA in recruiting SHP-1 was investigated by mutational analysis. Immunodetection of SHP-1 following co-immunoprecipitation with an HA-directed antibody indicated that the Tyr-269 motif, e.g.IVYASL, was the target for binding with SHP-1 (Fig.5 A). Indeed, whereas the Y298F substitution seems to have had only a slight effect on the association with SHP-1, the Y269F mutant and the Y269F/Y298F double mutant significantly decreased the SHP-1 signal. PILRα-HA (Fig.5 C) and SHP-1 (Fig. 5 B) were equally expressed in the corresponding lysates. The importance of the Tyr-269 motif in recruiting SHP-1 is supported using BIAcore detection. The immobilized phosphorylated peptide corresponding to this motif, e.g.KDDGI(pY)-ASLALSSSTS, demonstrated high affinity for the SHP-1-SH2(N) domain (Fig. 6, top) and intermediate affinity for the SHP-1-SH2(C) domain (Fig. 6,bottom). Interestingly, the SHP-1-SH2(C) domain selectively recognized the Tyr-298 phosphopeptide, e.g. PQNETL(pY)SVLKA, but with much lower affinity (Fig. 6, bottom). The dissociation constants (K D) for the various interactions were determined by saturation analysis (nonlinear regression analysis) and supported by those obtained by kinetic analysis (e.g. K D =k off/k on: TableI). Saturation analysis revealedK D values of 167 ± 4 and 1091 ± 196 nm following binding of the SHP-1-SH2(N) and -SH2(C) GST fusion proteins, respectively, to the Tyr-269 phosphopeptide. AK D value of 3777 ± 447 nm was obtained upon binding of the SHP-1-SH2(C) GST fusion protein to the Tyr-298 phosphopeptide. GST itself did not bind to any of the test surfaces (data not shown) and neither of the GST-SH2 domain fusion proteins bound significantly (e.g. less than 5 resonance units) to the control Biosensor chip surface.Table IBinding potential of the SHP-1 amino- and carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains with human PILRα tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptidesPhosphorylated peptidesKDDGIV(pY)ASLALSSSTSPQNETL(pY)SVLKASHP-1.SH2(N) k on (104m−1 s−1)5.10 ± 0.53ND k off(10−3 s−1)2.48 ± 0.65ND K D(nm)47.8 ± 10.5NDSHP-1.SH2(C) k on (104m−1 s−1)2.42 ± 0.990.46 ± 0.05 k off (10−3 s−1)3.78 ± 0.9612.9 ± 0.59 K D(nm)214.0 ± 77.73000 ± 431Values represent the mean (±S.E.) of five separate experiments.

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends designed to clone the 5′ end of the PILRα cDNA revealed the presence of a second cDNA displaying long regions of near sequence identity to PILRα but differing in its 5′ non-coding sequence. The existence of a related gene was also suggested from long range PCR performed on human genomic DNA (results not shown) and was confirmed by the sequence of a 200-kilobase segment of human chromosome 7 deposited subsequently in GenBankTM under the accession number RG161A02. The PILRα gene consists of seven exons and six introns spanning approximately 26.7 kb. The second gene, designatedPILRβ, is located 5.6 kb upstream of thePILRα gene and consists of four exons and three introns spanning approximately 9.8 kb (Fig.7 B). The nucleotide sequence of the first three exons of the two genes is extremely similar, displaying more than 90% sequence identity (Fig. 7 A), and suggests that the two genes share a common origin. TablesII and IIIsummarize the nucleotide sequence of the splice sites of thePILRα and PILRβ genes, respectively, and indicate that in both cases the intron-exon boundaries conform to the GT-AG rule. PILRβ codes for a protein with similar extracellular features as those of PILRα but with a short cytoplasmic tail and a charged lysine residue within its transmembrane domain (Fig.7 A).Table IIIntron-exon splice junction sites of the human PILRα geneExoSizeSplice donorSplice acceptorIntron sizebpbp1276TTT CTG CAG CCT Agtgagtacccc......cctcctctagGT GGC TCC ACA GGA3232390TCC ATC ACC CAG Ggtgagtccagc......ctctccccagCT GTC ACG ACC ACC15,4553219AGG AGA AGG AAA Ggtaagtgccca......ccccctacagGT CAG CAG CGG ACT7772434ACA ACC CCA GCC AGgtgagtgctgg......tcccatacagG GAA CCC TTC CAA1378550ATC AGG AAT GAA Ggtgagtcctt......ttattcttagGA CAA AAT ACA GAT240632CTA AAT CCC AAGgtaagcaatca......tctcgcccagGAT GAC GGC ATC1727308The nucleotide positions within the RG161A02 human genome clone are as follows: exon 1, 170751–171026; exon 2, 171350–171739; exon 3, 187194–187412; exon 4, 195185–195218; exon 5, 196597–196646; exon 6, 196887–196918; exon 7, 197091–197398 (polyadenylation signal at 197381).

The “gt-ag” delimiting each intron is underlined. Northern blot analysis of selected human tissues revealed a strong signal in peripheral blood leukocytes and lower intensity signals in lung, spleen, and placenta (Fig.8 A). Analysis of various human cell lines revealed a signal in a two B cell lines, e.g.WIL2-NS and 6F11 (Fig. 8 B), whereas all other cells tested were negative for PILR. Due to the high nucleotide sequence identity of the two genes and the similar length of the two transcripts, the Northern blots do not allow us to discriminate which of the two forms, e.g. PILRα orPILRβ, is expressed in these tissues and cell lines. To resolve this question, PCR with a forward oligonucleotide primer whose sequence was common to both PILRα and PILRβ(HUKF1, 5′-GGGAAGCTTATGGGTCGGCCCCTGCTGCTGCCC) and reverse primers specific for each form, HUKR3 for PILRα(5′-CCATCTCGAGTTTTGAGAGGGCTG) and HUKR5 for PILRβ(5′-TCCTCCGGGGCTAATACACATCC), were performed on reverse transcribed single-stranded cDNA from various tissues including colon, leukocyte, ovary, prostate, small intestine, spleen, testis, thymus, placenta, and mammary gland. The results indicate that bothPILRα and PILRβ were expressed,e.g. were paired, at the mRNA level in the individual samples (results not shown). The cytosolic phosphatase SHP-1 contains tandem SH2 domains that bind tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and, thus, by virtue of its catalytic subunit, gets recruited as an effector enzyme in a signaling pathway initiated by activated tyrosine kinase receptors (26.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Specificity in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways is critical and is often dictated by the intrinsic affinity of SH2 domains for the flanking sequences of phosphotyrosine residues.

Several of these kinases are oncogenic, and may function in the development of prostate cancer. One of the novel kinases is a new member of the sterile 20 (STE20) family of serine-threonine kinases which we have called prostate-derived STE20-like kinase (PSK) and characterized functionally.

Immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylates myelin basic protein and transfected PSK stimulates MKK4 and MKK7 and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Microinjection of PSK into cells results in localization of PSK to a vesicular compartment and causes a marked reduction in actin stress fibers.

Androgens play an important role in stimulating prostatic epithelial cell proliferation and initial treatment of patients with prostate cancer usually involves androgen ablation. Despite this, androgen-insensitive tumors often emerge after 2–3 years (3.Roehrborn C.G. Berns P.M.M.J. Romijn J.C. Schroder F.H.

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are also thought to play an important role in prostate cancer development with increased extracellular signal-regulated MAPK activation occurring with increased Gleason score and tumor stage (8.Putz T. Culig Z. Eder I.E. Nessler-Menardi C. Bartsch G. Grunicke H. Uberall F. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gioeli D. Mandell J.W. Petroni G.R. Frierson H.F. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). The prostate cancer cell mitogen IL-6 also activates MAPK pathways and the androgen receptor (15.Hobisch A. Eder I.E. Putz T. Horninger W. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Culig Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4640-4645PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK pathways play crucial roles in the regulation of a diverse array of responses including growth, differentiation, transformation, stress responses, and apoptosis, but their role in the development of prostate cancer remains to be determined (16.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 17.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar, 18.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). MAPK stimulation occurs via activation of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), which phosphorylates a dual specificity MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn phosphorylates MAPK. The MAPKs currently consist of three related protein kinase cascades named after the final enzyme in each series; extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)/stress-activated protein kinases, and p38s. The ERK cascade contains ERK1 and -2 (MAPKs), MEK1 and -2 (MAPKKs), and A-RAF, B-RAF, and RAF-1 (MAPKKKs) and is predominantly involved in signaling cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to ERK activation, pathways involved in the activation of JNK and p38 are less clear. The JNK cascade includes JNKs 1, 2, and 3 (MAPKs) and MKKs 4 and 7 (MAPKKs), while the p38 cascade contains p38 α and β (MAPKs) and MKKs 3 and 6 (MAPKKs) (18.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

The JNK and p38 pathways are predominantly involved in the protective responses of cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1) and cellullar stresses (10.Culig Z.

BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). A number of MAPKKK-like proteins activate the JNK and p38 pathways and include MAP/ERK kinases (MEKKs 1–4), MAPK upstream kinase, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase, tumor progression locus-2, and apoptosis signal-regulated kinase (22.Hirai S.

The large number of MAPKKKs is thought to allow many different stimuli to input into the MAPK pathways converging on a relatively limited number of MAPKK-like proteins. Recent attention has focused on a family of serine-threonine kinases whose catalytic domain has homology to the sterile 20 (STE20) kinase ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae involved in MAPK signaling of the pheromone response in yeast (26.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Mammalian STE20-like kinases appear to act as MAPK kinase kinase kinases, and some members of this family activate the JNK MAPK pathway. The STE20-like kinase family include p21-activated kinases (PAKs), mixed lineage kinases (MLKs), mammalian STE20-like kinases (MSTs), germinal center kinase (GCK), GCK-like kinase (GLK), hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK), kinase homologous to SPS1/STE20 (KHS), lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK), STE20 oxidant stress response kinase (SOK), yeast SPS1/STE20-like kinase (YSK), and NCK interacting kinase (NIK) (27.Creasy C.L.

MLK2 can also stimulate the ERK MAPK pathway, and PAKs not only activate the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways but also regulate cytoskeletal organization stimulating disassembly of actin stress fibers and membrane ruffling (34.Nagata K.

We set out to obtain a profile of kinases expressed in surgically removed prostate tumors to identify potential oncogenic signaling pathways that might be involved in progression to prostate cancer. The degenerate PCR screen of malignant prostate tissues identified 15 tyrosine or serine-threonine kinases and provides a basis for further analysis of kinase signaling pathways and function in prostate cancer development. The PCR screen for kinases also identified a novel member of the STE20-like family of protein kinases which we have called prostate-derived STE20-like kinase (PSK). PSK has a potential role as a signal transduction molecule in prostatic carcinomas and may function similarly to other STE20-like proteins discovered in mammalian tissues, which occupy pivotal roles in coupling stimuli to downstream signaling pathways. We have demonstrated that PSK specifically activates the JNK MAPK pathway and induces loss of actin stress fibers, suggesting a role for this new protein in regulating cellular stress responses and cell motility. Total RNA was isolated from surgically removed prostatic carcinoma tissues (Gleason grades 6–8) using RNazol B (Biogenesis). RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) primed with oligo(dT)17. PCR was performed using two degenerate primers 5′-CCTCGAGATCCA(T/C)(A/C)GNGA(T/C)(T/C)T-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCA(A/T)AGGACCA(G/C)AC(G/A)TC-3′ to target conserved sequences in subdomains VI and IX of the kinase catalytic domain (45.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 46.Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were 93 °C/90 s, 45 °C/2 min, and 72 °C/4 min for 30 cycles using 2 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) per 50-μl reaction. PCR products were digested with XhoI andEcoRI and cloned into Lambda Zap Express™ arms according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), and the DNA insert was sequenced (T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For 3′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), RNA from a T-47D breast carcinoma cell line was reverse transcribed using the primer 5′-GACTACGTTAGCATCTAGAATTCTCGAG(T)17-3′. Nested PCR was carried out using two forward primers 5′-CTGCGTCCATCATGGCACCTG-3′, followed by 5′-TTTGGATCCACTAGTGTCGA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GACTACGTTAGCATCTAGAATTCTCGG-3′ and a 534-bp product obtained and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The 534-bp 3′RACE product was used to screen a Lambda Zap cDNA library prepared from T-47D carcinoma cells (Stratagene, kind gift from M. Crompton, ICR, London). Filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Hybond™-N+) were hybridized at 65 °C in a solution containing 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 20 μg/ml salmon testis DNA (Sigma) for 48 h. Stringency of the final wash was 1× SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C. CDNA clones were isolated from a screen of 1 × 106 phage clones and sequenced on both strands (MWG-Biotech). PCR to confirm the presence of PSK in human genomic DNA was carried out using a forward primer 5′-CCTGAACAAGAAGCAGACCCA-3′ in combination with a reverse primer 5′-CCAGAATCCTCTGCTGCTTGG-3′. PCR conditions were 93 °C/45 s, 60 °C/60 s, and 68 °C/2 min for 35 cycles using 1 unit of Supertaq plus DNA polymerase (HT-Biotech) per 50-μl reaction. For mammalian cell expression, the open reading frame of PSK (758–4463 bp) was initially cloned into EfPlink (kind gift from R. Marais, ICR, London) containing a 5′ MYC epitope tag. The 5′ end of PSK was generated by PCR using a forward primer 5′-AAGCTTGGATCCATGCCAGCTGGGGGCCGG-3′, to introduce aBamHI site next to the ATG start codon, with the reverse primer 5′AAAGAATTCGCTGCAGGCGGCTGGAGA-3′. After digestion with appropriate enzymes the BamHI −1103 XbaI fragment of PSK was ligated into EfPlink along with the 3′ end of PSK (XbaI 1104–4492 XbaI) and an annealed oligonucleotide adaptor 5′-CTAGAGCATTGAGTAGATAGAATTCAAGCTTA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTAAGCTTGAATTCTATCTACTCAATGCT-3′ introduced at its 3′ XbaI site. To improve protein expression in COS1 cells upon transient transfection the open reading frame was subcloned into a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRK5 containing a 5′ MYC-epitope tag. PSK (K57A) was prepared using the method of Kunkelet al. (47.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Briefly, PSK (BamHI −3504BamHI) was subcloned into pBluescript II SK and used to generate a mutated fragment using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGGTGGTGGCCATCGCGAAGATGATGTCCTACAG-3′. The resultant PSK (BamHI −3504 BamHI, K57A) fragment was ligated back into EfPlink-PSK (BamHI 3504–4492XbaI). PSK (amino acids 1–349) and PSK (1–349, K57A) were prepared by ligating the respective BamHI −1805 XhoI blunt-ended fragments of PSK into EfPlink MYC-tag cut withBamHI-EcoRI and containing an EcoRI blunt end. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (MTN™, CLONTECH) was probed with anXbaI 1104–1800 XhoI or BamHI 3504–4492 XbaI fragment of PSK using the method described by the manufacturer. COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics (5%CO2, 37 °C). For transfection, cells (1.9 × 106/10 ml of medium) were seeded onto 100-mm Petri dishes and grown for 16 h before the indicated plasmids (6 μg of each plasmid with the total amount of DNA made equivalent using empty vector) were co-transfected into COS1 cells for 5 h in the presence of 30 μl of Lipofectin/4 ml of Opti-MEM I. (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cultures were transferred to 10 ml of growth medium and incubated for 48 h. For immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, cultures were lysed in 200 μl of gel sample buffer and 100 μg of each sample was separated by 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE before proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). MYC-tagged PSK or p38 proteins were detected using 9E10 anti-MYC tag antibody (Sigma), and FLAG-tagged JNK or ERK2 were detected using anti-FLAG tag M2 antibody (Sigma). Briefly, membranes were blocked with TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 5% dried milk for 1 h at room temperature; incubated in TBS-Tween 20 (0.5%) containing either a 1/500 dilution of 9E10 or 5 μg/ml M2 for 1 h (room temperature); and finally incubated in TBS-Tween 20 (0.5%) containing 1/2000 anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and 1% dried milk for 1 h (room temperature). Membranes were processed using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For JNK and p38 kinase assays, cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer A (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6). For ERK2 kinase assays or myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation assays, cells were lysed in 0.4 ml of buffer B (1% Nonidet P-40, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cell lysates were extracted for 10 min at 4 °C, and debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). For immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of protein were taken and made up to a final volume of 1 ml in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 40 mmNa4P2O7, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) for JNK or p38 kinase assays, or to 0.5 ml in buffer B for ERK2 and MBP phosphorylation assays. For JNK or ERK2 kinase assays, samples were incubated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, and for MBP phosphorylation or p38 kinase assays, 3 μg of anti-MYC-tag 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody was added for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma; 1:1 in appropriate binding buffer) were added to each sample for incubation for another 1 h (4 °C), and beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed two times in 0.5 ml of appropriate binding buffer. For in vitro kinase assays, beads were washed in respective kinase buffers. JNK and p38 kinase assays were carried out in 30 μl of kinase buffer A (20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 4 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) containing 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000 Ci/mmol) and either 3 μg of GST-c-Jun protein or 3 μg of GST-ATF2 protein, and incubated for 20 min or 30 min, respectively, at 30 °C. ERK2 or MBP kinase assays were carried out in 30 μl of kinase buffer B (20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 0.25 mg/ml MBP, 10 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase assays were terminated in gel sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE for transfer to nitrocellulose. Samples were processed by immunoblotting and analyzed by exposure to film or phosphorimaging (Fuji). Protein normalization and protein expression were confirmed for each sample by immunoblotting of cell lysates or immunoprecipitated material. FLAG-tagged MKK3, MKK4, or MKK7 were transfected and immunoprecipitated as described for FLAG-tagged JNK except that recombinant GST-p38 (MKK3) or GST-JNK (MKK4 or -7) were used as substrate for in vitrokinase assays. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. For microinjection, cells were seeded at 3 × 104/well (15 mm diameter) on glass coverslips (13 mm) and incubated for 2 days. Endotoxin-free plasmid DNA (100 ng/μl, Qiagen) was microinjected into the nuclei of approximately 100 cells (per coverslip), and, after 4 h, cultures were washed with PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2and 0.7 mm MgCl2, fixed for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. To localize MYC-tagged PSK and actin filaments, cells were incubated with 1:500 anti-Myc tag antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by 1:400 FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin together with 0.1 μg/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). To localize PSK and vinculin, cells were incubated with 1:200 rabbit anti-Myc tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1:50 mouse anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma). Cells were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). Image files were collected as a matrix of 1024 by 1024 pixels describing the average of 8 frames scanned at 0.062 Hz, where FITC and TRITC were excited at 488 nm and 543 nm and visualized with bandpass filters of 540 ± 25 and 608 ± 32 nm, respectively. The following plasmids were kindly provided by colleagues; pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 and pGEX-c-Jun (Dr. M. Karin, University of California and Dr. J. Ham, Eisai London Research Laboratories); pRK5-MYC-MLK2 (Dr. M. Terada, NCCRI, Tokyo); pCEF-HA-p38 (Dr. M. H. Cobb, University of Texas); and MKKs 3, 4, 7, GST-p38, and GST-JNK (Dr. R. Davis, Howard Hughes Medical Institute). pEXV-MYC-ERK2 was kindly provided by Dr. C. J.Marshall (Institute of Cancer Research, London), and ERK2 was subcloned into pCMV-FLAG (Sigma). Total RNA was prepared from three surgically removed prostate tumors (Gleason grades 6–8) and used to obtain a profile of kinases expressed in prostatic carcinoma tissues. RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and amplified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides that correspond to the highly conserved amino acid sequences present in subdomains V1 ((I/V)HRDL) and 1X (DVWS(F/L)G) of the kinase catalytic domain (45.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar,46.Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to amplify interconnecting sequences of approximately 200 base pairs between the two subdomains that were specific for each kinase. Sixty-six independent clones were sequenced. Based on this analysis, the deduced amino acid sequences (GenBank and EMBL data bases) identified 15 different tyrosine or serine-threonine kinases including six known receptor kinases (PDGFBR, IGF1-R, VEGFR2, MET, RYK and EPH-A1), six non-receptor kinases (ABL, JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, PLK-1 and EMK), and three novel kinases (Fig.1). Of the three tumors analyzed, one (Gleason grade 6) was more informative. All of the known kinases identified in this screen were represented at least once in this tumor, with IGF1-R being identified the most frequently (31% of clones sequenced for this tumor). Interestingly, 79% of clones sequenced from the other two tumors (Gleason grade 8) encoded PDGFBR, while IGF1-R was sequenced twice and JAK1, ABL, and MET were each sequenced once. We also detected three novel kinases. GenBank data base searches suggested that clone 1 was most related to the STE20 family of serine-threonine kinases with 52% homology to STE20 and clone 2 had most homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans predicted protein C46C2.1 (87%) and the Phycomyces blakesleeanus predicted protein PKPA (60%) (48.Ruizperez V.L. Murillo F.J. Torres-Martinez S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49.Wilson R. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Clone 3 now appears to be the human homolog of mouse PKL12 (50.Ligos J.M. Gerwin N. Fernandez P. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bernad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We chose to focus on the novel kinase, which had significant homology to members of the STE20 family of serine-threonine kinases, because of the role that these proteins play in the regulation of cell growth and survival. This new kinase is analyzed in detail here. 3′ RACE was carried out using a modification of the method of Frohman (51.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This approach generated a PCR fragment of 534 bp, which was used to screen cDNA libraries leading to the isolation of two cDNA clones. One cDNA clone contained an insert of approximately 5 kb and was sequenced on both strands, while the second clone (approximately 3 kb) represented a C-terminally truncated version of the longer clone, lacking an in-frame stop codon.

Although theDrosophila Groucho protein and its mammalian homologs, transducin-like enhancer of split proteins, are known to act as non-DNA binding corepressors, the role of the AES protein remains unclarified. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified the protein-protein interaction between AES and the p65 (RelA) subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which activates various target genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and embryonic development. The interaction between AES and p65 was confirmed byin vitro glutathione S-transferase pull down assay and by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation study. In transient transfection assays, AES repressed p65-driven gene expression. AES also inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression induced by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1, which is an upstream kinase for NF-κB activation. These data indicate that AES acts as a corepressor for NF-κB and suggest that AES may play a pivotal role in the regulation of NF-κB target genes.

The members of the NF-κB family in mammalian cells include the proto-oncogene c-Rel, Rel A (p65), Rel B, NFκB1 (p50/105), and NFκB2 (p52/p100). These proteins share a conserved 300-amino acids region known as the Rel homology domain, which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S.

In most cells, Rel family members form hetero- and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations. p65, Rel B, and c-Rel are transcriptionally active members of the NF-κB family, whereas p50 and p52 primarily serve as mere DNA binding subunits (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 2.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Okamoto T.

The transactivation domains of p65, Rel B, and c-Rel have been mapped in their unique COOH-terminal regions. p65 was shown to contain at least two independent transactivation domains within its COOH-terminal 120 amino acids (5.Moore P.A.

The second domain TA2 is contained within the NH2-terminally adjacent 90 amino acids. A common feature of the regulation of NF-κB family is their sequestration in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes with a class of inhibitory molecules known as IκBs (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 2.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Okamoto T. Sakurada S. Yang J.P.

Treatment of cells with a variety of inducers such as phorbol esters, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) results in phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of the IκB proteins (4.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar, 9.Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin.

The degradation of IκB proteins exposes the nuclear localization sequence in the remaining NF-κB dimers, leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-κB to the DNA regulatory element of target genes (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 2.Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Okamoto T.

In addition to the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB, its transcriptional activity is also regulated by coactivators and corepressors in the nucleus. It has been recently demonstrated that the coactivators, CREB-binding protein and p300, physically interacts with p65 and increase its transcriptional activity (11.Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J.

Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Thus, using the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we searched for protein molecules interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. We have found that p65 physically interacts with the amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES), a 197-amino acid protein homologous to the NH2-terminal region of the Drosophila Groucho protein but lacking COOH-terminal WD40 repeats (13.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14.Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Groucho family includes three types of proteins (15.Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16.Parkhurst S.M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 130-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The larger proteins such as Groucho and its mammalian homologs, transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) 1 through 3, share five domain structures. These proteins exhibit a common feature including an amino-terminal glutamine-rich region (Q domain), a glycine/proline-rich region (GP domain), a CcN domain containing a casein kinase II site and nuclear localization sequence, a serine/proline-rich region (SP domain), and COOH-terminal WD40 repeats (13.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15.Fisher A.L. Caudy M.

Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Three of these domains the Q, CcN, WD40 domains are most highly conserved. A shorter protein, the human TLE4, contains all the domains except for the amino-terminal Q domain. Shortest proteins in the Groucho family, which contain only the Q domain and the GP domain, are designated as AES or the Groucho-related gene (Grg) (13.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14.Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Significant homology is observed in the Q domain between AES and other Groucho proteins except for TLE4. Drosophila Groucho protein and its mammalian homologs, TLEs, have been shown to serve as non-DNA binding corepressors for several transcription factors including the Hairy-related proteins, Runt domain proteins, Engrailed, Dorsal, and lymphoid enhancer factor-1/T-cell factor (18.Paroush Z.

The WD40 repeats in Groucho and TLEs appear to mediate protein-protein interaction with relevant DNA-binding proteins, such as Engrailed and Hairy (19.Jimenez G. Paroush Z. Ish-Horowicz D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,20.Tolkunova E.N. Fujioka M. Kobayashi M. Deka D. Jaynes J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The function of AES, a Groucho-related protein lacking WD40 repeats, remains controversial. Mallo et al. (24.Mallo M. Lieberman P.M. Gridley T. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the in vitro transcription activity of the HeLa nuclear extract was diminished when AES was depleted. Roose et al.(23.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) have shown that XGrg-5, a Xenopus AES homolog lacking WD40 repeats, augmented transcriptional activation of T-cell factor-dependent reporter genes, whereas the XGrg-4, aXenopus Groucho homolog containing WD40 repeats, inhibited TCF-dependent gene expression. From these observations it was suggested that AES may act as an inhibitor of Groucho family corepressors by dominant negative mechanisms. On the other hand, Renet al. (25.Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) have shown that AES mediates positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1/Blimp-1-dependent repression of β-interferon gene and that AES itself can function as a potent repressor when tethered to DNA through the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Here we demonstrate that AES physically interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The interaction between AES and p65 was confirmed byin vitro glutathione S-transferase pull down assay and by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. In transient transfection assays, AES repressed NF-κB-dependent gene expression. These results indicate that AES, even lacking the WD40 repeats can interact with p65 and inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-p65, pRSV-CREB, pCMV-ΔMEKK1, and pIL6-luc were generous gifts from Drs. Yoshiaki Ito (Kyoto University), Masatoshi Hagiwara (Tokyo Medical and Dental University), Gary L. Johnson (University of Colorado), and Shizuo Akira (Hyogo Medical College), respectively. The cDNA of human p65 (amino acids 1–551) was amplified by PCR using pCMV-p65 as a template with oligonucleotides containing BamHI sites (forward, 5′-CCCCCGGATCCCCGGCCATGGACGAACTGTTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-ACCAGGGATCCGGGGAGGGCAGGCGT CACCC-3′). This fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated in frame into a BamHI site of pMAL-c2 (New England BioLabs). The resulting plasmid was named as pMAL-p65. To generate pGBT-p65-(1–286), pGBT-p65-(286–551), pGBT-p65-(286–521), pGBT-p65-(286–470), and pGBT-p65-(286–442), p65 cDNA fragments excised from pMAL-p65 with EcoRI,EcoRI-BamHI, EcoRI-SmaI,EcoRI-SalI, and EcoRI-PstI were ligated in frame into the corresponding sites of pGBT9, respectively. pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521) was generated by digesting pGBT-p65-(286–521) with PvuII and religation. To construct pGBT-p65-(473–522), the cDNA fragment of p65 (amino acids 473–522) was amplified from pCMV-p65 by PCR using oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-CCTGGCATCCGTCGACAACTCCGAATTCCAGCAGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CATTGTGGATCCCCGGGGCCCCCAGTGGAGCAG-3′) containingEcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively. This product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned in frame into pGBT9 at the EcoRI-BamHI site. To generate the mammalian expression plasmid for AES, the cDNA of AES corresponding to amino acids 1–197 was amplified by PCR from human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) using oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-GCCGGGATCCACATGATGTTTCCACAAAGCAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCGGCCTCGAGCTAATCCGACTTCTCGCCATC-3′) containingBamHI and XhoI sites, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated in frame into pCDNA3.1/HisA vector at theBamHI-XhoI site to form pCMV-AES. To construct the mammalian expression vector for TLE1, the cDNA fragment of TLE1 corresponding to amino acids 1–770 was amplified by PCR from cDNA encoding TLE1 (a generous gift from Dr. Stefano Stifani at McGill University) using oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-GCCAGGATCCCGATGTTCCCGCAGAGCCGTCAC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCACATCCTCGAGTCAGTAGATGACTTCATAGACTG-3′) containing BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated in frame into pCDNA3.1/HisA vector at the BamHI-XhoI site to form pCMV-TLE1. To generate the FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vectors, pFLAG-AES and pFLAG-TLE1, the AES and TLE1 cDNA inserts were excised from pCMV-AES and pCMV-TLE1 with BamHI and XhoI and ligated in frame into pCMV-Tag1 expression vector (Stratagene) at the BglII-XhoI site, respectively. Construction of a luciferase reporter plasmid, 4x κB-SV40-luc (4x κBw-luc), containing four tandem copies of the HIV κB sequence upstream of minimal SV40 promoter has been described previously (26.Sato T. Asamitsu K. Yang J.P. Takahashi N. Tetsuka T. Yoneyama A. Kanagawa A. Okamoto T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other luciferase reporter plasmids including 5x κB-TATA-luc (pNFκB-luc), 4x CRE-TATA-luc (pCRE-luc), and 5x Gal4-TATA-luc (pFR-luc) were purchased from Stratagene. These plasmids contain five tandem copies of the NF-κB binding site, four tandem copies of cAMP-response element (CRE) and five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site upstream of the TATA box, respectively. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (27.Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The various portions of the p65 COOH-terminal regions corresponding to amino acids 286–551, 286–521, 286–442/477–521, and 286–470 were fused in-frame to Gal4-DNA-binding domain (1–147) using the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH). They were tested for activation of the Gal4-dependent lac Z expression (β-galactosidase activity). Among them, pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521) was chosen as a bait for library screening, because it had undetectable background, whereas other clones had significant background levels in β-galactosidase assay. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521), and the human placenta cDNA expression library fused to the Gal4 transactivation domain in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). Approximately one million transformants were screened for the ability to grow on the plates with medium lacking tryptophan/leucine/histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Plasmids were rescued from clones that were positive for β-galactosidase activity and identified by nucleotide sequencing. cDNA sequences and their amino acid sequences were compared with GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases for identification of the interacting proteins. Jurkat T lymphocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's recommendations. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and the extracts were prepared for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (27.Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was monitored by Renilla luciferase activity using the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. The data are presented as the fold increase in luciferase activities (mean ± S.E.) relative to control of three independent transfections. Bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins utilized pGEX expression vectors. To generate pGEX-AES, which expresses GST-AES, the AES cDNA insert was excised from pCMV-AES with BamHI and XhoI and ligated in frame into pGEX-5X-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at theBamHI-XhoI site. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified as described (27.Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In vitro protein-protein interaction assays were carried out as described previously (27.Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). p65, AES, and luciferase proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine by the in vitrotranscription/translation procedure using the TNT wheat germ extract-coupled system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 20 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed two times with 1 ml of modified HEMNK buffer (40 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were left in 0.6 ml of HEMNK after the final wash. The beads were incubated with the radiolabeled proteins overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of HEMNK buffer. Bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, 293 cells were transfected with pCMV-p65 and pFLAG-AES or pFLAG-TLE1 expression vectors. Whole cell extract was harvested with whole cell extract buffer (20 mmHEPES at pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The whole cell extract was incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Kodak) or control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads were added and incubated further for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of IP buffer. Antibody-bound complexes were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was incubated with anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as described previously (28.Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11689-11693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29.Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Miller B.W. Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For protein-protein interaction assay using the p65 protein expressed in mammalian cells, the whole cell extract from p65-transfected 293 cells was incubated with GST or GST-AES immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C in IP buffer. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer and two more times with IP buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Bound p65 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-p65 antibody as described above. Because the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB were not sufficient for full activation of NF-κB (30.Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31.Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol.

Thus, we searched for protein molecules interacting with the unique COOH-terminal region adjacent to the transactivation domain of NF-κB p65 using the yeast two-hybrid screening system. As shown in Fig.1 A, various portions of p65,i.e. amino acids 286–551, 286–521, 286–470, and 286–442/477–521 were fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH). Among these clones, pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521) was chosen as a bait, because it had no detectable background in β-galactosidase assay, whereas other clones had significant background levels (TableI). Yeast strain Y190 was used to screen human placenta cDNA expression libraries fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). Approximately one million transformants of cDNA library were screened, and about 90 clones were positive for both nutritional selection and β-galactosidase activity. Nucleotide sequence determination and comparison with GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases revealed that six clones encoded the IκB family, i.e. IκBα/MAD3 (5 clones) and Bcl-3 (one clone). One positive clone was found to be the human AES also named human Grg (13.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J.

The isolated AES lacked a NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1–58), which contains the leucine zipper-like motif (13.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J.

Thus, the leucine zipper-like motif in AES appears not to be required for the interaction with p65. To confirm the interactions between p65 and AES and to determine the region of p65 necessary for binding to AES, various regions of p65 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT9 vector were reintroduced into yeast cells along with pACT2-AES, which is a rescued clone encoding AES (amino acids 59–197) fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain.

Expression of the mutant CBF-B but not the wild-type CBF-B resulted in retardation of fibroblast cell growth.

These results provide direct evidence for the first time that CBF is an important regulator of fibroblast growth. The inhibition of CBF binding reduced expression of various cellular genes including the α2(1) collagen, E2F1, and topoisomerase IIα genes which promoters contain the CBF-binding site.

Among these various elements, several are present in many different polyerase II promoters. In higher eukaryotic promoters, the CCAAT box is most often found between 80 and 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, and the sequences around the CCAAT box of a specific gene are usually highly conserved in different species (1.Bucher P.

A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Human, mouse, and rat CBF subunits show more than 95% amino acid sequence identity among the different mammalian species (8.Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Huisjduijnen R.H.V. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Portions of the amino acid sequences of CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C are also evolutionarily conserved, with a high degree of sequence identity with segments of yeast HAP3, HAP2, and HAP5, respectively. The products of these HAP genes, which are components of the yeast multimeric CCAAT-binding protein, are necessary for expression of genes encoding components of the electron transport chain and thus regulate the respiratory function of yeast (9.McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.McNabb D.S. Tseng K.A.-S. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Previous studies demonstrated that CBF-A and CBF-C interact with each other to form a stable heterodimer and that CBF-B only interacts with the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer, not with CBF-A or CBF-C alone, to form a heterotrimeric CBF molecule which then binds to DNA (7.Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The conserved segments of CBF-A and CBF-C that are necessary for formation of a CBF-DNA complex show amino acid sequence homology with each other. Interestingly, the amino acid sequences of these two CBF segments are similar to the histone-fold motifs of histones H2B and H2A, respectively, and to the archaebacterial histone-like protein Hmf-2 (11.Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12.Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conserved segment of CBF-B that is needed for formation of the CBF-DNA complex shows no homology with the histone-fold motif or with any of the known dimerization motifs found in other heteromeric DNA-binding proteins (15.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis classified CBF as a unique DNA-binding protein.In an in vitro reconstituted transcription system, CBF stimulates transcription of several different mammalian promoters (16.Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This showed that the heterotrimeric CBF contains two transcription activation domain, one present in CBF-B and the other in CBF-C. The two CBF activation domains are rich in glutamine and hydrophobic residues and show similarities to the glutamine-rich activation domain of SP1 transcription factor. The specific DNA sequences that are required for CBF binding have been defined by using a PCR-mediated random binding selection method. This showed that specific sequences flanking to the CCAAT are required for high-affinity CBF binding and that the CCAAT motifs of various mammalian promoters are very similar to the high-affinity CBF-binding site (17.Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Role of CBF in the in vivo transcription of various mammalian genes is still unclear. The CBF-binding sites in promoters have mostly been studied by in vitro transcription assay or by DNA transfection experiments in different cell lines. Generally, mutation in the CBF-binding site results in decreased basal promoter activity. Previous studies of CBF binding in the promoters of serum albumin and major histocompatibility complex class II genes showed that CBF facilitates formation of stable transcription complexes together with tissue-specific transcription factors. This indicated that CBF might regulate the transcription of various promoters by cooperative interaction with promoter-specific transcription factors (18.Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19.Wright K.L. Vilen B.J. Itoh-Lindstorm Y. Moore T.L. Li G. Criscitiello M. Cogswell P. Clarke J.B. Ting J.P.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently, studies of the Xenopus hsp70 promoter showed that CBF binding to this promoter disrupts local chromatin structures and facilitates transcription within the chromatin (20.Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that the Xenopus CBF interacts with p300 acetyltransferase, which modifies chromatin by acetylation, thus suggesting that CBF could regulate the in vivo transcription of various promoters by chromatin modification.To understand in vivo function of CBF in mammalian cells, in this study a dominant negative CBF-B mutant was expressed stably in mouse fibroblast cells under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The consequent expression of the mutant CBF-B inhibited the DNA binding of cellular CBF and interestingly resulted in the retardation of fibroblast cell growth. Our results also showed that the expression of the mutant CBF-B delayed progression of S phase and reduced the expression of several genes which promoters contain CBF-binding site. This result implied that the retardation of cell growth is possibly caused by decreased expression of various cellular genes.DISCUSSIONOur results indicated that stable expression of mutant CBF-B inhibits the DNA binding of cellular CBF and thus acts as a dominant negative mutant in vivo. Interestingly, expression of the mutant but not the wild-type CBF-B resulted in arrest of fibroblast cell growth, which in turn correlated well with the inhibition of CBF binding, thus indicating that the DNA binding activity of CBF is required for normal fibroblast cell growth. The nature of the cell growth arrest was revealed by our flow cytometry, BrdUrd labeling, and TUNEL assay analyses. The flow cytometry and TUNEL assay indicated that the growth arrest is not due to either the growth arrest in specific cell cycle stage or the apoptotic cell death. In contrast, the BrdUrd labeling analysis which measured specifically the DNA synthesizing or the S phase cells, showed that expression of the mutated CBF-B resulted in reduction of BrdUrd-labeled cells indicating that the inhibition of CBF binding decreased the number of cells going through the S phase of cell cycle. In the case of serum starvation/stimulation experiment, the mutant CBF-B was expressed in the Bmut-b cells in the absence of tetracycline during the starvation period and inhibited almost 90% of the cellular CBF binding activity in the quiescent cells. The inhibition of CBF binding in the quiescent Bmut cells did not completely inhibit the serum-stimulated cell growth. However, the doubling time of growth of the Bmut cells expressing mutant CBF-B is two times longer than that of the Bmut cells not expressing mutant CBF-B, thus indicating that the inhibition of CBF binding reduced significantly the rate of progression of cell growth. The BrdUrd labeling analysis of the quiescent cells at different times after serum stimulation clearly showed that the expression of the mutant CBF-B delayed the progression of S phase and also reduced the percentage of cells progressing through the S phase. Thus the inhibition of CBF binding results in inhibition of both the rate of progression of S phase and the amount of cells entering into the S phase which is most likely cause of the retardation of cell growth.The inhibition of CBF binding decreased significantly expression of the α2(1) collagen gene which promoter contained a CBF-binding site. This result is consistent with previous studies which showed that mutation of the CBF-binding site in the collagen promoter decreased in vivo transcription activity of the promoter in a transient transfection experiment in fibroblast cells (26.Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicated that expression of the α2(1) collagen gene is directly regulated by CBF in fibroblasts. Our results also indicated that the inhibition of CBF binding decreased expression of both the E2F1 andtopo IIα genes that are activated at different stages of the cell cycle. The promoters of the mouse E2F1 andtopo IIα genes consist of multiple CBF-binding sites which are also conserved in the corresponding human promoters (37.Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38.Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 39.Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are also directly regulated by CBF. Recent studies of the E2F1 promoter showed that the transcriptional activity of this promoter, like the expression of the endogenous E2F1, is stimulated strongly at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (38.Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The E2F1 promoter consists of multiple DNA elements, including binding sites for E2F, SP1, and CBF transcription factors, that regulate repression of the promoter in G0 and activation in S phase. Those studies revealed that mutation of the E2F site increased the promoter activity in G0 but had little effect in S phase; in contrast, mutation of the CBF-binding site reduced promoter activity only in S phase. These results are consistent with our present observation that the inhibition of CBF binding decreased the activated expression of E2F1 at 15 h after serum stimulation. This indicated that CBF participated in the transcription activation of theE2F1 gene during the period when this gene was stimulated by the growth signal. Since the CBF binding is not regulated during cell growth, it is possible that the CBF-mediated activation of theE2F1 gene is repressed during G0 phase and that, in S phase, CBF activates this gene when the repression is relieved. Recent studies of the mouse topo IIα promoter demonstrated that transcription of this promoter is low in the G1 phase and is stimulated through S phase to a maximal level at G2/M phase of the cell cycle, similar to the case for endogenous topo IIα gene (37.Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the role of the multiple CBF-binding sites in the promoter activity is not known. The human topo IIα promoter also contains multiple CBF-binding sites that, when deleted, resulted in significant loss of the promoter activity, indicating that the CBF-binding sites are part of an upstream activator sequence (39.Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We speculate that activation of the mouse topo IIα is regulated during the cell cycle by derepression of the CBF-mediated activation. Recent studies showed that transcription activation of several cell cycle-regulated promoters, including the promoters of the cyclin A, Cdc2, and CDC25C genes, appeared to be mediated by a derepression mechanism (40.Zwicker J. Muller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These promoters consisted of a cell cycle-regulated repressor element and an upstream activator sequence element which mediate repression and activation of the promoter, respectively. The CBF-binding site is found in the upstream activator sequence of these cell cycle-regulated genes, suggesting that inhibition of CBF binding possibly decreased expression of these genes similar to the E2F1 and topo IIα genes.The inhibition of CBF binding results in a modest decrease of expression of both the E2F1 and topo IIα genes compare with that of the α2(1) collagen gene. The modest decrease ofE2F1 and topo IIα expression is somewhat consistent with the observation that the inhibition of CBF binding only delayed but did not completely block the progression of S phase. It is possible that the decreased expression of the α2(1) collagen gene may partly contribute to the retardation of cell growth. The α2(1) collagen is a subunit of the type I collagen which is part of the extracellular matrix protein. Recent studies showed that the extracellular matrix protein and the mitogens together regulate induction of cyclin D and cyclin A in mouse and human fibroblasts, and play an important role in the anchorage-dependent cell cycle progression (43.Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, a specific role of the type I collagen in the cell growth process is not known. Although the collagen promoter contains a single CBF-binding site, the inhibition of CBF binding reduced the expression of the collagen gene more than that of theE2F1 and topo IIα genes which promoters contain multiple CBF-binding sites. This indicates that the in vivotranscription of these promoters containing CBF-binding sites are not equally dependent on CBF activity. It seems likely that in case of E2F1 and topo IIα, the contribution of CBF in the in vivotranscription is minor and possibly regulated by other transcription factors which bind to these promoters.Our differential display experiments indicated that the inhibition of CBF binding did not result in a significant change in expression of many cellular genes. This experiment, however, identified two genes,Egr1 and Mts1 whose expression is specifically decreased by the inhibition of CBF binding. Analysis of the mouse Egr1 and Mts1 promoters revealed that none of the promoters contain consensus CBF-binding site in the proximal promoter region (31.Tulchinsky E.M. Grigorian M.S. Ebralidze A.K. Milshina N.L. Lukanidin E.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 44.Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), thus indicating that these genes are not directly regulated by CBF. However, it is possible that the CBF-binding site in these promoters may be located in the distal promoter regions which are not yet identified. Altogether our results showed that the inhibition of CBF binding decreased expression of multiple cellular genes, which is consistent with the previous studies that showed that CBF binding to the various promoters is required for optimal transcription activity of the promoters (4.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 18: 459-463Google Scholar). Since expression of none of the genes except the collagen gene are decreased at high levels, it is possible that the inhibition of CBF binding could decrease a smaller amount of expression of many other genes which are required for cell proliferation, and such a smaller decrease of multiple genes could result in significant reduction of the rate of cell growth progression. However, we cannot rule out a possibility that the inhibition of CBF binding could decrease significantly expression of specific gene(s) which are required for the progression of fibroblast growth. Further studies are needed to test all these possibilities.The function of CBF homologues in yeast was studied extensively which showed these genes were specifically required for expression of several nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function (9.McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.McNabb D.S. Tseng K.A.-S. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our present results provide direct evidence for the first time that CBF is an important regulator for the normal growth of mouse fibroblast cells, and that it is required for expression of various mouse genes. However, it is possible that CBF may also be required for expression of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function in mouse cells, and that the inhibition of CBF binding in fibroblast could disrupt the mitochondrial function, and thus cannot produce adequate energy, which could be an important cause for the retardation of fibroblast growth.The function of CBF homologues in other eukaryotes was only revealed recently. For example, disruption of the CBF-C homologue aab1 inNeurospora crassa results in very slow growth and altered morphology, thus indicating pleiotropic effects on growth and development (45.Chen H. Crabb J.W. Kinsey J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and in the higher plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, the CBF-A homologue LEC1 functions at an early developmental stage and activates transcription of genes required for both embryo morphogenesis and cellular differentiation (46.Lotan T. Ohto M-A. Yee K.M. West M.A. Lo R. Kwong R.W. Yamagishi K. Fisher R.L. Goldberg R.B. Harada J.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether these results indicated that the function of CBF has diverged during evolution and that this transcription factor likely plays an important role in growth and development of higher eukaryotes. Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters consist of multiple DNA elements that together control the transcriptional activity of the promoters. Among these various elements, several are present in many different polyerase II promoters. In higher eukaryotic promoters, the CCAAT box is most often found between 80 and 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, and the sequences around the CCAAT box of a specific gene are usually highly conserved in different species (1.Bucher P.

The mammalian CCAAT binding factor CBF1 (also called NF-Y and CP1) which is a ubiquitous transcription factor, consists of three different subunits (CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C), all of which are needed to form a CBF-DNA complex (5.Maity S.N.

A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Human, mouse, and rat CBF subunits show more than 95% amino acid sequence identity among the different mammalian species (8.Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Huisjduijnen R.H.V. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Portions of the amino acid sequences of CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C are also evolutionarily conserved, with a high degree of sequence identity with segments of yeast HAP3, HAP2, and HAP5, respectively. The products of these HAP genes, which are components of the yeast multimeric CCAAT-binding protein, are necessary for expression of genes encoding components of the electron transport chain and thus regulate the respiratory function of yeast (9.McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.McNabb D.S. Tseng K.A.-S. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that CBF-A and CBF-C interact with each other to form a stable heterodimer and that CBF-B only interacts with the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer, not with CBF-A or CBF-C alone, to form a heterotrimeric CBF molecule which then binds to DNA (7.Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The conserved segments of CBF-A and CBF-C that are necessary for formation of a CBF-DNA complex show amino acid sequence homology with each other. Interestingly, the amino acid sequences of these two CBF segments are similar to the histone-fold motifs of histones H2B and H2A, respectively, and to the archaebacterial histone-like protein Hmf-2 (11.Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12.Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conserved segment of CBF-B that is needed for formation of the CBF-DNA complex shows no homology with the histone-fold motif or with any of the known dimerization motifs found in other heteromeric DNA-binding proteins (15.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis classified CBF as a unique DNA-binding protein. In an in vitro reconstituted transcription system, CBF stimulates transcription of several different mammalian promoters (16.Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This showed that the heterotrimeric CBF contains two transcription activation domain, one present in CBF-B and the other in CBF-C. The two CBF activation domains are rich in glutamine and hydrophobic residues and show similarities to the glutamine-rich activation domain of SP1 transcription factor. The specific DNA sequences that are required for CBF binding have been defined by using a PCR-mediated random binding selection method. This showed that specific sequences flanking to the CCAAT are required for high-affinity CBF binding and that the CCAAT motifs of various mammalian promoters are very similar to the high-affinity CBF-binding site (17.Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Role of CBF in the in vivo transcription of various mammalian genes is still unclear. The CBF-binding sites in promoters have mostly been studied by in vitro transcription assay or by DNA transfection experiments in different cell lines. Generally, mutation in the CBF-binding site results in decreased basal promoter activity. Previous studies of CBF binding in the promoters of serum albumin and major histocompatibility complex class II genes showed that CBF facilitates formation of stable transcription complexes together with tissue-specific transcription factors. This indicated that CBF might regulate the transcription of various promoters by cooperative interaction with promoter-specific transcription factors (18.Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19.Wright K.L. Vilen B.J. Itoh-Lindstorm Y. Moore T.L. Li G. Criscitiello M. Cogswell P. Clarke J.B. Ting J.P.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently, studies of the Xenopus hsp70 promoter showed that CBF binding to this promoter disrupts local chromatin structures and facilitates transcription within the chromatin (20.Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that the Xenopus CBF interacts with p300 acetyltransferase, which modifies chromatin by acetylation, thus suggesting that CBF could regulate the in vivo transcription of various promoters by chromatin modification. To understand in vivo function of CBF in mammalian cells, in this study a dominant negative CBF-B mutant was expressed stably in mouse fibroblast cells under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The consequent expression of the mutant CBF-B inhibited the DNA binding of cellular CBF and interestingly resulted in the retardation of fibroblast cell growth. Our results also showed that the expression of the mutant CBF-B delayed progression of S phase and reduced the expressi"

Experimental evidence suggests that Cdx1 may be involved in cell cycle regulation, but its role is ill defined and the mechanisms have not been explored. We used stable transfection of inducible constructs and transient expression with a replication-deficient adenovirus to induce Cdx1 expression in rat IEC6 cells, a non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell line that does not express Cdx1 protein. Expression of Cdx1 markedly reduced proliferation of IEC6 cells with accumulation of cells in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest was accompanied by an increase in the hypophosphorylated forms of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the pRb-related p130 protein. Protein levels of multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were either unchanged (p16, p18, p21, p27, and p57) or were not detected (p15 and p19). Most significantly, levels of cyclins D1 and D2 were markedly diminished with Cdx1 expression, but not cyclins D3, E, or the G<sub>1</sub> kinases. Additionally, cyclin-dependent kinase-4 activity was decreased in association with decreased cyclin D protein. We conclude that Cdx1 regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by inhibiting progression through G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>, most likely via modulation of cyclin D1 and D2 protein levels."

In particular, the human β1- and β2-ARs and the hamster β2-AR mRNA undergo β-agonist-mediated destabilization. By UV cross-linking, we have previously described an ∼M r 36,000 mRNA-binding protein, βARB, that binds to A/C+U-rich nucleotide regions within 3′-untranslated regions. Further, we have demonstrated previously that βARB is immunologically distinct from AUF1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) D, another mRNA-binding protein associated with destabilization of A+U-rich mRNAs (Pende, A., Tremmel, K.

In this report, we describe the peptide composition of βARB. Mass spectrometric analysis of an ∼M r36,000 band isolated from ribosomal salt wash proteins revealed the presence of two mRNA-binding proteins, hnRNP A1, and the elav-like protein, HuR, both of which are known to bind to A+U-rich nucleotide regions. By immunoprecipitation, HuR appears to be the biologically dominant RNA binding component of βARB. Although hnRNP A1 and HuR can both be immunoprecipitated from ribosomal salt wash proteins, the composition of βARB (HuR alone versus HuR and hnRNP A1) appears to be dependent on the mRNA probe used.

However, the details of how accelerated mRNA decay occurs are far from clear.

Further, treatment with β-AR agonist or direct activators of protein kinase A concurrently decreases the half-life of the hamster β2-AR mRNA and increases the abundance of βARB protein (30.Port J.D.

Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11471-11478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, there is strong correlative evidence between the binding of βARB and the ability of that mRNA to undergo β-agonist-mediated destabilization. These findings also support an alternative hypothesis, that disruption of the A+U-rich region of the hamster β2-AR 20-mer likely disrupts the binding of other ARE-binding proteins such as AUF1/hnRNP D (discussed below). In fact, based upon our own work (18.Mitchusson K. Blaxall B.C. Pende A. Brewer G. Port J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)2 and that of others (18.Mitchusson K. Blaxall B.C. Pende A. Brewer G. Port J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of trans-acting factors presumed to either stabilize or destabilize mRNA have been described. In many cases, these proteins display high affinity for A+U-rich or C+U-rich elements within 3′-UTRs. Based upon an association between the presence of an A+U-rich mRNA binding activity and the destabilization of target mRNAs e.g. c-Myc, Brewer et al. (36.Zhang W. Wagner B. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A. DeMaria C. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). AUF1 is similar in class to hnRNPs A1 and A2/B1 in that it contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and an area rich in glycine and arginine residues (an RGG box) (39.Kiledjian M. Novick K. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Xu Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In general, hnRNP proteins, such as hnRNP A1, have been associated with the pre-mRNA, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex where they facilitate the formation of base-paired double strands (42.Dreyfuss G. Matunis M. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Thus, hnRNPs have been implicated in modulating mRNA splicing. However, more recent evidence that hnRNPs (as well as other classes of mRNA-binding proteins) can shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (43.Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 44.Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) has led to the speculation that these proteins may play an additional role in affecting the turnover of A+U-rich mRNAs (46.Hamilton B.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28732-28741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Further investigation of AUF1 indicates that there is a good correlation between the relative affinity of the p37 splice form of AUF1 for specific A+U-rich mRNAs and their intrinsic stability (34.DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These data fit well with the recent findings of Loflin et al. (35.Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), indicating that the p37 and p42 isoforms of AUF1 display a greater ability to destabilize an mRNA than the lower affinity isoforms (p40 and p45). Previously, we have demonstrated that both endogenous and purified recombinant AUF1 binds with high affinity to the A/C+U-rich regions of the human β1-AR, human β2-AR, and hamster β2-AR mRNAs (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further, we have demonstrated that, in cells treated with β-agonist or in tissues obtained from failing human heart, a condition associated with increased circulating catecholamines, AUF1 mRNA and protein are up-regulated (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By these criteria, the mRNA binding activity, βARB, and p37AUF1 are highly similar. However, by immunological methods, we have demonstrated that βARB and AUF1 are distinct proteins (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J. Bristow M.R.

We have speculated, therefore, that βARB may either be another hnRNP know to bind A+U-rich regions (46.Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol.

In this manuscript, we describe for the first time the peptide composition of βARB, as determined by both direct chemical sequencing (mass spectrometry) and by immunological methods. Additionally, by nondenaturing gel-shift analysis, we have determined the affinity of βARB protein components for different β-AR mRNA substrates. Finally, we demonstrate that the composition of βARB is dependent on the RNA target used for its identification. DDT1-MF2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) as described previously (29.Pende A.

To up-regulate βARB, cells were treated with the β-AR agonist, (−)-isoproterenol (10 μm for 48 h) (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J. Bristow M.R.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 2.6 mm KCl, 136 mm NaCl) and removed from the cell culture plate with PBS, 1 mm EDTA. The cells were then pelleted gently, resuspended in PBS, transferred to a sterile ultracentrifuge tube, and again pelleted gently. Excess buffer was removed, and 5 μl each of the protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml) aprotinin and leupeptin were added to the cells (∼ final (12.5 μg/ml) for each protease inhibitor). The cells were then spun at 100,000 × g using a Beckman Ti50 rotor and thick-walled, sterile, polycarbonate tubes, for 90 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were then transferred to Eppendorf tubes and placed on ice. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Lowry (60.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic S130 and polysome fractions, and RSW preparations were produced as described previously (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J. Bristow M.R.

Briefly, cells were washed with cold, serum-free medium, resuspended in 3.5 ml of Polysome Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were homogenized and centrifuged to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was removed and layered gently over a 1.5- ml sucrose (30% w/v) cushion and centrifuged at 130,000 × g in a Beckman SW60Ti rotor. The S130 supernatant was removed from above the S130/sucrose interface, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. To recover the polysome fraction, the sucrose cushion was aspirated off and the tubes allowed to drain while kept at 4 °C. To prepare an RSW, polysomes were resuspended in Polysome Buffer A and 4 m KCl was added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.3 m. After stirring, KCl-treated polysomes were re-pelleted through Polysome Buffer B (Polysome Buffer A with 30% w/v sucrose) as described above. The supernatant (RSW), generally containing ∼80% of polysome-associated 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity, was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

Plasmids were linearized immediately 3′ to the target DNA insert, and in vitro transcription was performed using T3 DNA-directed RNA polymerase to produce 5′-capped, uniformly labeled mRNAs based on the technique of Melton et al.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). mRNAs were transcribed in the presence of RNasin with nucleotide concentrations and buffer conditions as detailed by the manufacturer (Promega). Co-transcriptional capping was achieved by using the cap analogue m7(5′)Gppp(5′)G (New England Biolabs) at a concentration that was 10-fold in excess to the concentration of GTP. Radiolabeled probes were prepared using [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Biotinylation of the probes was achieved using biotin-14-CTP (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following transcription, RNase-free DNase (Promega) was added to the mixture to remove the template DNA and the probe was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 0.5 m ammonium acetate in ethanol. Radiolabeled probes were resuspended in RNase-free water. Biotinylated probes were resuspended in Column Buffer (75 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgOAc, 1 mm KOAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with a 1:1000 dilution of each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml), pepstatin (5 mg/ml), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), and RNasin (40 units/μl). All probes were maintained at −80 °C and used within 24 h of synthesis. UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (29.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.

Cooperative binding ofl-tryptophan activates TRAP so that it can bind to RNA. The crystal structure revealed that l-tryptophan forms nine hydrogen bonds with various amino acid residues of TRAP. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine the importance of several of these hydrogen bonds in TRAP activation. We tested both alanine substitutions as well as substitutions more closely related to the natural amino acid at appropriate positions. Tryptophan binding mutations were identified in vivo having unchanged, reduced, or completely eliminated repression activity. Several of thein vivo defective TRAP mutants exhibited reduced affinity for tryptophan in vitro but did not interfere with RNA binding at saturating tryptophan concentrations. However, a 10-fold decrease in TRAP affinity for tryptophan led to an almost complete loss of regulation, whereas increased TRAP affinity for tryptophan had little or no effect on the in vivo regulatory activity of TRAP. One hydrogen bond was found to be dispensable for TRAP activity, whereas two others appear to be essential for TRAP function.

We also found that trp leader RNA increases the affinity of TRAP for tryptophan. trpRNA-binding attenuation protein wild type Expression of the Bacillus subtilis tryptophan biosynthetic (trp) genes is negatively regulated in response to tryptophan by TRAP,1 thetrp RNA-binding attenuation protein, which is the product of the mtrB gene (reviewed in 1). TRAP-mediated regulation of the trp genes includes a transcription attenuation and two translation control mechanisms. The untranslated trp operon leader transcript contains inverted repeats that allow folding of the transcript to form three RNA secondary structures. Two of these structures, the antiterminator and terminator, overlap by four nucleotides and therefore are mutually exclusive (Fig.1) (2.Shimotsu H. Kuroda M.I. Yanofsky C. Henner D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Gollnick P. Ishino S. Kuroda M.I.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TRAP binding target in thetrp leader transcript consists of 11 (G/U)AG repeats, six of which are present within the antiterminator (6.Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When activated by tryptophan, TRAP binds to the 11 triplet repeats, which prevents formation of the antiterminator structure. This allows formation of the overlapping terminator, which promotes transcription termination upstream of the trp structural genes. In the absence of TRAP binding, the antiterminator structure forms, which results in transcription of the entire operon (7.Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An additional RNA secondary structure forms at the extreme 5′-end of the B. subtilis trpleader transcript. Disruption of the 5′-stem loop results in a substantial reduction in trp operon regulation in vivo and reduced affinity of TRAP for trp leader RNAin vitro (9.Sudershana S. Du H. Mahalanabis M. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5742-5749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP-5′-stem loop RNA interaction reduces the number of (G/U)AG repeats required for stable TRAP-trpleader RNA association. Thus it appears that the 5′-structure increases the rate of TRAP-trp leader RNA association, promoting the likelihood that tryptophan-activated TRAP binds to the nascenttrp leader transcript before the antiterminator can form. 2H. Du, A.V. Yakhnin, S. Dharmaraj, and P. Babitzke, unpublished results. 2H. Du, A.V. Yakhnin, S. Dharmaraj, and P. Babitzke, unpublished results. Cooperative binding of l-tryptophan between every adjacent TRAP subunit activates the 11-subunit TRAP complex. The crystal structure of TRAP complexed with tryptophan revealed that tryptophan forms nine hydrogen bonds with various amino acid residues of TRAP (Fig. 2) (10.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine the relative importance of several of these hydrogen bonds in TRAP activation. We tested both alanine-substituted mutants as well as substitutions more closely related to the natural amino acid at appropriate positions. Several of these substitutions were expected to disrupt hydrogen bond formation between TRAP and tryptophan, whereas others were not expected to disrupt TRAP function. The regulatory activity of each mutant TRAP was tested in vivo, whereas the tryptophan binding and RNA binding activities of each mutant protein were tested in vitro. Our results indicate that one hydrogen bond between TRAP and tryptophan that was predicted by the crystal structure is dispensable for TRAP activity, whereas two other hydrogen bonds appear to be essential for TRAP function. We also determined that the trp leader RNA increases the affinity of TRAP for tryptophan, presumably by stabilizing the interaction of TRAP with tryptophan. The B. subtilisstrains used in this study are described in Table I. The plasmid pTZ18mtrAB was described (5.Babitzke P. Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J.

Site-directed mutagenesis ofmtrB using pTZ18mtrAB, mutagenic DNA oligonucleotides, and the MORPH mutagenesis kit was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc.).

The culture medium was supplemented with tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml), and kanamycin (5 μg/ml). The β-galactosidase activity is reported in Miller units (14.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant mtrBgenes were overexpressed using the T7 RNA polymerase system described by Tabor and Richardson (11.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified by a published procedure (8.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or by a simplified protocol. Cells (2.5 g of wet weight) were suspended in 15 ml of 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 1 mm EDTA. 150 μl of isoamyl alcohol was added to prevent foaming during cell lysis. Cells were lysed by continuous sonication for 10 min (50% pulses) in an ice-water bath. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then heated for 10 min in boiling water. All TRAP mutants remained soluble during this step. Denatured proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 ×g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded at room temperature onto a 3-ml P11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) column equilibrated with buffer A (12 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 50 mm sodium chloride, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The column was washed with 7.5 ml of buffer A and then with 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 m sodium chloride. TRAP was eluted with 7.5 ml of buffer A containing 1 m sodium chloride. Protein was concentrated using a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration unit (Millipore). The retentate was diluted 3-fold in buffer A and concentrated as described above to a final volume of 1.2 ml. The pellet formed during this step was removed by centrifugation for 15 min (12,000 × g). β-Mercaptoethanol (0.1% final concentration) was added to all buffers for the S53C mutant protein purification. TRAP purity was assessed by electrophoresis through 16% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Wild type and mutant TRAP proteins purified according to this procedure were as active as those purified by a previous method (8.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The affinities of wild type and mutant TRAP proteins were determined by equilibrium dialysis using [3H]l-tryptophan (NEN Life Science Products) and purified TRAP by modifying a published procedure (10.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The buffer used in this analysis consisted of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2. [3H]l-Tryptophan at various concentrations (1–2187 μm) and TRAP (1–15 μm) were injected into opposite sides of 12–14-kDa cut-off membrane in an EMD101 equilibrium dialyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation at 4 °C for 16–24 h, duplicate 10-μl aliquots were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The data were fit to the Hill equation to describe the cooperative multisite binding of tryptophan to TRAP (see below). The RNA used in the gel mobility shift experiments was synthesized in vitro using the Ambion MEGAscript kit and plasmid pPB77 linearized with BamHI as template (6.Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transcript contained nucleotides +1 to +111 of theB. subtilis trp leader. The RNA was gel-purified (15.Du H. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20494-20503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and subsequently dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reaction mixtures (8 μl) contained 50 mmTris·acetate (pH 8.0), 4 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml E. coli tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanol and 400 units/ml RNasin (Promega). 0.2 nm 5′-End-labeled trp leader RNA and 1.2 mml-tryptophan were used for TRAP dilution experiments. 0.5 nm 5′-End-labeled trpleader RNA and 320 nm TRAP were used forl-tryptophan dilution experiments. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were then fractionated on native 10% polyacrylamide gels in 375 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.8), 5% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. The running buffer was 25 mm Tris·glycine (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA. Dried gels were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The bands corresponding to free and bound RNA were quantified using ImageQuant software. The binding data were fit to the simple binding equation, RNAb=a×[TRAP] i/(Kd+[TRAP] f)Equation 1 where a is the saturation level of the fraction RNA bound (RNAb); K d is the concentration of free protein, [TRAP]f, at which the RNAb reaches 50% saturation; RNAb is the fraction of RNA bound between 0 and 1; [TRAP]f is the concentration of free TRAP 11-mer, which was assumed to be the concentration of total TRAP added because the total TRAP concentration was at least in 12-fold molar excess over RNA. The tryptophan and RNA binding data were also fit to the cooperativity equations, Trpb=a×([Trp] f/S0.5) n/(1+([Trp] f/S0.5) n)Equation 2 RNAb=a×([Trp] f/S0.5) n/(1+([Trp] f/S0.5) n)Equation 3 RNAb=a×([TRAP] f/S0.5) n/(1+([TRAP] f/S0.5) n)Equation 4 where a is the saturation level of the fraction of bound RNA (RNAb) or tryptophan (Trpb); S0.5 is the concentration of free protein, [TRAP]f, or free tryptophan, [Trp]f, at which the RNAb or Trpb, respectively, reach 50% saturation; RNAb and Trpb are the fractions of bound RNA or tryptophan, respectively, between 0 and 1; [TRAP]f and [Trp]fare the concentrations of free TRAP 11-mer or tryptophan, respectively, which were assumed to be the concentration of total TRAP or tryptophan added. The cooperativity coefficient, n, is used to describe the cooperativity of binding (16.Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The binding of [3H]l-tryptophan to wild type and mutant TRAP proteins in the presence or absence of RNA was examined by modifying a published filter binding assay (17.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12452-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) containing various concentrations of [3H]l-tryptophan were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.2 μm TRAP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5 units RNasin in buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2. In some assays, gel-purified RNA (see gel mobility shift assay) was added to binding assays at a 10-fold excess (2 μm) over the TRAP concentration. Mixtures were filtered, the filters were washed four times with 0.1 ml of the same buffer, and the retained tryptophan was quantified in a scintillation counter. The x-ray crystal structure of TRAP in the presence of bound tryptophan indicates that tryptophan forms nine hydrogen bonds with various amino acid residues of TRAP (Fig. 2) (10.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on this structural information, point mutations were introduced into mtrB by site-directed mutagenesis to alter amino acid residues predicted to be involved in tryptophan binding. These TRAP mutants were also isolated to decipher which of the hydrogen bonds were required for the presumed conformational changes that allow TRAP interaction with RNA. Note that structural information of non-tryptophan-activated TRAP is unavailable. We tested both alanine-substituted mutants as well as substitutions more closely related to the natural amino acid at appropriate positions. A trpE'-'lacZ translational fusion was used to assess the level of trp operon expression in B. subtilisstrains containing wild type or mutant TRAP proteins (TableI). Each of these strains contained the entire trp operon at its natural chromosomal location, a single copy trpE'-'lacZ translational fusion under the control of the wild type trp promoter and leader integrated into amyE and a defective chromosomal copy ofmtrB (13.Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This genetic background was used to measure the relative levels of trp operon expression from thetrpE'-'lacZ translational fusion in strains containing wild type or mutant plasmid-borne mtrB alleles. β-Galactosidase activity in the positive control strain bearing wild type (WT) mtrB was reduced 700-fold when cultures were grown in the presence of tryptophan compared with cultures grown in its absence (Table II). In the negative control strain (no TRAP) β-galactosidase activity was similar when cultures were grown in the presence or absence of tryptophan (Table II). Of the eleven strains containing mutant TRAP, two exhibited wild type regulation (Q47E, S53A), four showed intermediate regulation (Q47A, Q47M, T52A, and S53C), and five were unable to regulate expression in response to tryptophan (T30A, T30V, T49A, T49V, and T52V) (Table II). Thus, nine of the elevenmtrB mutations severely affected the ability of the resulting TRAP complex to regulate trp operon expressionin vivo.Table IIIn vivo regulatory defects of TRAP mutantsTRAP mutantaThr-30, Thr-49, Thr-52, and Ser-53 form side chain hydrogen bonds with l-tryptophan, whereas Gln-47 forms main chain hydrogen bonds with l-tryptophan (see Fig. 2).β-Galactosidase activitybB. subtilis strains carried a null chromosomalmtrB (TRAP) allele, a trpE′-′lacZ translational fusion under control of the trp promoter and leader region, and a plasmid carrying the indicated mtrB (TRAP) allele. β-Galactosidase activity expressed from the trpE′-′lacZfusion is given in Miller units.

Open table in a new tab To determine if the in vivo defects caused by themtrB mutations were due to altered tryptophan binding, equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed in vitrowith purified wild type or mutant TRAP proteins. The S0.5value determined for wild type TRAP was 6.6 μm (TableIII). The Q47E and S53A mutant TRAP proteins bound tryptophan with similar affinities as wild type TRAP, consistent with the in vivo expression study (Tables II andIII). We did not observe detectable tryptophan binding with the remaining TRAP mutants at a 1-μm protein concentration; however, tryptophan binding with reduced affinity was observed for the Q47A, Q47M, T52A, and T52V mutant proteins at a concentration of 15 μm (Table III). Note that three of these four substitutions (Q47A, Q47M, T52A) retained partial regulatory activityin vivo. Also note that whereas equilibrium dialysis did not detect tryptophan binding to S53C in vitro (Table III), this mutant protein retained partial regulatory activity in vivo(Table II). Thus with the exception of T52V and S53C, the affinity of the mutant proteins for tryptophan determined in vitrocorrelated with their regulatory activity in vivo.Table IIIIn vitro activities of mutant TRAP proteinsEquilibrium dialysisaThe levels of the fraction of boundl-tryptophan were fit to a cooperative binding equation to give binding constants (S0.5).Gel shift analysisbRNA gel mobility shifts were performed as a function of TRAP concentration ([TRAP]) or l-tryptophan concentration ([l-tryptophan]).

Open table in a new tab To determine if the mutant TRAP proteins could bind to trpleader RNA we performed gel mobility shift assays using a saturating tryptophan concentration (1.2 mm). We found that the T49A substitution led to the complete loss of RNA binding activity. All of the remaining proteins, as well as wild type TRAP, bound trpleader RNA in a cooperative manner (positive n value) (Fig.3 and Table III). Of these mutant proteins, only T30A, T30V, T49V, and S53C exhibited a reduced affinity for RNA (at least 3-fold). However, we did observe a 2- to 3-fold increase in the affinity for RNA with the S53A mutant protein. The affinities of the remaining mutant proteins were comparable to that of wild type TRAP (Fig. 3 and Table III). With the exception of T30V, RNA binding was dependent on tryptophan (Fig.4 and Table III).Figure 4TRAP -trp leader RNA gel mobility shift analysis as a function of l-tryptophan concentration. Four representative gels are shown. Assays contained 0.5 nm 5′-32P end-labeledtrp operon leader RNA, 320 nm TRAP, and various concentrations of l-tryptophan (L-trp). With the exception of T30V, the first lane in each gel corresponds to binding reactions in the absence of tryptophan. For T30V the first lane, denoted by −, corresponds to a binding reaction in which TRAP was omitted, whereas the second lane corresponds to a reaction withoutl-tryptophan. The remaining lanes for WT, T30V, and S53A TRAP correspond to reactions that contained serial 2-fold increases of tryptophan ranging from 0.5 to 512 μm. The remaining lanes for T52A correspond to serial 2-fold increases of tryptophan ranging from 1 to 1024 μm. The positions of bound (B) and free (F) RNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because wild type TRAP can only bind RNA tightly when activated by tryptophan, the gel mobility shift assay was also used to examine the affinities of wild type and mutant TRAP for tryptophan indirectly using serial tryptophan dilutions. However this technique could not be used for the T30A, T49A, and T49V mutants, which had substantially reduced or eliminated RNA binding activity. In contrast to the TRAP dilution experiments, the positions of shifted RNA complexes in the tryptophan dilution experiments were dependent on the tryptophan concentration (Fig. 4). This effect was likely caused by disruption of the TRAP-RNA complex during gel running due to the dissociation of tryptophan. The Q47E mutant protein that exhibited wild type-like regulation in vivo bound tryptophan with a similar affinity as wild type TRAP. Interestingly, the S53A mutant TRAP had a 2.5-fold higher affinity than wild type TRAP for tryptophan (Fig. 4 and Table III). We also found that the T30V mutant protein possessed tryptophan-independent RNA binding activity. All of the remaining mutant proteins had reduced affinities for tryptophan (Table III) that correlated with their reduced ability to regulate trp operon expression in vivo (Table II). With the exception of T52V, all of the tryptophan-dependent mutant TRAP proteins retained the positive cooperativity of tryptophan binding that was previously observed for wild type TRAP (Table III) (10.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16.Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Note that T52V TRAP exhibited a negative cooperativity for tryptophan binding in this assay in contrast to the positive cooperativity that was demonstrated for this protein by equilibrium dialysis (Table III). Also note that the dissociation constants of tryptophan binding determined by gel mobility shift assays were substantially lower than those determined by equilibrium dialysis (Table III). It was possible that the apparent discrepancy in tryptophan S0.5 values measured by equilibrium dialysis and gel retardation techniques may have resulted because the equilibrium dialysis experiments were carried out in the absence of RNA, whereas the gel mobility shift assay measured the affinity of tryptophan indirectly via RNA binding. This suggested that TRAP-trpleader RNA interaction could increase the affinity of TRAP for tryptophan. A filter binding assay was used to test this hypothesis. We found that the affinity of TRAP for tryptophan increased substantially in the presence of trp leader RNA. The relative amount of tryptophan bound as a function of tryptophan concentration for the wild type and Q47E TRAP proteins are shown in Fig.5. In addition, the Q47A, Q47M, T52A, and T52V mutant proteins that retained appreciable RNA binding activity exhibited increased affinity for tryptophan in the presence of thetrp leader transcript (data not shown). These results demonstrate that RNA binding stabilizes the interaction of TRAP with tryptophan. Through the use of site-directed mutagenesis several mutant forms of TRAP were generated, each containing a different single amino acid substitution in the tryptophan binding pocket. The TRAP mutants were used to decipher the relative importance of various hydrogen bonds that form between TRAP and tryptophan. A trpE‘-‘lacZtranslational fusion reporter construct was used to assess the amount of trp operon expression in B. subtilis strains containing wild type or mutant TRAP. Several classes of tryptophan binding mutations were identified in vivo having unchanged (Q47E and S53A), reduced (Q47A, Q47M, T52A, and S53C), or completely eliminated (T30A, T30V, T49A, T49V, and T52V) repression activity (Table II). The RNA binding activity of mutant TRAP proteins was examined in vitro using a gel mobility shift assay with purified wild type or mutant proteins. Three of the five TRAP mutants that were inactive in vivo (T30A, T49A, and T49V) exhibited a more than 10-fold reduction in affinity for trp leader RNA at a saturating tryptophan concentration (Table III). Thus, the functional defects observed in vivo for the remaining TRAP mutants could not be attributed to the inability to bind totrp leader RNA. The affinity of wild type and mutant TRAP proteins for tryptophan was examined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, gel mobility shift, and filter binding experiments (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Table III). We determined that the wild type and mutant TRAP proteins boundtrp leader RNA in a cooperative manner, although the nature of this cooperativity is unknown. Cooperative RNA binding was not a result of the ligand dependence because the tryptophan-independent T30V mutant protein exhibited the same positive cooperativity (Table III). We also found that the affinities of the Q47E and S53A TRAP proteins for tryptophan were similar to wild type TRAP, consistent with thein vivo results where we observed wild type-like regulation (Table II). Several of the mutant proteins (Q47A, Q47M, T52A, and T52V) bound tryptophan with reduced affinity but did not interfere with RNA binding at saturating tryptophan concentrations (Table III), suggesting that the in vivo concentration of tryptophan was too low to activate these mutant proteins (Table II). In contrast, the reduced affinity between tryptophan and other mutant TRAP proteins (T30A, T49A, T49V, and S53C) resulted in a substantial reduction in affinity fortrp leader RNA (Table III). We found that a 10-fold decrease in TRAP affinity for tryptophan in vitro led to an almost complete loss of regulation in vivo, whereas increased affinity for tryptophan and RNA by the S53A mutant protein had little or no effect on the in vivo regulatory activity of TRAP. Taken together, our results indicate that the hydrogen bond between Ser-53 and tryptophan is dispensable for TRAP function, whereas the hydrogen bonds formed with Thr-30 and Thr-49 appear to be essential. In addition, we found that the interaction between TRAP and tryptophan was stabilized when bound to RNA (Fig. 5). Many of the results of this study were not predicted. For instance in wild type TRAP, Gln-47 forms a hydrogen bond with tryptophan through a main chain interaction. Thus, substitutions at this position were not expected to affect TRAP function. However we found that only the conservative Q47E replacement did not result in functional defects. In addition, the S53C substitution was expected to maintain the natural hydrogen bond in contrast to the disrupting S53A substitution. However, we found that the hydrogen bond formed by Ser-53 was dispensable for tryptophan binding, because S53A substitution results in a wild type-like protein. The severe effect of the S53C substitution may be due to the more acidic nature of the cysteine sulfhydryl group in comparison with the serine hydroxyl group. The partial ionization of the cysteine side chain could be deleterious for the interaction with the negatively charged carboxyl group of tryptophan. The most surprising finding is that the T30V substitution results in the constitutive conformational change(s) required to allow TRAP interaction with RNA. It is possible that the valine side chain in the T30V mutant protein results in hydrophobic interactions with other amino acid residues normally involved in binding the indole ring of tryptophan, thereby mimicking the tryptophan-bound conformation of wild type TRAP. This assumption is consistent with the observation that no tryptophan binding could be detected for this mutant by any of the techniques used in this study. Finally, whereas the dependence of tryptophan activation to allow TRAP-trp leader RNA interaction is well established (6.Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12452-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration of the trp leader RNA dependence on the affinity of TRAP for tryptophan. The results obtained in vitro are consistent with each other, but there are some apparent discrepancies with the in vivo observations. We would have expected that the tryptophan-independent T30V mutant protein would have resulted in low expression in the presence or absence of tryptophan in vivo. Instead, this mutant strain exhibited high level constitutive expression. This protein was successfully overproduced in E. coli in soluble form and was as stable in vitro as wild type TRAP. Thus, the inability to repress trp operon expression in vivo was unlikely due to incorrect folding. It is possible that the artificially active conformation of this mutant protein caused a relaxation in its specificity in RNA recognition and a corresponding competition by the random cellular RNAs. However, the ability of this mutant protein to bind to a randomly chosen competitor RNA could not be demonstrated in vitro (data not shown). An apparent discrepancy was also observed for T52V. This mutant protein had affinities for RNA and tryptophan that were similar to the T52A substitution at the same position; however, T52V resulted in the complete loss of in vivo repression, whereas T52A only exhibited reduced repression. Because T52V was the only substitution that resulted in negative cooperativity in tryptophan binding, the loss of cooperativity might be the reason for its severe defect in vivo. The opposite situation was observed for the S53C substitution. S53C retained some in vivo regulatory activity but exhibited greatly reduced affinities for both RNA and tryptophanin vitro. The reducing conditions used for purification and the in vitro assays for this mutant protein make it unlikely that the reduced affinities observed in vitro were due to oxidation. As was mentioned above, the defect of this mutant may be due to the partial ionization of its cysteine sulfhydryl group. The pH used in the in vitro experiments (pH 8.0) may be more favorable for cysteine ionization than the pH in vivo. Three-dimensional structures allow us to determine all protein-ligand contacts but are not capable of establishing the relative importance of these interactions. Our structure-function analysis using site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to obtain a substantial amount of information concerning the activation of TRAP by tryptophan and its role in regulating trp gene expression. Thus our study highlights the importance of testing predictions based on structural information. We thank Phil Bevilacqua and Craig Cameron for discussions throughout the course of this study.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), an important transcription factor for iNOS gene expression, is also activated and translocated to the nucleus. In the present study, we found that vicinal dithiol-binding agent, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), inhibited the induction of iNOS protein and mRNA as well as the release of nitrite (nitric oxide metabolite) into the culture medium. Simultaneous addition of a vicinal dithiol compound, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, with PAO completely abolished these inhibitions. PAO could not prevent either degradation of an inhibitory protein, IκB, of NF-κB or translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. However, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that PAO decreased the interaction between NF-κB and its binding consensus oligonucleotide. Transfection experiments with iNOS promoter-luciferase construct revealed that PAO inhibited NF-κB binding to DNA. These results indicate that PAO inhibits iNOS gene expression at a step of NF-κB binding to DNA by modifying its vicinal dithiol moiety, which may play a crucial role for the iNOS regulation in hepatocytes.

Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5742) Google Scholar). NOS can be classified into two groups, constitutive NOS and inducible NOS (iNOS). Constitutive NOS is present in tissues such as the endothelium and brain (2.Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar), but iNOS is present in negligible quantities under physiological conditions. During inflammation, injury, and infection, lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines induce iNOS in some tissues and organs including vascular vessels, kidney, and liver (4.Knowel R.G. Merrett M. Salter M. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5.Spitzer J.A.

Induction of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide contributes to the pathogenesis of septic shock (7.Petros A. Bennett D. Vallance P. Lancet. 1991; 338: 1557-1558Abstract PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), leading to organ destruction, including the liver. We (8.Kitade H. Sakitani K. Inoue K. Masu Y. Kawada N. Hiramatsu Y. Kamiyama Y. Okumura T. Ito S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar) and others (9.Geller D.A. de Vera M.E. Russell D.A. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4890-4898PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that a single cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) mimicked the in vivoinduction of iNOS in cultured hepatocytes. Other cytokines such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interferon γ had no effect under the same conditions (8.Kitade H. Sakitani K. Inoue K. Masu Y. Kawada N. Hiramatsu Y. Kamiyama Y. Okumura T. Ito S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar), although a combination of these cytokines and lipopolysaccharide stimulated the nitric oxide production (10.Nussler A.K.

A high level of nitric oxide production by iNOS influences various hepatic metabolism and functions, where nitric oxide inhibits the mitochondrial Krebs cycle enzyme (12.Stadler J. Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Stuehr D.J. Ochao J.B. Simmons R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C910-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ATP synthesis (13.Kitade H. Kanemaki T. Sakitani K. Inoue K. Kamiya T. Nakagawa M. Hiramatsu Y. Kamiyama Y. Ito S. Okumura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IL-1β is a key mediator in the inflammatory response and has been shown to activate the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), that is critical for the inducible expression of many genes involved in inflammation (14.O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The promoters of murine and human genes encoding iNOS contain a consensus sequence for the binding of NF-κB (15.Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 16.Nunokawa Y. Oikawa S. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1996; 223: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which is necessary to confer inducibility by cytokines. To induce iNOS mRNA, activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is essential although not sufficient by itself (18.Beck K.F. Sterzel R.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19.Spitsin S.V. Farber J.L. Bertovich M. Moehren G. Koprowski H. Michaels F.H. Mol.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is triggered by changes in the redox state (21.Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As mentioned before, IL-1β activated and translocated NF-κB to the nucleus, resulting in the induction of iNOS gene expression, in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (22.Sakitani K. Kitade H. Inoue K. Kamiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Okumura T. Ito S. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NF-κB is typically found in the form of p50/p65 heterodimers attached to the inhibitory molecule (IκB) in the cytoplasm of cells (23.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB involves (i) proteolytic degradation of IκB following the phosphorylation by IκB kinase (24.Didonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar, 25.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), (ii) translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, and (iii) binding to the promoter κB site of a target gene. The last step requires reduced cysteine residue(s) of NF-κB (26.Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the thiol residues in NF-κB molecule on the induction of iNOS in hepatocytes is obscure. deVera et al.(27.de Vera M.E. Kim Y.M. Wong H.R. Wang Q. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that sodium arsenite inhibited cytokine-inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in rat hepatocytes. Recently, Shumillaet al. (28.Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that thiol-reactive metals such as chromium, cadmium, mercury, zinc, and arsenite inhibited NF-κB binding to DNA in vitro. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO), arsine oxide derivative, interacts strongly with vicinal dithiol-containing molecules including enzymes and transcription factors (29.Kalef E. Walfish P.G. Gitler C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PAO also interacts with small molecular weight dithiol compounds such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanol and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) but hardly interacts with monothiol compounds (30.Zahler W.L. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 716-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports prompted us to investigate 1) whether arsine oxide derivative, PAO, inhibits the production of nitric oxide induced by IL-1β in hepatocytes and, if so, 2) which step of iNOS induction including NF-κB activation is influenced by PAO. In the present study, we found that PAO inhibited IL-1β-induced nitric oxide production by blocking a step of NF-κB binding to DNA, but not the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. Recombinant human IL-1β (2 × 107 units/mg of protein) was generously provided by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokushima, Japan). [γ-32P]ATP (−222 TBq/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (−111 TBq/mmol) were from DuPont NEN Japan (Tokyo). PAO was purchased from Aldrich and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar strain rats (200–250 g) by collagenase perfusion as described previously (31.Kanemaki T. Kitade H. Hiramatsu Y. Kamiyama Y. Okumura T. Prostaglandins. 1993; 45: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kansai Medical University. The isolated hepatocytes were suspended in culture medium at 5.5–6.0 × 105 cells/ml, seeded onto plastic dishes (2 ml/dish, 35 × 10 mm; 9 cm2, Falcon Plastic, Oxnard, CA), and then cultured as monolayers in a CO2 incubator (under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air) at 37 °C. The culture medium used was Williams' medium E supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, Hepes (5 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), dexamethasone (10 nm), and insulin (10 nm). After 6–7 h, the medium was replaced by fresh serum- and hormone-free medium (1.5 ml/dish), and the cells were cultured overnight and then used for the experiments. The purity of isolated hepatocytes was greater than 98% by microscopic observation (32.Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The number of cells attached to the dishes was calculated from the number of cell nuclei (33.Horiuti Y. Ogishima M. Yano K. Shibuya Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The nucleus/cell ratio was 1.37 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.E.,n = 7). On day 1, cultured hepatocytes were washed with Williams' medium E, and the same medium was added (1 ml/dish). Then, IL-1β (1 nm, 347 units/ml) was added to the medium in the absence and presence of PAO, and cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator. Alternatively, cells were pretreated with PAO for 15 min, washed with the medium, and then incubated with IL-1β. In our preliminary experiment, we measured the sum of NO2− and NO3−in culture medium; the conditioned medium was reduced with nitrate reductase and then was assayed (NO assay kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). IL-1β increased the release of NO2− + NO3− into the medium, where the ratios of NO2−: NO3− are approximately 1:2 (34.Kaibori M. Sakitani K. Oda M. Kamiyama Y. Masu Y. Nishizawa M. Ito S. Okumura T. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 1138-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that PAO inhibited the release of NO2− + NO3− dose-dependently but did not change the ratios. Thus, accumulation of nitrite (NO2−) in the medium was used as a measure of nitric oxide production. Nitrite was determined with the Griess reagent method (35.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10828) Google Scholar) and sodium nitrite was used as the standard. PAO (2 μm) caused no interference at all in the nitrite assay used. Cultured hepatocytes were incubated with IL-1β in the absence and presence of PAO. After the indicated times, dishes were placed on ice and were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline before being solubilized in 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane. Immunostaining was performed using an ECL blotting detection agent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham, Bucks, UK) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the COOH-terminal fragments of mouse macrophage iNOS (Affinity-Bio Reagent, Neshanic station, NJ), human IκBα (C-21), or human IκBβ (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as the primary antibody. Total RNA was extracted from cultured hepatocytes after IL-1β stimulation in the absence and presence of PAO using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (36.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were fractionated by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and immobilized by baking (80 °C, 2 h) for hybridization with DNA probes. The cDNA probe of iNOS (rat vascular smooth muscle cells; RT-PCR product (830 bp) amplified with YNO12 and YNO56 primers (37.Nunokawa Y. Ishida N. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar)) was provided by Dr. Y. Nunokawa (Suntory Institute for Biochemical Research, Osaka, Japan) and was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random-primed labeling method. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Shreiber et al (38.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Briefly, approximate 2 × 106cells (two dishes) were placed on ice, washed with Tris-buffered saline, harvested with the same buffer by a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 1,840 × g for 1 min. The cells in a centrifuge tube were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 500 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 in the lysis buffer was added. Then, the tube was vigorously vortexed for 1 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. After removal of the supernatant, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 500 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, DTT-free nuclear extraction buffer) or the buffer with 1 mm DTT. The tube was incubated on ice for 20 min with continuous mixing and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Binding reactions (15 μl total) were performed by incubating 4 μg of protein of the nuclear extract with reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) in the absence and presence of cold probe as competitor (500-fold excess) for 30 min, followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature with the probe (approximately 20,000 cpm). Products were electrophoresed at 100 V on a 4.8% polyacrylamide gel in high ionic strength buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), and dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC) from mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain was purchased (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. In experiments with the treatment of PAO in vitro, nuclear extracts were prepared with DTT-free nuclear extraction buffer and incubated with PAO in the absence and presence of DTT or thioglycerol for 30 min at room temperature before mixing with the probe. The protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (39.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) with a dye binding assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The 5′-flanking region of rat iNOS gene (−1026 to +16) were amplified from rat genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction using linker-primers based on the published sequence (17.Eberhardt W. Kunz D. Hummel R. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), gcggtacCGAGGCTGAGCTGAATTTGGGAACCATG (KpnI site) and gccaagcttAGAGTCTCAGTCTTCAACTCCCTGT (HindIII site). The product was cloned into pGV-B vector harboring promoterless firefly luciferase gene (Toyo B-Net Co. Ltd., Japan) to create the 1042-bp rat iNOS promoter-luciferase construct (pRNOS-Luc). pCGp65 and pCGp105NcoI encoding p65 (RelA) and p50, respectively, (40.Hirai H. Suzuki T. Fujisawa J.-I. Inoue J.-I. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. J.-I. Fujisawa, Kansai Medical University. Hepatocytes were cultured at 4 × 105 cells per dish (35 × 10 mm) in Williams' medium E supplemented with 10% serum, dexamethasone (10 nm), and insulin (10 nm) for 1 day. Then, cultured cells were replaced by the medium without serum and hormones and were subjected to transfection with 16 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA: 1.5 μg of pRNOS-Luc; and 0.25 μg of CMV enhancer/promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-LacZ as an internal control and 0.25 μg of plasmid expressing NF-κB (0.125 μg of each pCMV-p65 and pCMV-p105). After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by fresh medium supplemented with 10% serum, dexamethasone, and insulin. On day 2, the cells were treated with PAO or the vehicle (0.1% dimethylsulfoxide) for 15 min, washed with the medium, and incubated for 8 h. Activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured as reported previously (20.Sakitani K. Nishizawa M. Inoue K. Masu Y. Okumura T. Ito S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized by dividing relative light units by β-galactosidase activity. Transfection was performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was analyzed by Bonferroni/Dunn's test, and a p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. As reported previously, an inflammatory cytokine IL-1β increased levels of nitrite (nitric oxide metabolite) released to the medium in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, where concentrations for the maximal and half-maximal effects were 1 nm and 30 pm, respectively (8.Kitade H. Sakitani K. Inoue K. Masu Y. Kawada N. Hiramatsu Y. Kamiyama Y. Okumura T. Ito S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous addition of PAO, a trivalent arsenical compound, inhibited the nitrite release stimulated by IL-1β in the time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Concentration for the maximal inhibition was 2 μm (Fig. 1 B). We also observed the similar effect when PAO was pretreated for 15 min and was removed from the medium before experiments instead of simultaneous addition (data not shown). Thus the latter condition was used in the following experiments. Both trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release tests implied that drug toxicity was not a cause of the decreased production of nitric oxide in response to IL-1β. IL-1β induced the formation of iNOS protein, which has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kDa (37.Nunokawa Y. Ishida N. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), with a maximum at 8–12 h as reported (22.Sakitani K. Kitade H. Inoue K. Kamiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Okumura T. Ito S. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34.Kaibori M. Sakitani K. Oda M. Kamiyama Y. Masu Y. Nishizawa M. Ito S. Okumura T. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 1138-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PAO inhibited the induction of iNOS protein (Fig.2). Furthermore, PAO inhibited the induction of iNOS mRNA, which appeared at 3 h after addition of IL-1β and increased to a maximum at 6–8 h (Fig.3). The results indicated that PAO inhibited IL-1β-stimulated nitric oxide production at a transcription step.Figure 3Effect of phenylarsine oxide on the induction of iNOS mRNA in hepatocytes. Cells were pretreated with or without PAO and were incubated with IL-1β as in the legend to Fig. 2. Total RNA (10 μg) were analyzed by Northern blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The filter was probed with labeled inserts of iNOS cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA. Data represent one of three independent experiments yielding similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PAO is known to react with two thiol groups of closely spaced protein cystenyl residues to form stable dithioarsine rings (29.Kalef E. Walfish P.G. Gitler C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interaction between PAO and vicinal dithiol-containing proteins cannot be competed by monothiols, but in the presence of low molecular-weight dithiols such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanol and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) the binding is competed. PAO (2 μm) was treated in the presence of dithiol, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (50 μm), or monothiol, 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol (thioglycerol, 50 μm). The 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, but not thioglycerol, abolished PAO-induced inhibitions on the production of nitric oxide and inductions of iNOS protein and its mRNA (Fig. 4). In the case of monothiols, even larger excess of thioglycerol (250 μm) had no effect at all (data not shown). IL-1β stimulated a rapid degradation of inhibitory subunits, IκBα and IκBβ proteins, of NF-κB which were recovered within 1.5 and 4 h, respectively, after addition of IL-1β. PAO had no effect on both IκB degradation (data not shown). However, EMSA revealed that PAO markedly decreased NF-κB band in nuclear extract prepared without DTT (Fig.5) although PAO had no effect on IL-1β-induced NF-κB translocation in nuclear extract prepared with DTT. In EMSA experiments for DNA binding activity of NF-κB, we used to prepare nuclear extracts in the presence of DTT. Thus, NF-κB band in the nuclear extract without DTT had lower intensity than that with DTT in control (IL-1β without PAO) (Fig. 5). In the case of nuclear extract with DTT, it could be possible that DTT reversed the binding of PAO to vicinal dithiol-containing residue of NF-κB molecule during the nuclear extraction. These results indicated that PAO could not influence the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus following IκB degradation but could prevent a DNA binding of NF-κB, resulting in the blockade of NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β in hepatocytes. In the next, after NF-κB activation by IL-1β in the absence of PAO, nuclear extracts were prepared without DTT, and then PAO were incubated in nuclear extracts in the absence or presence of DTT or thioglycolin vitro. Addition of exogenous PAO again decreased NF-κB band in the absence of DTT but not in the presence of DTT (Fig.6). We also found the similar decrease of NF-κB band in the nuclear extract with monothiol, thioglycerol. Transfection experiments with iNOS promoter construct and p50/p65, subunits of NF-κB, revealed that PAO inhibited the transactivation of iNOS promoter concentration dependently, and the inhibition was significantly blocked in the presence of dithiol, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effect of phenylarsine oxide on the transactivation of iNOS promoter by NF-κB (p50/p65) in hepatocytes. iNOS promoter construct (pRNOS-Luc) was introduced to hepatocytes with effector plasmids encoding p50 and p65. Transfected cells were treated with PAO (0.33, 1, and 2 μm) in the absence and presence of vicinal dithiol (VD; 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, 100 μm) for 15 min and, after removal of PAO, further incubated for 8 h.

This inhibition is because of the suppression at a step of its transcription, as both inductions of iNOS mRNA and its protein were abolished by PAO (Figs. 2 and 3). Simultaneous addition of low molecular weight dithiol, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, completely blocked these inhibitory effects (Fig. 4), indicating that PAO interacted with vicinal dithiol-containing molecule(s) and inactivated its function, which is presumably involved in the pathway of iNOS induction in hepatocytes. Among candidates, NF-κB seems likely to be a predominant molecule having the interaction with PAO, which is supported by the observation as follows: (i) EMSA experiments demonstrated that PAO inhibited the DNA binding of NF-κB, but did not inhibit the NF-κB translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 5), which was consistent with the result that PAO had no effect on the IκB degradation (data not shown); (ii) in vitro incubation of PAO with nuclear extracts revealed that PAO inhibited the interaction between NF-κB and the κB consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 6); and (iii) in transfection experiments with iNOS promoter-luciferase, PAO inhibited the iNOS promoter activity stimulated by p50/p65, subunits of NF-κB (Fig. 7). Thus, our results suggested that PAO rather directly binds to NF-κB through its vicinal dithiol moiety. In support of this observation, Shumilla et al. (28.Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that arsenite as well as other thiol reactive metals inhibited NF-κB binding to DNA in vitro with nuclear extracts isolated from TNFα-treated A549 cells, through interaction with critical protein sulfhydryls, which was reversed by addition of dithiols, DTT.

Selenite inhibited NF-κB activation via adduct formation with the essential thiols of this transcription factor. Selenite inhibition was also reversed by addtion of DTT. Inhibition because of formation of such selenotrisulfide type of adduct is established as the mechanism of selenite action in the case of rat brain prostaglandin D synthase (42.Islam F. Watanabe Y. Morii H. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PAO is an inhibitor of a specific class of tyrosine phosphatases characterized by two vicinal thiol groups in the active site (43.Bernier M. Laird D.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl.

They concluded that PAO presumably inhibited tyrosine phosphatase, which occurs in the cytoplasm and is involved in the pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB. They had no mention about interaction between PAO and NF-κB. We cannot exclude the possibility that PAO inhibited tyrosine phosphatase in our study, which occurs in the nucleus and is involved in NF-κB DNA binding. However, it seems that different types of cells have alternative pathways for the activation of NF-κB (47.Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PAO may attack different targets which have a vicinal dithiol moiety and are involved in NF-κB activation. Teweset al. (48.Tewes F. Bol G.-F. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that PAO inhibited IL-1-induced activation of IL-1R1 associated protein kinase and impaired the activation of NF-κB in a murine T cell line, EL4 cells. In our primary cultured hepatocytes, we found that pretreatment of sodium arsenite (20 μm for 15 min) also markedly inhibited the production of nitric oxide and the induction of iNOS protein and mRNA by IL-1β as similar as PAO did. However, addition of DTT (500 μm) could not reverse the inhibition. Furthermore, sodium arsenite had no effect on iNOS promoter activation with p50/p65 at all, 2M. Oda and T. Okumura, unpublished observation. implying that PAO and sodium arsenite inhibits iNOS induction via different mechanisms. de Vera et al. (27.de Vera M.E. Kim Y.M. Wong H.R. Wang Q. Billiar T.R.

Although a precise role of vicinal dithiol residue in NF-κB activation is obscure on the induction of iNOS in hepatocytes, our study demonstrates that vicinal dithiol residue(s) which interacts with PAO may be an essential component for the binding to iNOS promoter region. Thus, maintenance of active thiol forms by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system specifically, in part, determine NF-κB activation on the induction of iNOS in hepatocytes. In support of our observation, Vos et al. (50.Vos T.A. Goor H. Tuyt L. Jager-Krikken A. Leuvenink R. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L. Moshage H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that glutathione depletion prevented iNOS induction in hepatocytes but not in inflammatory cells including neutrophils.

Here we demonstrate that the HD-PPRE is also a target for the constitutive androstane receptor β (CARβ). In vitro binding analysis showed that CARβ bound the HD-PPRE, but not the AOx-PPRE, as a heterodimer with RXRα. Binding of CARβ/RXRα to the HD-PPRE occurred via determinants that overlap partially with those required for PPARα/RXRα binding.

Upon binding of ligand, PPARs heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, RXRα, and bind to specificcis-acting DNA response elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE). PPREs consist of direct repeats of the consensus hexameric motif TGACC(T/C) separated by one base pair (DR1) and have been found upstream of a number of target genes, including those encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD) (8.Tugwood J.D.

Accordingly, transcriptional regulation from PPREs is a net aggregate response generated in part by the availability of PPARs and other factors that bind PPREs, the complexity of the response elements themselves, and the interplay of PPARs with other nuclear hormone receptors and cofactors, including corepressors and coactivators. This complex interaction of various factors and elements ensures that the correct transcriptional response to extra- and intracellular stimuli will be elicited from appropriate target genes.The nuclear hormone receptor constitutive androstane receptor β (CARβ) (NR1I4 - Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee, 1999) (15.Choi H.-S.

Recently, Forman and co-workers (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) showed that unlike the classical steroid/nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by their cognate ligands, CARβ binds the steroid androstane metabolites androstanol and androstenol to antagonize its ligand-independent transcriptional activation, suggesting that CARβ could form part of a novel class of ligand-deactivated receptors (28.Picard D. Nature. 1998; 395: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Considering the similarities between CARβ and PPARα with respect to the compositions of their response elements, their strong expression in liver, and their heterodimerization with RXRα to modulate transcription, we investigated the potential of CARβ to regulate expression from the PPREs of genes involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation.DISCUSSIONBecause of the abundant expression of the nuclear hormone receptor CARβ in liver and its functional interaction with RXRα, we investigated whether CARβ had a role in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids through regulation of transcription of the HD and AOx genes via their PPREs. We have demonstrated that the HD-PPRE is a target for CARβ/RXRα heterodimers and that CARβ/RXRα stimulates transcription from the HD-PPRE. This increase in transcriptional activity is approximately the same in either the absence or the presence of the peroxisome proliferator, Wy-14,643, affirming the ligand-independent transcriptional activation activity that has previously been demonstrated for CARβ (16.Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).The presence of CARβ does not affect transactivation from the HD-PPRE by PPARα/RXRα. In contrast, CARβ serves to antagonize PPARα/RXRα-mediated transcriptional induction from the AOx-PPRE. We attribute the effects of CARβ on transcription from the HD- and AOx-PPREs in the presence of PPARα to the availability of RXRα required for heterodimerization with both CARβ and PPARα. Because CARβ/RXRα heterodimers form a complex on the HD-PPRE, we suggest that CARβ sequesters RXRα away from PPARα to form a heterodimeric CARβ/RXRα complex that is less transcriptionally robust than the PPARα/RXRα complex on the HD-PPRE. In the case of the AOx-PPRE, which does not bind CARβ/RXRα, sequestration of RXRα away from PPARα by CARβ would result in decreased transcriptional activity, likely as a result of the formation of nonbinding, transcriptionally inactive CARβ/RXRα heterodimers, concomitant with a reduction in the number of transcriptionally active PPARα/RXRα heterodimers.The involvement of cofactors such as SRC-1, p300, N-CoR, and SMRT-1 in transcriptional regulation by nuclear hormone receptors is well established (35.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 36.DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricotte M. Ingrey S. Hörlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15901-15907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The binding of the ligand 5α-androstan-3α-ol to CARβ has been suggested to result in the dissociation of SRC-1 from CARβ, thereby bringing about transcriptional deactivation (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,39.Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Science. 1999; 284: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Addition of 5α-androstan-3α-ol in transient transfections did result in transcriptional deactivation by CARβ/RXRα from both the β-RARE and the HD-PPRE; however, the extent of deactivation was less than what has previously been reported. The observed decrease in deactivation could stem from endogenous levels of PPARα and RXRα in BSC40 cells, which may overcome androstanol deactivation by promoting transcriptional induction from the HD-PPRE via PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. In effect, in transient transfections expressing PPARα, RXRα, and CARβ, addition of androstanol did not affect the level of transcriptional activation from the HD-PPRE (data not presented). PPARα/RXRα heterodimers bind weakly to β-RARE (40.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), and therefore endogenous cellular levels of PPARα and RXRα would probably be precluded from potentiating transcription from the β-RARE, allowing for the observed deactivation by CARβ in the presence of androstanol. Surprisingly, we observed only a moderate reduction of ligand-independent activity by CARβ/RXRα on the β-RARE as compared with previously published results (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These differences could be attributed to inherent differences in the cell lines used, including the relative levels of endogenous nuclear hormone receptors, corepressors and coactivators. These and other cell-specific factors could influence the observed differences in ligand-dependent deactivation.The HD-PPRE is a complex response element composed of four hexameric DRs arranged as two tandem DR1 arrays separated by two nucleotides, thereby forming a DR2. This complex arrangement permits the interaction of a variety of nuclear hormone receptors on the HD-PPRE (9.Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl.

CARβ/RXRα heterodimers bind to half-sites on the HD-PPRE that partially overlap with half-sites recognized by PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. Half-sites II and III of the HD-PPRE, which form a DR2, are required for CARβ/RXRα binding, whereas PPARα/RXRα binds to sites III and IV. CARβ/RXRα-mediated transactivation is eliminated when half-site II or III is mutated. It has been reported that half-site III of the HD-PPRE is occupied by RXRα, whereas the more distal half-site (IV) is occupied by PPARα (41.Chu R. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (26939): 29636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Considering this and the fact that CARβ/RXRα heterodimers have been shown to bind β-RARE with DR2 spacing (15.Choi H.-S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.-K. Seol W. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23565-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that CARβ would likely occupy half-site II, which matches perfectly the consensus hexameric half-site sequence. Furthermore, the intricate combinations of various nuclear hormone receptors that can modulate the transcriptional response from the HD-PPRE converge on the second hexameric half-site (13.Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31442-31448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Kassam A. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the limitations of our in vitro assays do not allow us to distinguish which half-site is specifically occupied by CARβ when bound as a heterodimer with RXRα on the HD-PPRE.Our findings suggest that CARβ can modulate the transcriptional response of the genes coding for two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, AOx and HD. The peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway is involved preferentially in the metabolism of long and very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. AOx, the first enzyme in the pathway, is rate-limiting. We have shown that CARβ decreases transcriptional activation of the AOx gene while increasing transcriptional activation of the HD gene, which encodes the second enzyme in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. This differential regulation of the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway may represent an adaptive cellular response that primes the pathway to respond rapidly to cellular oxidative demands under physiological conditions where repression of the transcription of the AOx gene is relieved. The convergence of the CARβ, PPARα and RXRα signaling pathways underscores the complex and dynamic processes by which various metabolic cues are integrated to elicit the correct transcriptional response leading to control of peroxisomal β-oxidation.In summary, we demonstrate that CARβ/RXRα heterodimers play a role in fatty acid homeostasis by regulating the transcription of the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, acyl-CoA oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. We also show that the PPRE of the HD gene is a target for CARβ/RXRα heterodimers. An understanding of the various transcription factors that control peroxisomal β-oxidation could contribute to the development of pharmacological agents that specifically target this pathway as a way to treat disorders of lipid metabolism and homeostasis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)1 are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (1.Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Functioning as ligand-activated transcription factors, PPARs regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, inflammation, and glucose metabolism (2.Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PPARs respond to a broad class of structurally diverse ligands, including xenobiotic chemicals called peroxisome proliferators and both naturally occurring and synthetic fatty acids (3.Göttlicher M.

Upon binding of ligand, PPARs heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, RXRα, and bind to specificcis-acting DNA response elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE). PPREs consist of direct repeats of the consensus hexameric motif TGACC(T/C) separated by one base pair (DR1) and have been found upstream of a number of target genes, including those encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD) (8.Tugwood J.D.

In addition to PPARs, several other nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to bind PPREs and differentially modulate PPAR function. These include chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (10.Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accordingly, transcriptional regulation from PPREs is a net aggregate response generated in part by the availability of PPARs and other factors that bind PPREs, the complexity of the response elements themselves, and the interplay of PPARs with other nuclear hormone receptors and cofactors, including corepressors and coactivators. This complex interaction of various factors and elements ensures that the correct transcriptional response to extra- and intracellular stimuli will be elicited from appropriate target genes. The nuclear hormone receptor constitutive androstane receptor β (CARβ) (NR1I4 - Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee, 1999) (15.Choi H.-S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.-K. Seol W. Moore D.D.

Interestingly, CARβ/RXRα possesses ligand-independent transcriptional activation activity from both the β-RARE and phenobarbital response element module in the absence of retinoids or any other exogenously added ligand (15.Choi H.-S.

CARβ is therefore among a growing number of orphan receptors, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (20.Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Recently, Forman and co-workers (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) showed that unlike the classical steroid/nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by their cognate ligands, CARβ binds the steroid androstane metabolites androstanol and androstenol to antagonize its ligand-independent transcriptional activation, suggesting that CARβ could form part of a novel class of ligand-deactivated receptors (28.Picard D. Nature. 1998; 395: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Considering the similarities between CARβ and PPARα with respect to the compositions of their response elements, their strong expression in liver, and their heterodimerization with RXRα to modulate transcription, we investigated the potential of CARβ to regulate expression from the PPREs of genes involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation. DISCUSSIONBecause of the abundant expression of the nuclear hormone receptor CARβ in liver and its functional interaction with RXRα, we investigated whether CARβ had a role in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids through regulation of transcription of the HD and AOx genes via their PPREs. We have demonstrated that the HD-PPRE is a target for CARβ/RXRα heterodimers and that CARβ/RXRα stimulates transcription from the HD-PPRE. This increase in transcriptional activity is approximately the same in either the absence or the presence of the peroxisome proliferator, Wy-14,643, affirming the ligand-independent transcriptional activation activity that has previously been demonstrated for CARβ (16.Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).The presence of CARβ does not affect transactivation from the HD-PPRE by PPARα/RXRα. In contrast, CARβ serves to antagonize PPARα/RXRα-mediated transcriptional induction from the AOx-PPRE. We attribute the effects of CARβ on transcription from the HD- and AOx-PPREs in the presence of PPARα to the availability of RXRα required for heterodimerization with both CARβ and PPARα. Because CARβ/RXRα heterodimers form a complex on the HD-PPRE, we suggest that CARβ sequesters RXRα away from PPARα to form a heterodimeric CARβ/RXRα complex that is less transcriptionally robust than the PPARα/RXRα complex on the HD-PPRE. In the case of the AOx-PPRE, which does not bind CARβ/RXRα, sequestration of RXRα away from PPARα by CARβ would result in decreased transcriptional activity, likely as a result of the formation of nonbinding, transcriptionally inactive CARβ/RXRα heterodimers, concomitant with a reduction in the number of transcriptionally active PPARα/RXRα heterodimers.The involvement of cofactors such as SRC-1, p300, N-CoR, and SMRT-1 in transcriptional regulation by nuclear hormone receptors is well established (35.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 36.DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricotte M. Ingrey S. Hörlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15901-15907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The binding of the ligand 5α-androstan-3α-ol to CARβ has been suggested to result in the dissociation of SRC-1 from CARβ, thereby bringing about transcriptional deactivation (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,39.Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Science. 1999; 284: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Addition of 5α-androstan-3α-ol in transient transfections did result in transcriptional deactivation by CARβ/RXRα from both the β-RARE and the HD-PPRE; however, the extent of deactivation was less than what has previously been reported. The observed decrease in deactivation could stem from endogenous levels of PPARα and RXRα in BSC40 cells, which may overcome androstanol deactivation by promoting transcriptional induction from the HD-PPRE via PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. In effect, in transient transfections expressing PPARα, RXRα, and CARβ, addition of androstanol did not affect the level of transcriptional activation from the HD-PPRE (data not presented). PPARα/RXRα heterodimers bind weakly to β-RARE (40.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), and therefore endogenous cellular levels of PPARα and RXRα would probably be precluded from potentiating transcription from the β-RARE, allowing for the observed deactivation by CARβ in the presence of androstanol. Surprisingly, we observed only a moderate reduction of ligand-independent activity by CARβ/RXRα on the β-RARE as compared with previously published results (17.Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These differences could be attributed to inherent differences in the cell lines used, including the relative levels of endogenous nuclear hormone receptors, corepressors and coactivators. These and other cell-specific factors could influence the observed differences in ligand-dependent deactivation.The HD-PPRE is a complex response element composed of four hexameric DRs arranged as two tandem DR1 arrays separated by two nucleotides, thereby forming a DR2. This complex arrangement permits the interaction of a variety of nuclear hormone receptors on the HD-PPRE (9.Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl.

CARβ/RXRα heterodimers bind to half-sites on the HD-PPRE that partially overlap with half-sites recognized by PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. Half-sites II and III of the HD-PPRE, which form a DR2, are required for CARβ/RXRα binding, whereas PPARα/RXRα binds to sites III and IV.

These differences could be attributed to inherent differences in the cell lines used, including the relative levels of endogenous nuclear hormone receptors, corepressors and coactivators. These and other cell-specific factors could influence the observed differences in ligand-dependent deactivation. The HD-PPRE is a complex response element composed of four hexameric DRs arranged as two tandem DR1 arrays separated by two nucleotides, thereby forming a DR2. This complex arrangement permits the interaction of a variety of nuclear hormone receptors on the HD-PPRE (9.Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl.

CARβ/RXRα heterodimers bind to half-sites on the HD-PPRE that partially overlap with half-sites recognized by PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. Half-sites II and III of the HD-PPRE, which form a DR2, are required for CARβ/RXRα binding, whereas PPARα/RXRα binds to sites III and IV. CARβ/RXRα-mediated transactivation is eliminated when half-site II or III is mutated. It has been reported that half-site III of the HD-PPRE is occupied by RXRα, whereas the more distal half-site (IV) is occupied by PPARα (41.Chu R. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (26939): 29636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Considering this and the fact that CARβ/RXRα heterodimers have been shown to bind β-RARE with DR2 spacing (15.Choi H.-S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.-K. Seol W. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23565-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that CARβ would likely occupy half-site II, which matches perfectly the consensus hexameric half-site sequence. Furthermore, the intricate combinations of various nuclear hormone receptors that can modulate the transcriptional response from the HD-PPRE converge on the second hexameric half-site (13.Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31442-31448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Kassam A. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the limitations of our in vitro assays do not allow us to distinguish which half-site is specifically occupied by CARβ when bound as a heterodimer with RXRα on the HD-PPRE. Our findings suggest that CARβ can modulate the transcriptional response of the genes coding for two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, AOx and HD. The peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway is involved preferentially in the metabolism of long and very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. AOx, the first enzyme in the pathway, is rate-limiting. We have shown that CARβ decreases transcriptional activation of the AOx gene while increasing transcriptional activation of the HD gene, which encodes the second enzyme in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. This differential regulation of the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway may represent an adaptive cellular response that primes the pathway to respond rapidly to cellular oxidative demands under physiological conditions where repression of the transcription of the AOx gene is relieved. The convergence of the CARβ, PPARα and RXRα signaling pathways underscores the complex and dynamic processes by which various metabolic cues are integrated to elicit the correct transcriptional response leading to control of peroxisomal β-oxidation. In summary, we demonstrate that CARβ/RXRα heterodimers play a role in fatty acid homeostasis by regulating the transcription of the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, acyl-CoA oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. We also show that the PPRE of the HD gene is a target for CARβ/RXRα heterodimers. An understanding of the various transcription factors that control peroxisomal β-oxidation could contribute to the development of pharmacological agents that specifically target this pathway as a way to treat disorders of lipid metabolism and homeostasis.

In addition to its catalytic activity on phosphatidylinositol substrates, it can serve as an adaptor protein in binding Shc and Grb2. Erythropoietin (EPO), the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, has been shown to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, resulting in recruitment of Grb2. However, the mechanism by which the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) recruits Shc remains unknown. EPO activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1, resulting in the interdependent recruitment of Shc and Grb2. Ship1 is recruited to the EPO-R in an SH2-dependent manner. Utilizing a panel of EPO-R deletion and tyrosine mutants, we have discovered remarkable redundancy in Ship1 recruitment. EPO-R Tyr401 appears to be a major site of Ship1 binding; however, Tyr429 and Tyr431 can also serve to recruit Ship1. In addition, we have shown that EPO stimulates the formation of a ternary complex consisting of Ship1, Shc, and Grb2. Ship1 may modulate several discrete signal transduction pathways. EPO-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt was examined utilizing a panel of EPO-R deletion mutants. Activation of ERK1/2 was observed in EPO-RΔ99, which retains only the most proximal tyrosine, Tyr343. In contrast, EPO-dependent PKB activation was observed in EPO-RΔ43, but not in EPO-RΔ99. It appears that EPO-dependent PKB activation is downstream of a region that indirectly couples to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Growth factors and cytokines activate the Ras signaling pathway through the recruitment of the SH2 adaptor protein Grb2 and the associated guanine nucleotide release factor SOS. In earlier studies, we have shown that Grb2-Sos can be recruited to the EPO-R through direct association with the EPO-R or indirectly via Shp2 or Shc (16.Barber D.L. Corless C.N. Xia K. Roberts T.M.

In these experiments, we had identified a 145-kDa phosphoprotein, and with the subsequent identification of Ship1 by several laboratories (21.Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B.

Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ship proteins display catalytic activity on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate substrates. In addition, Ship1, an SH2 domain-containing protein, can serve as an adaptor protein, as when tyrosine-phosphorylated, it can bind Shc in a phosphotyrosine-binding domain-dependent manner (20.Lamkin T.D.

Proline-rich sequences found at the carboxyl terminus of Ship1 also result in recruitment of the SH3 domain of Grb2 (21.Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the EPO-R activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1 and that Ship1 binds to the EPO-R in an SH2-dependent fashion through multiple phosphotyrosine residues, including EPO-R Tyr401, Tyr429, and Tyr431.RESULTSThe role of Ship1 in cytokine-mediated signaling was examined in Ba/F3 and DA-3 cells expressing EPO-R as well as in the erythroid cell line HCD-57. Cell lines were depleted of cytokine and then stimulated with no factor or with IL-3 or EPO, and immunoprecipitation with a peptide-specific Ship1 antibody was performed, followed by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Fig.1). IL-3 and EPO stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1 in Ba/F3-EPO-R (lanes 7and 8) and DA-3-EPO-R (lanes 10 and11) cells. Stimulation of HCD-57 cells with EPO also resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1 (lane 13). IL-3 stimulation of Ba/F3-EPO-R cells (lane 7) and IL-3 (lane 10) or EPO (lane 11) stimulation of DA-3-EPO-R cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of a 52-kDa phosphoprotein with Ship1. Stripping and reprobing of the membrane revealed that this protein was Shc (data not shown). EPO stimulation of DA-3-EPO-R cells also resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of the 72-kDa EPO-R. On longer exposures, the EPO-R was also shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Ship1 from Ba/F3-EPO-R and HCD-57 cells (data not shown). The ability of the EPO-R to associate with Ship1 from the various cell lines was directly proportional to EPO-R expression. Equal immunoprecipitation of Ship1 was demonstrated by stripping and reprobing the membrane with an anti-Ship1 polyclonal antibody (Ship1 immunoblot).Ship1 was initially described to interact with Grb2 and Shc (21.Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 24.Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A.

To investigate the ability of Ship1 to bind to these adaptor proteins, immunoprecipitations were performed using peptide-specific Grb2 and Ship1 antibodies (Fig. 2). DA-3-EPO-R cells were depleted of cytokine and then stimulated with no factor or with IL-3 or EPO. As we have previously shown in CTLL-EPO-R cells (16.Barber D.L. Corless C.N. Xia K. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 55-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated Ship1 (145 and 130 kDa), EPO-R (72 kDa), Shp2 (68 kDa), and Shc (52 and 46 kDa) (lane 6) after EPO stimulation of DA-3-EPO-R cells. IL-3 stimulation resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of Ship1, Shp2, and Shc with Grb2 (lane 5). Since Grb2 assembled a multimolecular complex consisting of Ship1, Shp2, Shc, and EPO-R after EPO stimulation, we were interested in determining whether Shc could be recruited to the EPO-R through Ship1. As shown in Fig. 1, Ship1 co-immunoprecipitated Shc after IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 2,lane 8) and Shc and EPO-R after EPO stimulation (lane 9).Figure 2Grb2 and Ship1 recruit similar signaling complexes after EPO stimulation. DA-3-EPO-R cells were depleted of cytokine for 4 h and stimulated with no factor (lanes 1, 4, and 7) or with 10 ng/ml murine IL-3 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or 50 units/ml human recombinant EPO (lanes 3,6, and 9) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either an anti-Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Ab; lanes 4–6) or an anti-Ship1 polyclonal antibody (lanes 7–9). Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The immunoblot was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 and then stripped and reprobed with antibodies to the EPO-R, Shc, Grb2, and Ship1.

Lysates were prepared from DA-3-EPO-R cells, andin vitro mixing experiments were performed with GST alone and fused with the Ship1 SH2 domain and a mutated Ship1 SH2 domain (GST-Ship1 SH2 R34Q) (Fig. 3). The Ship1 SH2 domain was shown to associate with the IL-3 receptor βc chain (140 kDa) (lane 8) after IL-3 stimulation, and the 72-kDa EPO-R was shown to bind to the Ship1 SH2 domain after engagement of the EPO-R (lane 9). Stripping and reprobing the membrane confirmed that the 72-kDa phosphoprotein in lane 9 was the EPO-R (lower panel). No phosphoproteins were shown to associate with GST-Ship1 SH2 R34Q after either IL-3 (lane 11) or EPO (lane 12) stimulation. Only small amounts of Shc were observed to associate with Ship1, in contrast to a previous report (25.Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol.

Lysates from unstimulated or EPO-stimulated Ba/F3-EPO-R cells were immunoprecipitated with a peptide-specific EPO-R antibody. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was cut into strips, and each strip was incubated with GST, GST-Ship1 SH2, or GST-Ship1 SH2 R34Q (20.Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F. Liu L.

Following washing, Western blotting was performed using an anti-GST antibody followed by HRP-protein A. GST-Ship1 SH2 (lane 6) was shown to bind to the EPO-R. Neither a GST fusion protein of the Ship1 SH2 domain expressing an inactivating SH2 domain mutation (R34Q) nor GST alone bound to the EPO-R. This suggests that Ship1 directly associates with the EPO-R in an SH2-dependent manner.Figure 4The SH2 domain of Ship1 binds directly to the activated EPO-R. Ba/F3-EPO-R cells were depleted of cytokine for 4 h and stimulated with no factor (lanes 1,3, and 5) or with 50 units/ml human recombinant EPO (lanes 2, 4, and 6) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-EPO-R polyclonal antibody (Ab). Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 2.5 μg/ml eluted GST (lanes 1 and 2), GST-Ship1 SH2 R34Q (lanes 3 and 4), or GST-Ship1 SH2 (lanes 5 and 6). After 1 h of incubation, the membrane was probed with an anti-GST polyclonal antibody, followed by ECL (upper panel). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-EPO-R polyclonal antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine this possibility in greater detail, we performed a transient transfection in 293T cells (Fig. 5). The EPO-R and JAK2 were expressed with either wild-type Ship1 or the Ship1 SH2 domain R34Q mutant. Tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type Ship1 was shown to associate with the EPO-R when the cells were stimulated with EPO (lane 2). No tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1 R34Q was observed when this construct was coexpressed with the EPO-R and JAK2 (lane 4). 293T cells failed to express Ship1 (Ship1 reprobe; lanes 5 and6), and the association of the EPO-R and Ship1 in this cellular environment was dependent on JAK2 (lane 8). The 72-kDa phosphoprotein in the Ship1 immunoprecipitation was confirmed to be the EPO-R (EPO-R reprobe;lane 2). The experiments in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 provide strong evidence that Ship1 directly associates with the EPO-R in an SH2-dependent fashion.Figure 5The SH2 domain of Ship1 mediates association with the EPO-R. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then incubated for 18 h under serum-free conditions. The cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 10 units/ml EPO for 10 min. Following lysis, immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Ship1 polyclonal antibody (Ab).

In addition to the wild-type EPO-R, four mutants were selected: EPO-RΔ43 (containing 4 Tyr residues), EPO-RΔ69 (containing 2 Tyr residues), EPO-RΔ99 (containing 1 Tyr residue), and EPO-RΔ99,F1 (containing 0 Tyr residues) (Fig. 6 A). All cell lines (with the exception of EPO-RΔ99,F1) were capable of EPO-dependent proliferation as determined by XTT assays (data not shown). Previous studies have indicated that EPO-RΔ99 is capable of EPO-dependent mitogenesis when expressed in Ba/F3 cells (26.D'Andrea A.D. Yoshimura A. Youssoufian H. Zon L.I. Koo J.-W. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1980-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The selected subclones were depleted of cytokine and stimulated in the presence or absence of EPO. Immunoprecipitation with Ship1 was performed, followed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting (Fig.6 B). EPO stimulation of Ba/F3-EPO-R (lane 8), Ba/F3-EPO-RΔ43 (lane 10), and Ba/F3-EPO-RΔ69 (lane 12) cells resulted in robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1. Ba/F3-EPO-RΔ99 cells caused a slight stimulation of Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EPO (lane 14). Ba/F3 or Ba/F3-EPO-RΔ99,F1 cells showed no increase in Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that the EPO-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation requires EPO-R cytoplasmic tyrosines.Figure 6Ship1 associates with EPO-R deletion mutants. A, schematic representation of the full-length EPO-R and EPO-R deletion mutants. The mutant cDNAs were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3. The deletion mutants are denoted by the number of amino acids deleted from the carboxyl terminus. B, Ship1 associates with EPO-R tyrosines 401 and/or 429 and 431. The indicated cell lines were depleted of cytokine for 4 h and stimulated with no factor (odd-numbered lanes) or with 50 units/ml human recombinant EPO (even-numbered lanes) for 10 min at 37 °C. Following cell lysis, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with an anti-Ship1 polyclonal antibody (Ab). Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The immunoblot was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (upper panel) and then stripped and reprobed with an anti-Ship1 polyclonal antibody (lower panel). Lysate controls are shown in lanes 1–4. C, the Ship1 SH2 domain associates with EPO-R tyrosines 401 and/or 429 and 431. Lysates identical to those described for B were incubated with 5 μg of GST-Ship1 SH2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. D, tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by EPO-R deletion mutants. Lysates identical (100 μg) to those described for B were resolved via SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10.

Lysates identical to those described above were incubated with GST-Ship1 SH2, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected. EPO stimulated the association of the wild-type EPO-R (lane 4), EPO-RΔ43 (lane 6), and EPO-RΔ69 (lane 8) with the Ship1 SH2 domain. From these experiments, we conclude that EPO-R Tyr401 is sufficient to couple to EPO-dependent Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation and binding of Ship1 to the EPO-R.All of the EPO-R deletion mutants were capable of activating JAK2, and all mutants (with the exception of EPO-RΔ99,F1) activate STAT5, indicating that EPO-RΔ43, EPO-RΔ69, and EPO-RΔ99 activate similar downstream signaling pathways compared with the wild-type EPO-R (Fig.6 D). Metabolic labeling experiments confirmed expression of each of the EPO-R deletion mutants in Ba/F3 cells (Fig.6 E).Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding specificity of the Ship1 SH2 domain is pY(Y/D)1 X 2(L/I/V)3 (27.Osborne M.A. Zenner G.

Scanning the EPO-R cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, it is evident that there are four potential Ship1-binding sites, with Tyr401potentially serving as the optimal binding site (Fig.7).Figure 7EPO-R expresses several consensus binding motifs for the Ship1 SH2 domain. The sequences at EPO-R Tyr343, Tyr401, Tyr429, and Tyr431 are shown as well as the consensus Ship1 SH2 domain-binding motif. The EPO-R consensus sequence is shown at the top, and similar residues are shown in boldface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the specific tyrosine residues that couple to Ship1 recruitment, a series of EPO-R tyrosine mutants was expressed in Ba/F3 cells. We initially examined a series of single tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr343(EPO-R-Y7,F1), Tyr401 (EPO-R-Y7,F2), Tyr429(EPO-R-Y7,F3), and Tyr431 (EPO-R-Y7,F4). All of these mutants were capable of activating Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation after EPO stimulation, and GST-Ship1 SH2 bound to each of these mutantsin vitro (data not shown). As a result, we focused on another series of EPO-R tyrosine mutants (Fig.8 A). Subclones of the wild-type EPO-R, EPO-R-Y7,F1, EPO-R-Y6,F1F2, EPO-R-Y5,F1F2F3, and EPO-R-Y4,F1F2F3F4 were isolated. All EPO-R mutants were shown to generate EPO-dependent proliferation when analyzed in XTT assays (data not shown). As described for Fig. 6, we examined the ability of EPO to stimulate Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation in each EPO-R tyrosine mutant (Fig. 8 B), tested the ability of GST-Ship1 SH2 to associate with each EPO-R construct in vitro (Fig. 8 C), and performed far-Western assays to test the ability of the Ship1 SH2 domain to bind directly to the EPO-R (Fig. 8 D). Immunoprecipitations were performed with a peptide-specific Ship1 antibody, followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting to analyze EPO-dependent Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation. EPO stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1 in Ba/F3-EPO-R (Fig. 8 B, lane 6), Ba/F3-EPO-R-Y7,F1 (lane 8), and Ba/F3-EPO-R-Y6,F1F2 (lane 10) cells. The level of Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation decreased in Ba/F3-EPO-R-Y5,F1F2F3 cells (lane 12) and was low, but detectable in Ba/F3-EPO-R-Y4,F1F2F3F4 cells (lane 14). No Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in Ba/F3 (lane 4) or Ba/F3-EPO-R-F8 (lane 16) cells. The previous experiments utilizing deletion mutants suggested that Tyr401 is the major binding site for the Ship1 SH2 domain. However, EPO stimulation of Ba/F3-EPO-R-Y6,F1F2 cells still resulted in significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Ship1, whereas EPO-dependent Ship1 phosphorylation was dramatically reduced in EPO-R-Y5,F1F2F3. Considerable redundancy exists in the ability of the EPO-R to recruit Ship1. The ability of the EPO-R to induce detectable Ship1 tyrosine phosphorylation in EPO-R-Y4,F1F2F3F4 cells could be mediated by the binding of Grb2 to EPO-R Tyr464. Ship1 could be recruited to the EPO-R indirectly through interaction with the Grb2 SH3 domains.Figure 8Ship1 associates with EPO-R Tyr401, Tyr429, and/or Tyr431.

https://openalex.org/W1992137936,"Polysialyltransferase-1 (PST; ST8Sia IV) is one of the α2,8-polysialyltransferases responsible for the polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). The presence of polysialic acid on NCAM has been shown to modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We previously reported that the PST enzyme itself is modified by α2,8-linked polysialic acid chainsin vivo. To understand the role of autopolysialylation in PST enzymatic activity, we employed a mutagenesis approach. We found that PST is modified by five Asn-linked oligosaccharides and that the vast majority of the polysialic acid is found on the oligosaccharide modifying Asn-74. In addition, the presence of the oligosaccharide on Asn-119 appeared to be required for folding of PST into an active enzyme. Co-expression of the PST Asn mutants with NCAM demonstrated that autopolysialylation is not required for PST polysialyltransferase activity. Notably, catalytically active, non-autopolysialylated PST does not polysialylate any endogenous COS-1 cell proteins, highlighting the protein specificity of polysialylation. Immunoblot analyses of NCAM polysialylation by polysialylated and non-autopolysialylated PST suggests that the NCAM is polysialylated to a higher degree by autopolysialylated PST. We conclude that autopolysialylation of PST is not required for, but does enhance, NCAM polysialylation.

It is found in human tissue and tumors (1.Troy F. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), in fish and sea urchin eggs (2.Inoue S. Iwaski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Science. 1992; 256: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and in neuroinvasive bacteria, such as Escherichia coli K1 (5.Robbins J.B. McCracken G.H.J. Gotschlich E.C. Orskov F. Orskov I. Hanson L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 290: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). While many forms of sialic acid and polysialic acid have been identified, the predominant form of polysialic acid found in mammals is a linear homopolymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) linked by α2,8-glycosidic bonds (6.Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 558-564Google Scholar), heretofore referred to as polysialic acid. A small group of mammalian proteins are modified by polysialic acid, including the α-subunit of the rat brain voltage-sensitive sodium channel (7.Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and unidentified proteins in breast cancer and basophilic leukemia cell lines (8.Martersteck C.M. Kedersha N.L. Drapp D.A. Tsui T.G. Colley K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the most abundant carrier of polysialic acid in mammals is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)1(9.Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). During development, high levels of polysialylated NCAM are observed in embryonic and neonatal tissues, such as developing brain (10.Finne J. Finne U. Deagostini-Bazin H. Gordis C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), kidney (11.Roth J. Taatjies D.J. Bitter-Suermann D. Finne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the majority of adult tissues lack polysialic acid or express very low levels of this carbohydrate structure (13.Edelman G.M. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that presence of polysialylated NCAM at the cell surface disrupts the homophilic binding properties of NCAM, thus facilitating cell migration during development (14.Rutishauser U.

Mooleanaar C.E.C. Michalides R.J.A.M. Bitter-Suermann D. Addis B.J. Mooi W.J. J. Pathol. 1989; 159: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), neuroblastoma (21.Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L.

This reexpression of polysialic acid is thought to enhance the metastatic potential of cancer cells by decreasing their adhesion and increasing their migration (21.Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L.

Although polysialylation of NCAM is most often associated with a decrease in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (27.Horstkorte R. Lessner N. Gerardy-Schahn R. Lucka L. Danker K. Reutter W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), recent data suggest that the polysialic acid modifying NCAM can enhance heterophilic binding of NCAM to proteoglycan substrates (28.Storms S.D.

While PST and STX both polysialylate NCAM, they exhibit slight differences in site preference, and PST synthesizes a longer polysialic acid chain than STX (37.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously reported that both the PST and STX enzymes are modified by α2,8-linked polysialic acid chains when expressed in COS-1 cells (38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a process termed autopolysialylation (39.Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These autopolysialylated polysialyltransferases localized to the Golgi, the cell surface, and were found soluble in the extracellular space. In addition, our data suggested that these autopolysialylated polysialyltransferases were the only polysialylated proteins expressed in COS-1 cells (38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the polysialic acid chains modifying PST and STX found at the cell surface and in the extracellular space could modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in a manner similar to those modifying polysialylated NCAM. Recent in vitro studies on autopolysialylated PST indicate that PST is modified by at least four Asn-linked oligosaccharides, with the number of polysialic acid chains unknown (39.Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that autopolysialylation of PST was a requirement for enzymatic activity toward NCAM (39.Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the carbohydrate modifications of PST and identify the requirements for autopolysialylation of the enzyme, as well as the requirements for polysialylation of NCAM by PST. Mutational analysis of human PST revealed that PST is modified by five Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The majority of the polysialic acid of autopolysialylated PST resides on the Asn-linked oligosaccharide modifying Asn-74. Our data also establish that the minimum requirement for autopolysialylation of PST is an Asn-linked oligosaccharide on Asn-74. Mutants of PST shown to be non-autopolysialylated by immunofluorescence, pulse-chase, and immunoblot analyses were co-expressed with full-length and soluble NCAM to determine if autopolysialylation was a requirement for enzymatic activity. Results from three separate experimental methodologies show that autopolysialylation of PST is not a prerequisite for enzymatic activity. Both soluble and membrane-bound forms of NCAM were polysialylated when co-expressed with a non-autopolysialylated form of PST. Comparison of the extent of NCAM polysialylation by polysialylated and non-autopolysialylated PST suggests that the NCAM is polysialylated to a higher degree by autopolysialylated PST. However, we conclude that autopolysialylation of PST is not a prerequisite for NCAM polysialylation.

COS-1 cells maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS were plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates or 12-mm glass coverslips and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Lipofectin transfections were performed according to the protocols provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Thirty microliters of Lipofectin and 20 μg of wild type or mutant PST-V5 plasmid DNA in 3 ml of Opti-MEM I + 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol were used for transfection of each 100-mm tissue culture plate.

COS-1 cells were plated on glass coverslips, transfected with wild type or mutant PST-V5 cDNA, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (40.Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with either −20 °C methanol to visualize internal staining or 3% paraformaldehyde to visualize cell surface staining. Anti-V5 epitope tag antibody was diluted 1:100 and the OL.28 anti-polysialic acid antibody, FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-mouse IgM, were diluted 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum/PBS blocking buffer prior to use. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using 20 μl of mounting medium (15% (w/v) Vinol 205 polyvinyl alcohol, 33% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% azide in PBS, pH 8.5). Cells were visualized and photographed using a Nikon Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination and a 60× oil immersion Plan Apochromat objective. Following transfection of COS-1 cells with wild type or mutant PST-V5 cDNA and expression of these proteins in the cells for 18 h, 100-mm tissue culture dishes of transfected cells were incubated with cysteine/methionine-free DMEM for 1 h.

Cells were incubated with the radiolabel for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After labeling, medium was removed and cells washed, the labeled proteins were chased for either 0 h (cell lysates) or 6 h with 4 ml of unlabeled DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). After 6 h of chase, cell medium was collected, debris removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant frozen overnight at −20 °C. The PST-V5 mutant and wild type proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and 6-h chase media using 2 μg of anti-V5 epitope tag antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (41.Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to avoid breakdown of the polysialic acid, the boiling step was omitted and the immunoprecipitation beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% BME and directly loaded into the gel wells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% separating, 3% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels (42.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207843) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 10% 2,5-diphenyloxalzole in dimethyl sulfoxide (43.Bonner W.M. Lasky R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar), and gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at −80 °C. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type or mutant PST-V5 cDNA as described before. Following transfection, the 3 ml of transfection mixture was removed, and 4 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added to the cells and the cells incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell medium was collected, debris removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant frozen overnight at −20 °C. Cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS, removed by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed on ice by addition of 250 ml of TBS, 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant frozen overnight at −20 °C. The PST-V5 mutant and wild type proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and media and electrophoresed as described above. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 500 mA. The membranes were processed for immunoblotting according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Anti-polysialic acid antibody, OL.28 (IgM), was diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer 1 (2% dry milk in TBS, pH 8.0). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgM, was diluted 1:8000 in blocking buffer 2 (5% dry milk in TBS, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at room temperature. COS-1 cells maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent and essentially transfected as described before. For each coverslip, the ratio of mutant PST-V5 to NCAM 140 plasmid DNA transfected was 1:1 (0.5 μg:0.5 μg). Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described before. Both primary antibodies, OL.28 anti-polysialic acid antibody and anti-mouse NCAM IgG, and secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-mouse IgM, were diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum in PBS) prior to use. In duplicate, COS-1 cells plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates were co-transfected with wild type and mutant PST-V5 and NCAM-Fc plasmid DNA at a ratio of 4:1, respectively (20 μg: 5 μg). For the first set of plates, 7 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added following transfection and the cells incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, cells were radiolabeled for 1 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine-methionine mix as described before. After labeling, medium was removed and cells washed, the labeled proteins were chased for 3 h with 4 ml of unlabeled DMEM, 10% FBS. Cell medium was collected, debris centrifuged down, and the supernatant frozen overnight at −20 °C. The medium was thawed at room temperature and precleared with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Sepharose CL-6B for 1 h by end-over-end rotation 4 °C. The Sepharose CL-6B beads were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant transferred to a clean tube. Soluble NCAM-Fc was precipitated from the medium by addition of 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose and end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated on 5% separating/3% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels after the addition of 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% BME and incubation of the protein A-Sepharose beads at 65 °C for 5 min. This heating step was added to eliminate the formation of NCAM-Fc dimers. Gels were processed for fluorography as described above. For the second set of plates, the 3 ml transfection mixture was removed following transfection and 4 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, cell medium collected, debris centrifuged down, and the supernatant frozen overnight at −20 °C. Soluble NCAM-Fc was precipitated from the medium as described above. The protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% BME, directly loaded into the gel wells, and electrophoresed on 5% separating/3% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described before. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 500 mA, and the membranes were processed for immunoblotting with the OL.28 anti-polysialic acid antibody as described above. After finding that PST is autopolysialylated in vivo(38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we wondered how autopolysialylation is related to polysialyltransferase activity. To investigate this question, we needed to know where polysialic acid was located on the PST protein in order to eliminate it and analyze the activity of the non-autopolysialylated protein using NCAM as a substrate. In addition, if we found that PST was polysialylated on a limited number of Asn-linked oligosaccharides, this would suggest specificity in the autopolysialylation event and make it more reasonable to use PST as a model protein to investigate the protein sequence and carbohydrate structure requirements for its polysialylation. To determine which Asn-linked oligosaccharides of PST are polysialylated, we first needed to establish which Asn-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites in the PST sequence are used. Human PST (33.Nakayama J. Fukuda M. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) has six potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites (Fig.1 A), with a seventh being the disallowed Asn-Pro-Ser/Thr sequence (Asn-191). Asn residues in each consensus glycosylation site were mutated to Ser as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ser was chosen to replace Asn, based on previous observations with Asn replacements in the ST6Gal I protein in which an isosteric Gln replacement generated a protein that was misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while a Ser replacement led to a Golgi-localized and active sialyltransferase. 2Chen, C., and Colley, K. J. (2000)Glycobiology, in press. COS-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant PST proteins were metabolically labeled with 35S-Express protein labeling mix for 1 h in order to detect predominantly non-autopolysialylated species (38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). V5 epitope-tagged enzymes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-V5 epitope tag antibody and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Typically, a single non-autopolysialylated Asn-linked oligosaccharide contributes approximately 3–4 kDa to the molecular mass of a protein. Thus, mutagenesis of the Asn residue in a glycosylated consensus sequence will result in a protein that migrates 3–4 kDa smaller than the wild type protein. Analysis of wild type glycosylated, but non-autopolysialylated, PST by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 61 kDa, which corresponds to the expected molecular mass of human PST modified by the V5 epitope tag and five Asn-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 1 B). Individual mutations of Asn residues 50, 74, 119, 204, and 219 to Ser resulted in proteins with reduced molecular mass (∼58-kDa) in comparison to wild type PST (Fig. 1 B, compareWT to N50S, N74S, N119S,N204S, and N219S). This demonstrated each of these Asn residues is modified by an oligosaccharide in the wild type PST protein. In contrast, no change in molecular mass occurred when Asn-191 or Asn-327 were converted to Ser, indicating that these residues are not glycosylated (Fig. 1 B, compareWT to N191S and N327S). In addition,N-glycosidase F treatment of a multiple PST mutant lacking Asn residues 50, 74, 119, 204, and 219 confirmed that no other Asn-linked oligosaccharides were present on the protein (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that human PST is modified by five Asn-linked oligosaccharides. From this point on, we will refer to Asn residues 50, 74, 119, 204, and 219 as Asn residues 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (Fig. 1 B, bottom). To establish whether the PST glycosylation mutants were autopolysialylated like wild type PST, we expressed these proteins in COS-1 cells that lack endogenous polysialyltransferases and polysialic acid (38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expressing cells were metabolically labeled with 35S-Express protein labeling mix for 1 h, chased with unlabeled medium for 6 h, the mutant PST proteins immunoprecipitated from the cell medium and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Wild type PST appeared as two forms: a 61-kDa glycosylated, but non-autopolysialylated form, and a polydisperse form with an apparent molecular mass ranging from 105 kDa to well above 200 kDa (Fig.2 A, WT). Previous work established that the latter form of PST represents the autopolysialylated enzyme (38.Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutation of Asn-1, -4, or -5 to Ser resulted in proteins that migrated like the wild type enzyme on SDS gels (Fig. 2 A, mutants 1,4, and 5). In contrast, mutation of Asn-2 to Ser resulted in a dramatic reduction in the high molecular mass form of the enzyme (Fig. 2 A, mutant 2), and mutation of Asn-3 to Ser completely eliminated the high molecular mass form (Fig. 2 A, mutant 3). We confirmed that the polydisperse, high molecular mass forms of wild type and mutant PST proteins are α2,8-linked polysialylated proteins in a parallel immunoblot experiment (Fig. 2 B). Proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells, immunoprecipitated from unlabeled cell medium, and were analyzed by immunoblotting with the OL"

The induction of theM r 73,000 protein reached a 7-fold maximum 24 h after induction. The protein was confirmed by its enzyme activity to be a long-chain fatty-acid alcohol oxidase (LC-FAO) and purified to homogeneity from microsomes by a rapid procedure involving hydrophobic chromatography. An internal peptide of 30 amino acids was sequenced. A 1100-base pair cDNA fragment containing the LC-FAO peptide coding sequence was used to isolate a single exon genomic clone containing the full-length coding sequence of an LC-FAO (fao1). The fao1 gene product was expressed inEscherichia coli and was translated as a functional long-chain alcohol oxidase, which was present in the membrane fraction. In addition, full-length coding sequences for a Candida tropicalis LC-FAO (faoT) and a second C. cloacae LC-FAO (fao2) were isolated.

These water-immiscible substrates are metabolized to carbon dioxide by two sequential oxidative pathways: (a) the membrane-bound ω-oxidation pathway and (b) the β-oxidation pathway located in peroxisomes. During ω-oxidation, the methyl end of the molecule is oxidized successively by a cytochrome P450 alkane/fatty-acid oxidase, a hydrogen peroxide-generating alcohol oxidase, and an aldehyde dehydrogenase, producing ω-alcohols, ω-aldehydes, and ω-fatty acids, respectively. Growth on both alkanes and fatty acids results in dicarboxylic acid formation as a metabolic intermediate. Such long-chain dicarboxylic acids are very versatile raw materials for the oleochemical industry and are used in the production of fragrances, polyamides, polyesters, adhesives, and macrolide antibiotics (1.Picataggio S. Rohrer T. Deanda K. Lanning D. Reynolds R. Mielenz J. Eirich L.D. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 894-898PubMed Google Scholar). The dicarboxylic acid products of ω-oxidation are further oxidized in the peroxisome by the β-oxidation pathway following activation to acyl-CoAs. Two different biological modes of alcohol dehydrogenation have been identified. The first is a nicotinamide-dependent reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases, and the second is a flavin-dependent reaction catalyzed by alcohol oxidase. The latter uses molecular oxygen as acceptor and generates hydrogen peroxide (2.Geissler J. Hemmerich P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 3.Kemp G.D. Dickinson F.M. Ratledge C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1988; 29: 370-374Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Flavin-dependent alcohol oxidases have been isolated from a number of different fungal sources (4.Kato N. Omori Y. Tani Y. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5.Tykarska E. Leibioda L. Marchut E . Steczko J. Stec B. J.

Lett. 1991; 80: 221-224Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In all organisms studied to date, the enzyme is octameric, with the exception of C. tropicalis, where it is dimeric (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the enzyme differs considerably depending on the source of the enzyme. In C. tropicalis, the enzyme is most active on long-chain fatty alcohols (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas secondary alcohols such as dodecan-2-ol and long-chain ω-hydroxy fatty acids are also good substrates of the enzyme (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alcohol oxidases fromKloeckera sp., Hansenula polymorpha, andCandida boidinii are very active toward methanol and ethanol, but are inactive toward substrates of chain length longer than C5 and will not oxidize secondary alcohols or ω-hydroxy fatty acids (4.Kato N. Omori Y. Tani Y. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6.Sahm H. Schutte H. Kula M.-R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity has also been investigated for the alcohol oxidase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavipes grown on hexadecanol. Although this enzyme will oxidize long-chain alcohols, it will not utilize α,ω-diols, ω-hydroxy fatty acids, or secondary alcohols (9.Savitha J. Ratledge C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 80: 221-224Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The enzymes from Candida maltosa (10.Mauersberger S. Drechsler H. Oehme G. Müller H.-G. Appl. Microbiol.

J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and C. cloacae (11.Picataggio, S., Deanda, K., and Erlich, L. D. (1991) International Patent WO 91/06660Google Scholar) all oxidize ω-hydroxy fatty acids, whereas those from other organisms studied lack the ability to use these substrates. Long-chain alcohol oxidase has been purified from C. tropicalis (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but to date, there is no gene or amino acid sequence available. Oxidation of long-chain alcohols by alcohol oxidase has been reported in germinating seedlings of the plant Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) (12.Moreau R.A. Huang A.H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which accumulates long-chain fatty alcohol-containing waxes as its main storage product. The utilization of these storage products as an energy source requires an appropriate oxidative pathway, presumably having ω-oxidation as a key component. However, to date, no potential long-chain alcohol oxidase DNA coding sequences have been identified in plants. There has been much interest in cloning and manipulating genes of the alkane/fatty acid oxidation pathway in industrial yeast species (1.Picataggio S. Rohrer T. Deanda K. Lanning D. Reynolds R. Mielenz J. Eirich L.D. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 894-898PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Casey J. Dobb R. Mycock G. J. Gen.

Strains giving high yields of dicarboxylic acids from alkane- or fatty acid-containing media have been produced by selective mutagenesis of the oxidation pathways. However, comparatively little is known at the molecular level about long-chain fatty-acid alcohol oxidases and aldehyde dehydrogenases from these organisms. In this study, we report the induction of C. cloacaeproteins upon transfer to a lipid-based growth medium, purification and partial amino acid sequence determination of long-chain fatty-acid alcohol oxidase, the first isolation of cDNA and genomic clones from C. cloacae and C. tropicalis, and the functional expression of an alcohol oxidase in Escherichia coli. It is expected that disruption of these genes will result in industrial yeast strains capable of producing ω-hydroxy fatty acids from fatty acid substrates. C. cloacae strain 3152 FERM P-736 was used throughout these experiments (15.Akabori, S., Shiio, I., and Uchio, R. (1972) International Patent CO7C 55/02Google Scholar). It was maintained at 4 °C on agar slopes containing (per 100 ml) 1.5 g of agar, 0.5 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of peptone, and 1 g of sucrose. Starter cultures, used to inoculate shake flasks and fermentors, unless otherwise specified, were prepared by transferring a loop of agar slope culture into 50 ml of medium containing 0.25 g of yeast extract, 0.25 g of peptone, and 0.5 g of sucrose and incubating for 24 h in a baffled 250-ml flask at 30 °C with shaking at 90 rpm. The minimal medium for shake flask cultures contained (per liter) 25 g of sucrose, 7.6 g of NH4Cl, 1.5 g of Na2SO4, 300 ml of 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 mg of ZnSO4·7H2O, 20 mg of MnSO4·4H2O, 20 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 2 g of MgCl2·6H2O, 100 μg of biotin, 20 mg of nicotinic acid, 20 mg of pyridoxine, 8 mg of thiamine, and 6 mg of pantothenate. Bulk preparation of induced cells for enzyme preparation was performed in 6-liter fermentors (Biolafitte) using a minimal medium containing (per liter) 10 g of hexadecane (in place of sucrose as carbon source), 4.5 g of (NH4)2HPO4, 1.5 g of yeast extract, 0.1 g of CaCl2, and 1.5 g of Na2SO4. The remaining vitamins and minerals were as detailed above. The minimal medium (5 liters) was inoculated with 2% (v/v) starter culture and then grown at 30 °C and 0.45 liters/min aeration with stirring at 700 rpm and a pH control at 6.4 by auto-addition of 40% NaOH. When the hexadecane substrate was fully utilized (15–20 h), the cells were harvested (3500 g/10 min); washed with 3 liters of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5); and resuspended in 140 ml of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to cell disruption using a French pressure cell. The wet weight of cells was typically 110–120 g. C. tropicalis strain NCYC 470 was grown in the same way as C. cloacae on an alkane medium. Starter cultures of C. cloacae were grown overnight in 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2.5% sucrose at 30 °C. Baffled flasks containing 250 ml of minimal medium and sucrose as the carbon source were inoculated with 2.0 ml of starter culture and grown for 48 h at 30 °C and 90 rpm on a shaker. The cells were then centrifuged at 2400 × g for 10 min; the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in the same volume of minimal medium but with 1% oleic acid as the carbon source instead of sucrose; and incubation was continued at 30 °C and 90 rpm for a further 125 h. Samples of 30 ml were removed from the flasks immediately before addition of oleic acid and at 6, 24, 50, and 125 h after addition. They were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Cell-free extracts were made from the pellets by grinding each pellet in liquid N2 three times and then rapidly resuspending the powder in 10 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol and 0.5% CHAPS1 and centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The procedure developed involved microsomal preparation, solubilization, and (NH4)2SO4precipitation followed by chromatography on phenyl-Superose. All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Cells (132 g, wet weight) were passed through a French pressure cell three times at 20,000 p.s.i.; the disrupted cell extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min; and the precipitate was discarded. At this and other stages, the preparation was snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C prior to further processing. The supernatant was thawed, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to give a final volume of 230 ml. The microsomal fraction was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 140,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The pellet was washed by suspending in 100 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m KCl (final volume of 115 ml) and pelleted at 140,000 × gfor 1.5 h. The washed microsomes were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) (final volume of 62 ml). The resuspended pellet was made up to 500 ml with 50 mmHEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0). Sodium cholate was added to 1.0%, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (in isopropyl alcohol) was added to 1 mm, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 35% (w/v); the solution was stirred for 20 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. (NH4)2SO4 was added to 55% (w/v) to the supernatant; the solution was stirred for 20 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 1% sodium cholate to a final volume of 52 ml, dialyzed 2 × 1 h against two changes of 2 liters of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) and a further 500 ml of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 1% CHAPS for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 5 min to give a clear supernatant. The (NH4)2SO4 precipitant was resuspended, dialyzed, and diluted to 15 ml with the column equilibration buffer; filtered through a 0.2-μm filter; and loaded onto a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 1.7m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.5% CHAPS. After washing the column with 15 ml of buffer, a 10-ml linear reverse gradient was run from 1.7 to 0.85 m(NH4)2SO4, followed by a 15-ml linear gradient from 0.85 to 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4. A flow rate of 0.6 ml/min was used throughout. To produce a probe for the cDNA library screen, 1 μl (1.5 × 103 plaque-forming units) of the C. cloacae oleic acid-induced cDNA (non-amplified) library was placed into a reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of M13 forward primer (5′-TTG TAA AAC GAC GGC CAG T-3′) or M13 reverse primer (5′-CAC ACA GGA AAC AGC TAT GAC C-3′), 20 pmol of internal degenerate FAO primer (5′-ACN AAY CAR CAR CTN TTY ATG ATH GC-3′, where N = ACGT, Y = CT, R = AG, and H = ACT; corresponding to the amino acid sequence TNQQLFMIA), 2 units of Taq polymerase, 1.5 mm MgCl2-containing PCR buffer, and 1.25 mm dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification was performed under the following conditions for 35 cycles: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. A mixture of products resulted from the reverse and internal primer reactions, and these were subcloned into pGEM®-T vector (Promega) and analyzed by sequencing. The largest open reading frame clone, named pAX17, was used in subsequent hybridization experiments as described below. Poly(A)+ mRNAs from 24-h oleic acid-induced C. cloacae and C. tropicalis were used for the construction of a random-primed non-directional cDNA library in EcoRI-digested alkaline phosphatase-treated λZapII vector (Stratagene). Approximately 5 μg of mRNA was used in the reverse transcriptase reaction (TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).EcoRI/NotI adapters were added to the ends, and cDNA was ligated with EcoRI-digested λZapII. Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) was used to form phage particles, which were used to transfect E. coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). Genomic C. cloacae andC. tropicalis DNAs were isolated from cells grown on 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, and 20 g/liter glucose according to Philippsen et al. (20.Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A Sau3A partial digest of C. cloacae DNA was size-fractionated to 14–23 kb on a 10–40% sucrose gradient and ligated into λBluestarBamHI arms (Novagen). Gigapack II Gold-packaged particles were used to transfect E. coli ER1647 (Novagen). ASau3A partial digest of C. tropicalis DNA was size-fractionated on a 10–40% sucrose gradient to 10–12 kb and ligated into ZapExpress BamHI arms (Stratagene). PhageMaker packaging extract (Novagen) was used to form phage particles, which were then used to transfect XL1-Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene). For the C. cloacaecDNA screen, prehybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 2 h in 6× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.05 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, and hybridization was carried out at 65 °C overnight in essentially the same buffer but without herring sperm DNA and with 1 mm EDTA. Filters were washed at 65 °C with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS (2 × 15 min) and with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS (2 × 15 min). For the C. tropicalis screen, prehybridization was carried out at 55 °C for 2 h, and hybridization was carried out at 55 °C overnight in the same buffers as listed above. Filters were washed 2 × 30 min at 55 °C with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. For the C. cloacae screen, prehybridization was carried out for 2 h at 55 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 50% formamide, and hybridization was carried out with the probe overnight at 55 °C in the same hybridization mixture. Filters were washed 3 × 15 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. For theC. tropicalis screen, prehybridization was carried out for 2 h at 42 °C, and hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in the same hybridization mixture as described above. Filters were washed 2 × 15 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and 2 × 15 min in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. C. cloacae cells were grown for 24 h in minimal medium containing either 2% glucose or 1% oleic acid as a carbon source. The cells were harvested and ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid N2, and RNA was extracted using hot SDS (21.Hall T.C. Ma Y. Buchbinder B.U. Pyne J.W. Sun S.M. Bliss F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3196-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared using oligo(dT) spun columns (Pharmacia mRNA Purification kit). Northern analysis was conducted using 2 μg of mRNAs on agarose gels containing 0.66 mformaldehyde, blotting onto Hybond-NTM membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridizing according to standard methods (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a Rediprime random primer-labeled probe (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA samples were prepared from cells grown under identical conditions described for Northern analyses, except that samples were grown on hexadecane. They were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 15 min to remove possible DNA contamination. DNase I was subsequently inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min in the presence of 2.5 mm EDTA. The resulting RNA (2 μg) was used as a template for RT-PCR using theCLONTECH RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides 5′- atgtcccatcaagttgaagacc-3′ and 5′-atgaatcccgttgttgaagacagcc-3′ are specific to fao1 andfao2 5′-end coding sequences, respectively; the oligonucleotides 5′-ctaaagtttagtttgtggttgcaagtc-3′ and 5′-ctaaagtttactttgttgc-3′ are specific to fao1 andfao2 3′-end coding sequences, respectively. PCRs were carried out for 29 cycles with denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min and were performed on a Robocycler (Stratagene). Initial experiments demonstrated that up to 30 cycles of PCR product formation was linear. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to PCR-amplify the full-length fao1 coding sequence: 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGTCCCATCAAGTTGAAGACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTAAAGTTTAGTTTGTGG TTGCAAGTC-3′. The purified PCR product was digested by NheI and BamHI and subsequently cloned into the overexpression vector pET17b (Novagen); the resulting plasmid was designated pET17b-fao1. The sequence of the fao1 coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells according to the Stratagene protocol, and the cells were grown on an LB/ampicillin plate overnight. One colony was transferred into 5 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml), and the culture was grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in 250 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 mm EDTA. For enzyme assay, microsomal fractions were prepared from 500 ml of overnight culture grown on LB medium. The pellet was finally washed and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 mmEDTA. SDS-polyacrylamide gels consisted of a 5% stacking gel with a 10% running gel and were run on a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean gel kit. The buffers used were as described by Laemmli (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was carried out at 200 V for 2.5 h on a 10% resolving and 5% stacking gel as described above for SDS-PAGE, except that the SDS was replaced by 1 and 0.5% sodium cholate in the gel and running buffers, respectively. The sample buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% glycerol, 1% sodium cholate, and sufficient bromphenol blue to make it visible. The running buffer and apparatus were chilled on ice before and during the run. The sample was 50 μl of 0.2 units of hydroxylapatite-purified C. cloacae material prepared by the method of Dickinson and Wadforth (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To stain the gel for enzyme activity, buffer, ABTS, and peroxidase at 10 times the concentration used in the standard LC-FAO assay and dodecanol at 2.7 mm were applied to the surface of the gel. This was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Alcohol oxidase activity was identified as a region of green stain on the surface of the gel. The region containing the biological activity was cut out from the native gel and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. LC-FAO was assayed by spectrophotometry (3.Kemp G.D. Dickinson F.M. Ratledge C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1988; 29: 370-374Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) 0.7 mg/ml ABTS, 7 units of horseradish peroxidase, and 50 μmdodecanol previously dissolved in Me2SO, in a final volume of 1.0 ml unless otherwise specified. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured. The value of ε for the radical cation of ABTS is 18.4 mm−1 cm−1, and 1 mol of substrate gives rise to 2 mol of radical cation (17.Werner W. Rey H.G. Wielinger H. Z. Anal. Chem. 1970; 252: 224-228Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity catalyzes the conversion of 1 nmol of substrate to product/min. This was determined using the dye binding method of Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. This was performed using the Promega procedure with Chromaphor green to detect the protein in the first gel and Endoproteinase Glu-C for digestion (19.Elborough K.M. Simon J.W. Swinhoe R. Ashton A.R. Slabas A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For N-terminal amino acid sequence determination, proteins were transferred onto Problot membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining as directed in the Problot manual. Amino acid sequencing was performed with an ABI Model 477 sequencer. Sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA sequencer. Computer analysis of DNA sequences was carried out using DNA Strider (23.Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and FASTA alignments. All biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma and were highest purity available. Reagents for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Both LC-FAO enzyme activity and SDS-PAGE protein profiles were analyzed in cell extracts of C. cloacaefollowing transfer from a sucrose-containing growth medium to one containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source. The induction of LC-FAO enzyme activity increased 4-fold in 6 h and reached a maximum of 7-fold at 24 h; similar results were obtained using the alkane hexadecane as an inducer (data not shown). C. cloacae cell extracts from cultures grown for 0, 6, and 125 h after addition of oleic acid were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained for protein with Coomassie Blue. Growth on oleic acid resulted in the induction of proteins of M r102,000, 73,000, 61,000, 54,000, and 46,000 and two in the region ofM r 45,000 and the disappearance of a protein ofM r 64,000 (Fig.1). We initially adopted a procedure similar to that used for the purification of LC-FAO from C. tropicalis (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TheC. tropicalis procedure did not, however, result in a homogeneous preparation with C. cloacae extracts. Accordingly, we developed a procedure with hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Superose as a key step in the purification, taking advantage of the hydrophobic nature of the protein. It was essential to prepare the microsomes from alkane-induced cells as oleic acid-induced cells accumulated fatty acids, which interfere with membrane pelleting during the ultracentrifugation step. By directly applying the resuspended (NH4)2SO4 precipitate to a phenyl-Superose column and eluting it with a reverse gradient of (NH4)2SO4, it was possible to obtain a homogeneous preparation. The fractions with highest activity eluted at ∼0.7 m(NH4)2SO4 (Fig.2 A). Analysis of alcohol oxidase activity and protein profiles by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the activity coincided with the elution of the M r73,000 protein (Fig. 2 B). The enzyme was purified 230-fold with a 10.7% recovery of biological activity (TableI). Further evidence that LC-FAO is anM r 73,000 protein was obtained from native gels. The enzyme activity was visualized directly on the gel as a green band when the gel was incubated with enzyme assay reagents. This band was excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and a major band atM r 73,000 was seen, confirming assignment of this band as LC-FAO. The molecular weight of the alcohol oxidase fromC. cloacae is the same as that reported for the LC-FAO enzyme from C. tropicalis (7.Dickinson F.M. Wadforth C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pH optimum of the enzyme from C. cloacae was between 8.5 and 9.0, and the apparentK m for dodecanol was between 4.0 and 5.0 μm (data not shown).Table IPurification of long-chain fatty acid alcohol oxidase from C. cloacaeVolumeUnitsProteinSpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgfold%Cell extract230201257500.351.0100Membranes115151017830.852.475Washed membranes62143011781.213.571Thawed washed membranes50082411750.72.04155% (NH4)2SO4pellet527541564.813.737Dialyzed centrifuged (NH4)2SO4pellet69824978.524.341Phenyl Superose pooled fractions232142.78023010.7 Open table in a new tab N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed three times on purified LC-FAO following transfer to Problot.

https://openalex.org/W2090170736,"Caenorhabditis elegans protein kinase A (PKAICE) is tethered to organelles in vivo. A unique A kinase anchor protein (AKAPCE) avidly binds the RI-like regulatory subunits (RCE) of PKAICE and stringently discriminates against RIIα and RIIβ subunits, the preferred ligands for classical AKAPs. We elucidated structural features that stabilize AKAPCE·RCE complexes and confer atypical R isoform specificity on the anchor protein. Three large aliphatic amino acids (Leu236, Ile248, and Leu252) in the tethering domain of AKAPCE(residues 236–255) are crucial for ligation of RCE. Their side chains apparently generate a precisely configured hydrophobic binding pocket that accommodates an apolar surface on RCEdimers. Basic residues (His254-Arg255-Lys256) at the C terminus of the tethering site set an upper limit on affinity for RCE. A central dipeptide (Phe243-Ser244) contributes critical and distinctive properties of the tethering site. Ser244 is essential for selective binding of RCE and exclusion of RII isoforms. The aromatic hydrophobic character of Phe243ensures maximal RCE binding activity, thereby supporting a “gatekeeper” function of Ser244. Substitution of Phe243-Ser244 with Leu-Val generated an RII-specific AKAP. RCE and RII subunits contain similar dimerization domains. AKAP-binding domains of RCE (residues 23–47) and RII differ markedly in size, amino acid sequence, and docking specificity. Four hydrophobic residues (Cys23, Val27, Ile32, and Cys44) in RCE are crucial for avid binding with AKAPCE, whereas side chains from Leu20, Leu35, Val36, Ile40, and Ile41 have little impact on complex formation. Tyr26 is embedded in the docking domain, but its aromatic ring is required for RCE-RCE dimerization. Residues 236–255 in AKAPCE also constitute a binding site for mammalian RIα. RIα (PKAIα) is tightly sequestered by AKAPCE in vitro (K D = ∼10 nm) and in the environment of intact cells. The tethering domain of AKAPCEprovides a molecular module for manipulating intracellular localization of RI and elucidating functions of anchored PKAI in eukaryotes.

Basic residues (His254-Arg255-Lys256) at the C terminus of the tethering site set an upper limit on affinity for RCE. A central dipeptide (Phe243-Ser244) contributes critical and distinctive properties of the tethering site. Ser244 is essential for selective binding of RCE and exclusion of RII isoforms. The aromatic hydrophobic character of Phe243ensures maximal RCE binding activity, thereby supporting a “gatekeeper” function of Ser244. Substitution of Phe243-Ser244 with Leu-Val generated an RII-specific AKAP. RCE and RII subunits contain similar dimerization domains. AKAP-binding domains of RCE (residues 23–47) and RII differ markedly in size, amino acid sequence, and docking specificity. Four hydrophobic residues (Cys23, Val27, Ile32, and Cys44) in RCE are crucial for avid binding with AKAPCE, whereas side chains from Leu20, Leu35, Val36, Ile40, and Ile41 have little impact on complex formation. Tyr26 is embedded in the docking domain, but its aromatic ring is required for RCE-RCE dimerization. Residues 236–255 in AKAPCE also constitute a binding site for mammalian RIα. RIα (PKAIα) is tightly sequestered by AKAPCE in vitro (K D = ∼10 nm) and in the environment of intact cells. The tethering domain of AKAPCEprovides a molecular module for manipulating intracellular localization of RI and elucidating functions of anchored PKAI in eukaryotes. protein kinase A or cAMP-dependent protein kinase A kinase anchor protein regulatory subunit of protein kinase A isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside glutathioneS-transferase fast protein liquid chromatography Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs)1 mediate many actions of hormones and neurotransmitters that stimulate adenylate cyclase (1.Edelman A.M.

Clustering of a high concentration of AKAP·PKAII complexes in proximity with PKA substrate/effector proteins in cytoskeleton/organelles enables efficient reception, rapid amplification, and precisely focused targeting of cAMP signals.

However, the folding pattern and physical properties of amino acids that subserve the ligation of RII subunits are universal properties of AKAPs. The RII-binding region of typical AKAPs comprises 16–20 contiguous amino acids that have a predicted propensity to fold into an amphipathic α-helix (25.Carr D.W. Stofko-Han R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Acolt T.S. Brennon R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helix includes six critical, precisely positioned amino acids whose large aliphatic side chains co-operatively create an extended hydrophobic surface (19.Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size, hydrophobicity, and configuration of this domain generate a unique receptor site for a complementary, apolar docking surface that is produced from the folding of ∼30 amino acid residues in RIIα or RIIβ dimers (26.Li Y.

The development of a comprehensive data base of information on structure, function, mechanism of assembly, and physiological significance of AKAP·PKAII complexes contrasts sharply with our lack of knowledge concerning intracellular targeting and tethering of RI subunits and potential functions for anchored PKAI. RIα is expressed in nearly all mammalian tissues, where it mediates (as PKAIα) regulatory effects of many hormones (1.Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 2.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Immunochemical staining of intact cells and biochemical assays performed on fractions derived from cell or tissue homogenates indicate that a large proportion of RIα (PKAIα) is dispersed in cytoplasm (5.Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). However, several observations suggest that PKAI can also be adapted for specialized functions by binding with anchor proteins. Substantial amounts of RIα (PKAIα) are associated with the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes (30.Rubin C.S. Rosenfeld R.D. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3735-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); recruited to a multi-protein complex at the “cap” site of activated T lymphocytes (31.Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); sequestered along the fibrous sheath of mammalian spermatozoa (32.Moos J. Peknicova J. Geussova G. Philimonenko V. Hozak P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); and juxtaposed with the post-synaptic myocyte cell membrane at neuromuscular junctions (33.Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Faust D.M. Benichou J.C. Hellio R. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activity of a voltage-gated,l-type calcium channel in skeletal muscle transverse tubules is increased when co-localized, anchored PKAII is activated and phosphorylates a Ser residue near the C terminus of the α1C channel subunit (8.Gray P.C. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In knockout mice that lack RIIα and RIIβ subunits in muscle, PKAIα binds with the channel-associated anchor protein and sustains normal, cAMP-controlled potentiation of Ca2+ flux by providing a properly localized supply of PKA catalytic subunits (34.Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Rescue of calcium channel regulation by immobilized PKAIα is apparently explained by the discovery that high affinity RII-binding sites in certain AKAPs also ligate RIα (PKAIα). However, these AKAPs bind RIIα (PKAIIα) with 25–500-fold higher affinity than RIα (34.Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35.Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Only small amounts of PKAIα are likely to be anchored by this mechanism in normal physiological contexts because most cells/tissues have concentrations of RIIα and/or RIIβ subunits that approach or exceed the level of RI (1.Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 2.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

Nevertheless, the cited studies suggest important principles: (a) RI dimers have a binding surface available for interactions with anchor proteins, (b) PKAIα can be anchored in intact cells, and (c) properly targeted AKAP·PKAIα complexes can be poised to phosphorylate a co-localized effector protein and thereby, selectively regulate a key, compartmentalized physiological process. A complementary but potentially incisive approach to advancing our understanding of the molecular basis and regulatory significance of PKAI anchoring involves discovery and systematic characterization of RI-selective, prototype AKAPs. Ideally, AKAPs to be studied should engage RI (PKAI) with high affinity (K D in the 1–100 nm range) and efficiently discriminate against RII subunits (e.g. KA(RI):KA(RII) ≥ 100) in vitro and in cells. Recently, we discovered the first eukaryotic tethering protein that fulfills the specified criteria (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AKAPCE is a novel Caenorhabditis elegansprotein composed of 1280 amino acids (M r = 144,000). The tethering site of AKAPCE binds the RIα-like subunits (RCE) of C. elegans PKAI (PKAICE) with a K D of 7 nm(37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, high concentrations of RIIα and RIIβ subunits do not competitively inhibit formation of RCE·AKAPCE complexes in vitro or in transfected cells. The AKAPCE polypeptide includes a RING finger domain and other putative anchoring motifs 3R. A. Angelo and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. that may mediate the routing of tethered PKAICE to several intracellular docking sites (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKAICE is 82% identical with Cα, the predominant catalytic subunit of all mammalian PKA isoforms (38.Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Lu X. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6896-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RCE is closely related to mammalian RIα (∼60% overall sequence identity) but not RII subunits (39.Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans 60% of PKAICE is tightly associated with organelles/cytoskeleton (39.Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AKAPCE is the principal RCE-binding protein.3 Because pathways and mechanisms of signal transduction are highly conserved between C. elegans and mammals (40.Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 41.Sternberg P.W. Han M. Trends.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it is probable that tethering and targeting of RCE subunits by AKAPCE adapts and diversifies PKAICE for multiple functions in various compartments of C. elegans cells (39.Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of a high affinity, RCE-selective anchor protein (AKAPCE) and availability of cDNAs, protein expression systems, and specific antibodies for AKAPCE and RCE (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be exploited to elucidate molecular mechanisms that govern the selective targeting/anchoring of PKAI. Several basic but fundamental questions merit immediate consideration: What structural features in AKAPCE are essential for avid ligation of RCE? Conversely, which amino acid side chains in RCE create a binding surface that docks with the tethering site in AKAPCE? Which residues in RCEand the anchor protein govern binding affinity? How are RII (PKAII) isoforms excluded from the tethering site of AKAPCE? Does the tethering domain of AKAPCE exhibit plasticity? That is, can substitution of one or a few amino acids generate a binding region that selectively sequesters RII subunits? Can the wild type RCE tethering site bind mammalian RIα with high affinity? In this paper we address the central questions posed above and also report that the tethering module from AKAPCE may provide a molecular tool for manipulating the intracellular location of mammalian PKIα. Complementary cDNAs encoding AKAPCE, AKAP75, S-AKAP84, and human RIIβ were cloned and characterized as described in previous papers (9.Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

A cDNA clone encoding murine RIα was generously provided by Dr. Robert Steinberg (Department of Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma). Full-length cDNAs for RCE and RIIβ were subcloned in the bacterial expression plasmid pET14b as described previously (26.Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

An analogous pET14b construct was created for expression of RIα by following the strategy used for RIIβ cDNA (26.Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Phosphorylatable Ser residues were introduced into the pseudosubstrate sites of RCE and RIα via site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This mutation has no effect on the properties of RCE3 or RIα (43.Durgerian S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9807-9813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it enables efficient phosphorylation of R subunits by incubation with Mg[γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA, as previously reported (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cloning of cDNAs in pET14b enabled IPTG-inducible high level expression of soluble R subunits that contained an N-terminal, 20-residue fusion peptide. Included in the fusion peptide are six consecutive His residues (His tag) that enabled purification of recombinant RCE, RIα, and RIIβ proteins to near homogeneity, as described by Li and Rubin (26.Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A fragment of AKAPCE cDNA that encodes amino acids 176–409 in the anchor protein was cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-KG as described previously (37.Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This enabled synthesis of a GST-AKAPCE fusion protein in Escherichia coliDH5α that was transformed with recombinant plasmid and induced with IPTG. After induction, bacteria were disrupted in a French press, and the soluble GST-AKAPCE (176–409) protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously reported (44.Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RCE tethering domain of AKAPCE encompasses residues 236–255 (37.Angelo R.

Full-length RIα cDNA was excised from a recombinant pBluescript SK plasmid by digestion with NotI and ApaI and ligated into the Rc/CMV mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), which was cleaved with the same enzymes. This placed the cDNA downstream from a strong cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. RIα cDNA was also amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using previously described conditions (44.Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ primer appended aBamHI restriction site to the amplified cDNA; the 3′ primer contained an SpeI cleavage site. Amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and SpeI and then cloned in the mammalian expression vector pEBG (45.Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), which was cleaved with the same enzymes. (The pEBG plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Joseph Avruch, Harvard Medical School.) This accomplished an in-frame fusion of RIα cDNA with an upstream GST gene. The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification of RIα cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. Transcription of the chimeric gene is driven by the strong, constitutively active EF1α promoter; an optimal polyadenylation signal follows the inserted RIα cDNA. Mammalian cells transfected with this vector produce a dimeric GST-RIα fusion protein that is avidly and efficiently complexed by GSH-Sepharose 4B beads. Deletion mutagenesis was performed via polymerase chain reaction as described for AKAP75 and S-AKAP84 (19.Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the RCE-binding tethering domain of AKAPCE via site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (19.Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplified cDNAs and cDNAs containing various mutated codons were cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-KG (47.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) after digestion of insert and vector with EcoRI andHindIII. This placed cDNAs encoding partial AKAPCE polypeptides downstream from and in-frame with the 3′ terminus of a GST gene in the vector. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Transcription of the GST fusion gene is driven by an inducible tac promoter. High levels of chimeric GST partial AKAPCE polypeptides were produced when E. coliDH5α was transformed with recombinant pGEX-KG plasmids and then induced with 0.5 mm IPTG. GST-AKAPCE fusion proteins were purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B, as described previously (44.Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

First, several proteins, including origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex, need to be assembled on chromatin before initiation. Second, cyclin-dependent kinases regulate DNA replication in both a positive and a negative way by inducing the initiation of DNA replication at G1/S transition and preventing further rounds of origin firing within the same cell cycle. Here we characterize a link between the two levels. Immunoprecipitation ofXenopus origin recognition complex with anti-XOrc1 or anti-XOrc2 antibodies specifically co-immunoprecipitates a histone H1 kinase activity. The kinase activity is sensitive to several inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases including 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP), olomoucine, and p21Cip1. This kinase activity also copurifies with ORC over several fractionation steps and was identified as a complex of the Cdc2 catalytic subunit and cyclin A1. Neither Cdk2 nor cyclin E could be detected in ORC immunoprecipitations. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations with anti-Xenopus Cdc2 or anti-Xenopus cyclin A1 antibodies specifically co-precipitate XOrc1 and XOrc2. Our results indicate that Xenopus ORC and Cdc2·cyclin A1 physically interact and demonstrate a physical link between an active cyclin-dependent kinase and proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication.

Many experiments have indicated that the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires at least two components: replication-competent chromatin and protein kinases that exert both positive and negative effects (1.Stillman B.

The origin recognition complex (ORC)1 was initially identified in budding yeast as a protein complex which binds to origins of replication and is essential for the initiation of replication (4.Bell S.P.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and Cdc6p, bind to ORC, or next to ORC, during the pre-replicative period of the cell cycle. Both are essential for the initiation of DNA replication; they are displaced from chromatin as replication proceeds and are absent from post-replicative chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 1.Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 2.Diffley J.F.X. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, ORC is bound to origins during both the pre-replicative and post-replicative period and the binding of Cdc6 and MCMs to chromatin is dependent on the presence of ORC (14.Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Indeed, a hierarchy of binding exists; ORC binds first, followed by ORC-dependent Cdc6 binding and Cdc6-dependent MCM binding. A wealth of experimental data points to the involvement of protein kinases in the initiation of replication. In yeast, genetic studies have identified the cdc2/CDC28 genes encoding protein kinases necessary for entry into S phase and M phase (19.Nurse P. Bissett Y. Nature. 1981; 292: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 20.Hartwell L. Culotti J. Pringle J.R. Reid B.J. Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, both Cdc2·cyclin A and Cdk2·cyclin E complexes have been implicated in triggering initiation of DNA replication (21.Blow J.J. Nurse P.

It is important to note that protein kinases of the Cdk family appear to exert both positive and negative effects on DNA replication; kinase activities present during S and G2phases of the cell cycle prevent a second round of replication (reviewed in Ref. 28.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and specifically inhibit rebinding of MCM proteins (27.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28.Romanowski P.

Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Thus, a complex network of protein phosphorylation is likely to converge at the origins of replication to induce a single round of replication during S phase and prevent further initiations within the same cell cycle. Although the nature of replication competent chromatin and cyclin-dependent kinases have been elucidated separately, a crucial gap in our understanding lies between them. In fission yeast, Orp2, a subunit of fission yeast ORC has been demonstrated to interact with Cdc2 kinase, which serves two functions performed by both Cdc2 and Cdk2 in higher eukaryotes (32.Leatherwood J. Lopez-Girona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 361-363Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the kinase was not shown to be active and no cyclin partner was reported. Here, we show thatXenopus ORC co-purifies and co-immunoprecipitates with an active cyclin-dependent kinase, which we identify as Cdc2·cyclin A1. This is particularly interesting, as Cdc2 is more likely to be involved in the negative regulation discussed above, rather than in positive regulation of initiation at the onset of S phase. Therefore, the Cdc2·cyclin A1 complex becomes a strong candidate for the kinase that prevents MCM rebinding (27.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28.Romanowski P.

Egg extract was diluted 5-fold in buffer B/50 (buffer B is 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; B/50 is 50 mm KCl in buffer B) and ammonium sulfate was added to 20% saturation. Precipitated material was pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant up to 35% saturation, and precipitated material was pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer B/0 and loaded on heparin-Sepharose CL6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed in buffer B/200 (200 mm KCl) and eluted in a single step with buffer B/500. The eluate was diluted 4-fold in buffer B to bring the concentration of KCl down to 125 mm and applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column equilibrated in buffer B/125 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with buffer B/125 and eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of KCl (125–600 mm) in buffer B. XOrc1 and XOrc2-containing fractions (210–320 mm KCl) were pooled, diluted with buffer B to achieve KCl concentration of 100 mm, and applied to a 1-ml MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted in exactly the same way as MonoQ except that ORC eluted at approximately 230–320 mm KCl. ORC-containing fractions were pooled, diluted with buffer B to achieve a final KCl concentration of 200 mm, and concentrated to 500 μl in a Vivaspin concentrator (approximately 10-fold). The concentrated material was applied to Superose 6 column equilibrated in buffer B/200. Reactions for co-immunoprecipitating and copurifying kinase activities were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP as substrates. Samples were electrophoresed on a 12% denaturing gel; gels were dried and exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant Cdc2·cyclin B and Cdk2·cyclin E complexes were expressed in Sf9 cells from viruses kindly supplied by W. Harper and purified as described (42.Hendrickson M. Madine M.A. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); baculovirally expressed Cdc2·cyclin A and Cdk2·cyclin A were kind gifts from Drs. Mark Jackman and Jonathon Pines. A histone H1 kinase activity co-immunoprecipitates withXenopus origin recognition complex from the egg extract (Fig. 1 A). This activity is co-immunoprecipitated with two different antibodies against XOrc1, as well as with two different antibodies against XOrc2. H1 kinase activity is not immunoprecipitated when egg extract has been immunodepleted of ORC before immunoprecipitation (compare − ORC andcomplete). This suggests that the presence of H1 kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates is due to its interaction with ORC rather than nonspecific binding to the antibodies or protein A-Sepharose beads. To address the specificity of interaction further, we performed immunoprecipitations with several control antibodies: anti-XMcm3 (M3), anti-XMcm7 (M7), anti-goat IgG (GIgG), and anti-sheep IgG (SIgG). None of these antibodies co-immunoprecipitated substantial amounts of H1 kinase activity from Xenopus egg extract. Thus, we conclude that an H1 kinase activity is specifically associated with theXenopus origin recognition complex. To characterize the coimmunoprecipitating kinase further, we have assayed several Cdk protein kinase inhibitors for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). Both 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP) and olomoucine inhibited the activity at approximately the same concentrations as those required for inhibition of the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts (43.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Dativaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Both 6-DMAP and olomoucine inhibit a whole range of kinases, while showing only a relative preference for Cdks (44.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Dativaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the ORC-associated kinase activity was inhibited by p21 Cip1, a specific inhibitor of Cdk kinases (45.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar, 46.Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, the effect of p21 Cip1 was evident at concentrations equal to or lower than those reported to inhibit replication in egg extracts (23.Strausfeld U.P. Howell M. Rempel R. Maller J.L. Hunt T. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 876-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24.Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J.

Xenopus, like yeast, have several Cdk·cyclin complexes which have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication (21.Blow J.J. Nurse P.

Addition of the Cdk2 kinase inhibitor p21 Cip1 also has a similar effect (27.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28.Romanowski P.

The replication capacity of the extract can be rescued by re-addition of Cdk2·cyclin E, Cdk2·cyclin A, or Cdc2·cyclin A, as well as cyclin A or cyclin E alone (26.Strausfeld U. Howell M. Descombes P. Chevalier S. Rempel R.E. Adamczewski J. Maller J.L. Hunt T. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1555-1563PubMed Google Scholar). In the Xenopus egg, cyclin A is predominantly associated with p34 Cdc2 rather than p33 Cdk2 (48.Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ablation of cyclin A mRNA (49.Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or immunodepletion of Cdc2 (22.Fang F. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) do not block DNA synthesis in Xenopus egg extract. These results argue that Cdk2·cyclin E appears to be a better candidate for the Cdk·cyclin complex required for the initiation of DNA replication. However, as Cdc2·cyclin A or Cdk2·cyclin A can rescue replication capacity of egg extracts immunodepleted of Cdks (21.Blow J.J. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 62: 855-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26.Strausfeld U. Howell M. Descombes P. Chevalier S. Rempel R.E. Adamczewski J. Maller J.L. Hunt T. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1555-1563PubMed Google Scholar), other Cdk·cyclin complexes can clearly substitute for Cdk2·cyclin E. In addition to inducing initiation, Cdk·cyclin complexes are likely mediators of other regulatory functions in DNA replication. Ablation of cyclin A mRNA from Xenopus egg extracts has been demonstrated to abolish the dependence of mitosis on completion of DNA replication (49.Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and cyclin A has been shown to inhibit the activity of the replication licensing factor (43.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of Cdc2·cyclin a toXenopus egg extracts selectively induces the release of ORC but not MCMs from pre-replicative chromatin (27.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Kinases that induce initiation of DNA replication or prevent further initiation events within the same cell cycle would be expected to interact with proteins present at replication origins before initiation. ORC, the eukaryotic initiator protein, is a prime candidate for such an interaction. Therefore, we have asked if the kinase that co-immunoprecipitates with ORC is any of those implicated in the regulation of DNA replication inXenopus egg extracts. Our attempts to identify the ORC-associated kinase by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitated material failed, presumably due to insufficient amounts of protein obtained by this method. Therefore, we resorted to larger scale biochemical purification of ORC from the egg extract and followed XOrc1, XOrc2, candidate cyclins, and Cdks throughout the purification by Western blotting. ORC was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by heparin-Sepharose, MonoQ, and MonoS chromatography columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The partially purified ORC was concentrated and loaded on a Superose 6 gel filtration column. Fig.2 shows immunoblots across the ORC-containing fractions from this column. Examination of XOrc1 and XOrc2 elution profiles suggests that only a part of XOrc2 is present in a complex with XOrc1, whereas significant amounts of XOrc2 appear to be present in a slightly smaller complex lacking XOrc1. This observation agrees with previously published data demonstrating that immunodepletion of ORC with anti-XOrc1 antibodies failed to immunodeplete XOrc2 completely (15.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, as XOrc1 immunodepletion abolished the ability of egg extract to support DNA replication, the complex lacking XOrc1 cannot perform all the functions required for initiation (14.Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have used anti-PSTAIR antibody to detect both Cdc2 and Cdk2 with similar affinity and to allow quantitation of their relative abundance (35.Goodger N.M. Gannon J. Hunt T. Morgan P.R. J. Pathol. 1996; 178: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 34-kDa PSTAIR-reactive band could be detected in the ORC-containing fractions. In addition, small amounts of a 33-kDa PSTAIR-reactive protein could also be detected. Independent immunoblotting with antibodies specific to p34 Cdc2 or p33 Cdk2 confirmed that the 34-kDa band corresponds to the Cdc2 kinase catalytic subunit (data not shown). Careful examination of the immunoblots indicates that, whereas Cdc2 elutes identically to XOrc1, Cdk2 elutes later, overlapping with the broad XOrc2 peak but not the narrow XOrc1 peak. As shown in Fig. 2, Cdc2 elutes at exactly the same position as XOrc1, whereas very little Cdk2 can be detected in XOrc1-containing fractions. Using an antibody that is specific for Xenopuscyclin A1, an immunoblot revealed a peak of cyclin A1 overlapping the peak of XOrc1 and Cdc2. No cyclin B could be detected in XOrc1- or XOrc2-containing fractions. An anti-cyclin E immunoblot revealed a weak peak of cyclin E overlapping the peaks of Cdk2 kinase and XOrc2 but not coincident with Cdc2 or XOrc1. All fractions were independently assayed for H1 kinase activity. The elution profile of histone H1 kinase activity corresponded well with the presence of Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases detected by Western blotting. We conclude that two kinase complexes, Cdc2·cyclin A1 and Cdk2·cyclin E, cofractionate with XOrc2. However, only one of these, Cdc2·cyclin A1, exactly co-elutes with fractions containing both XOrc1 and XOrc2, whereas the other, Cdk2·cyclin E, is absent from fractions containing XOrc1. Cyclin A2 is not expressed in Xenopus embryos until stage 10 (50.Howe J.A. Howell M. Hunt T. Newport J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The absence of cyclin A2 from egg extracts and ORC-containing fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with cyclin A2-specific antibodies (kind gift of Dr. Uli Strausfeld; data not shown). To obtain further evidence for interaction between ORC and Cdc2 or Cdk2, we performed immunoprecipitations from the individual Superose 6 fractions with anti-XOrc1 and anti-XOrc2 antibodies and assayed the immunoprecipitated material for the presence of H1 kinase activity, Cdc2 and Cdk2 (Fig. 3). Both antibodies co-immunoprecipitated XOrc1, XOrc2, and Cdc2 kinase but not detectable Cdk2 kinase. The pattern of bands obtained with anti-PSTAIR antibody was identical to that on anti-Cdc2 immunoblots, ruling out the possibility that failure to detect Cdk2 was due to different sensitivities of anti-Cdc2 and anti-Cdk2 antibodies. In agreement with immunoblotting results, the peak of H1 kinase activity overlapped exactly with the presence of Cdc2 kinase (Fig. 3). Thus, Cdc2 kinase rather than Cdk2 kinase is tightly associated with Xenopusorigin recognition complex in the egg extract. Independent evidence for this interaction was obtained from reciprocal immunoprecipitations with antibodies directed againstXenopus Cdc2 and cyclin A1. As shown in Fig.4, both anti-Cdc2 and anti-cyclin A1 antibodies, but not control antibodies, co-immunoprecipitated significant amounts of XOrc1 and XOrc2 from the pool of ORC-containing fractions from the MonoS column (see “Experimental Procedures”). In summary, these results provide evidence that a soluble complex between ORC and Cdc2·cyclin A1 exists in Xenopus egg extracts. Several recombinant Cdk·cyclin complexes were tested for their ability to phosphorylate recombinant XOrc2 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 A, all Cdc2- and Cdk2-containing complexes tested were able to phosphorylate XOrc2. However, XOrc2 was phosphorylated by Cdc2·cyclin A with approximately 4-fold higher efficiency than by Cdc2·cyclin B or Cdk2-containing complexes (Fig. 5 B), and of course, this is the same complex that interacts with ORC in Xenopus egg extracts (Figs. 2 and4). The H1 kinase activity co-immunoprecipitating with ORC is sensitive to p21 Cip1. p21 Cip1 is known to inhibit efficiently Cdk4·cyclin D, Cdk2·cyclin A, and Cdk2·cyclin E complexes and weakly Cdc2·cyclin B, but its activity against Cdc2·cyclin A has not been reported so far (44.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Dativaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J.

As shown in Fig. 5 C, p21 Cip1 efficiently inhibits the kinase activity of recombinant Cdc2·cyclin A toward histone H1 and XOrc2 used as substrates. In this report, we have used three different approaches to identify a direct physical interaction between the Xenopusorigin recognition complex and Cdc2·cyclin A1. First, immunoprecipitations of Xenopus ORC with highly specific antibodies against XOrc1 or XOrc2 co-precipitates Cdc2·cyclin A1. Likewise, anti- Xenopus Cdc2 or anti- Xenopuscyclin A1 antibodies specifically co-precipitate XOrc1 and XOrc2. In contrast, antibodies against XMcm3, XMcm7, sheep IgG, or goat IgG fail to co-precipitate Cdc2·cyclin A1. In the second approach, Cdc2·cyclin A1 co-fractionates with ORC over several fractionation steps including ion exchange and gel filtration. Finally, in the third approach, XOrc2 is shown to be phosphorylated most efficiently by recombinant Cdc2·cyclin A1 in comparison to recombinant Cdc2·cyclin B and Cdk2 complexes. These results argue that the interaction betweenXenopus ORC and Cdc2·cyclin A1 is highly specific. We also report that histone H1 kinase activity is associated with the ORC -Cdc2·cyclin A1 complex following both fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation. This kinase activity is sensitive to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 6-DMAP, olomoucine, and p21Cip1. Interestingly, antibodies against Cdk2, cyclin E, and cyclin B show an absence of these proteins from the ORC·Cdc2·cyclin A1 complex. From these results it can be concluded Cdc2·cyclin A1 accounts for the majority of the H1 kinase activity that both co-immunoprecipitates and co-fractionates with ORC. We have not directly identified the function of the ORC-associated kinase, but it is a very strong candidate for one specific role. As outlined in the Introduction, two major roles are known for protein kinases in the control of DNA replication. The first is S phase promoting activity. However, the fact that cyclin A ablation does not inhibit DNA replication in the extract (49.Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) appears to point to the Cdk2·cyclin E complex as the prime candidate for an S phase promoting activity. It also appears to argue against the possibility that ORC-associated kinase identified in this paper triggers the initiation of DNA replication by phosphorylating proteins associated with ORC or ORC itself. The second known major role of a protein kinase in controlling DNA replication is the prevention of re-initiation of replication within a single cell cycle. Conditional mutations ofcdc2 and deletion of cdc13, the B-type cyclin inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, promote over-replication (51.Broek D. Bartlett R. Crawford K. Nurse P. Nature. 1991; 349: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar,52.Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of protein kinases in G2 in mammalian cells makes them competent to replicate again (53.Coverley D. Wilkinson H.R. Downes C.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 54.Usui T. Yoshida M. Abe K. Osada H. Isono K. Beppu T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and causes MCM proteins to rebind to replicating chromatin (29.Coverley D Wilkinson H. Madine M.A. Mills A. Laskey R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). InXenopus egg extracts, the rebinding of MCM proteins to chromatin is actively prevented by the accumulation of cyclin A or E in sperm nuclei (30.Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the continuous presence of an active cyclin-dependent kinase throughout S and G2appears to be essential for keeping MCMs off chromatin and preventing re-replication within the same cell cycle (55.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The association of Cdc2·cyclin A with ORC makes it an attractive candidate for this function. Whether ORC-Cdc2·cyclin A regulates ORC binding to DNA or instead regulates Cdc6 binding to DNA remains to be determined. Asking if the ORC-Cdc2·cyclin A complex is bound to DNA, and in particular in a cell cycle-regulated manner, should help answer this question. We are grateful to Drs. M. Doree, J. Gannon, T. Hunt, J. Maller, A. Philpott, U. Strausfeld, and M. Yamashita for generous gifts of antibodies; and Drs. Mark Jackman and Jonathon Pines for recombinant Cdk2·cyclin A and Cdc2·cyclin A complexes and p21Cip1. We are also grateful to Tim Hunt for critical comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2055009615,"Diphtheria toxin A-fragment enters the cytosol of target cells, where it inhibits protein synthesis by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). We have here analyzed toxin-induced protein synthesis inhibition in single cells by autoradiography and compared it with inhibition of protein synthesis in the whole cell culture. The data show that half-maximal protein synthesis inhibition in the whole cell population after a short incubation time is achieved by partially inhibiting protein synthesis in basically all the cells, while half-maximal protein synthesis inhibition after a long incubation time is due to a complete protein synthesis block in about half the cells in the population. We have also compared stable and unstable A-fragment mutants with respect to the kinetics of cell intoxication. While the toxicity of the stable mutants increased with time, the unstable mutants showed a similar toxicity at early and late time points. When studying the kinetics of cell intoxication by toxins with short cytosolic half-life, we could not detect any recovery of protein synthesis at late time points when all the mutant A-fragments should be degraded. This indicates that the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 cannot be reversed by an endogenous activity in the cells. The data indicate that entry of toxin into a cell is not associated with an immediate block in protein synthesis, and that prolonged action of single A-fragment molecules in the cytosol is sufficient to obtain complete protein synthesis inhibition at low toxin concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1995280708,"Calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) are tightly associated with cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and are implicated in the regulation of transmembrane Ca2+cycling. In order to assess the importance of membrane-associated CaM in modulating the Ca2+ pump (Ca2+-ATPase) function of SR, the present study investigated the effects of a synthetic, high affinity CaM-binding peptide (CaM BP; amino acid sequence, LKWKKLLKLLKKLLKLG) on the ATP-energized Ca2+uptake, Ca2+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and CaM kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation in rabbit cardiac SR vesicles. The results revealed a strong concentration-dependent inhibitory action of CaM BP on Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activities of SR (50% inhibition at ∼2–3 μm CaM BP). The inhibition, which followed the association of CaM BP with its SR target(s), was of rapid onset (manifested within 30 s) and was accompanied by a decrease inV max of Ca2+ uptake, unalteredK 0.5 for Ca2+ activation of Ca2+ transport, and a 10-fold decrease in the apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for its substrate, ATP. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition involved alterations at the catalytic site but not the Ca2+-binding sites of the Ca2+-ATPase. Endogenous CaM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel was also strongly inhibited by CaM BP. The inhibitory action of CaM BP on SR Ca2+ pump function and protein phosphorylation was fully reversed by exogenous CaM (1–3 μm). A peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase markedly attenuated the ability of CaM to reverse CaM BP-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ transport. These findings suggest a critical role for membrane-bound CaM in controlling the velocity of Ca2+pumping in native cardiac SR. Consistent with its ability to inhibit SR Ca2+ pump function, CaM BP (1–2.5 μm) caused marked depression of contractility and diastolic dysfunction in isolated perfused, spontaneously beating rabbit heart preparations. Full or partial recovery of contractile function occurred gradually following withdrawal of CaM BP from the perfusate, presumably due to slow dissociation of CaM BP from its target sites promoted by endogenous cytosolic CaM.

A well known mechanism for the regulation of the cardiac SR Ca2+-ATPase involves phosphorylation of another intrinsic SR protein, phospholamban (8.Tada M. Katz A.M. Annu. Rev.

In its unphosphorylated state, phospholamban is thought to interact with the Ca2+-ATPase exerting an inhibitory effect; phosphorylation of phospholamban by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or CaM kinase is thought to disrupt this interaction resulting in stimulation of Ca2+ pump activity (8.Tada M.

Physiol. 1998; 247: H2025-H2034Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in cardiac SR, a membrane-associated CaM kinase phosphorylates the Ca2+-ATPase in addition to RYR-CRC and phospholamban. The phosphorylation occurred at a serine residue and was specific for the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle isoform (SERCA2a) of the Ca2+-ATPase (18.Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies by Toyofuku et al. (23.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Narayanan N. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26492-26496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in the identification of Ser38 as the site in SERCA2a that is phosphorylated by CaM kinase. Studies using native cardiac SR vesicles (14.Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified SR Ca2+-ATPase preparations (14.Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SERCA2a expressed in HEK-293 cells (23.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Narayanan N. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26492-26496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Ser38 phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase results in activation of the V max of Ca2+ transport. Some studies have, however, questioned the physiological role of Ca2+-ATPase phosphorylation. Thus, a study by Odermatt et al. (24.Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed CaM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase in native rabbit cardiac SR as well as SERCA2a expressed in HEK-293 cells but failed to observe a significant stimulatory effect of phosphorylation on Ca2+-ATPase function. Another study by Reddy et al. (27.Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Pace R.C. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported failure to observe phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase in canine cardiac SR or purified Ca2+-ATPase reconstituted in lipid vesicles. These studies have attributed the stimulatory effect of CaM kinase to the phosphorylation of phospholamban and a consequent increase in Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase. In native cardiac SR, analysis of the selective effect of Ca2+-ATPase phosphorylation on Ca2+-pumping activity of this enzyme is hampered by the concomitant phosphorylation of phospholamban and RYR-CRC by the membrane-bound CaM kinase. Recently, we achieved selective phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase by the SR-associated CaM kinase by utilizing a phospholamban monoclonal antibody, which inhibits phospholamban phosphorylation, and the RYR-CRC blocking drug, ruthenium red, which was found to inhibit RYR-CRC phosphorylation (22.Xu A. Narayanan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Ca2+-ATPase phosphorylation by endogenous CaM kinase resulted in enhanced V max of Ca2+transport (22.Xu A. Narayanan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies we have found that, in addition to the endogenous CaM kinase, SR vesicles isolated from cardiac muscle contains significant amount of calmodulin that is resistant to extraction with high salt (0.6 m KCl). The presence of calmodulin in isolated SR vesicles may mask the true potential of calmodulin-dependent regulation of SR function in in vitro experiments. For example, since both calmodulin and CaM kinase are structured in the SR, introduction of Ca2+ to the assay medium to measure Ca2+transport would also result in concurrent activation of CaM kinase and other Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent membrane events. This issue assumes a higher level of complexity given that CaM kinase, once activated, undergoes autophosphorylation and retains activity independently of Ca2+/calmodulin (28.Bruan A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized a previously characterized amphiphilic, high affinity calmodulin-binding peptide (29.DeGrado W.F. Prendergast F.G. Wolfe Jr, H.R. Cox J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to unmask the potential influence of SR-associated calmodulin on cardiac SR Ca2+-ATPase function. The results presented here demonstrate a strong inhibitory action of CaM BP on the Ca2+ ion-transporting as well as energy-transducing functions of the Ca2+-ATPase. This inhibition stems from the association of CaM BP with SR membrane target(s) and is readily reversed by calmodulin. These findings imply that a calmodulin-dependent process controls the velocity of Ca2+ pumping in native cardiac SR. 45CaCl2 was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal antibody against calmodulin was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals were from Sigma. A 17-amino acid high affinity calmodulin-binding peptide (designated CaM BP in this report), designed and characterized previously by DeGrado et al.(29.DeGrado W.F. Prendergast F.G. Wolfe Jr, H.R. Cox J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and three fragments of this peptide with overlapping residues were synthesized by the University of Victoria Protein Micro-chemistry Center using a model 430A Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer. The C termini of the peptides were amidated. All peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, analyzed by mass spectrometry, and sequenced on Applied Biosystems model 473A protein sequencer. The sequences included the following: CaM BP, LKWKKLLKLLKKLLKLG; fragment A, LKWKKLL; fragment B, LLKLLKK; and fragment C, KKLLKLG. SR membrane vesicles were prepared from heart ventricles and fast-twitch (adductor magnus) skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5–3 kg) as described previously (30.Jones D.L. Narayanan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H98-H105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following isolation, the SR vesicles were suspended in 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm KCl and stored at −80 °C after quick-freezing in liquid N2. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake by SR was determined using a Millipore filtration technique as described previously (32.Narayanan N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium for Ca2+ uptake (total volume 250 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, l20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 5 mm ATP, 0.l mm45CaCl2 (∼8000 cpm/nmol; free Ca2+, 7.5 μm), 25 μm ruthenium red, and SR (6 μg of protein). In experiments where Ca2+concentration dependence was studied, the EGTA concentration in the assay medium was held at 0.1 mm, and the amount of total45CaCl2 added was varied in the range 1 to 200 μm to yield the desired free Ca2+. Modifications to the standard incubation medium are specified in the figure legends. Unless indicated otherwise, all assays were carried out at 37 °C; the Ca2+ transport reaction was initiated by the addition of SR vesicles after preincubation of the rest of the assay components for 3 min. The initial free Ca2+concentrations in the assay medium were determined using the computer program of Fabiato (33.Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The data on Ca2+concentration dependence on Ca2+ uptake were analyzed by nonlinear regression curve fitting using SigmaPlot scientific graph program (Jandel Scientific) run on an IBM-PC computer. The data were fit to Equation 1, ν=Vmax[Ca2+] n/(K0.5n+[Ca2+] n)Equation 1 where v is the measured Ca2+ uptake activity at a given Ca2+ concentration;V max is the maximum activity reached;K 0.5 is the Ca2+ concentration giving half of V max, and n is the equivalent to the Hill coefficient. Ca2+-ATPase activity of SR membranes was quantified as described previously (34.Narayanan N. Su N. Bedard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using an incubation medium identical to that used for Ca2+ uptake except that [γ-32P]ATP was used instead of nonradioactive ATP and nonradioactive CaCl2 was used instead of 45CaCl2. Parallel assays were also performed in the absence of Ca2+(i.e. in the presence of 0.2 mm EGTA with no CaCl2 added to the assay medium), and the Ca2+-ATPase activity was defined as the difference in ATP hydrolysis (liberation of 32Pi) measured in the absence and presence of Ca2+. The ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of SR vesicles after preincubation of the rest of the assay components for 3 min at 37 °C and was allowed to proceed for 2 min. Western blotting analysis of endogenous calmodulin in SR vesicles was performed using a monoclonal antibody specific for calmodulin (35.Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SR proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide (15%, homogenous) mini-gels and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose sheets. The sheets were incubated in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 45 min at 24 °C and then rinsed in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% BSA, 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. Following three 15-min washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the sheets were incubated with anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml in PBS) for 60 min at 37 °C and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:1000). After five 10-min washes in PBS/Tween, the sheets were rinsed with deionized water, and the immunoreactive peptide band representing calmodulin was visualized following color development using a Bio-Rad assay kit. Endogenous CaM kinase-catalyzed SR protein phosphorylation was measured as described previously (18.Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium (total volume 50 μl) for phosphorylation by endogenous CaM kinase contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μm calmodulin, 0.8 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 300–400 cpm/pmol), and SR (30 μg of protein). The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of SR after preincubation of the rest of the assay components for 3 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated after 2 min by the addition of 15 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed in 4–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. Quantification of phosphorylation was carried out by liquid scintillation counting after excision of the radioactive bands from the gels (18.Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbits were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, intravenously), and the hearts were excised and immediately cannulated for retrograde aortic perfusion of the coronary arteries with mammalian Ringer solution consisting of 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 6 mm NaHCO3, and 5.5 mm dextrose. The perfusion buffer was equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, which maintained a pH of 7.4; the perfusion temperature was set at 37 ± 0.2 °C. The hearts were perfused at a constant flow rate of 25 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. After an initial 15–20 min of perfusion, when the spontaneous beating had stabilized, a latex balloon-tipped cannula filled with degassed H2O was inserted into the lumen of the left ventricle for obtaining systolic left ventricular pressure development. The cannula was connected via a pressure transducer (COBE, Bramalea, Canada) to a BioPac System Digital Monitor (model MP100) and a personal computer that allowed on-line monitoring of left ventricular pressure and off-line calculation of developed pressure, rate of pressure development (+dP/dt), and rate of relaxation (−dP/dt). Unless specified otherwise, the experimental values represent the average of at least three independent experiments using separate SR preparations performed in duplicate. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. The ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake by SR vesicles is a useful, commonly used parameter to measure the Ca2+ pump (Ca2+-ATPase) function of SR in vitro (6.Inesi G. Submilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate the effects of varying concentrations of CaM BP and its fragments on ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR vesicles measured in the absence and presence of calmodulin in the assay medium. When assays were performed in the absence of calmodulin, CaM BP caused strong, concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by SR with virtually complete inhibition occurring at <5 μm CaM BP (Fig. 1 A). Fragmented molecules of CaM BP (CaM BP fragments A–C) failed to inhibit Ca2+ uptake by SR (Fig. 1 A, inset). Addition of low micromolar concentrations of calmodulin to the assay medium prevented the inhibitory action of CaM BP on Ca2+uptake by SR, in a concentration-dependent manner, and caused appreciable stimulation (∼40–55%) of Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 1, A and B, inset). The results presented in Fig. 1 A and the inset in Fig.1 B were obtained under the standard Ca2+ uptake assay conditions with 6 μg of SR protein in the assay medium (see under “Experimental Procedures”). In additional experiments, the effect of CaM BP on Ca2+ uptake by SR was determined with varying amounts of SR in the assay medium. The results presented in Fig. 1 B show that the concentration dependence curve for CaM BP inhibition of Ca2+ uptake is progressively shifted to the right with increasing concentration of SR in the assay. These findings suggest that the inhibitory action of CaM BP stems from its apparently stoichiometric interaction with one or more targets in the SR, and such interaction is prevented by calmodulin. Since CaM BP inhibited ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR, the effect of CaM BP on Ca2+-ATPase activity (ATP hydrolysis) was investigated. The results presented in Fig. 2 show that, under the assay conditions identical to that used for Ca2+uptake, CaM BP caused concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity. The inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake by CaM BP occurred at similar concentration range with only a minor difference inK i values for Ca2+ uptake (50% inhibition at ∼2 μm CaM BP) and Ca2+-ATPase activity (50% inhibition at ∼2.8 μm CaM BP) (Fig. 2,inset). Thus the observed reduction in Ca2+uptake is mainly a consequence of a primary inhibition of ATPase activity by CaM BP. Addition of calmodulin (3 μm) to the assay medium reversed the inhibitory effect of CaM BP on Ca2+-ATPase activity (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 A shows the time course of ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR measured in the absence of CaM BP and in the presence of two selected concentrations of CaM BP (2 and 4 μm) with or without calmodulin. The rates of Ca2+ uptake by SR is strongly inhibited by CaM BP; the inhibition was of rapid onset (manifested within 30 s) and the degree of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of CaM BP. Addition of calmodulin (3 μm) to the assay medium prevented the inhibitory action of CaM BP. In the experiments described thus far, the effect of CaM BP was assessed by adding this peptide directly to the Ca2+ uptake assay medium. In order to determine whether the inhibitory action of CaM BP results from its association with SR membrane target(s), in subsequent experiments, the time course of Ca2+ uptake was measured using CaM BP-pretreated and control SR vesicles obtained as follows. Cardiac SR vesicles were incubated with 5 μm CaM BP in the absence of calmodulin and in the presence of 3 μm calmodulin for 10 min at 24 °C. Subsequently, the SR vesicles were recovered by centrifugation, washed to remove free CaM BP and calmodulin, and then the time course of Ca2+ uptake was determined under standard assay conditions in the absence of calmodulin or in the presence of 3 μm calmodulin. SR vesicles subjected to the same experimental protocol but without CaM BP in the incubation medium served as control for these experiments. The results from these experiments showed that pretreatment of SR with CaM BP leads to markedly reduced rates of Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3,B and C); this decline in Ca2+ uptake rates is not observed when CaM BP-pretreatment of SR is performed in the presence of calmodulin (Fig. 3 C) or when Ca2+ uptake assays with CaM BP-pretreated SR is performed in the presence of calmodulin (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that the inhibitory action of CaM BP is dependent on its association with the SR membrane and that calmodulin is able to prevent the onset of CaM BP-mediated inhibition as well as reverse pre-existing inhibition induced by CaM BP. To investigate the effect of CaM BP on cardiac SR Ca2+-ATPase during its turnover, CaM BP was added to the Ca2+ uptake assay medium 3 min 15 s after initiating Ca2+-ATPase turnover. The time course of Ca2+ uptake was monitored prior to and following the addition of CaM BP for several minutes. It was found that addition of CaM BP (3 μm) during the turnover cycle of Ca2+-ATPase resulted in an apparently instantaneous and short-lived release of a small fraction (∼25%) of the pre-existing SR Ca2+ load as well as complete cessation of further Ca2+ uptake by SR vesicles (Fig.4). Addition of calmodulin (3 μm) together with CaM BP (3 μm) prevented the above effects of CaM BP (Fig. 4). In additional experiments, it was found that the fractional Ca2+ release induced by CaM BP did not exceed 25% of the pre-existing SR Ca2+ load at higher concentrations (up to 5 μm) of CaM BP (data not shown). These findings suggest that about 75% of the inhibitory effect of CaM BP on the measured Ca2+ uptake activity of SR stems from inhibition of the SR Ca2+ pump (Ca2+-ATPase); the remaining 25% of the inhibitory effect may be attributed to CaM BP-induced Ca2+ release. Since calmodulin prevented the effects of CaM BP, it is likely that CaM BP exerts its effects by interfering with calmodulin-dependent processes that are normally involved in the control of Ca2+sequestering and Ca2+ release functions of the SR. The results presented in Fig. 5 show the effect of two selected concentrations of CaM BP (1.5 and 3 μm) on Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations (9 nm to 67 μm). CaM BP inhibited Ca2+ uptake at all Ca2+ concentrations tested. At the submaximally effective concentrations of CaM BP used, the inhibitory effect could not be overcome with increasing Ca2+ concentration. On the other hand, addition of calmodulin (3 μm) to the assay medium fully reversed the inhibitory effect of CaM BP. The kinetic parameters derived from the data shown in Fig. 5 are summarized in TableI. It can be seen that the inhibitory action of CaM BP is associated with a decrement inV max without appreciable changes in the apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ or the Hill coefficient (n H) for Ca2+.Table IEffect of CaM BP on the kinetic parameters of Ca 2+ uptake by SRParameterControl1.5 μmCaM BP3 μm CaM BP3 μm CaM BP + 3 μm calmodulinV max, nmol Ca2+ · mg of protein−1 · min−1489 ± 85362 ± 68255 ± 46616 ± 76K 0.5 for Ca2+ (μm)0.62 ± 0.070.55 ± 0.080.54 ± 0.040.91 ± 0.10Hill coefficient (n H)1.40 ± 0.041.47 ± 0.131.35 ± 0.051.20 ± 0.02The ki"
https://openalex.org/W2054881891,"DnaA protein, the initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli, seems to be regulated through its binding to acidic phospholipids, such as cardiolipin. In our previous paper (Hase, M., Yoshimi, T., Ishikawa, Y., Ohba, A., Guo, L., Mima, S., Makise, M., Yamaguchi, Y., Tsuchiya, T., and Mizushima, T. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28651-28656), we found that mutant DnaA protein (DnaA431), in which three basic amino acids (Arg(360), Arg(364), and Lys(372)) were mutated to acidic amino acids showed a decreased ability to interact with cardiolipin in vitro, suggesting that DnaA protein binds to cardiolipin through an ionic interaction. In this study, we construct three mutant dnaA genes each with a single mutation and examined the function of the mutant proteins in vitro and in vivo. All mutant proteins maintained activities for DNA replication and ATP binding. A mutant protein in which Lys(372) was mutated to Glu showed the weakest interaction with cardiolipin among these three mutant proteins. Thus, Lys(372) seems to play an important role in the interaction between DnaA protein and acidic phospholipids. Plasmid complementation analyses revealed that all these mutant proteins, including DnaA431 could function as an initiator for chromosomal DNA replication in vivo."

Fragments of elastin and fibronectin may play an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes following tissue injury (4.Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Mecham R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 859-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5.Hunninghake G.W. Davidson J.M. Rennard J.M. Szapiel S. Gader J.E. Crystal R.G.

A fragment of fibronectin triggers AP-1, whereas intact fibronectin does not (1.Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that a fragment of collagen XIII is anti-angiogenic (7.O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar).In previous studies, we reported that urokinase (uPA) and MMP-9 expression by macrophages and macrophage cell lines were up-regulated when cultured on extracellular matrix purified from Engelbreth Holm Swarm (EHS) sarcomas (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In order to identify the ECM components that were responsible for the increase in the proteinase expression of macrophages, cells were incubated with human collagen IV, fibronectin, and tenascin. Each of these purified ECM components stimulated cellular MMP-9 expression. In contrast, both uPA and MMP-9 expressions were stimulated by laminin isolated from human placental following mild pepsin digestion. The effect of placental laminin on uPA expression was mirrored by SIKVAV, a synthetic laminin peptide derived from the tail region of the α1-chain (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of α1:SIKVAV on uPA expression by THP-1 monocytes was blocked when cells were preincubated with anti-CD49f (α6 integrin subunit). Moreover, preincubation of THP-1 monocytes with anti-CD49f inhibited the induction of uPA by EHS-derived ECM. Based on these data, we concluded that binding of macrophages to laminin-1 in the EHS-ECM up-regulated their expression of both uPA and MMP-9 (8.Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The observation that laminin is able to up-regulate both uPA and MMP-9 expression by macrophages is important because these proteinases cooperate in matrix degradation. However, the ability of laminin to influence cellular proteinase expression may require proteolysis to unmask cryptic domains. For example, a proteolytic fragment of laminin exerted a much greater stimulatory effect on MMP-9 expression by melanoma cells than intact laminin (9.Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Thorgeirsson U.P. Rao C.N. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1883-1889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the synthetic α1-chain peptide SIKVAV stimulated expression of MMP-1 by human monocytes, whereas intact laminin was reported to have no effect (10.Corcoran M.L. Kibbey M.C. Kleinman H.K. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10365-10368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The disparate response of cells to intact laminin-1, a laminin fragment, and a synthetic peptide suggests differential recognition mechanisms and/or signaling pathways.In experiments reported here, we demonstrate that intact laminin-1 has no effect on the proteinase expression of macrophages, whereas uPA and MMP-9 expressions were stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the α1-chain peptide SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR. Incubation of macrophages with α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including MAPKerk1/2. Intact laminin-1, which was unable to induce the proteinase expression of macrophages, failed to stimulate phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases or protein kinase C blocked peptide-induced phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 and the up-regulation of steady state levels of uPA mRNA and MMP-9 activity. Moreover, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase blocked the stimulation of the proteinase expression of macrophages by the α1-chain peptide. These data demonstrate that incubation of macrophages with α1-chain laminin peptide, but not intact laminin-1, triggers protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2, leading to the up-regulation of proteinase expression.DISCUSSIONComponents of ECM contain cryptic domains, which are exposed by proteolysis and elicit biological responses distinct from intact molecules (3.Giannelli G.

The disparate cellular response to ECM fragments versus intact molecules suggests differential recognition and signaling pathways. In studies reported here, we demonstrate that incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with a laminin peptide derived from the α1-chain, but not intact laminin-1, triggers protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2, leading to the up-regulation of uPA and MMP-9 expression.The ability of ECM to regulate cellular function is mediated by integrins, which, despite the absence of intrinsic receptor kinase activity, trigger signal transduction events (22.Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the adherence of human monocytes to ECM or ligation of their β1 integrins with antibodies triggers an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and the expression of immediate-early genes (23.Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B.

As reported here, incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and the expression of uPA and MMP-9. Tyrosine phosphorylation and proteinase expression induced by the α1-chain peptide were blocked when cells were preincubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. These studies confirm the relationship between peptide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and proteinase expression. Moreover, the inability of intact laminin-1 and a β1-chain peptide to effect cellular levels of phosphotyrosyl proteins or expression by macrophages of proteinases clearly demonstrate that the region of laminin-1 corresponding to α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR is cryptic in the intact molecule.An early event in integrin signaling is the activation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) (22.Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of p125FAK in cells of monocytic lineage is controversial. The tyrosine kinase p125FAK is expressed by THP-1 monocytes (24.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), whereas it is not expressed by human blood monocytes (23.Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, we are unable to detect p125FAK in lysates prepared from RAW264.7 macrophages (data not shown). In this regard, integrin ligation has been reported to trigger the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases other than p125FAK. These include proline-rich tyrosine kinase (p112PYK2), C-Abl (p120), CAS (p130CAS), and spleen tyrosine kinase (p76SYK) (22.Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase p76SYK is a major phosphorylated protein in monocytes following adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of β1integrins by antibody (24.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although we have found that RAW264.7 macrophages express high levels of p112PYK2 and p76SYK (data not shown), the identification of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is phosphorylated in response to α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR in RAW264.7 macrophages remains to be determined.A major signaling pathway by which integrins regulate gene expression is via the activation of MAPKerk1/2 (26.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 148-180Crossref Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). In addition to ECM-integrin interactions, MAPKerk1/2 is activated by ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (growth factor receptors), cytokine receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors. Activated MAPKerk1/2 regulates the activity of other serine threonine kinases, phospholipase A2, and several transcription factors. The activation of MAPKerk1/2 in response to laminin-1 has been reported (21.Wei J. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5903-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When murine P388D1 macrophages transfected with α6Aβ1 were incubated with laminin, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and the activation of MAPKerk1/2 was observed. The activation of MAPKerk1/2 was dependent on RAS and protein kinase C. As reported here, levels of phosphorylated MAPKerk1/2 were strikingly elevated in RAW264.7 macrophages incubated with α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR; however, intact laminin-1 had no effect. Preincubation of cells with an inhibitor of MAPK kinase blocked the activation of MAPKerk1/2 by α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR. Likewise, preincubation of cells with calphostin C blocked α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR-induced activation of MAPKerk1/2.The failure of intact laminin-1 to trigger phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 in these studies is consistent with the reported inability of laminin-1 to up-regulate MMP-1 expression by monocytes (10.Corcoran M.L. Kibbey M.C. Kleinman H.K. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10365-10368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and as reported here uPA and MMP-9 expression by RAW264.7 macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of cells to a cryptic domain of laminin-1 initiates a phosphorylation cascade resulting in the activation of protein kinase C, which in turn leads to the activation of MAPKerk1/2. In conclusion, a cryptic domain of laminin-1 induces a signaling pathway distinct from intact laminin-1 and may play a role in regulation of macrophage proteinase expression and tissue remodeling at sites of injury and repair. Evidence is emerging that components of extracellular matrix (ECM)1 contain cryptic domains, which are exposed by proteolysis and elicit biological responses distinct from intact molecules (1.Werb Z.

Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As reported here, incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and the expression of uPA and MMP-9. Tyrosine phosphorylation and proteinase expression induced by the α1-chain peptide were blocked when cells were preincubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. These studies confirm the relationship between peptide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and proteinase expression. Moreover, the inability of intact laminin-1 and a β1-chain peptide to effect cellular levels of phosphotyrosyl proteins or expression by macrophages of proteinases clearly demonstrate that the region of laminin-1 corresponding to α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR is cryptic in the intact molecule. An early event in integrin signaling is the activation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) (22.Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of p125FAK in cells of monocytic lineage is controversial. The tyrosine kinase p125FAK is expressed by THP-1 monocytes (24.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), whereas it is not expressed by human blood monocytes (23.Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or murine P388D1 macrophages (25.Shaw L.M. Turner C.E. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, we are unable to detect p125FAK in lysates prepared from RAW264.7 macrophages (data not shown). In this regard, integrin ligation has been reported to trigger the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases other than p125FAK. These include proline-rich tyrosine kinase (p112PYK2), C-Abl (p120), CAS (p130CAS), and spleen tyrosine kinase (p76SYK) (22.Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase p76SYK is a major phosphorylated protein in monocytes following adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of β1integrins by antibody (24.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although we have found that RAW264.7 macrophages express high levels of p112PYK2 and p76SYK (data not shown), the identification of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is phosphorylated in response to α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR in RAW264.7 macrophages remains to be determined. A major signaling pathway by which integrins regulate gene expression is via the activation of MAPKerk1/2 (26.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 148-180Crossref Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). In addition to ECM-integrin interactions, MAPKerk1/2 is activated by ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (growth factor receptors), cytokine receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors. Activated MAPKerk1/2 regulates the activity of other serine threonine kinases, phospholipase A2, and several transcription factors. The activation of MAPKerk1/2 in response to laminin-1 has been reported (21.Wei J. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5903-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When murine P388D1 macrophages transfected with α6Aβ1 were incubated with laminin, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and the activation of MAPKerk1/2 was observed. The activation of MAPKerk1/2 was dependent on RAS and protein kinase C. As reported here, levels of phosphorylated MAPKerk1/2 were strikingly elevated in RAW264.7 macrophages incubated with α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR; however, intact laminin-1 had no effect. Preincubation of cells with an inhibitor of MAPK kinase blocked the activation of MAPKerk1/2 by α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR. Likewise, preincubation of cells with calphostin C blocked α1:SRARKQAASIKVAVSADR-induced activation of MAPKerk1/2. The failure of intact laminin-1 to trigger phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 in these studies is consistent with the reported inability of laminin-1 to up-regulate MMP-1 expression by monocytes (10.Corcoran M.L. Kibbey M.C. Kleinman H.K. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10365-10368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and as reported here uPA and MMP-9 expression by RAW264.7 macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of cells to a cryptic domain of laminin-1 initiates a phosphorylation cascade resulting in the activation of protein kinase C, which in turn leads to the activation of MAPKerk1/2. In conclusion, a cryptic domain of laminin-1 induces a signaling pathway distinct from intact laminin-1 and may play a role in regulation of macrophage proteinase expression and tissue remodeling at sites of injury and repair.

Inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms are generated upon activation of an alternative, intronic promoter within the CREM gene. ICER is proposed to down-regulate both its own expression and the expression of other genes that contain cAMP-responsive elements such as a number of growth factors. Thus, ICER has been postulated to play a role in proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that ICER gene expression is induced by gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and epidermal growth factor in AR42J cells.

CREB was first identified as an activator of gene expression in response to increased intracellular concentration of cAMP (4.Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl.

The CRE modulator (CREM) gene encodes multiple members of the CRE-binding protein family by alternative splicing as well as by internal transcriptional initiation (6.Delmas V. Laoide B.M.

Upon increased levels of cAMP, CREB is phosphorylated at Ser-133 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) (9.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 10.Lee C.Q. Yun Y.D. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which leads to a dramatic increase in its transactivating potential. Similarly, the activity of CREM τ isoforms are increased by PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation (11.Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that phosphorylation of both CREM and CREB transcription factors also can involve other kinases like protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent kinases, casein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (12.de Groot R.P. den Hertog J.

The discovery of CREM proteins suggests that the activity of the functional CREB dimer is regulated not only by its phosphorylation state, but also by protein/protein interactions like formation of heterodimers, which may either activate or repress transcription, or by competition between CREM and CREB homodimers (11.Laoide B.M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The kinetics of cAMP-induced ICER expression are characteristic of early response genes, reaching maximum expression after approximately 2 h of stimulation. ICER is proposed to down-regulate both its own expression and the expression of other CRE-containing genes (17.Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).A large number of genes that are modulated by regulatory peptides contain CRE-like sequences in their promoters, and CRE-binding proteins have been postulated to play an important role in a variety of neuroendocrine processes. cAMP serves as a mitogenic signal for the somatotroph cells, and transgenic mice that express a CREB mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKA, exhibit atrophied pituitary glands and a dwarf phenotype (18.Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). CREM appears to play a decisive role in the regulation of the spermatogenetic process (7.Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and studies with CREM gene knock-out mice display animals that completely lack spermatozoa and are sterile (19.Nantel F.

In particular, inducibility of the ICER repressor has been reported to occur in several tissues in response to hormone stimulation, first described in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in the pineal gland (1.Stehle J.H.

Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 535-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Gastrin and CCK are gastrointestinal regulatory peptides, which play a crucial role in differentiation and proliferation of the gastrointestinal tract. While CCK is known to stimulate pancreatic secretion and proliferation, gastrin is a potent inducer of gastric acid secretion. This physiological response is regulated through an interplay of a variety of neuroendocrine cell types in the stomach mucosa (22.Waldum H.L. Brenna E. Kleveland P.M. Sandvik A.K. Dig. Dis. 1995; 13: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Gastrin is also known to act as a growth factor, stimulating proliferation of normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal cells in rats (23.Brenna E. Waldum H.L. Gut. 1992; 33: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), colon carcinoma cell lines (24.Ishizuka J. Townsend Jr, C.M. Bold R.J. Martinez J. Rodriguez M. Thompson J.C.

Urumov A. Yamada J. Stepan V.M. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G891-G898PubMed Google Scholar). Gastrin has been found to transmit its cellular effects via a specific transmembrane Gq/G11 protein-coupled receptor, the CCK-B/gastrin receptor, while CCK-mediated signaling can occur via both the CCK-B/gastrin and via another receptor within the same family, the CCK-A receptor (29.Sandvik A.K. Waldum H.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: 925-928PubMed Google Scholar). Both gastrin and CCK-mediated intracellular signaling mechanisms have been reported to include activation of the phospholipase C-β (PLC-β), as well as activation of the adaptor proteins Shc, Grb, and Sos; Ras and Raf proteins; PKC; and MAPK (30.Kowalski-Chauvel A.

Physiol. 1997; 273: C1472-C1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CCK-A receptors can couple to adenylyl cyclase (34.Marino C.R. Leach S.D. Schaefer J.F. Miller L.J. Gorelick F.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In the present study we show that ICER is induced in a variety of rat neuroendocrine cell lines by agents known to activate either PKA or PKC signaling pathways. Furthermore, both gastrin and CCK, whose predominant effector pathway is linked to activation of PLC- β and MAPK, induce ICER gene expression in the AR42J cell line. Gastrin-mediated ICER induction was not reduced in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89, indicating a PKA-independent mechanism. This is the first report on ICER inducibility via Gq/G11protein-coupled receptors. Moreover, ICER is induced in a rat fibroblast and a rat epithelial cell line, but not in human HeLa (epithelial) and HaCaT (keratinocyte) cells, indicating cell specific differences in ICER inducibility.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that ICER gene expression can be induced in AR42J cells by variety of agents including EGF, gastrin, and CCK. This has not been reported earlier. The AR42J cell line, derived from an azaserine-induced tumor of rat pancreas, possesses both exocrine and neuroendocrine characteristics (47.Christophe J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G963-G971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the fact that AR42J expresses both CCK-B/gastrin and CCK-A receptors, the growth-promoting effect of gastrin and CCK and their intracellular signaling pathways has been extensively studied in these cells (30.Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.S. Vaysse N.

Commun. 1997; 238: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since ICER is thought to play a pivotal role in regulation of growth and differentiation, we consider AR42J cells an interesting model for the study of a possible involvement of ICER in gastrin- and CCK-mediated cellular responses.AR42J cells may also be suited for comparison of the signaling mechanisms of CCK-A and CCK-B, since our results indicate that induction of ICER gene expression can be mediated by either of these receptors. Although CCK-A and CCK-B have been found to activate similar downstream signaling events, more detailed studies may reveal differences in the manner that these intracellular events are set into play by a given receptor in a given cellular response. This would be analogous to the two types of tumor necrosis factor receptors, which we have found to mediate activation of transcription factor NFκB through different, but partially overlapping signal transduction pathways (37.Laegreid A.

Espevik, submitted for publication. CCK-A and CCK-B receptors are G protein-coupled receptors where the main G-protein has been found to be of the Gq/G11 type (51.Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Klengel R. Zeuzem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Wang H.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1728-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 53.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, the predominant effector pathway of gastrin and CCK is linked to activation of PLC-β, formation of the second messengers inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol with subsequent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKC (54.Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 55.Seva C. Scemama J.L. Pradayrol L. Sarfati P.D. Vaysse N. Regul.

Furthermore, gastrin and CCK induce activation of Ras and Raf proteins and the MAPK cascade via adaptor proteins Shc, Grb, and Sos (30.Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L.

Recently, gastrin was reported to cause cAMP accumulation in AR42J cells (59.Dethloff L.A. Barr B.M. Bestervelt L.L. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which may indicate that the CCK-B receptor can also couple to G proteins of the Gs type. Alternatively, cAMP production may be caused by the gastrin-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+via calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase. However, we could not detect a rise in PKA activity in cells stimulated with gastrin or CCK. Furthermore, experiments with the PKA inhibitor H-89 show that PKA is not necessary for gastrin-mediated ICER induction. Thus our data imply that gastrin-induced ICER gene expression is mediated by cAMP-independent signaling mechanisms.We found that EGF could induce ICER gene expression in AR42J, while both EGF and NGF could cause the same effect in PC-12 cells. NGF-mediated ICER induction via a Ras-dependent pathway was also recently reported by others (44.Monaco L. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the same study, however, ICER expression could not be detected upon EGF stimulation of PC-12 cells, a discrepancy that could be due to different analytical methods. Our results support the hypothesis that growth factors which transmit their signals via tyrosine kinase receptors can also induce ICER gene expression. A central, downstream signaling pathway activated by tyrosine kinase receptors is the MAPK cascade (60.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). This pathway can also be activated via PKC (61.Thompson H.L. Marshall C.J. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9486-9492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showing that ICER expression can be induced by treatment of cells with either tyrosine kinase receptor stimulating growth factors or with PMA, which acts via PKC, may indicate that the MAPK cascade can be involved in activation of ICER gene expression. Taken together with our observation that gastrin can induce ICER in a PKA-independent manner, we therefore speculate that activation of the MAPK cascade plays a major role in the gastrin-activated signaling mechanisms involved in induction of ICER gene expression.Activation of the ICER promotor is thought to be controlled by CREB, a transcription factor that is known to depend on phosphorylation at Ser-133 (41.Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In contrast to PC-12 cells, where CREB phosphorylation only occurs upon stimulation with agents like NGF or forskolin (9.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 13.Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), we found that CREB was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-133 in AR42J cells and no increase in CREB Ser-133- P was detected after treatment with forskolin or other agents. In NIH 3T3 cells, the transcriptional potential of CREB is reported to be moderated by signals independent of Ser-133, although Ser-133 phosphorylation seems necessary for activation (62.Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Moens U. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient to induce c-fos expression upon CCK injection (63.Houpt T.A. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results suggest that signaling events additional to CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation are necessary in order to induce ICER transcription in AR42J cells. The spectrum of agents found to induce ICER in AR42J suggest that these additional signaling events can be supplied by PKA or PKC, or by PLC- β-associated signaling pathways, one of which may be the MAPK cascade. Furthermore, it is likely that these additional signals function through sites in CREB other than Ser-133 or that they involve other transcription factors than CREB.Recent studies have brought to light ICER as a general repressor in non-neuroendocrine cells as well. In the myeloid leukemia cell line IPC-81, high levels of ICER proteins protected the cells from cAMP-induced apoptosis (38.Ruchaud S. Seite P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Lanotte M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ICER has been found to repress cytokine gene expression (39.Bodor J. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9544-9551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as well as human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 promotor activity (64.Bodor J. Spetz A.L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), in human medullary thymocytes. Our observation that ICER can be induced also in fibroblast and epithelial cell lines, has to our knowledge, not been previously reported and indicates a role for the transcriptional repressor ICER in these cell types as well.An interesting aspect of our study is the putative role of the transcriptional repressor ICER in the mitogenic cellular responses mediated by gastrin and CCK. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of gastrin and CCK-mediated ICER induction and possible biological implications are under way in our laboratory. Inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER)1 is a member of the CREB and CREM family of transcription factors, which bind to cAMP-responsive promoter elements (CREs) (1.Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2.Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol.

CREB was first identified as an activator of gene expression in response to increased intracellular concentration of cAMP (4.Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 5.Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The CRE modulator (CREM) gene encodes multiple members of the CRE-binding protein family by alternative splicing as well as by internal transcriptional initiation (6.Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. de Groot R.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7.Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E.

A. 1994; 91: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These proteins include both activators (CREM τ,) and repressors (CREM α, β, γ) of cAMP-induced transcription. Upon increased levels of cAMP, CREB is phosphorylated at Ser-133 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) (9.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 10.Lee C.Q. Yun Y.D. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which leads to a dramatic increase in its transactivating potential. Similarly, the activity of CREM τ isoforms are increased by PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation (11.Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that phosphorylation of both CREM and CREB transcription factors also can involve other kinases like protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent kinases, casein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (12.de Groot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13.Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

The discovery of CREM proteins suggests that the activity of the functional CREB dimer is regulated not only by its phosphorylation state, but also by protein/protein interactions like formation of heterodimers, which may either activate or repress transcription, or by competition between CREM and CREB homodimers (11.Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16.Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). ICER isoforms represent a unique CREM subfamily of transcription factors, which are generated by alternative splicing of a transcript generated from an internal CREM gene promotor (P2) containing cAMP response elements (Fig. 1) (1.Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2.Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The kinetics of cAMP-induced ICER expression are characteristic of early response genes, reaching maximum expression after approximately 2 h of stimulation. ICER is proposed to down-regulate both its own expression and the expression of other CRE-containing genes (17.Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A large number of genes that are modulated by regulatory peptides contain CRE-like sequences in their promoters, and CRE-binding proteins have been postulated to play an important role in a variety of neuroendocrine processes. cAMP serves as a mitogenic signal for the somatotroph cells, and transgenic mice that express a CREB mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKA, exhibit atrophied pituitary glands and a dwarf phenotype (18.Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). CREM appears to play a decisive role in the regulation of the spermatogenetic process (7.Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and studies with CREM gene knock-out mice display animals that completely lack spermatozoa and are sterile (19.Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In particular, inducibility of the ICER repressor has been reported to occur in several tissues in response to hormone stimulation, first described in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in the pineal gland (1.Stehle J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2065810934,"Tyr446 in putative transmembrane segment 10 (TM10) of the yeast galactose transporter Gal2 has previously been identified as essential for galactose recognition. In the present study, alignment of the amino acid sequences of 63 sugar transporters or related proteins revealed 14 aromatic sites, including Tyr446 of Gal2, that are conserved in >75% of these proteins. The importance of the remaining 13 conserved aromatic amino acids was examined individually by random mutagenesis using degenerate primers. Galactose transport-positive clones were identified by plate selection and subjected to DNA sequencing. For those transport-positive clones corresponding to Tyr352, and Phe504mutants, all the amino acid substitutions comprised aromatic residues. The importance of the aromatic residues at these sites was further investigated by replacing them individually with each of the other 19 amino acids and measuring the galactose transport activity of the resulting mutants. Among both Tyr352 and Phe504mutants, the other aromatic amino acids supported galactose transport; no other amino acids conferred high affinity transport activity. Thus, at least three aromatic sites are critical for galactose transport: one at the extracellular boundary of putative TM7 (Tyr352), one in the middle of putative TM10 (Tyr446), and one in the middle of putative TM12 (Phe504)."
https://openalex.org/W2074284357,"Isoform 3f of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is a major isoform of this pump in rat skeletal muscle. It has an unusual structure, with a short carboxyl-terminal regulatory region of only 33 residues when compared with the 77 to 124 residues found in the other isoforms. Also, whereas the regulatory regions of the other isoforms, downstream of the alternative splice, consist of two homologous groups, the sequence of 3f is not related to either group. A synthetic peptide representing the calmodulin binding domain of isoform 3f had a much lower calmodulin affinity (with a K d of 15 nm) than the corresponding peptide of isoform 2b (K d value was 0.2 nm). The characteristics of this domain were further studied by making chimeras of the 3f regulatory region with the catalytic core of isoform 4 and by making the full-length isoform 3f. Both constructs bound to calmodulin-Sepharose. The chimera was fully active without calmodulin, showing no stimulation of activity when calmodulin was added. The full-length isoform 3f was slightly activated by calmodulin. These data show that the regulatory region of isoform 3f is only a weak autoinhibitor of the enzyme, in contrast to the properties of all the other isoforms studied so far.

Removal of the regulatory region activates the pump so that it requires no effector for activity (1.Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the regulatory regions begins with a calmodulin-binding domain (2.Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), followed by additional regulatory regions which include autoinhibitory domains (3.Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases (4.Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), sites for protease digestion (5.Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 46-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and sites for interaction with PDZ domains (6.Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1591-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These different domains and sites may overlap or occur in different orders, but they generally make up a regulatory region of 77 to 124 amino acid residues, counting from the beginning of the calmodulin-binding domain (4.Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7.Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Contrasting with this picture is the situation in isoform 3f, the product of an unusual alternate splice that results in a novel calmodulin-binding domain.Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the carboxyl terminus of rPMCA3f with the corresponding portions of the common isoforms of the rat plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. This alignment starts at the beginning of the calmodulin-binding domain and all of the sequences are identical for the first 18 residues, except that isoform 4 substitutes a valine for the phenylalanine at the ninth residue. At this point an alternate splice results in two isoforms (a and b) for each gene product. The downstream structures of these isoforms all differ, but they are all long complex regulatory regions which extend further than is shown in Fig. 1. The calmodulin-binding domains of isoforms 4a and 4b have been investigated. The currently accepted picture is that 4b has a domain of about 28 residues (3.Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 4a has a longer domain (9.Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) which is interrupted by a nonbinding region (10.Verma A.K. Paszty K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 527-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These regions are double underlined in Fig. 1. Isoforms 4a and 4b also have autoinhibitory domains that make the native form of the enzyme relatively inactive. In isoform 4b there are two such domains, one of which is coterminous with the calmodulin-binding domain and the second of which is a separate, downstream domain. In isoform 4a, the autoinhibitory domain is included within the calmodulin-binding domain. Isoform 3f has a much shorter region downstream of the alternative splice, and that region has a sequence that is not related to those found in either the a or the b forms.The message for isoform 3f is present in rat at a high level in skeletal muscle and at a lower level in brain (11.Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18569-18576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The message for a very similar human isoform was found in cerebral cortex (12.Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unusual structure of this isoform has compelled us to investigate its enzymic properties. These properties have indeed also proved to be unusual. We show here that isoform 3f is expressed in rat skeletal muscle at a higher level than that of other PMCA isoforms. It still binds to calmodulin despite its unusual calmodulin binding domain. In contrast to the low to medium activity level seen in the other isoforms in the absence of calmodulin, 3f is already almost fully active.MATERIALS AND METHODS45Ca and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Calmodulin and calmodulin-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma. LipofectAMINE and Optimem media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals used for this study were of reagent grade. The standard ABC Kit and Universal IgG used for immunostaining were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). rPMCA3a cDNA in pBR322 vector was a gift from Dr. G. Shull (University of Cincinnati).Preparation of a Specific Antibody Directed Against rPMCA3fThe polyclonal antibody named CR3F was generated following the protocol described in Filoteo et al.

The synthetic peptide, which was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits, followed the sequence of the last 15 residues (VCWDGKKMLRTTEVG) of rPMCA3f. It was synthesized usingt-butoxycarbonyl l-amino acids onp-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (14.McCormick D.J. Griesmann G.E. Huang Z. Lambert E.H. Lennon V.A. J.

The immune sera were screened for the antibody by Western blots using overexpressed 3f.Construction of Full-length rPMCA3f and of the Chimeras of the h4b Catalytic Region (ct120) with Different Lengths of the r3f Carboxyl TerminusUsing standard ligation and transformation procedures, full-length r3f was made by ligating an amplified rat 3f PCR product into rPMCA3a cDNA in pSP72 using ClaI andBamHI sites (15.Enyedi Á.

The amplified PCR product corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of rPMCA3f which was prepared using GeneAmp RT-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) with rat skeletal muscle mRNA as template. The sequence of the full-length 3f was verified before the correct clone was excised and ligated into the expression vector PMM2 using SalI and ClaI sites.The chimeras ct120–3f28 and ct120–3f33 were prepared using H4b (taken out of pSP72-h4b) as template. Appropriate primers were used in PCR reactions to synthesize NsiI-KpnI pieces corresponding to ct120–3f28 and ct120–3f33. The clones with the correct sequence were selected and used to replace the originalNsiI-KpnI portions in pSP72-h4b. Full-length ct120–3f28 and ct120–3f38 were cut out of pSP72 vector and transferred into the expression vector PMM2 using SalI andKpnI. Similarly, a ClaI-BamHI piece corresponding to r3f was synthesized by PCR reaction and replaced into rPMCA3a to obtain full-length rPMCA3f.Calculation of Ki(Kd) from Peptide Competition ExperimentsThese experiments were set up with constant concentrations of calmodulin and purified erythrocyte Ca2+ pump, and the concentration of peptide was varied. As the peptide concentration was increased, it competed more effectively for calmodulin, removing calmodulin from the pump. This effect was analyzed quantitatively by the method previously described (16.Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Microsomes at 10–20 μg/ml concentration were preincubated in the presence or absence of 2 μm calmodulin for 2 min at 37 °C and Ca2+uptake by the vesicles was started by the addition of 6 mmATP.

The reaction was started by the addition of ATP to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The calmodulin concentration was chosen to give the maximum velocity. To avoid nonspecific absorption of the peptides to the walls of the tubes, peptide solution in 160 mm KCl was introduced directly into the reaction medium beneath the liquid surface.Peptides were synthesized with 28 or 33 residues; each peptide began with the first residue of the calmodulin binding domain. The peptides were named to reflect the isoform being represented, i.e.C28R2b represents isoform r2b and C28R3f represents isoform r3f. In previous papers (19.Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 10–20-μg samples were placed in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm CaCl2, and 90 μm EGTA in a 200-μl volume. The reaction was terminated by putting the samples on ice, and subsequently, 40 μl of extraction solution containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 1.5 m sucrose, 0.8 m NaCl, and 50 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2 was added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Then, 200 μl of this mixture was added to 50 μl of a suspension of calmodulin-Sepharose beads previously equilibrated in the same buffer. The binding was allowed to proceed on ice for 90 min. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads four times with 200 μl of 5× diluted extraction buffer. The proteins bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose were removed by incubating the beads with the electrophoresis sample buffer described above, which contained SDS-urea. The beads were separated from the samples by centrifugation, and an aliquot of each sample was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Preparation of the Plasma Membrane Fraction from Rat Skeletal MusclePlasma membrane vesicles were prepared from the white muscles of legs of 3–5 adult rats. The procedure followed was that described by Seiler and Fleischer (21.Seiler S. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13862-13871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, a final enrichment of the plasma membrane calcium pump was done by the use of calmodulin-Sepharose beads as described above.Gel Electrophoresis, Electrotransfer, and ImmunostainingThe samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% acrylamide gel following Laemmli's procedure except that the sample buffer contained 100 mm dithiothreitol and 125 mg/ml urea. The samples were subsequently electroblotted, and the blots were immunostained with monoclonal antibody 5F10 (22.Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem.

A universal second antibody that includes both anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG was used.RESULTSFig. 2 shows a test of the specificity of antibody CR3F. In this Western blot, three antibodies were tested for their reactivity with four isoforms of PMCA expressed in COS cells. The COS cells express isoform 1b spontaneously (13.Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L.

As expected, antibody 5F10 reacted with all of the isoforms present (lane 1). Antibody NR3, which was already known to react with isoform 3a (13.Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi Á. Caride A.

This result was expected because NR3 is directed against the amino terminus of isoform 3, which is identical in 3a and 3f. Lane 3 shows that antibody CR3F was specific for isoform 3f, not reacting with any of the other isoforms present.Figure 2CR3F is specific for isoform 3f. Three different batches of COS cells were transfected with isoforms rPMCA3a, rPMCA3f, and hPMCA4a, and their membranes were mixed to obtain this blot. The same membranes were run in all three lanes, each of which was then labeled with the antibodies shown. The failure of CR3F to react with other isoforms is shown by the absence of theupper bands in the lane labeled withCR3F. (In addition to its reaction with r3a and r3f, antibody NR3 is already known to react with r3b (13.Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi Á. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Each panel shown contains a 3f standard in the adjacent track to assure the positive identification of 3f in these high-resolution blots. The first panel shows the results obtained with 5F10, which is known to react with all isoforms of the pump (13.Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi Á. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

The pattern obtained is consistent with the presence of isoform 4a or 3a (upper band), 3f (middle band), and smaller proteolyzed isoform(s) which are difficult to identify (lower band). The second panel shows results with CR3F and confirms that the middle band of the first panel is isoform 3f, and that a small amount of proteolytically degraded 3f was present (faint lower band). Because the gel which produced the middle blot had better focused bands, the 3f band looks much narrower than the middle band in the first panel, but it was clear from comparison of a number of similar experiments that 3f accounted for essentially all of that middle band. Thelower band of the second panel did not correspond in size to the lower band of the first panel, showing that another isoform is present. This must be a proteolyzed isoform because it is smaller than any of the known full-length isoforms of PMCA. The third panel, with antibody NR3, shows that the top band was primarily isoform 3a and reconfirmed the identity of the middle band.Figure 33f is a major isoform of PMCA in skeletal muscle. These Western blots were all done at the same time, and full-length isoform 3f was electrophoresed in the left trackof each, as a standard. The labels on the panelsindicate the antibody used to visualize the PMCA in skeletal muscle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The properties of the regulatory region of isoform 3f were tested by studying the affinity for calmodulin of a peptide representing the 28-residue calmodulin binding region of rPMCA3f. This was done by means of an experiment in which the peptide and the purified Ca2+pump from erythrocytes competed for calmodulin. Because the affinity of the erythrocyte Ca2+ pump for calmodulin is known to be 7.6 nm (23.Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the affinity of the peptide for calmodulin can be calculated (16.Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P.

The figure clearly shows that C28R3f is much less effective than C28R2b in inhibiting the ATPase activity stimulated by calmodulin. TheK d calculated for C28R3f was 15 nm, whereas that for C28R2b was 0.2 nm.Figure 4Competitive inhibition of the calmodulin-activated portion of the pump ATPase by calmodulin-binding peptides. “f” is the enzyme rate associated with calmodulin activation, as previously defined (16.Enyedi Á.

The high-affinity peptide C28R2b inhibited the ATPase at much lower concentrations than did C28R3f. The solid line is the expected inhibition curve for K i = 0.2 nm, whereas the dashed line is the expected curve for K i = 15 nm. TheseK i values are equivalent to theK d values for the calmodulin-peptide complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The properties of the regulatory region of 3f were next tested by constructing chimeras. These consisted of the catalytic core of hPMCA4 (which we call ct120 because the carboxyl-terminal 120 residues have been removed) linked to the regulatory region of 3f. Two chimeras were made, one having 28 residues from 3f added to the carboxyl terminus of ct120 and the second having all 33 residues of the regulatory region of 3f added to ct120. Both of these constructs still bound calmodulin, as was shown by their binding to a calmodulin-Sepharose column. Fig. 5 compares immunoblots of pump constructs with and without calmodulin-Sepharose treatment. It is evident from this figure that ct120, which lacks the calmodulin-binding region, did not bind to the column, but that all of the other constructs did bind. The calmodulin-binding domain of 3f, when incorporated into a pump (either chimera or full-length 3f), still had a high enough affinity to interact with calmodulin even though the peptide C28R3f had a low affinity for calmodulin.Figure 5All constructs except ct120 bind to calmodulin-Sepharose. These Western blots use isoform 4b as a control in all panels. Panel A and the left partof panel B show the three constructs, whereas theright part of panel B shows full-length isoform 3f. In panel A, the membranes were simply solubilized, electrophoresed, and stained without other treatment. In panel B, the treatments were identical except the solubilizate was passed through calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+and then the purified pump molecules were eluted in the presence of EGTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, the binding of calmodulin to the chimeras did not regulate their activity. These chimeric pumps were already fully activated in the absence of calmodulin. Under these circumstances they displayed the high activity and high affinity for Ca2+ which is normally found only when the enzyme is activated by addition of calmodulin or the regulatory region is removed. The addition of calmodulin, even at quite high concentrations, had no significant effect on the activity. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the Ca2+ activation curves of the chimeras with those of the fully active truncated mutant ct120 and of the partially inhibited truncated mutant ct92. ct92 is hPMCA4b cut off at the downstream end of the 28-residue calmodulin-binding domain. The chimeras were all essentially fully activated, regardless of whether they had 28 or 33 residues from 3f and whether they had a high level of calmodulin or none. At very low Ca2+ concentrations, the chimeras appeared to be slightly inhibited relative to ct120, but this effect was not significant.Figure 6Chimeras of rPMCA3f with hPMCA4 are fully activated. The filled circles and the lineof short dashes represent ct120, the activated catalytic core of hPMCA4, whereas the filled triangles andline of long dashes represent ct92, the same enzyme with its calmodulin-binding and autoinhibitory region of 28 residues added to the carboxyl terminus. The open symbolsand solid line represent chimeras of the 3f regulatory domain with ct120. The open squares represent ct120–3f28, the open diamonds represent ct120–3f28 plus calmodulin, the open circlesrepresent ct120–3f33, and the open triangles represent ct120–3f33 plus calmodulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The situation was somewhat different for the full-length 3f, which was weakly activated by calmodulin. Fig. 7shows the activity of 3f with and without calmodulin. It is evident from this figure that the V max was still not changed by the presence of calmodulin. The average activity was increased only 1.41-fold by calmodulin, and the maximum increase was 1.64-fold at 0.69 μm free Ca2+. This contrasts strongly with the effect of calmodulin on hPMCA4b, whereV max was increased 4.0-fold, the average activity was increased 9.0-fold, and the maximum increase was 20.5-fold at 0.27 μm free Ca2+ (25.Elwess N.L.

Although Asp was identified as the active site residue in various DNA glycosylases based on the crystal structure, Glu-125 in human MPG (Glu-145 in mouse MPG) was recently proposed to be the catalytic residue. Mutational analysis for all Asp residues in a truncated, fully active MPG protein showed that only Asp-152 (Asp-132 in the human protein), which is located near the active site, is essential for catalytic activity. However, the substrate binding was not affected in the inactive Glu-152, Asn-152, and Ala-152 mutants. Furthermore, mutation of Asp-152 did not significantly affect the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme and the far UV CD spectra, although a small change in the near UV CD spectra of the mutants suggests localized conformational change in the aromatic residues. We propose that in addition to Glu-145 in mouse MPG, which functions as the activator of a water molecule for nucleophilic attack, Asp-152 plays an essential role either by donating a proton to the substrate base and, thus, facilitating its release or by stabilizing the steric configuration of the active site pocket.

N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase human MPG mouse MPG 1,N 6-ethenoadenine apurinic/apyrimidinic Cellular DNA is continuously exposed to endogenous or exogenous chemical or physical agents that induce DNA lesions. The DNA base damage threatens the genomic stability and cellular viability (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). Multiple DNA repair pathways exist in all organisms from bacteria to man to preserve the integrity of the genome (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). Unrepaired, damaged bases could be mutagenic (2.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 59Google Scholar) and cause cytotoxicity by blocking DNA replication (3.Larson K. Sharn J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 233: 211-218Google Scholar). The DNA base excision repair pathway is primarily responsible for repairing the small alkylation adducts and other base modifications. This repair process is initiated by DNA glycosylases for the recognition and removal of inappropriate bases by cleavage of the C1′-N-glycosyl bond (4.Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Simple DNA glycosylases, e.g. N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG),1 remove abnormal and modified bases and generate apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. Mixed function DNA glycosylase/AP lyases, on the other hand, after base cleavage carry out a β (or βδ) elimination reaction on the free deoxyribose residue, causing a DNA strand break at the resulting AP sites, and generate 3′-phosphosugar (or 3′-phosphate) residue termini. AP endonucleases cleave DNA strands to the AP sites and generate 3′-OH and 5′-phosphodeoxyribose termini. Subsequent repair steps include removal of the 5′-phosphodeoxyribose by deoxyribosephosphate hydrolase, filling the resulting DNA gap with a DNA polymerase, and finally sealing of the repaired strand by DNA ligase (4.Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 5.Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Roy R. Ikeda S. Biswas T. Lock J. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mol.

Although MPGs from several mammalian sources with different molecular masses (25–68 kDa) were reported, only one MPG, homologous in the humans and rodents, has been extensively characterized after its cDNA was cloned by several laboratories including ours (6.Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C. Tano K. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15710-15715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Samson L. Derfler B. Boosalis M. Call K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9127-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This protein is similar to the inducible AlkA protein of Escherichia coli in regard to their broad substrate range. E. colihas a second MPG, the constitutive Tag protein, that is specific for 3-alkyladenine (8.Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Mammalian MPGs, like many other DNA glycosylases, are monomeric in active form, do not have an absolute requirement for a cofactor for activity, and are active when expressed as recombinant proteins inE. coli (9.Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human and mouse MPGs (hMPG and mMPG, respectively) share about 83% identity in their amino acid sequences. MPG is known to excise at least 17 structurally diverse damaged bases, such as alkylated bases (3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, and 3-methylguanine) and a broad range of other damaged bases from DNA including cyclic ethenoadducts, hypoxanthine, and various adducts of nitrogen mustards used in cancer chemotherapy (10.Roy R.

Because the alterations are located in both major and minor grooves of duplex DNA, the earlier hypothesis that the E. coli MPG (AlkA) recognizes alkyl adducts localized only in the minor groove of DNA may not be correct (13.McCarthy T.V. Karran P. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of human MPG complexed with a AP-site analog, it was recently proposed that MPG, while scanning the duplex DNA, completely or partially unstack nucleotides to find its substrate, a structurally diverse group of damaged bases that may or may not cause distortion of the DNA double helix. Once the enzyme recognizes its substrate, a unique tyrosine residue of the protein is inserted into the minor groove of the DNA, which then flips out the damaged nucleotide and intercalates into the vacated space. The damaged base then enters the active site pocket of the enzyme, where a bound water is poised for nucleophilic attack on the N-glycosyl bond (14.Verdine G.L. Bruner S.D. Chem. Biol.

To identify the potential role of aspartic acid residues in the catalytic activity of MPG, we decided to mutate those aspartic acid residues in mouse MPG one at a time that are conserved in all mammalian MPGs characterized so far.

The mutants were generated using Stratagene's Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit.

Open table in a new tab Expression of MPG proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3) and assay of MPG activity in cell-free extract using methyl-3H-labeled methylated calf thymus DNA substrate were performed as described previously (10.Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One unit of MPG is defined as the activity needed to release 1 pmol of methylpurine/min at 37 °C under the assay conditions. The wild type (NΔ100CΔ18) and mutant (Asn-152, Ala-152, and Glu-152) MPG proteins were expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli MV1932 (alkA - tag −) and purified as described previously. The glutathione S-transferase domain was cleaved by digestion with thrombin and separated from MPG as described previously (20.Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The wild type (5 ng) and three mutant enzymes (1 μg) were individually incubated with32P-labeled 1,N 6-ethenoadenine (εA)-containing duplex oligonucleotide (∼10,000 cpm; the sequence is shown in Table IB) substrate for various times when necessary at 37 °C in an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 2 mpiperidine and heating at 90 °C for 30 min to cleave the labeled strand at the abasic site generated by MPG. The DNA was precipitated by ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate and 4 μg of tRNA, dried, dissolved in loading buffer containing 66% formamide and 0.03 n NaOH, and then resolved by electrophoresis in sequencing gel containing 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea. DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described by Leblanc and Moss (26.Leblanc B. Moss T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reaction (50 μl) was performed with 4 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide (∼15,000 cpm; the sequence is the same as of the substrate oligonucleotide), 5 ng of plasmid DNA, and varying amounts of the wild type NΔ100CΔ18 MPG or mutant proteins (Asn-152, Ala-152, and Glu-152) in the assay buffer. After incubating for 5 min at room temperature, the DNA was partially digested with 5 μl of 0.001 unit (Kunitz) of DNase I (Sigma) for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of reaction stop buffer (1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 40 μg/ml tRNA), and after extraction with phenol/chloroform, the DNA was precipitated in ethanol and dried, and the cleavage product was analyzed as before. Two independent major DNase I-generated bands in the εA-containing strand protected by wild type and mutant MPGs were selected for quantitation of radioactivity in the PhosphorImager. The MPG concentration that reduced the radioactivity in the bands generated in the absence of added MPG to 50% was assumed to be the K D,app. TheK D,app values had less than 10% variability, independently determined from the two bands. The wild type and the mutant MPGs were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl and then analyzed for the secondary and tertiary structures by far UV and near UV CD spectra, respectively, using an AVIV 62 DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter. The far UV and near UV CD spectra were obtained in fused quartz cuvettes with 0.1-cm and 1.0-cm path lengths, respectively, and the protein solutions had absorbance at 280 nm ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Each spectrum was recorded with a 0.5-nm increment and 1-s interval. For each sample, three repetitive scans were obtained and averaged. The structure of the wild type and mutant MPGs was also monitored by determining the emission spectra with a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 fluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The emission spectra were acquired by scanning between 305 and 400 nm. Five repetitive scans were obtained and averaged. The spectra were normalized to the same protein concentration. Proteins were quantified by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer. Adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine-β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites were obtained from Applied Biosystems, and special ethenoadenine-β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite was obtained from Glen Research. We tested the role of aspartic residues in MPG in catalysis by targeted mutagenesis of eight such residues, at positions 112, 152, 231, 252, 255, 259, 260, and 310, to asparagine. All of these residues were conserved in three known mammalian MPGs. The levels of these mutant proteins in the soluble fraction of cell-free extract ofE. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the corresponding expression plasmids were comparable with that of the wild type protein (NΔ100CΔ18). Only the Asn-152 mutant among the 8 Asn mutants showed substantial loss of enzymatic activity (TableII). The Asp-152 residue was then independently mutated to Ala and Glu, and all three mutant proteins (Asn-152, Ala-152, and Glu-152) were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli MV1932 (alkA - tag −) and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1).Table IISpecific activities of wild type and mutant MPGs in E. coli crude cell extractsProtein typeSpecific activityunits/mgControl0.02Wt (NΔ100CΔ18)14Asn-11213Asn-1520.08Asn-2317Asn-2525Asn-2557Asn-2599Asn-26010Asn-31018Because the E. coli host contained endogenous MPG, the activity in BL21(DE3) cells harboring the empty vector was subtracted for each assay.

Open table in a new tab Because the E. coli host contained endogenous MPG, the activity in BL21(DE3) cells harboring the empty vector was subtracted for each assay. The activities were determined in three or four experiments, and the mean values are listed. Wt, wild type. With εA-containing duplex oligonucleotide substrate, no εA-cleaving activity was observed for any of three mutants, even when incubated for an extended time and with 200-fold excess protein (Fig.2). Also with hypoxanthine-containing duplex oligonucleotide, we could not detect any cleavage activity for any of the three mutants (data not shown). Although some activity was observed in crude E. coli extract containing the Asn-152 mutant protein (Table II) using a less sensitive assay, we conclude that the purified enzyme lacks detectable MPG activity. Thus Asp-152 appears to play an essential role in the catalytic function of the enzyme. Although the three proteins mutated at the Asp-152 site underwent some structural reorganization (as described later) and completely lost catalytic activity, they showed identical behavior as the active enzyme in protecting the substrate DNA from DNase I digestion as indicated in the footprinting analysis (Fig. 3). Furthermore, all mutants had similar affinity for the substrate DNA as the wild type enzyme (Table III). These results further support our conclusion that Asp-152 is essential for catalytic activity but not for substrate binding.Table IIIDissociation Constants, KDapp (nm) for the interaction of wild type and mutant MPGs with ɛA · T-containing duplex oligonucleotidesProtein typeWild type (NΔ100CΔ18)0.2Asn-1520.28Ala-1520.19Glu-1520.24 Open table in a new tab The far UV circular dichroism spectra of Asn-152, Ala-152, and Glu-152 mutant proteins are closely similar to that of wild type enzyme (Asp-152), indicating similar secondary structure or backbone conformation of the mutant and wild type protein (Fig.4 A). The near UV CD spectrum, which generally depends on the atomic environment and closeness of packing of the aromatic residues including their accessibility to solvent (27.Pain R. Current Protocols in Protein Science Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 7.6.1-7.6.23Google Scholar), shows that one or more of the five tyrosine residues of MPG are in an asymmetric environment, causing a decrease in positive ellipticity of the Glu-152 and Asn-152 mutants and generating a marked negative ellipticity of Ala-152 mutant compared with that of the wild type protein (Fig. 4 B). These changes in aromatic CD reflect changes in conformation that are limited strictly to the immediate neighborhood of the relatively few aromatic residues. On the other hand the emission spectra of tryptophan (total of three residues) fluorescence of these mutants are superimposable with that of the wild type protein (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, it appears that a small local structural perturbation observed due to mutation of the Asp-152 residue is not around the tryptophan residues but more likely the tyrosine residues. Aspartic acid was shown to be the catalytic residue in the cases of most DNA glycosylases and DNA glycosylase/lyases, including E. coli alkA, the MPG ortholog, uracil-DNA glycosylase, MutY, E. coli endonuclease III, hNTH1, Fpg, human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1, yeast 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1, and yeast 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-2 (16.Labahn J.

These observations prompted us to carry out a systematic investigation to test whether an Asp residue plays a critical role in MPG activity as well. We generated site-directed mutants one at a time of those aspartate residues that are conserved in mammalian MPGs. Among eight such aspartate residues, mutations of only Asp-152 caused complete loss of catalytic activity. While our experiments were in progress, the tertiary structure of hMPG was elucidated by x-ray crystallography, upon which basis it was proposed that Glu-125 in hMPG (Glu-145 in mMPG) is the active site residue (15.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This residue presumably activates a bound water molecule by abstracting a proton, which then attacks the C1′ atom of the deoxynucleoside substrate (15.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, Ala-125 or Gln-125 mutants of hMPG had no detectable catalytic activity; however, both retained high affinity for an inhibitor, pyrrolidine-containing DNA. 2T. Ellenberger, personal communication. It was proposed earlier that the net positive charge in the N-alkylpurine substrates such as 7-methylguanine facilitates in cleavage of the glycosyl bond (14.Verdine G.L. Bruner S.D. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1997; 4: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The results reported here indicate that, in addition to Glu-125, Asp-132 in hMPG plays a critical role in catalysis of nonelectron-deficient substrates, namely εA- or hypoxanthine-containing oligonucleotides. It will be therefore interesting to test whether Asp-132 is essential for the glycosylase activity on an electron-deficient substrate, e.g.7-methylguanine in the same sequence context as of the εA-containing oligonucleotide. It is interesting to note that among all aspartates, only Asp-152 of mMPG is conserved in all putative glycosylases cloned from the eukaryotic sources (e.g. human, rat, andArabadopsis thaliana) as well as among from several bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Borrelia bergdorferi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Fig. 5). Furthermore, among all Asp residues Asp-132 is the only one located near the DNA binding site, whereas the other Asp residues are widely scattered on the surface of hMPG (15.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the case of several DNA glycosylases, a conserved residue(s) other than the active site has(have) been shown to be involved in lesion recognition and catalysis. For example, although theN-terminal proline (Pro-2) in E. coli Fpg was shown to be involved in catalysis by producing an imino (Schiff base) intermediate with its substrate (28.Rabow L.E. Kow Y.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5084-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Lys-57 and Lys-155, conserved in Fpg proteins of several bacteria, were implicated specifically in recognition and catalysis of 8-oxoguanine in DNA (29.Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30.Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5351-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A unified catalytic mechanism for DNA glycosylases was proposed, which postulates that protonation of the substrate base is necessary for making it a better leaving group in efficient N-glycosylic bond cleavage. In such a case, catalysis involves a proton donor as well as a proton acceptor residue in the enzyme molecule (31.Dodson M.L Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the cases of E. coli Mut Y and uracil-DNA glycosylase of herpes simplex virus type I, Glu-37 and His-210, respectively, were proposed to be involved in protonation of the substrate bases, whereas Asp-138 and Asp-88, respectively, in these enzymes act as activators of water molecules, which attack the N-glycosylic bonds (17.Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18.Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic structure of hMPG bound to pyrrolidine-containing oligonucleotide allowed identification of Glu-125 as being responsible for activation of water based on its location relative to the pyrrolidine residue (15.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this structure, Asp-132 (corresponding to Asp-152 in mMPG) is localized on the protein surface facing away from the DNA binding site (15.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and, thus, may not be involved in DNA binding. The fact that all mutations of the Asp-152 residue in mMPG did not affect the substrate DNA binding is consistent with this prediction. In considering the possible causes for the loss of activity of mutants at residue 152, we should point out that a trivial reason for such inactivation is a drastic structural change of the mutant proteins. However, spectroscopic studies and DNA footprinting analysis indicate that conservative substitution of Asp-152 with Asn or Glu or even nonconservative substitution with Ala did not cause a global change in the tertiary structure of the protein. No significant change was observed in the far UV CD spectra and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a result of mutation. Furthermore, DNA footprinting pattern was indistinguishable among the wild type and mutant proteins. At the same time, a localized change in the environment and closeness of packing of aromatic residues, most likely tyrosine residues, was produced in the Asn-152 and Glu-152 mutants as indicated by a decrease in positive ellipticity in the near UV region. Such tyrosine residues are localized near the binding site of DNA. Thus the loss of activity of at least Asn-152 and Glu-152 mutants are likely to be due to a local effect. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of detectable environmental perturbation surrounding the Trp residues, which are located away from Asp-152. If the role of Asp-152 is to donate a proton to the substrate base, then the complete loss of activity of the Glu-152 mutant was unexpected because Glu, in principle, is capable of donating a proton. It is likely that perturbation of the local conformation in the neighborhood of aromatic residues could have prevented the optimum geometry for such proton transfer from Glu-152. Because Asp-132 (Asp-152 in mMPG) in the crystal structure of hMPG complexed with pyrrolidine-containing DNA is located 10.52 Å away from the C1′ of pyrrolidine, it is unlikely that in such a configuration Asp-152 could be a proton donor to the base. However, we should point out that pyrrolidine is not a substrate of the enzyme. It is thus possible that the binding of a true substrate, e.g. εA to the enzyme, could cause movement of the loop containing the Asp-152 residue (Fig. 6), to an optimum distance from the base to allow the proton transfer. Alternatively, the proton transfer may involve a bridging H2O molecule. At the same time, we are not able to exclude the possibility of an indirect role of Asp-152 in which its substitution mutation destabilized the architecture of the catalytic pocket. Thus the local hydrogen-bonding network with the neighboring residues, particularly the critical Tyr residues at positions 147, 179, and 182 of mMPG in the hydrophobic active site pocket, may be disrupted in the absence of Asp-152. This disruption may lead to loss of hydrogen bonding between the OH group of Tyr-147 and Glu-145 (Glu-125 in hMPG), which holds the side chain of Glu-145 in position for activating the water molecule. These alternatives could be directly tested by elucidation of the structure of active or Asp-152 mutant MPG bound to the substrate base and/or to a substrate oligonucleotide. We thank Drs. R. S. Lloyd and M. L. Dodson for critical discussions and Lucy Lee and Dr. S.-H. Lin for CD and fluorescence analysis, respectively."

The biological specificity of eosinophilia suggests a tight and independent regulation of IL-5 expression.

In this study, we report the finding of a novel 3′-regulatory element. Data base analysis of a 2-kilobase fragment of the 3′-end of the mouse IL-5 gene revealed the presence of a 40-base pair-long repetitive sequence that consists of four direct repeats of ATGAATGA distributed in a symmetrical manner. This sequence, named mouse downstream regulatory element-1 (mDRE1), was shown to be protected in DNase I footprinting assays in vitro. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific antibodies identified the transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 as responsible for the formation of the specific complexes with mDRE1 and nuclear extracts from both EL4 and primary T-cells. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides containing different numbers of ATGAATGA repeats showed that Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to different motifs in the mDRE1 sequence.

IL-5 controls the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and is also involved in their differentiation and activation. It is a cytokine produced mainly by Th2 cells, but mast cells and eosinophils are also known to produce it (5.Barata L.T. Ying S. Meng Q. Barkans J. Rajakulasingam K. Durham S.R. Kay A.B. J.

The expression of IL-5 is tightly regulated and tissue-specific, and it is present in all cases of eosinophilia (8.Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the majority of cytokines, the expression of IL-5 is regulated at the transcriptional level (9.Naora H. Young I.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Thomas M.A. Karlen S. D'Ercole M. Sanderson C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As most of the research on the regulation of IL-5 expression targets the promoter region of the gene, all known elements that regulate its expression are located in that region. However, transcription regulatory elements can be present in the 3′-end of genes. The 3′-untranslated region silencer present in thespi2.3 gene inhibits the basal promoter activity of this gene as well as its expression in response to growth hormone (11.Le Cam A. Legraverend C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The 3′-flanking region of the CD2 gene contains an enhancer that provides T-cell-specific expression to this gene or any other to which it is attached (12.Greaves D.R. Wilson F.D. Lang G. Kioussis D. Cell. 1989; 56: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In cytokine genes, the tumor necrosis factor-α-responsive element renders tissue-specific tumor necrosis factor-α-induced expression to the tumor necrosis factor-α gene in cells of the central nervous system, but not in mononuclear cells (13.Kwon J. Lee S.J. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22383-22390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the case of the IL-4 gene, a silencer region present in the 3′-flanking region of the gene renders Th2 specificity to IL-4 expression through the binding of STAT6. As Th1 cells are not capable of nuclear expression of STAT6, these cells cannot overcome the 3′-silencer activity and therefore are not able to express IL-4 (14.Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies in this laboratory demonstrated that the 3′-untranslated region has little or no effect on the post-transcriptional control of IL-5 expression (10.Thomas M.A. Karlen S. D'Ercole M. Sanderson C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of elements present in the 3′-flanking region of the IL-5 gene and show that they are involved in the transcriptional control of the gene. We identified a new regulatory element located in the 3′-flanking region of the mIL-5 gene. This murine downstream regulatory element-1 (mDRE1) is 40 bp long, consists of four direct repeats of ATGAATGA distributed in a symmetrical manner, and was shown to be protected in DNase I footprinting assays. Deletion of this sequence from a 9.5-kb construct containing the whole mIL-5 gene decreased the promoter activity upon PMA/cAMP stimulation by 3.5-fold, suggesting that this part of the 3′-untranslated region is involved in the positive regulation of the gene. Using nuclear extracts from the thymoma-derived EL4 cell line and primary T-cells, we have shown that transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to the mDRE1 sequence. Together, these data suggest that mDRE1 is a new regulatory element involved in the regulation of IL-5 expression and that its activity may be regulated by octamer factors. EL4 and primary murine cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 μmminimal Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 75 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma), and 10 mm Hepes. 5% fetal calf serum was added to EL4 cell medium. Primary murine cell cultures were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml recombinant human IL-2. EL4 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 mm cAMP. Primary T-cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA). The 220-bp fragment of the mIL-5 gene (+4958 to +5178) was subcloned into theXbaI/SacI sites of the pSP72 vector (Promega). The resulting construct was subsequently digested with restriction enzymes XhoI and HpaI, for labeling of the coding strand, or with BglII and PvuII, for labeling of the noncoding strand. The fragments were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase for dephosphorylation of the 5′ terminus and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The DNase I footprinting assays were carried out using the DNase I footprinting system supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. The protection protocol followed the instructions supplied with the kit. Nuclear extracts from unstimulated EL4 cells were used as the source of proteins, and the incubation was carried out at room temperature for 20 min in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC). A 9.5-kb fragment of the murine IL-5 gene (from positions −3861 to +5612) was cloned into the p-Poly-III expression vector (15.Lathe R. Vilotte J.L. Clark A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the luciferase reporter gene was inserted at position +33. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The mutagenesis protocols followed the instructions supplied with the kit. The oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis reaction were as follows: mutagenic primer, 5′-GGC TCA GGG TGA ACA GGA GAG GCG CTC CAT TAA TAA AGT GCT TGC-3′; and selection primer, 5′-CGA TAA GGA TCC GCC GAC CGA TGC CC-3′. EL4 cells were transfected with 10 μg of the IL-5/luciferase constructs by electrophoresis as described previously (16.Karlen S. D'Ercole M. Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in duplicate. After transfection, the cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 mm cAMP for 12 h. The luciferase assay was performed as described (17.Todd M.D. Grusby M.J. Lederer J.A. Lacy E. Lichtman A.H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The background obtained from the lysis buffer was subtracted from each sample. Errors represent S.D. The magnitude of the luciferase activity varied greatly between experiments. The mean of the activity of the mutant construct is expressed as the ratio of the mutant to the wild type with an S.D. calculated over five experiments. Nuclear extracts used in EMSA were prepared following the method described by Schreiberet al. (18.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol were added to the reaction buffers just prior to lysis. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Standard binding reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 60 mm KCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 12% glycerol, and 25 fmol of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Probe preparation, DNA-protein binding reactions, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described by Karlen and Beard (19.Karlen S. Beard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4296-4306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as probes or competitors (one strand shown). The wild-type oligonucleotide for mDRE1, spanning nucleotides +4539 to +4579 of the mIL-5 gene, was 5′-ATG AAT GAG AGG ATG AAT GAA TGA ATG AAT AAA TGA ATG AA TGG GAG-3′. The mDRE1 deletion, substitution, and insertion mutants are given in Tables II and III. All oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University). Other competitor oligonucleotides included the AP1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′), the Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC ACT AGA A-3′), the AP2 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′) (all obtained from Promega), the c-Ets consensus oligonucleotide (5-GGG CTG CTT GAG GAA GTA TAA GAA T-3′), and the GATA consensus oligonucleotide (5′-CAC TTG ATA ACA GAA AGT GAT AAC TCT-3′) (both obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In supershift experiments, polyclonal antibodies to Jun/AP1 (reactive with all Jun members), Oct-1, Oct-2, Ets1/2, and c-Myb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 h on ice prior to the addition of the probe.Table IICompetitor oligonucleotidesOligonucleotideSequenceOligo 1ATGAATGAOligo 2ATGAATGAATGGGAGOligo 3GAGGATGAATGAATAAOligo 4ATGAATGAATGAATGGGGAGOligo 5GAGGATGAATGAATGAATGAATAAOligonucleotides containing different numbers of ATGAATGA repeats, with or without flanking sequences, were used as competitors in EMSAs.

Boldface letters indicate substitutions (mut1 to mut11) or insertions (mut12 to mut14). Palindromic and repetitive sequences are well known to display regulatory activities in the expression of a number of genes. To identify potential regulatory elements in the mIL-5 gene, a pattern recognition search was performed in the first 2 kb of the IL-5 3′-untranslated region, commencing at the stop codon (+3772). An interesting pattern of direct repeats was found downstream of the polyadenylation site. This sequence is 40 bp long (from positions +4539 to +4578) and consists of four direct repeats of ATGAATGA (Fig.1 A). The first and last pairs of repeats are separated from the core by four nucleotides, so the whole structure is symmetrical. Using the program TFSEARCH (20.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), this sequence showed homology to the binding motifs of AP1, Oct-1, GATA1/2, and c-Ets (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, all these transcription factors have been described to be involved in the regulation of IL-5 (16.Karlen S. D'Ercole M. Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Gruart-Gouilleux V. Engels P. Sullivan M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22.Yamagata T.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine if nuclear proteins were able to bind to the repetitive sequence, a 220-bp fragment (from positions +4958 to +5178) was cloned into the pSP72 vector and used as template in DNase I protection assays with nuclear extracts from the murine T-cell line EL4. This cell line was used in the original characterization of IL-5 and has been widely used to study gene regulation (31.Schwenger G.T. Sanderson C.J. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1998; 28: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Four protected regions (sites I–IV) were observed in the IL-5 sequence in experiments with unstimulated EL4 cells (Fig. 1,B and C). Alignment of protected regions from coding and noncoding strands indicated that sites I and III are complementary and cover 47 bp, including the repetitive ATGAATGA sequence in its entirety (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, sites II and IV are not complementary to each other. In addition, site II overlaps part of the vector sequence and was shown to be nonspecific. This indicates that the repetitive motif (sites I/III) is involved in protein binding. A 9.5-kb fragment of the mIL-5 gene (from positions −3861 to +5612) (Fig.2) was cloned into the p-Poly-III plasmid with the luciferase reporter gene inserted immediately downstream of the IL-5 cap site. The protected 47 base pairs were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis from this construct, and both wild-type and deletion constructs were transiently transfected into EL4 cells. Luciferase activity levels produced in unstimulated cells transfected with wild-type or mutant constructs were not significantly different from background levels. However, following cell stimulation with PMA/cAMP, a combination known to induce optimal levels of IL-5 in EL4 cells (24.Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar), the mean of the expressed activity of the mutant construct relative to the wild-type construct in five independent experiments (Table I) was 29.85 ± 1.4%. This suggests that the deleted sequence (mDRE1) is important for PMA/cAMP-induced expression of the IL-5 gene and functions as a positive regulatory element.Table ILuciferase activity levels produced in PMA/cAMP-stimulated EL4 cells transfected with the wild-type or mutant construct in five independent experimentsExperiment12345Wild-type (LCPS)aLCPS, light counts per s.2756 ± 9772258 ± 1382380 ± 2531577 ± 2021437 ± 166Mutant (LCPS)863 ± 79648 ± 71713 ± 155475 ± 117419 ± 57Mutant/wild-type (%)31.328.73030.129.2a LCPS, light counts per s. Open table in a new tab EMSA utilizing a double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the mDRE1 sequence was performed with nuclear extracts from unstimulated EL4 cells. Four complexes were identified, three of which (C1, C2, and C3) were competed with excess unlabeled mDRE1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–4), but not with an unrelated AP2 consensus sequence (Fig. 3 A,lanes 5–7), suggesting specific binding. The formation of complexes C1 and C3 was reproducible in all experiments; however, the major complex, C2, seemed to be accompanied by a second, faster migrating band that was competed with unlabeled mDRE1, but not with AP2. This complex was not present in all EMSAs, and its intensity was weak and variable; so it is not further discussed. The intensity of complex C2 varied in the different assays, but it was always present. Although C1, C2, and C3 were constitutively expressed in EL4 cells, the bands increased in intensity following stimulation (Fig.4 A), but no additional complexes were formed.Figure 4Competition EMSA with the mDRE1 oligonucleotide. A, the consensus sequence for Oct-1 competed for the formation of complexes C1, C2, and C3 with mDRE1 and nuclear extracts from both unstimulated (UNSTM; lane 2) and PMA/cAMP-stimulated (lane 6) EL4 cells. The AP1 consensus sequence competed for the formation of only complex C2 (lanes 3 and 7), and the c-Ets consensus sequence did not interfere with complex formation (lanes 4 and 8). B, GATA and AP2 consensus sequences did not interfere with complex formation with mDRE1 and nuclear extracts from PMA/cAMP-stimulated EL4 cells. All competitors were present at a 100-fold molar excess. C, the consensus sequence for Oct-1 competed for the formation of complexes C1, C2, and C3 with nuclear extracts from ConA/IL-2-stimulated primary T-cells. The Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide was used at a 100-fold molar excess.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclear extracts from unstimulated primary T-cells did not form any complexes with mDRE1 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). However, extracts from ConA/IL-2-stimulated primary cells formed three specific complexes with similar gel migration patterns obtained with extracts from EL4 cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6). The intensity of complex C1 varied, but was consistently present in all EMSAs. These results show that the nuclear factors binding to mDRE1 are constitutively expressed in EL4 cells and increase after stimulation, whereas in primary T-cells, there is no detectable constitutive expression, but they are strongly induced after cell activation. As described above, a series of possible binding sites for known transcription factors were present in the mDRE1 sequence. To determine, if any of these were forming the specific complexes with mDRE1, consensus sequences were tested for the ability to inhibit complex formation in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4 A (lanes 2 and 6), only the Oct-1 consensus sequence was able to compete for the binding of the specific complexes C1, C2, and C3 from both unstimulated and PMA/cAMP-stimulated EL4 cells. The AP1 consensus oligonucleotide was able to compete for the binding of complex C2 (Fig. 4 A,lanes 2 and 7), whereas c-Ets (lanes 4 and 8) and GATA (Fig.4 B, lane 2) did not compete for any of the complexes. When extracts from ConA/IL-2-stimulated primary T-cells were tested, the Oct-1 consensus sequence competed for the binding of C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 4 C). To further characterize the proteins that bind to mDRE1, we performed supershift assays. Addition of anti-Oct-1 antibody clearly abolished the formation of only complex C1 with nuclear extracts from either stimulatory condition (Fig.5 A, lanes 2 and 8). Anti-Oct-2 antibody eliminated only the C3 band (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and9), whereas anti-Jun antibody interfered with the formation of complex C2, but did not totally abolish it. Antibodies against Ets1/2 and c-Myb had no effect (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4–6 and 10–12). These results indicate that Oct-1 forms C1, Jun forms C2, and Oct-2 forms C3. Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts from ConA/IL-2-stimulated primary T-cells were used. As shown in Fig.5 B, anti-Oct-1 and anti-Oct-2 antibodies interfered with the binding of only complexes C1 and C3, respectively, confirming that the same proteins form complexes with mDRE1 in both the cell line and primary T-cells. To determine if the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors were binding to the same motifs in the mDRE1 sequence, oligonucleotides containing different numbers of repeats (Table II), with or without a flanking sequence, were used as competitors in EMSA against labeled mDRE1. The results (Fig.6 A) show that the minimal sequence necessary for competition with complex C3·Oct-2 contains two ATGAATGA repeats and that a flanking sequence is also necessary (Oligo5). This sequence was called the “minimal binding sequence” (MBS). The nature of the flanking sequence is probably unimportant, as an oligonucleotide containing the same flanking sequence, but one copy of ATGAATGA (Oligo3), could not compete for the formation of any of the complexes (data not shown). None of the oligonucleotides were able to compete for the formation of complex C1·Oct-1 with labeled mDRE1, showing that Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to different motifs in the mDRE1 sequence. To determine which nucleotides were important for formation of the major complex C3·Oct-2, substitution mutations were generated within the MBS. These mutants (Table III) were used as competitors in EMSA using radiolabeled mDRE1 as probe. The substitution of TG for CT in mut1 totally abolished the capacity of the oligonucleotide to compete for complex C3·Oct-2 (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2–4). Similarly, the substitution of TG for CT in mut4 also abolished the capacity of the oligonucleotide to compete for complex C3·Oct-2 (data not shown). The same substitution on mut9 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 6–8) and mut3 (data not shown), however, did not interfere with the ability of the sequence to compete for C3·Oct-2. As shown in Fig. 6 B(lanes 6–8), mut9 was able to compete for the formation of complex C1·Oct-1 with mDRE1. A computer analysis of this sequence showed that an 80% homologous Oct-1-binding motif had been created in this mutant, which probably explains its capacity to compete for complex C1·Oct-1. The substitution of a pair of AA for CT in mut7, mut8, and mut10 also abolished the capacity of these mutants to compete for binding of complex C3·Oct-2, whereas the same substitutions in mut11 had no effect (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the important nucleotides for protein recognition are symmetrically distributed within the sequence (Fig. 6 C) and that the substitution of only two of them is enough to interfere with protein binding. The nature of the flanking sequence is unimportant, as mutations in this region did not alter the capacity to compete for formation of complex C3·Oct-2 (data not shown). To determine if the spacing between the repeats was important for complex formation, oligonucleotides with two, four, or six thymidines inserted between the central repeats (Table III) were produced. Insertion of two nucleotides between the repeats (mut12) was enough to interfere with protein binding to the sequence, as the mutant was not able to compete for formation of complex C3·Oct-2 with labeled mDRE1 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 9–11). The same was true with insertion mutants mut13 and mut14. These results show that spacing between the repeats is of importance for protein recognition of the element, as any disruption of its continuity abolishes the capacity of the mutants to form complex C3·Oct-2. The expression of cytokine genes is regulated at the transcriptional level. Although the best known transcription regulatory elements are present in the 5′-flanking region, a series of regulatory elements have been described in the 3′-end of genes. The work presented here describes the finding of a novel 3′-flanking element (mDRE1) that plays a positive role in the regulation of the murine IL-5 gene. Data base analysis of a 2-kb fragment of the 3′-flanking region of the mIL-5 gene revealed the presence of a 40-bp-long repetitive sequence that consists of four direct repeats of ATGAATGA distributed in a symmetrical manner. This sequence was shown to be protected in in vitro DNase I footprinting assays with nuclear extracts from EL4 cells. When the sequence corresponding to mDRE1 was deleted from the complete 9.5-kb mIL-5 gene, the expression of the luciferase reporter gene was significantly decreased in comparison with the wild-type construct when expressed in EL4 cells. This indicates that mDRE1 plays a positive role in the expression of mIL-5. EMSAs using oligonucleotides corresponding to the mDRE1 sequence showed the formation of at least four complexes, three of which (C1, C2, and C3) were specific and consistently formed. Competition analysis indicated that complexes C1 and C3 belong to the octamer family of transcription factors, and supershift assays showed that Oct-1 and Oct-2 were forming complexes C1 and C3, respectively. The formation of complex C2 could be competed with both Oct and AP1 consensus sequences, and the addition of anti-Jun antibody interfered with, but did not abolish, the formation of this complex. Thus, some of the proteins forming complex C2 may belong to the Jun family. Although Oct-1 and Oct-2 are not present in nuclear extracts from unstimulated primary T-cells, they are constitutively expressed at a low level in EL4 cells as described previously (25.Staudt L.M. Clerc R.G. Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Sharp P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 241: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26.Kamps M.P. Corcoran L. LeBowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5464-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In both cases, they are induced after stimulation. Nuclear extracts from stimulated primary T-cells displayed the same pattern of complex formation as those from EL4 cells, and competition and supershift assays indicated that Oct-1 and Oct-2 formed complexes C1 and C3, respectively. Competition with oligonucleotides containing different numbers of ATGAATGA repeats indicated that Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to different motifs in mDRE1. Oct-2 binds to the central repeats, whereas Oct-1 appears to bind to the flanking region. Mutations in the MBS showed that the nucleotides important for protein recognition are distributed symmetrically in the sequence and that spacing between the repeats is critical for protein binding, as any disruption of its continuity interfered with the capacity of the mutants to compete for formation of the Oct-2 complex. Recent data from our laboratory revealed that the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors also bind to the conserved lymphokine element-0 sequence located in the 5′-flanking region of the IL-5 gene. 2M. Senna Salerno, G. Schwenger, C. J. Sanderson, and V. A. Mordvinov, submitted for publication. The fact that octamer factors, and in particular Oct-2, can be found to bind to sequences in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the IL-5 gene suggests the possibility that they might work together, in the context of the whole IL-5 gene, to regulate the expression of the gene. One possibility is that the octamer factors play a role in the remodeling of the chromatin in the IL-5 locus in a similar way as STAT6 binds to both the promoter (27.Lederer J.A. Perez V.L. DesRoches L. Kim S.M. Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the 3′-flanking region of the IL-4 gene (14.Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this case, it has been proposed that the binding of STAT6 is necessary for long-range remodeling of the IL-4 locus during Th2 differentiation (28.Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this work describes the finding of a novel downstream regulatory element (mDRE1) that plays a positive role in the regulation of the IL-5 gene. The activity of mDRE1 seems to be regulated by octamer factors. Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action of these factors in the regulation of the IL-5 gene."
