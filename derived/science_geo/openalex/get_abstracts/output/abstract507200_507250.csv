Air pollution is an important environmental problem in China, but the factors contributing to the high levels of particulate matter present during haze pollution events remain poorly understood. This paper investigates the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in four Chinese cities during the severe haze pollution event of January 2013, and finds that the event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation. This indicates that mitigation strategies focused on primary particulate emissions alone are unlikely to be fully effective. Additional measures such as controlling emissions of volatile organic compounds from fossil fuel combustion (mostly coal and traffic) and biomass burning may be required if China's particulate pollution is to be reduced. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in developing countries has led to an increase in air pollution, along a similar trajectory to that previously experienced by the developed nations1. In China, particulate pollution is a serious environmental problem that is influencing air quality, regional and global climates, and human health2,3. In response to the extremely severe and persistent haze pollution experienced by about 800 million people during the first quarter of 2013 (refs 4, 5), the Chinese State Council announced its aim to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) by up to 25 per cent relative to 2012 levels by 2017 (ref. 6). Such efforts however require elucidation of the factors governing the abundance and composition of PM2.5, which remain poorly constrained in China3,7,8. Here we combine a comprehensive set of novel and state-of-the-art offline analytical approaches and statistical techniques to investigate the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi’an during January 2013. We find that the severe haze pollution event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation, which contributed 30–77 per cent and 44–71 per cent (average for all four cities) of PM2.5 and of organic aerosol, respectively. On average, the contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) are found to be of similar importance (SOA/SIA ratios range from 0.6 to 1.4). Our results suggest that, in addition to mitigating primary particulate emissions, reducing the emissions of secondary aerosol precursors from, for example, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning is likely to be important for controlling China’s PM2.5 levels and for reducing the environmental, economic and health impacts resulting from particulate pollution."

https://openalex.org/W2155441570,"Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition."
https://openalex.org/W1995403970,"In photosynthetic organisms, D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the major enzyme assimilating atmospheric CO2 into the biosphere. Owing to the wasteful oxygenase activity and slow turnover of Rubisco, the enzyme is among the most important targets for improving the photosynthetic efficiency of vascular plants. It has been anticipated that introducing the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) from cyanobacteria into plants could enhance crop yield. However, the complex nature of Rubisco's assembly has made manipulation of the enzyme extremely challenging, and attempts to replace it in plants with the enzymes from cyanobacteria and red algae have not been successful. Here we report two transplastomic tobacco lines with functional Rubisco from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Se7942). We knocked out the native tobacco gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco by inserting the large and small subunit genes of the Se7942 enzyme, in combination with either the corresponding Se7942 assembly chaperone, RbcX, or an internal carboxysomal protein, CcmM35, which incorporates three small subunit-like domains. Se7942 Rubisco and CcmM35 formed macromolecular complexes within the chloroplast stroma, mirroring an early step in the biogenesis of cyanobacterial β-carboxysomes. Both transformed lines were photosynthetically competent, supporting autotrophic growth, and their respective forms of Rubisco had higher rates of CO2 fixation per unit of enzyme than the tobacco control. These transplastomic tobacco lines represent an important step towards improved photosynthesis in plants and will be valuable hosts for future addition of the remaining components of the cyanobacterial CCM, such as inorganic carbon transporters and the β-carboxysome shell proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2085056743,"Given the global burden of diarrhoeal diseases, it is important to understand how members of the gut microbiota affect the risk for, course of, and recovery from disease in children and adults. The acute, voluminous diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption. Here we conduct a detailed time-series metagenomic study of faecal microbiota collected during the acute diarrhoeal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a high burden of disease. We find that recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that shows similarities to the pattern of assembly/maturation of the gut microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define the underlying mechanisms, we introduce into gnotobiotic mice an artificial community composed of human gut bacterial species that directly correlate with recovery from cholera in adults and are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of the species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibits consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up analyses, including mono- and co-colonization studies, establish that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization, that R. obeum luxS (autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthase) expression and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing-mediated repression of several V. cholerae colonization factors. Co-colonization with V. cholerae mutants discloses that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP. The approach described can be used to mine the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi or other populations for members that use autoinducers and/or other mechanisms to limit colonization with V. cholerae, or conceivably other enteropathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2015030879,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and remains the most lethal gynaecological malignancy in the Western world. Therapeutic approaches need to account for inter-patient and intra-tumoural heterogeneity and detailed characterization of in vitro models representing the different histological and molecular ovarian cancer subtypes is critical to enable reliable preclinical testing. There are approximately 100 publicly available ovarian cancer cell lines but their cellular and molecular characteristics are largely undescribed. We have characterized 39 ovarian cancer cell lines under uniform conditions for growth characteristics, mRNA/microRNA expression, exon sequencing, drug response for clinically-relevant therapeutics and collated all available information on the original clinical features and site of origin. We tested for statistical associations between the cellular and molecular features of the lines and clinical features. Of the 39 ovarian cancer cell lines, 14 were assigned as high-grade serous, four serous-type, one low-grade serous and 20 non-serous type. Three morphological subtypes: Epithelial (n = 21), Round (n = 7) and Spindle (n = 12) were identified that showed distinct biological and molecular characteristics, including overexpression of cell movement and migration-associated genes in the Spindle subtype. Comparison with the original clinical data showed association of the spindle-like tumours with metastasis, advanced stage, suboptimal debulking and poor prognosis. In addition, the expression profiles of Spindle, Round and Epithelial morphologies clustered with the previously described C1-stromal, C5-mesenchymal and C4 ovarian subtype expression profiles respectively. Comprehensive profiling of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines under controlled, uniform conditions demonstrates clinically relevant cellular and genomic characteristics. This data provides a rational basis for selecting models to develop specific treatment approaches for histological and molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1966971875,"Efficient catalytic reactions that can generate C-C bonds enantioselectively, and ones that can produce trisubstituted alkenes diastereoselectively, are central to research in organic chemistry. Transformations that accomplish these two tasks simultaneously are in high demand, particularly if the catalysts, substrates and reagents are inexpensive and if the reaction conditions are mild. Here we report a facile multicomponent catalytic process that begins with a chemoselective, site-selective and diastereoselective copper-boron addition to a monosubstituted allene; the resulting boron-substituted organocopper intermediates then participate in a similarly selective allylic substitution. The products, which contain a stereogenic carbon centre, a monosubstituted alkene and an easily functionalizable Z-trisubstituted alkenylboron group, are obtained in up to 89 per cent yield, with more than 98 per cent branch-selectivity and stereoselectivity and an enantiomeric ratio greater than 99:1. The copper-based catalyst is derived from a robust heterocyclic salt that can be prepared in multigram quantities from inexpensive starting materials and without costly purification procedures. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through enantioselective synthesis of gram quantities of two natural products, namely rottnestol and herboxidiene (also known as GEX1A)."
https://openalex.org/W2034227336,"Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are among the densest stellar systems in the universe. These systems have masses up to 200 million solar masses, but half light radii of just 3-50 parsecs. Dynamical mass estimates show that many UCDs are more massive than expected from their luminosity. It remains unclear whether these high dynamical mass estimates are due to the presence of supermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial mass function that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected. Here we present the detection of a supermassive black hole in a massive UCD. Adaptive optics kinematic data of M60-UCD1 show a central velocity dispersion peak above 100 km/s and modest rotation. Dynamical modeling of these data reveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with mass of 21 million solar masses. This is 15% of the object's total mass. The high black hole mass and mass fraction suggest that M60-UCD1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. Our analysis also shows that M60-UCD1's stellar mass is consistent with its luminosity, implying many other UCDs may also host supermassive black holes. This suggests a substantial population of previously unnoticed supermassive black holes."

Mammalian Xk-related (Xkr) protein 8, which is predicted to contain six transmembrane regions, and its Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CED-8 promote apoptotic PtdSer exposure. The mouse and human Xkr families consist of eight and nine members, respectively. Here, we found that mouse Xkr family members, with the exception of Xkr2, are localized to the plasma membrane. When Xkr8-deficient cells, which do not expose PtdSer during apoptosis, were transformed by Xkr family members, the transformants expressing Xkr4, Xkr8, or Xkr9 responded to apoptotic stimuli by exposing cell surface PtdSer and were efficiently engulfed by macrophages. Like Xkr8, Xkr4 and Xkr9 were found to possess a caspase recognition site in the C-terminal region and to require its direct cleavage by caspases for their function. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues conserved among CED-8, Xkr4, Xkr8, and Xkr9 identified several essential residues in the second transmembrane and second cytoplasmic regions. Real time PCR analysis indicated that unlike Xkr8, which is ubiquitously expressed, Xkr4 and Xkr9 expression is tissue-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2062347763,"The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth’s interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining. Patrice Rey and co-authors present a numerical model showing that, because Earth's early oceanic crust was probably thick and buoyant, early continents would have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading. They find that this spreading could initiate episodes of subduction at continental margins. Their model predicts the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons, as well as the petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle. They conclude that the slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining. Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics1,2, which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth’s interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present3, and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models4. Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant5, early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons6. Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith5 and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of a mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity7. The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth’s interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining."

Before 1995 our knowledge about exoplanets was mainly based on philosophical and theoretical considerations. The following years have been marked, instead, by surprising discoveries made possible by high-precision instruments. More recently the availability of new techniques moved the focus from detection to the characterization of exoplanets.

https://openalex.org/W1996995616,"The development and spread of mammary carcinomas require synergetic interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment through paracrine secretions, which are still not well defined. We have shown here that interleukin-6 (IL-6), either recombinant or secreted from highly invasive breast cancer cells, down-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p53 and activates breast stromal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. The formation of myofibroblasts requires p16(INK4A) down-regulation and the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Indeed, the transcription factor STAT3 positively controls the expression of the three major myofibroblast markers, SDF-1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and TGF-β1, and mediates IL-6-related down-regulation of p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p53 as well as the activation of stromal fibroblasts. Importantly, these effects were mediated through STAT3-dependent up-regulation of the mRNA-binding protein AUF1, whose promoter contains three canonical STAT3 binding sites. AUF1 binds the SDF-1, α-SMA, TGF-β1, and IL-6 mRNAs and reduces their turnover. Consequently, specific AUF1 down-regulation inhibits IL-6-dependent activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, whereas AUF1 ectopic expression of p37(AUF1) activated these cells and enhanced their paracrine induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells, which shows a non-cell-autonomous oncogenic function of AUF1. Together, these results demonstrate a major role of IL-6 in activating breast stromal fibroblasts through STAT3-dependent AUF1 induction."

The pathological hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies that consist mainly of post-translationally modified forms of α-synuclein. Whereas phosphorylation is one of the major modifications of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, sumoylation has recently been described. The interplay between α-synuclein phosphorylation and sumoylation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the interplay between these modifications as well as their impact on cell growth and inclusion formation in yeast. We found that α-synuclein is sumoylated in vivo at the same sites in yeast as in human cells. Impaired sumoylation resulted in reduced yeast growth combined with an increased number of cells with inclusions, suggesting that this modification plays a protective role. In addition, inhibition of sumoylation prevented autophagy-mediated aggregate clearance. A defect in α-synuclein sumoylation could be suppressed by serine 129 phosphorylation by the human G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) in yeast. Phosphorylation reduced foci formation, alleviated yeast growth inhibition, and partially rescued autophagic α-synuclein degradation along with the promotion of proteasomal degradation, resulting in aggregate clearance in the absence of a small ubiquitin-like modifier.

Among new compounds, BIHC was found to be the most cytotoxic agent against the HepG2 cell line while exhibiting less toxicity toward normal hepatocytes. Furthermore, BIHC inhibited the proliferation of various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Subsequently, using in silico target prediction, BIHC was predicted as a TNF blocker. Experimental validation was able to confirm this hypothesis, where BIHC could significantly inhibit the recombinant mouse TNF-α binding to its antibody with an IC50 of 16.5 µm. Furthermore, in silico docking suggested a binding mode of BIHC similar to a ligand known to disrupt the native, trimeric structure of TNF, and also validated with molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we have demonstrated the down-regulation of p65 phosphorylation and other NF-κB-regulated gene products upon BIHC treatment, and on the phenotypic level the compound shows inhibition of CXCL12-induced invasion of HepG2 cells.

Two variables in fatty acid binding can influence the product outcome. 1) Polyunsaturated fatty acids may have one or more pentadienes available for attack (for example, arachidonic acid (AA) has three chemically equivalent pentadienes), and a primary determinant of regiospecificity is which pentadiene in the double bond system aligns with the LOX catalytic iron (16.Kühn H. Sprecher H. Brash A.R. On singular or dual positional specificity of lipoxygenases. The number of chiral products varies with alignment of methylene groups at the active site of the enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16300-16305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The substrate can enter the active site either carboxyl (“head”) or hydrocarbon (“tail”) first (2.Brash A.R.

Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This determines which side of the selected pentadiene is accessible to the catalytic iron. In addition to the mode of fatty acid binding, the direction of oxygen attack across the face of the pentadiene determines the R or S chirality of the products (18.Coffa G. Brash A.R. A single active site residue directs oxygenation stereospecificity in lipoxygenases: stereocontrol is linked to the position of oxygenation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As an example, 8R and 12S products have the hydroperoxide moiety on the same side of the carbon chain and the 8S/12R-hydroperoxides are on the opposite side. Taken together, the fatty acid binding issues and direction of the reaction with O2 can “on paper” explain all the observed LOX-catalyzed specific oxygenations of AA. lipoxygenase(s) arachidonic acid hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Although clues to LOX-substrate recognition have emerged from a wealth of mechanistic chemistry, enzyme mutagenesis, inhibitor structure-activity relationships, and crystal structures of inhibitor complexes, what is missing is a melding of protein structural information with a detailed picture of substrate binding. The fundamental deterrent has been the difficulty in obtaining the crystal structure of an enzyme-substrate complex. Acting against the attempted crystallization of the enzyme-substrate complex are (i) LOX enzymes require no cofactor for the dioxygenase reaction and are therefore primed for instant activity, (ii) the ready oxidation of the resting state ferrous iron to the active ferric state by traces of peroxide, and (iii) the O2 co-substrate is ubiquitous under standard conditions of crystallography. Therefore, a combination of these factors has thwarted attempts to halt the one-turnover transformation that will metabolize a substrate molecule in the LOX active site. Crystals of an 8R-LOX from Plexaura homomalla, which generates 8R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid from AA, proved to be to sufficiently robust to survive the manipulations required to introduce the hydrophobic substrate at concentrations of AA and carrier that do not compromise diffraction quality, but are adequate for complex formation. Combined with the previously reported structures of the mammalian lipoxygenases with inhibitors, the model provides a robust framework for the design of isoform-specific inhibitors. Furthermore, mutagenesis and activity assays support the proposed model. Mutants were constructed in pseudo-wild-type 8R-LOX (1.Yamamoto S.

Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) by whole plasmid polymerase chain reaction using Pfu UltraII Hot Start polymerase (Agilent Technologies). Where possible, silent mutations were included in the primers for rapid identification of mutant plasmids. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Wizard system (Promega).

Single colonies were picked to grow overnight starter cultures in Luria Broth, 50 µg/ml ampicillin. The starter culture was then diluted 100× into 2× Yeast Tryptone and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, at which point the temperature was changed to 22 °C, and expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after 22 h, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were resuspended in B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with DnaseI, PMSF, leupeptin, and pepstatin, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sonicated at 5-s intervals and 50% power for 5 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was cleared with a 0.45-µm Millipore PES syringe filter, and applied on a Co-nitrilotriacetic acid column using AKTA FPLC. The 8R-LOX was eluted using a gradient of 20 mm to 200 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the prominent peak of the absorbance chromatogram were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) overnight with three buffer exchanges. The dialyzed protein was then purified further using a Mono-Q column and AKTA FPLC and a salt gradient of 0 to 500 mm NaCl. Most of 8R-LOX eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl. The purities of fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining; the fractions containing purest 8R-LOX were collected and concentrated to 5–15 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra centrifugal units. The kinetic measurements were performed on an Applied Photophysics Stopped Flow instrument SX.18MV, monitoring the increase in absorbance at 237 nm over time in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. The concentration of enzyme was 15 (native), 20 (R182A), or 200 nm (A589M and A620H). For each enzyme at least 10 AA (Cayman Chemical) concentrations, varying from 1–50 µm, were monitored. Initial rates were measured by fitting the average of four to five measurements of the initial linear region of absorbance change to a linear equation. Most of the variants were analyzed by using the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Vmax and Km values; however, the R182A mutant was analyzed by using the reciprocal plot and substrate inhibition steady state kinetics using the equation shown below. υ=Vmax1+Km[S]+[S]nKin(Eq. 1) Equation 1 has been used before to study other systems that involve cooperative substrate inhibition, and it was the model that gave the best fit to the experimental data (20.Dewal M.B.

Incubations were carried out in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, using 50 µm arachidonic acid (15 µg) added in 5 µl of ethanol. (10-ml incubations were carried out with the slowly reacting A589M and A620H mutants.) The samples were incubated at room temperature for 2–10 min, with the time depending on the rate of reaction observed by UV-235 nm. The incubations were extracted using a Waters 1-cc Oasis HLB cartridge and eluted with 1 ml of methanol. The extracts were treated with triphenylphosphine in methanol at room temperature for 30 min to reduce hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid to the corresponding hydroxtetraenoic acid (HETE). The samples were analyzed (and the individual HETEs collected) by SP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere 5µ silica column (250 × 4.6 mm) with a solvent system of hexane/isopropanol/glacial acetic acid (100:2:0.1, by volume) running at 1 ml/min, and the eluant was monitored with an Agilent 1100 diode array detector. The individual HETEs were then methylated with diazomethane, and the stereochemistry of the 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETE products was determined using a Chiralpak AD column (250 × 4.6 mm) with a solvent of hexane/methanol (100:2, v/v) running at 1 ml/min (24.Schneider C.

Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion with a well solution of 8% PEG-8000, 5% glycerol, 0.2 m CaCl2, 0.1 m imidazole acetate, pH 8.0. Crystals were then soaked overnight (∼17 h) in a solution of 25% glycerol, 10% PEG-8000, 0.02 m CaCl2, 0.1 m imidazole acetate, pH 8.0, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 mg/ml AA. The next morning, crystals were cooled in liquid nitrogen that was brought into the anaerobic chamber. During the cooling process, O2 levels rose to 55 ppm (due to O2 dissolved in the liquid nitrogen). Diffraction data from the soaked 8R-LOX crystals were collected with an ADSC Quantum 315 at the NE-CAT 24ID-E beamline located at the Advanced Photon Source. Two data sets were collected from a single crystal. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS (25.Kabsch W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), merged with XSCALE, and analyzed with POINTLESS (26.Evans P. Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr.

Iterative model building and refinement were run in PHENIX (28.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J.

Residues for the N-terminal His tag were modeled only where sufficient electron density warranted (one N-terminal His for chains A, B, and D and three N-terminal His for chain C). In addition, residues 307–315 were not modeled in any of the chains, along with residue 316 in chain A, residues 305 and 306 in chain B, and residue 306 in chain D, due to lack of electron density in those regions. Residue 600 was not modeled in chain B, also due to a lack of electron density. Arachidonate was modeled into electron density present in the active site of chain C. An omit map, calculated after three cycles of coordinate refinement of the model without AA, shows clear density for the substrate (Fig. 2C). Electron density in the active sites of the other monomers was suggestive of AA, but insufficient to model the ligand structure in these sites with confidence. The final Rfactor/Rfree was 16.21/21.45%. Data processing and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. Although the AA B-factor (39 Å2) is higher than the average protein B-factor (29 Å2), it is within the range of those of the neighboring amino acid side chains (21 to 46 Å2).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure 8R-LOX was determined to 2.0 Å resolution. Lipoxygenases are composed of an amino-terminal β-barrel domain and a largely α-helical catalytic domain, which is ∼80% of the polypeptide (6.Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. The three-dimensional structure of an arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase.Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and harbors the catalytic iron. Those enzymes that metabolize AA are roughly 650 amino acids in length. Although in general the placement of elements of secondary structure in lipoxygenases is conserved, helix α2, which helps define the active site, has been observed in two strikingly distinct orientations: it can be a long single α-helix that runs the length of the catalytic domain or a broken helix in which some side chains are inserted into the common active site to conceal it from bulk solvent. Helix α2 is one long helix in 8R-LOX and substrate can enter without invoking a major conformational change. The catalytic iron in 8R-LOX is positioned by three invariant His (384, 389, 570) side chains and the terminal main chain carboxylate of an invariant Ile (693). A large U-shaped cavity, in which Fe2+ sits at the base of the U, is observed in the structure of 8R-LOX in the absence of substrate (30.Neau D.B. Gilbert N.C. Bartlett S.G. Boeglin W. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. The 1.85 A structure of an 8R-lipoxygenase suggests a general model for lipoxygenase product specificity.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7906-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An arched helix, kinked by a distinct two-amino acid insertion in one helical turn (first described in detail by Minor et al. (31.Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B. Crystal structure of soybean lipoxygenase L-1 at 1.4 A resolution.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10687-10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)), covers this site and contributes one of several invariant leucines that line the proposed substrate binding pocket. In the structure of 8R-LOX with AA bound (Fig. 2, A and B) this “arched” helix (420–442) is displaced ever-so-slightly outwards (Cα-Cα distance = 1.3 Å for Ile-437) and the side chains of Leu-431 and Ile-437, which frame the insertion, are now ordered (Fig. 2, A and B). These amino acids make van der Waals contacts to secure the AA, Leu-431 with the central carbon of the pentadiene centered at C10. Ile-437 is positioned at the top of the “U” between the carboxyl head (C1) and C17 at the tail. These amino acids side chains fill the U from the side opposite of the catalytic iron, where just across from Leu-431 sits invariant Leu-627. Leu-627 and Leu-431 are equidistant from the substrate, and the two side chains appear to clamp the C10 pentadiene in place. The base of the U is positioned by invariant Leu-385 on one side, and the iron and His-384 and His-389 on the other. Leu-385 and the catalytic iron cradle the base of the U (Fig. 2C). Pocket depth, which allows the tail to slide in so that C10 is attacked, appears to be conferred by Ala-620, which with Ala-589 makes for a very a deep cavity. Leu-381 and Val-428 define the wall of the cavity at C15, and the polar and charged amino acids Gln-380 and Asp-424 (highly conserved) flank the cluster of histidines that hold the iron in place. In the absence of AA, Tyr-181 and Arg-182 of helix α2 participate in an interhelical charge cluster with Glu-430 of the arched helix. In the AA-bound structure, the AA carboxylate expands this charge network with only the slight shift in the arched helix described above and the reorientation of the side chain of Glu-430 to allow Arg-182 to interact with the substrate carboxylate as well as Glu-430. Apparent in the crystal structure is a tubular opening that leads to the U-shaped site. It sits on the face of the AA opposite the Fe and is thus positioned to allow molecular oxygen to access the pentadiene. This tubular cavity abuts the shallower side of the U, where C8 of AA sits. Proximal to the substrate it is defined by Gly-427. Access to the pentadiene from the iron side is blocked not only by the residues that position the iron but also by Ile-427, which is invariant. Thus, the substrate-binding site is formed largely by invariant amino acids, and these amino acids are positioned around the pentadiene that is adjacent to the catalytic iron. The depth of the cavity is set by residues 620 and 589, and the cavity entrance is defined by amino acids from α2. Site-directed mutants were prepared to test the structural interpretation. Arg-182, which appears to charge pair with the substrate carboxylate, was mutated to Ala. Ala-589 and Ala-620, positioned deep in the cavity to allow the AA tail slide into the enzyme active site to position C10 at the catalytic site, were mutated to methionine and histidine, respectively, to introduce bulk and charge at the putative hydrocarbon end of the active site. Whereas the mutation of R182A had only a modest impact on product specificity (Table 2), the kinetic properties of the enzyme were dramatically different from that of the wild type enzyme, as this mutant displayed striking substrate inhibition (Fig. 2D). In contrast, mutations deep in the cavity lead to 11R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid as the primary product, a product consistent with a shallower site. To generate the 11R-product, C13, rather than C10, must be at the catalytic center.TABLE 2The impact of 8R-LOX mutations on the enzyme product profile and kinetic parametersEnzyme/Product% of products% R:SKmkcatkcat/KmFold changeKiµms−1µm8R-LOX8-HETE97.999:130 ± 7210 ± 236.9 ± 1.7112-HETE2.1NDR182A8-HETE88.898:267 ± 11193 ± 8.72.9 ± 0.50.4213 ± 212-HETE4.6ND11-HETE2.9ND15-HETE3.7NDA589M8-HETE2192:859 ± 1932 ± 60.54 ± 0.230.07912-HETE531:6911-HETE6494:615-HETE109:91A620H8-HETE2081:1858 ± 223.2 ± 0.80.055 ± 0.0290.00812-HETE1246:5411-HETE6292:815-HETE632:68 Open table in a new tab The steady state kinetic parameters for wild type 8R-LOX and the single amino acid substitution variants are shown in Table 2. The kcat for A620H is <2% of that for 8R-LOX, whereas the kcat for A589M is reduced to ∼15%. The R182A mutant displays conspicuous substrate inhibition for the reaction with AA. The rate versus substrate concentration plots of R182A and the wild type are shown in Fig. 2D, along with the curve fit for Michaelis-Menten and substrate inhibition kinetics. Prior to fitting the data to the substrate inhibition model, the Km of R182A was first determined by the double reciprocal plot of 1/νo versus 1/[S] as described (32.Lineweaver H. Burk D. The determination of enzyme dissociation constants.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8010) Google Scholar) and fitting a linear line to the data at intermediate substrate concentrations. The Km determined from the double reciprocal plot was then used as a constant in fitting the substrate inhibition curve using Equation 1. The LOX reaction proceeds with the abstraction of hydrogen from the sp3 carbon of a pentadiene via a water molecule that fills the metal coordination sphere. The resulting free radical is delocalized along the pentadiene, and oxygenation occurs at the carbon ±2 from the site of attack. Hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation occur on opposite faces of the substrate, and the structural basis for this relationship is clearly elucidated in the structure of 8R-LOX with AA. The substrate fills a U-shaped cavity, and at the base of the U, the catalytic iron is positioned by the side chains of conserved amino acids. Of the 16 amino acids that define this cavity and make contacts with the AA six are invariant: two His (384, 389) that also bind the iron, three Leu (385, 431, 627), and an Ile (627). All of these amino acids are positioned to envelope the pentadiene centered at C10 for attack. AA enters 8R-LOX tail first and slides deep into the active site, which is exceptionally deep when compared with that described for other LOX structures due to an Ala at position 620 as compared with Met, His, Val, or Gln in other LOX structures (Table 3).

https://openalex.org/W903662490,"The Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) plays an important role in regulating many neuronal functions, including excitability, axonal growth, synaptogenesis, and neuronal survival. NFAT can be activated by action potential firing or depolarization that leads to Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT and its translocation to the nucleus. Recent data suggest that NFAT and NFAT-dependent functions in neurons can also be potently regulated by NGF and other neurotrophins. However, the mechanisms of NFAT regulation by neurotrophins are not well understood. Here, we show that in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, NGF markedly facilitates NFAT-mediated gene expression induced by mild depolarization. The effects of NGF were not associated with changes in [Ca2+]i and were independent of phospholipase C activity. Instead, the facilitatory effect of NGF depended on activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of the TrkA receptor and on inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a protein kinase known to phosphorylate NFAT and promote its nuclear export. Knockdown or knockout of NFATc3 eliminated this facilitatory effect. Simultaneous monitoring of EGFP-NFATc3 nuclear translocation and [Ca2+]i changes in dorsal root ganglion neurons indicated that NGF slowed the rate of NFATc3 nuclear export but did not affect its nuclear import rate. Collectively, our data suggest that NGF facilitates depolarization-induced NFAT activation by stimulating PI3K/Akt signaling, inactivating GSK3β, and thereby slowing NFATc3 export from the nucleus. We propose that NFAT serves as an integrator of neurotrophin action and depolarization-driven calcium signaling to regulate neuronal gene expression.

Thus, NFAT-mediated transcriptional responses are determined by the balance between the activities of the Ca2+/CaN pathways driving nuclear import of NFAT and the NFAT kinases stimulating NFAT export from the nucleus. Recent studies have demonstrated that not only electrical activity and intracellular Ca2+, but also neurotrophins, in particular nerve growth factor (NGF), potently regulate NFAT function in neurons (4.Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R.

For example, NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulate NFAT-dependent expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1, BDNF, cyclooxygenase-2, and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 in peripheral and central neurons (15.Groth R.D.

BDNF-dependent survival of adult hippocampal neurons and the formation of spatial memory have also been reported to require NFAT activation (13.Quadrato G. Benevento M. Alber S. Jacob C. Floriddia E.M. Nguyen T. Elnaggar M.Y. Pedroarena C.M. Molkentin J.D. Di Giovanni S. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc4) is required for BDNF-dependent survival of adult-born neurons and spatial memory formation in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E1499-E1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NFAT is essential for NGF-dependent axonal growth, and deletion of NFAT isoforms NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4 disrupts neurite outgrowth (4.Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R. Neurotrophins and netrins require calcineurin/NFAT signaling to stimulate outgrowth of embryonic axons.Cell. 2003; 113: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Despite the growing evidence that NFAT proteins are important effectors of neurotrophin signaling, the mechanisms of NFAT regulation by neurotrophins are not well understood. It is also unclear whether and how electrical activity and neurotrophin signaling interact to regulate NFAT activity. Here, by using genetic and pharmacological tools, we demonstrate that NGF facilitates depolarization-induced activation of NFAT in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Although Ca2+ is a critical regulator of NFAT, NGF had no significant effect on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in DRG neurons, and the potentiating actions of NGF were independent of phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Instead, the NGF potentiation of NFAT activation required the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and inhibition of the NFAT kinase, GSK3β. Furthermore, the silencing or deletion of specifically the NFATc3 isoform abolished the potentiating effect of NGF on NFAT-mediated transcription, implicating NFATc3 as a key NGF effector in sensory neurons. Cultured DRG neurons were prepared as described previously (7.Kim M.S. Usachev Y.M. Mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling facilitates activation of the transcription factor NFAT in sensory neurons.J.

Briefly, newborn (postnatal day 1–2) Sprague-Dawley rats or adult (2–4-month-old) wild-type and NFATc3 knock-out mice (BALB/c background) were sacrificed, and DRG were isolated from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments. Suspensions of DRG neurons were plated onto 25-mm glass coverslips precoated with poly-l-ornithine and laminin. Approximately 30 min after the cells were plated, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 g/ml) was added to the plates (hereafter referred to as complete DMEM). The DRG neurons were maintained in culture in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and were used within 2–3 days. All surgical protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), and NFATc3 knock-out mice were generously provided by Dr. Santana (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (31.Rossow C.F.

Typically, five rat pups or three mice were required to obtain a sufficient number of cells for performing a single transfection. EGFP-NFATc3 was generated by ligating NFATc3 (gift of Dr. Iino, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science) (34.Tomida T. Hirose K. Takizawa A. Shibasaki F. Iino M.

A constitutively active form of the catalytic subunit PI3Kα (caPI3K; p110 mutant (35.Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T.

The shRNA constructs targeting NFATc3, NFATc4, and GSK3β were kindly provided by Dr. Michal Hetman (University of Kentucky) (12.Vashishta A. Habas A. Pruunsild P. Zheng J.J. Timmusk T. Hetman M.

NFAT reporter expression was assessed using a Dual-Luciferase assay as described previously (7.Kim M.S. Usachev Y.M.

Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37594-37609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, DRG neurons were co-transfected with the NFAT-luciferase (NFAT-luc) reporter plasmid (which encodes firefly luciferase under the control of three copies of the NFAT-binding motif; pNFAT-TA-luciferase; Clontech) and the Renilla reniformis luciferase (TK-luc) reporter (which encodes Renilla luciferase under the control of constitutively active HSV-TK promoter; pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI). In some experiments, the investigated signaling pathways were modulated by co-transfecting GSK3β S9A or caPI3K with the luciferase reporter constructs. Initially, transfected cells were cultured in complete DMEM containing 25 ng/ml NGF (50 ng/ml in the case of mouse DRG cultures). Approximately 20 h later, the culture medium was replaced with fresh complete DMEM supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and ITS-A (Invitrogen) but devoid of NGF. Twenty-four hours later, the cultured DRG neurons were stimulated with 20 mm KCl medium (15 mm KCl for mouse cultures), which was prepared by mixing complete DMEM with 150 mm KCl stock solution. The L-type Ca2+ channel agonist BayK8644 (1 µm) was added to the 20 mm (15 mm) KCl medium to stabilize [Ca2+]i at the elevated levels for the duration of stimulation (7.Kim M.S. Usachev Y.M. Mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling facilitates activation of the transcription factor NFAT in sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12101-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some cultured DRG plates, the KCl medium was supplemented with 25 ng/ml NGF (50 ng/ml for mouse DRG cultures). The cultured DRG neurons were stimulated with 20 mm (15 mm) KCl medium for either 6 or 12 h. In the case of the 6-h KCl stimulation protocol, cells were cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with B27 and ITS-A for an additional 6 h in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml NGF (50 ng/ml NGF for mouse DRG cultures). All chemical inhibitors were applied at least 30 min prior to stimulation with 20 mm KCl. Twelve hours after the beginning of KCl stimulation, cells were lysed, and Dual-Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (DLRTM Assay System, Promega) using a Sirius luminometer (Berthold, Spain). NFAT-mediated transcription was quantified by normalizing the expression of NFAT-luciferase to that of constitutively active TK-luc (NFAT-luc/TK-luc). This approach minimizes variations in transfection efficiency and neuronal viability among various DRG cultures and culture conditions used in this study. Control and NGF-treated (25 ng/ml) DRG cultures were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors (HaltTM protease inhibitor mixture kit, Pierce) and phosphatase inhibitors (HaltTM phosphatase inhibitor mixture, Pierce). Loading volumes for SDS-polyacrylamide gels were calculated based on BCA assays (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) measuring the protein concentration in lysate. Lysates were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled at 90 °C for 10 min to completely denature the proteins. Samples were loaded onto 8–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and run at constant voltage (100 V) for 2–3 h in a chamber that contained running buffer (3.0 g of Tris-HCl, 14.3 g of glycine, and 1 g of SDS dissolved in 1000 ml of H2O). Proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using transfer buffer (1.5 g of Tris-HCl, 7.2 g of glycine, and 150 ml of MeOH dissolved in 1000 ml of H2O). Then the membrane was incubated with a blocking solution composed of 5% skim milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h and then washed briefly with TBS prior to incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-Ser(P)-9 GSK3β (1:10,000; catalog no. ab30619, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) dissolved in 5% skim milk in TBS-T (0.05% Tween 20 in TBS) for 2 h.

CyaA is able to invade eukaryotic target cells in which it produces high levels of cAMP, thus altering the cellular physiology. Although CyaA has been extensively studied by various cellular and molecular approaches, the structural and functional states of the toxin remain poorly characterized. Indeed, CyaA is a large protein and exhibits a pronounced hydrophobic character, making it prone to aggregation into multimeric forms. As a result, CyaA has usually been extracted and stored in denaturing conditions. Here, we define the experimental conditions allowing CyaA folding into a monomeric and functional species. We found that CyaA forms mainly multimers when refolded by dialysis, dilution, or buffer exchange. However, a significant fraction of monomeric, folded protein could be obtained by exploiting molecular confinement on size exclusion chromatography. Folding of CyaA into a monomeric form was found to be critically dependent upon the presence of calcium and post-translational acylation of the protein. We further show that the monomeric preparation displayed hemolytic and cytotoxic activities suggesting that the monomer is the genuine, physiologically active form of the toxin.

CyaA plays an important role in the early stages of respiratory tract colonization by B. pertussis. CyaA is able to invade eukaryotic target cells, where it is activated by an endogenous protein, calmodulin (CaM), 4The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinACDATP-cyclizing, CaM-activated, catalytic domainRDcell receptor-binding domainANS1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonateSECsize exclusion chromatographyTDAtetra detector arrayRHhydrodynamic radiusT1SStype I secretion machinery. and produces high levels of cAMP that, in turn, alters the cellular physiology. calmodulin ATP-cyclizing, CaM-activated, catalytic domain cell receptor-binding domain 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate size exclusion chromatography tetra detector array hydrodynamic radius type I secretion machinery. CyaA is a 1706-residue long protein organized in a modular fashion (Fig. 1A). The ATP-cyclizing, CaM-activated, catalytic domain (ACD) is located in the 400 N-terminal residues (4Glaser P. Ladant D.

Both activities can function independently as adenylate cyclase and hemolysin, respectively. Several domains can be identified in the C-terminal region. The so-called translocation region, spanning residues 400–500, is crucial for the translocation of ACD across the plasma membrane (8Karst J.C. Barker R. Devi U. Swann M.J. Davi M. Roser S.J.

The hydrophobic region, spanning residues 500–750, contains several hydrophobic segments predicted to adopt α-helical structures.

The C-terminal part of CyaA is the cell receptor-binding domain (RD; residues 1000–1706). This domain consists of ∼40 copies of a calcium-binding, glycine- and aspartate-rich nonapeptide repeat that is characteristic of a large family of bacterial cytolysins known as RTX (repeat-in-toxin) toxins (14Welch R.A.

Once secreted, CyaA binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the CD11b/CD18 integrin expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, that are the primary targets of this toxin in vivo (31Guermonprez P.

One of the main originalities of CyaA, with respect to other bacterial or plant toxins, stems from its unique mechanism of penetration into eukaryotic cells; CyaA is the only known toxin able to translocate its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of the target cells, from the extracellular side into the cytosol (36Gordon V.M.

The molecular mechanism by which CyaA enters the target cells remains, however, largely unknown. It is believed that after binding of RD to the CD11b/CD18 receptor, the hydrophobic regions of CyaA may insert into the plasma membrane of the target cells. The catalytic domain is then delivered through the plasma membrane, possibly through a transient and local destabilization of the membrane integrity (8Karst J.C. Barker R. Devi U. Swann M.J. Davi M.

We found that CyaA, when refolded by dialysis, dilution, or buffer exchange, mainly produced multimers, as reported earlier (37Rogel A. Schultz J.E. Brownlie R.M. Coote J.G. Parton R. Hanski E.

However, by exploiting molecular confinement on size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we were able to obtain a monomeric form of CyaA that was stable in buffer without urea. Noticeably, this monomeric form exhibited much higher hemolytic and cell-invasive activities than the multimeric ones. CyaA refolding into the monomeric state was critically dependent upon the presence of calcium and the post-translational acylation. The structural role of both calcium and acyl chains in CyaA folding demonstrated here may possibly apply to other RTX cytolysins that are activated by selective acylation and are dependent upon calcium for their cytolytic activities. CyaA was produced and purified from inclusion bodies as described previously (53Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D.

Briefly, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in about 50 ml of 20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea, pH 7.4, by overnight solubilization under constant stirring with a magnet at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.14 m NaCl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 75 ml of Q-Sepharose resin equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 7.4. The resin, retaining the CyaA protein, was then loaded onto a column, and contaminants were washed out. After an extensive wash with the same buffer, the CyaA protein was eluted in 20 mm Hepes, 500 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 7.4. The eluate was then diluted in 20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea to decrease salt down to 140 mm NaCl and loaded onto a second Q-Sepharose column (50 ml). Washing and elution were performed in the same conditions as described above with the first Q-Sepharose column. This last step further removed contaminants and concentrated the CyaA protein. Proteins eluted from the second Q-Sepharose column were diluted 5 times with 20 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and applied onto a 70-ml phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Resin was washed with 20 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, with 20 mm Hepes, and then with 50% isopropyl alcohol. The isopropyl alcohol washing step allowed the removal of many contaminants and LPS. After an extensive wash with 20 mm Hepes, the toxin was eluted with Hepes 20 mm, urea 8 m. The eluate was finally loaded onto a Sephacryl S-500 column (GE Healthcare, HIPREP 26/60) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea. CyaA was then concentrated by ultrafiltration to 1–2 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea.

https://openalex.org/W2086184883,"The littoral forest on sandy soil is among the most threatened habitats in Madagascar and, as such, it represents a hot-spot within a conservation hot-spot. Assessing the health of the resident lemur fauna is not only critical for the long-term viability of these populations, but also necessary for the future re-habilitation of this unique habitat. Since the Endangered collared brown lemur, Eulemur collaris, is the largest seed disperser of the Malagasy south-eastern littoral forest its survival in this habitat is crucial. In this study we compared fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels, a measure of physiological stress and potential early indicator of population health, between groups of collared brown lemurs living in a degraded forest fragment and groups occurring in a more preserved area. For this, we analysed 279 fecal samples collected year-round from 4 groups of collared brown lemurs using a validated 11-oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay and tested if fGCM levels were influenced by reproductive stages, phenological seasons, sex, and habitat degradation. The lemurs living in the degraded forest had significantly higher fGCM levels than those living in the more preserved area. In particular, the highest fGCM levels were found during the mating season in all animals and in females during gestation in the degraded forest. Since mating and gestation are both occurring during the lean season in the littoral forest, these results likely reflect a combination of ecological and reproductive pressures. Our findings provide a clear indication that habitat degradation has additive effects to the challenges found in the natural habitat. Since increased stress hormone output may have long-term negative effects on population health and reproduction, our data emphasize the need for and may add to the development of effective conservation plans for the species."
https://openalex.org/W2011944093,"Therapeutic hypothermia is commonly used to improve neurological outcomes in patients after cardiac arrest. However, therapeutic hypothermia increases sepsis risk and unintentional hypothermia in surgical patients increases infectious complications. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms by which hypothermia dysregulates innate immunity are incompletely understood. We found that exposure of human monocytes to cold (32°C) potentiated LPS-induced production of TNF and IL-6, while blunting IL-10 production. This dysregulation was associated with increased expression of microRNA-155 (miR-155), which potentiates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by negatively regulating Ship1 and Socs1. Indeed, Ship1 and Socs1 were suppressed at 32°C and miR-155 antagomirs increased Ship1 and Socs1 and reversed the alterations in cytokine production in cold-exposed monocytes. In contrast, miR-155 mimics phenocopied the effects of cold exposure, reducing Ship1 and Socs1 and altering TNF and IL-10 production. In a murine model of LPS-induced peritonitis, cold exposure potentiated hypothermia and decreased survival (10 vs. 50%; P < 0.05), effects that were associated with increased miR-155, suppression of Ship1 and Socs1, and alterations in TNF and IL-10. Importantly, miR-155-deficiency reduced hypothermia and improved survival (78 vs. 32%, P < 0.05), which was associated with increased Ship1, Socs1, and IL-10. These results establish a causal role of miR-155 in the dysregulation of the inflammatory response to hypothermia.— Billeter, A. T., Hellmann, J., Roberts, H., Druen, D., Gardner, S.

Collectively, the MTases can methylate a wide range of substrates, from simple oxidized arsenic or chloride ions to complex macromolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Thayer J.S. Review: biological methylation of less-studied elements.Appl. Organomet. Chem. 2002; 16: 677-691Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Methylation of proteins typically occurs on lysine or arginine residues; however, several other amino acids, such as histidine, aspartate, glutamate, or glutamine, can also be methylated (3Nyman T.

Lysine can be modified on its ϵ-amino group with either one, two, or three methyl groups, the addition of which decreases the number of potential hydrogen bonds and increases the bulk of the residue yet leaves the overall positive charge unaffected.

However, little progress has been made in understanding the functional significance of these modifications or in identifying the responsible MTases. For example, in the span of 3 decades since the first reports of lysine methylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), only two MTases acting on eEF1A lysines have been recently identified in yeast, still leaving several methylated lysine residues without a known MTase (15Hiatt W.R.

Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a GTPase that catalyzes the translocation of the nascent protein chain from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome, an essential function of every cell. It is highly conserved throughout Eukarya and also has a functional homologue, elongation factor G (EF-G) in prokaryotes. From yeast to humans, eEF2 is subject to several known post-translational modifications that regulate or adjust its activity, such as the inactivating threonine phosphorylation by an eEF2-specific kinase (19Ryazanov A.G.

Phosphorylated EF-2 is unable to catalyze translocation.FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or the constitutive formation of a unique diphthamide residue through sequential modifications of a histidine residue (for a review, see Ref. 20Su X. Lin Z. Lin H. The biosynthesis and biological function of diphthamide.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Diphthamide is the target of several bacterial toxins that inactivate eEF2 via ADP-ribosylation, halting protein translation and resulting in cell death (21Oppenheimer N.J. Bodley J.W.

Protein synthesis is a highly energy-consuming process, and the post-translational modification of eEF2 serves as one of the main mechanisms for regulating protein synthesis at the level of elongation, which is crucial for cell survival during stress (23Kaul G.

Here we describe a novel modification of eEF2, the trimethylation of a conserved lysine residue (Lys-525 in human/Lys-509 in yeast sequence), which appears to occur throughout the evolutionary tree in humans, rabbits, and rats and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase FAM86A and its yeast homologue Yjr129c to be the enzymes catalyzing the corresponding methylation reaction. In addition, knockout of the YJR129C gene in S. cerevisiae cells abolishes eEF2 methylation, proving that Yjr129c is the sole enzyme responsible for this methylation in yeast. Interestingly, lack of eEF2 methylation increases the sensitivity of the yeast toward sordarin, a translation inhibitor that directly targets fungal eEF2; it also increases the occurrence of −1 ribosomal frameshifting events, indicating that lysine methylation is required for optimal eEF2 function. ORFs were amplified with Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The primers were designed to generate PCR products flanked by restriction sites appropriate for T4 DNA ligase-mediated insertion into the vectors. The vectors used were pET28a (Novagen), pYES260 (obtained from EUROSCARF), pNTAPa (Agilent Technologies), and pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). In addition, to create the pcDNA5/FRT/TO_TAP-FAM86A constructs, two rounds of PCRs were performed, first amplifying the calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) and streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) containing tag (tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag), containing the first 15 nucleotides of FAM86A at the 3′-end, and FAM86A, containing the last 15 nucleotides of the SBP tag at the 5′-end. These products were then mixed and used as template to amplify TAP-FAM86A with the flanking primers with appropriate restriction sites. Mutagenesis was performed using the PrimerX program to design the mutagenic primers and the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein-protein Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) was used for identification of proteins homologous to human FAM86 and eEF2 proteins (25McGinnis S.

Wild-type (WT) BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0) and yjr129cΔ mutant JEY9581 (MAT α; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; yjr129c::kanMX4) strains were acquired from Euroscarf. The isogenic strain JEY10800 (Mat α; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; yjr129c::URA3), which was used to test for paromomycin sensitivity and to confirm sordarin sensitivity, was made by transforming BY4742 with a PCR product consisting of the URA3 cassette flanked by regions of homology toward YJR129C (primer sequences: GAATGAAGATCTATTCTACGATAGATTACATCAGCGGTGCCCTGGAAAATACGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGC and GTTTCGTGATCTTGTAGATCCGTATGGGTGCAATCAAAGGTTTGAATTGCAGGGCCTGGAACAACACTCAACCCTATC). Deletion of YJR129C was confirmed by PCR. Yeast cells were grown in either YPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or synthetic defined medium containing yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), appropriate amino acid dropout mix (Clontech), and 2% glucose. Temperature sensitivity and sensitivity to drugs were assayed by growing the yeast cultures to the same A600 in YPD and then spotting 200 µl of 10-fold serial dilutions onto YPD plates, containing either no drug or one of the following: anisomycin (MP Biomedicals), cycloheximide (Biovision), hygromycin (Invitrogen), nourseothricin (Werner Bioagents), paromomycin sulfate salt (Sigma-Aldrich), rapamycin (Cayman Chemical), or sordarin sodium salt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The plates were incubated at 25, 30, and/or 37 °C for 2–4 days. To assay the sensitivity to sordarin in liquid culture, the yeast strains were grown to an A600 of 0.22 in YPD at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm, at which point sordarin was added, and the cultures were allowed to grow further at either 30 or 37 °C; A600 of the cultures was measured at the indicated time points. 2 µg of recombinant His6-eEF2 proteins or 50 µg of yeast or HEK293 protein extracts were diluted in MTase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) and treated with 10–100 pmol of His6-FAM86A or His6-Yjr129c enzymes in the presence of either 0.5–1 µCi of [3H]AdoMet (for fluorography) or 1 mm cold AdoMet (for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by transfer to ice and the addition of NuPAGE gel loading buffer (Invitrogen). Products of the reaction were resolved on SDS-PAGE and either 1) stained with Coomassie Blue and the band of interest excised for MS analysis or 2) transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon), which was subsequently dried, sprayed with En3Hance spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MS film (Sigma-Aldrich) at −80 °C. Flp-InTM T-RExTM-293 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, and then 20 µm AdOx was added, and cells were grown for an additional 18–24 h. Cells were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen at −20 °C until further use. To lyse the Flp-InTM T-RExTM-293 cells, 50 mg of wet cell pellet were resuspended in 200 µl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1× Complete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min at 4 °C and then sonicated. To lyse rat tissues, the tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and crushed with a mortar and pestle in lysis buffer. To lyse yeast cells, the cultures were harvested at an A600 of 1.0 and lysed in lysis buffer, with 150 mm NaCl and without Triton X-100, by vortexing with glass beads. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. Relative protein concentrations of the lysates were determined with the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). For methylation site identification, eEF2 from yeast lysates was partially purified first on cation exchange (S-column) and then on anion exchange (Q-column) as described (30Jørgensen R. Carr-Schmid A. Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Purification and crystallization of the yeast elongation factor eEF2.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To partially purify eEF2 from mammalian lysates, an aliquot of cell lysate (1–2 mg of total protein content) was diluted using dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) to adjust NaCl concentration to 33 mm. Diluted cell lysate was loaded onto a Q-column equilibrated in dilution buffer. Material bound to the column was eluted using dilution buffer with a step gradient of increasing NaCl concentrations. Typically, four 100-µl fractions were collected: 0.15Q (between 0.033 and 0.15 m NaCl), eEF2-containing fraction 0.3Q (0.15–0.3 m NaCl), 0.5Q (0.3–0.5 m NaCl), and 0.75Q (0.5–0.75 m NaCl). Reverse phase (C18) nano-online liquid chromatographic MS/MS analysis of proteolytic peptides was performed using a system consisting of two Agilent 1200 HPLC binary pumps (nano and capillary) with autosampler, column heater, and integrated switching valve. This LC system was coupled via a nano-electrospray ion source to a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In-gel proteolytic digestion was performed with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) or AspN (Roche Applied Science). For the analyses, 5 µl of peptide solution was injected into the 5 × 0.3-mm extraction column filled with Zorbax 300 SB-C18 of 5-µm (diameter) particle size (Agilent). Samples were washed with mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 3% acetonitrile in water). The flow rate was 10 µl/min provided by the capillary pump. After 7 min, the integrated switching valve was activated, and peptides were eluted in the back-flush mode from the extraction column onto a 150 × 0.075-mm C18, 3-µm resin column (GlycproSIL C18–80Å, Glycpromass, Stove, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and MS grade water, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary gradient from 5 to 55% of acetonitrile in water in 60 min. The flow rate was 0.2 µl/min provided by the nanoflow pump. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode, applying a data-dependent automatic switch between survey scan and tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) acquisition. Peptide samples were analyzed with a collision-induced dissociation fragmentation method, acquiring one Orbitrap survey scan in the mass range of m/z 200–2000 followed by MS/MS of the six most intense ions in the Orbitrap. The target value in the LTQ-Orbitrap was 1,000,000 for survey scan at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400, using lock masses for recalibration to improve the mass accuracy of precursor ions. MS data were analyzed with the in-house maintained human, rat, and yeast protein sequence database and a database containing eEF2 protein sequence using SEQUESTTM. The mass tolerances of a fragment ion and a parent ion were set as 0.5 Da and 10 ppm, respectively. Methionine oxidation and cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a variable modification. A false discovery rate of 0.01 was required for proteins and peptides with a minimum length of 6 amino acids. eEF2 un-, mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptide MS spectra were manually searched by Qual Browser (version 2.0.7). For the expression of His6-tagged methyltransferases, pET28a_FAM86A and pET28a_YJR129C constructs were transfected into the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL expression strain (Agilent). Cells were cultured with appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C and shaking at 250 rpm until they reached A600 of 0.6. The temperature was then reduced to 16 °C, and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 100 µm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to proceed for 16 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 30 mm imidazole, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 units/ml Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 30 min on ice and sonicated. The resultant lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and recombinant proteins were allowed to bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 16 h. The resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 30 mm imidazole, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and His6-tagged proteins were eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. Eluates were buffer-exchanged to storage buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 1 mm DTT) by sequential concentration and dilution using Vivaspin 20 ultrafiltration columns with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa (Sartorius AG). Proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For the expression of His6-tagged S. cerevisiae eEF2 proteins, pYES260 constructs were transformed into competent yjr129cΔ BY4742 yeast using the LiAc/SS carrier method (31Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Frozen competent yeast cells that can be transformed with high efficiency using the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on SD −Ura plates. The cells were cultured at 30 °C and shaking at 250 rpm; recombinant protein expression was induced at A600 of 0.6 by changing from YPD medium to YPG (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose); and the cells were further cultured overnight. The cultures were then pelleted; lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm DTT) by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma); and cleared by centrifugation. The resulting lysates were allowed to bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT), and the His6-tagged proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluates were then buffer-exchanged to storage buffer as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). To measure in vivo [35S]methionine incorporation, yeast strains were grown in 20 ml of liquid YPD medium at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.3 and then switched to SD −Met/−Cys medium and grown"

https://openalex.org/W2147335382,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression in embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation. In ESCs, lncRNAs are regulated at the genetic level via transcription factor binding to lncRNA gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the key cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2 controls lncRNA expression in mammary stem cells. By profiling lncRNAs in wild-type and NRF2 knockdown mammary stem cells, we demonstrate that the lncRNA ROR, a regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, is overexpressed upon NRF2 knockdown. We performed promoter analyses and examined predicted NRF2 binding elements in the ROR promoter using luciferase reporter constructs of a ROR promoter deletion series. Our studies revealed that NRF2 binds to two specific NRF2 response elements flanking the ROR promoter and that these two NRF2 response elements are equally important to suppress ROR transcription. In addition, we identified associated H3K27me3 chromatin modification and EZH2 binding at the ROR promoter that was dependent on NRF2 binding. We observed that NRF2 knockdown or ROR overexpression leads to increased stem cell self-renewal in mammary stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate Nrf2 regulation of the mammary stem cell population in vivo. These observations provide further evidence for the critical role of NRF2 in maintaining normal stem cell subpopulations in mammary epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1987687846,"Many diverse myosin classes can be expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell expression system, whereas others have been recalcitrant. We hypothesized that most myosins utilize Sf9 cell chaperones, but others require an organism-specific co-chaperone. TgMyoA, a class XIVa myosin from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is required for the parasite to efficiently move and invade host cells. The T. gondii genome contains one UCS family myosin co-chaperone (TgUNC). TgMyoA expressed in Sf9 cells was soluble and functional only if the heavy and light chain(s) were co-expressed with TgUNC. The tetratricopeptide repeat domain of TgUNC was not essential to obtain functional myosin, implying that there are other mechanisms to recruit Hsp90. Purified TgMyoA heavy chain complexed with its regulatory light chain (TgMLC1) moved actin in a motility assay at a speed of ∼1.5 μm/s. When a putative essential light chain (TgELC1) was also bound, TgMyoA moved actin at more than twice that speed (∼3.4 μm/s). This result implies that two light chains bind to and stabilize the lever arm, the domain that amplifies small motions at the active site into the larger motions that propel actin at fast speeds. Our results show that the TgMyoA domain structure is more similar to other myosins than previously appreciated and provide a molecular explanation for how it moves actin at fast speeds. The ability to express milligram quantities of a class XIV myosin in a heterologous system paves the way for detailed structure-function analysis of TgMyoA and identification of small molecule inhibitors."

Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are well-characterized I-type lectins, which control apoptosis.We characterized the expression of Siglec-7 in human platelets isolated from healthy volunteers using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Siglec-7 is primarily expressed on α granular membranes and colocalized with CD62P. Siglec-7 expression was increased upon platelet activation and correlated closely with CD62P expression. Cross-linking Siglec-7 with its ligand, ganglioside, resulted in platelet apoptosis without any significant effects on activation, aggregation, cell morphology by electron microscopy analysis or secretion. We show that ganglioside triggered four key pathways leading to apoptosis in human platelets: (i) mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarization; (ii) elevated expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein; (iii) phosphatidylserine exposure and (iv), microparticle formation. Inhibition of NAPDH oxidase, PI3K, or PKC rescued platelets from apoptosis induced by Siglec-7 recruitment, suggesting that the platelet receptors P2Y1 and GPIIbIIIa are essential for ganglioside-induced platelet apoptosis.The present work characterizes the role of Siglec-7 and platelet receptors in regulating apoptosis and death. Because some platelet pathology involves apoptosis (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and possibly storage lesions), Siglec-7 might be a molecular target for therapeutic intervention/prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2013190667,"Three of the four kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I, II, and IV) that synthesize kynurenic acid, a neuromodulator, are identical to glutamine transaminase K (GTK), α-aminoadipate aminotransferase, and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, respectively. GTK/KAT I and aspartate aminotransferase/KAT IV possess cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase activity. The gene for the former enzyme, GTK/KAT I, is listed in mammalian genome data banks as CCBL1 (cysteine conjugate beta-lyase 1). Also listed, despite the fact that no β-lyase activity has been assigned to the encoded protein in the genome data bank, is a CCBL2 (synonym KAT III). We show that human KAT III/CCBL2 possesses cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase activity, as does mouse KAT II. Thus, depending on the nature of the substrate, all four KATs possess cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase activity. These present studies show that KAT III and glutamine transaminase L are identical enzymes. This report also shows that KAT I, II, and III differ in their ability to transaminate methyl-L-selenocysteine (MSC) and L-selenomethionine (SM) to β-methylselenopyruvate (MSP) and α-ketomethylselenobutyrate, respectively. Previous studies have identified these seleno-α-keto acids as potent histone deacetylase inhibitors. Methylselenol (CH3SeH), also purported to have chemopreventive properties, is the γ-elimination product of SM and the β-elimination product of MSC catalyzed by cystathionine γ-lyase (γ-cystathionase). KAT I, II, and III, in part, can catalyze β-elimination reactions with MSC generating CH3SeH. Thus, the anticancer efficacy of MSC and SM will depend, in part, on the endogenous expression of various KAT enzymes and cystathionine γ-lyase present in target tissue coupled with the ability of cells to synthesize in situ either CH3SeH and/or seleno-keto acid metabolites."

In this study, we examined the roles of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) in HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion using a cell-cell fusion assay with HIV-1 mimetics and their target cells. We employed reconstituted cells as target cells that stably express Sms1 or Sms2 in Sms-deficient cells.

The enhancement of fusion susceptibility observed in Sms2-expressing cells was reversed and reduced by Sms2 knockdown. We also found that catalytically nonactive Sms2 promoted membrane fusion susceptibility. Moreover, SMS2 co-localized and was constitutively associated with the HIV receptor·co-receptor complex in the plasma membrane. In addition, HIV-1 Env treatment resulted in a transient increase in nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) phosphorylation in Sms2-expressing and catalytically nonactive Sms2-expressing cells.

https://openalex.org/W1994969587,"Background The origin of the Etruscan civilization (Etruria, Central Italy) is a long-standing subject of debate among scholars from different disciplines. The bulk of the information has been reconstructed from ancient texts and archaeological findings and, in the last few years, through the analysis of uniparental genetic markers. Methods By meta-analyzing genome-wide data from The 1000 Genomes Project and the literature, we were able to compare the genomic patterns (>540,000 SNPs) of present day Tuscans (N = 98) with other population groups from the main hypothetical source populations, namely, Europe and the Middle East. Results Admixture analysis indicates the presence of 25–34% of Middle Eastern component in modern Tuscans. Different analyses have been carried out using identity-by-state (IBS) values and genetic distances point to Eastern Anatolia/Southern Caucasus as the most likely geographic origin of the main Middle Eastern genetic component observed in the genome of modern Tuscans. Conclusions The data indicate that the admixture event between local Tuscans and Middle Easterners could have occurred in Central Italy about 2,600–3,100 years ago (y.a.). On the whole, the results validate the theory of the ancient historian Herodotus on the origin of Etruscans."

https://openalex.org/W2031203794,"The postsynaptic apparatus of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) traps and anchors acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at high density at the synapse. We have previously shown that microtubule (MT) capture by CLASP2, a MT plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP), increases the size and receptor density of AChR clusters at the NMJ through the delivery of AChRs and that this is regulated by a pathway involving neuronal agrin and several postsynaptic kinases, including GSK3. Phosphorylation by GSK3 has been shown to cause CLASP2 dissociation from MT ends, and nine potential phosphorylation sites for GSK3 have been mapped on CLASP2. How CLASP2 phosphorylation regulates MT capture at the NMJ and how this controls the size of AChR clusters are not yet understood. To examine this, we used myotubes cultured on agrin patches that induce AChR clustering in a two-dimensional manner. We show that expression of a CLASP2 mutant, in which the nine GSK3 target serines are mutated to alanine (CLASP2-9XS/9XA) and are resistant to GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, promotes MT capture at clusters and increases AChR cluster size, compared with myotubes that express similar levels of wild type CLASP2 or that are noninfected. Conversely, myotubes expressing a phosphomimetic form of CLASP2 (CLASP2-8XS/D) show enrichment of immobile mutant CLASP2 in clusters, but MT capture and AChR cluster size are reduced. Taken together, our data suggest that both GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation and the level of CLASP2 play a role in the maintenance of AChR cluster size through the regulated capture and release of MT plus-ends."

EF1A ensures that correct codon matches occur between the aminoacyl-tRNA and the mRNA, whereas EF2 and EF3 help facilitate the timely translocation of peptidyl-tRNAs and removal of deacylated tRNAs. These three proteins together contain 10 methylated lysine residues (10Cavallius J. Zoll W. Chakraburtty K. Merrick W.C.

In yeast, EF1A is the most heavily methylated of the elongation factors, containing two monomethyllysines (Lys-30 and Lys-390), one dimethyllysine (Lys-316), one trimethyllysine (Lys-79), and a C-terminal lysine α-carboxyl methyl ester (10Cavallius J.

EF2 contains trimethyl Lys-509 and dimethyl Lys-613, whereas EF3 has three trimethyllysines: Lys-187, Lys-196, and Lys-789 (11Couttas T.A. Raftery M.J. Padula M.P. Herbert B.R. Wilkins M.R.

With the exception of the C-terminal methyl ester, there is no evidence that these modifications are reversible. Although the functional role of these methylations during translation elongation is unclear, the locations of these modifications hint at their importance. Structural studies of EF2 and the 40 S ribosome subunit indicate that the Lys-509 site is in close contact with ribosomal protein Rps23b (18Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jørgensen R.

This leaves five methylation events with no known responsible enzyme. Because the majority of those sites are trimethylated, we sought to search for these enzymes through trimethyllysine immunoblot-based screens. elongation factor methyltransferase 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol S-adenosyl-l-methionine S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine monomethyllysine dimethyllysine trimethyllysine parallel reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry Protein Data Bank. In this study, we identified Yjr129c as the enzyme responsible for the trimethylation at lysine 509 on elongation factor 2. While this work was being prepared for publication, this finding was reported by another group, and the protein was designated Efm3 (20Zhang L. Hamey J.J. Hart-Smith G. Erce M.A. Wilkins M.R.

In addition to mass spectrometric and immunoblot identification, we directly confirm the identity of this modification as a trimethyllysine by amino acid analysis. We then tested possible functions of elongation factor methylation, including Efm2-catalyzed modification of EF2. Deletion of EFM2 or EFM3 increased sensitivity to translation inhibitors, indicating changes in the ability for EF2 to interact and communicate with ribosomal components. Additionally, we found that translational fidelity is reduced in efm2Δ, indicating possible termination defects. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Cultures were grown in flasks on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 30 °C. Strains of interest were grown in YPD to an A600 of 0.7, and cells from 14 ml of the culture were harvested and washed twice with water. Lysis was performed using 0.2 g of glass beads (Biospec Products, 11079105) and 50 µl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.7 mm PMSF). Samples were vortexed for 1 min and then incubated on ice for 1 min, repeated 10 times. Crude lysates were extracted, and beads were washed once with 50 µl of lysis buffer. Unbroken cells and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry method (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 µg of protein from each sample was loaded onto a 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen, NuPAGE Novex) and run at 200 V for 1 h with MOPS buffer. Rainbow full range molecular weight markers (GE Healthcare, RPN800E) were used as standards. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Hybond-P) at 30 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% dried nonfat milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)). Membranes were washed in PBST and incubated with primary antibodies diluted into 1% dried nonfat milk in PBST for 1.5 h at room temperature and then with secondary antibodies diluted in the same solution for 1 h at room temperature. ECL was used to visualize bands (Amersham Biosciences ECL Prime Western blotting, GE Healthcare, RPN2232). After probing, membranes were stained with Ponceau (1% Ponceau S (w/v), 0.1% acetic acid (v/v)) to determine loading equality. Antibodies in this study include anti-trimethyllysine-HRP (1:5000; Immunechem, ICP0602), anti-di-/trimethyllysine (1:10,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 07-756), anti-pan-methyllysine (1:10,000; Abcam, ab7315), and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:6666; Cell Signaling, 7074). The Immunechem and Upstate Biotechnology antibodies were kind gifts from Joanna Goldberg (Emory University). The Abcam “anti-pan methyllysine” antibody was prepared against calf histone H1 containing dimethyllysine residues. The Upstate Biotechnology antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide containing dimethyllysine at position 9 of human histone H3 and is listed by the manufacturer as an anti-di-/trimethyllysine antibody. In the figures, we have emphasized which modified form the antibody prefers in the yeast elongation factors by using boldface type and underlining the respective degree of lysine methylation. Thus, we describe the Abcam antibody as α-M/D/TMK and the Upstate Biotechnology antibody as α-D/TMK. Mouse tissue cytosolic extracts were a kind gift of Dr. Jonathan Lowenson from UCLA. Cultures of wild type and knock-out cells were grown in YPD to an A600 of 0.7, and cells from 14 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min), resuspended in 1 ml of water, and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 900 µl of YPD and 100 µl of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; 83.3 Ci/mmol; 0.55 mCi/ml in 10 mm H2SO4-ethanol (9:1); PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C on a rotary shaker. Radiolabeled cells were washed twice with water and lysed using the glass bead method described above. Lysates from each strain were loaded onto a 4% stacking, 12% resolving SDS/Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (15 × 17 × 0.2 cm) and run at 35 mA through the stacking and 45 mA through the resolving gels. Gels were Coomassie-stained (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 40% water, 0.2% Brilliant Blue R-250 (w/v)) and destained overnight (10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 80% water). The protein band running just above the 97 kDa marker was excised and placed into a 6 × 50-mm glass test tube. 100 µl of 6 n HCl was added to each slice, and tubes were placed in a reaction chamber (Eldex Laboratories, 1163) containing 500 µl of 6 n HCl. Chambers were heated for 20 h in vacuo at 109 °C in a Pico-Tag vapor phase apparatus (Waters). Residual HCl was removed by vacuum centrifugation. Dried gel slices were resuspended in 400 µl of cation exchange loading buffer (sodium citrate, 0.2 m Na+, pH 2.2). 2 µmol of each methyllysine standard was added to the sample (Sigma; Nϵ-methyl-l-lysine hydrochloride 04685, Nϵ,Nϵ-dimethyl-l-lysine monohydrochloride 19773, and Nϵ,Nϵ,Nϵ-trimethyllysine hydrochloride T1660) and loaded onto a cation exchange column (Beckman AA-15 sulfonated polystyrene resin, 0.9-cm inner diameter by 12-cm height) equilibrated with running buffer (sodium citrate, 0.3 m Na+) at 55 °C. For full separation of mono-, di-, and trimethyllysine, low pH buffer (pH 3.8) was used. To reduce run times when separation of mono- and dimethyllysine was not required, a pH 4.5 buffer was used. Buffer at pH 5.5 was used to analyze when the separation of mono-, di-, and trimethyllysine species was not needed. Amino acids were eluted in the equilibration buffer at 1 ml/min while collecting 1-min fractions at the expected elution position of the methyllysine standards. 50 µl of each fraction was added to a flat-bottom 96-well plate to detect standards by the ninhydrin method. Each well was mixed with 100 µl of ninhydrin reagent (2% ninhydrin (w/v), 0.3% hydrindantin (w/v), 75% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v), 25% 4 m lithium acetate, pH 4.2 (v/v)), and the plate was heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Standards were detected by measuring absorbance at 570 nm using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader. The remainder of each fraction was added to 5 ml of scintillation fluor (Safety Solve, Research Products International) in a 20-ml scintillation vial and counted for three 5-min cycles using a Beckman LS6500 instrument to detect 3H-methylated amino acids. Coomassie-stained gel slices from the 100-kDa region of fractionated polypeptides of yeast cell lysates were washed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and destained by incubating in a solution of 50% 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile for 2–4 h until the gel slice became transparent. Slices were incubated in 100% acetonitrile and dried by vacuum centrifugation for 10 min. After incubating the dried slice in a minimal volume of 10 mm DTT in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 60 °C to reduce the disulfide bond, proteins were alkylated by treatment in 50 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 45 °C. Gel slices were washed by alternating 10-min incubations in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 100% acetonitrile. Slices swelled on ice in a working stock solution of 20 ng/µl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, V5111) for 45 min. Digests were performed for 16 h at 37 °C, and peptides were eluted using 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in 200 µl of 0.1% TFA in water. Tryptic peptides from the 100 kDa SDS-gel band of wild type, efm2Δ, and efm3Δ lysates were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) and an EASY-Spray nano-electrospray ionization source. Peptides were injected onto a 75 µm × 15-cm, 3µ, 100-Å PepMap C18 reversed-phase LC column and separated using a linear gradient from 5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile), 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 50% solvent B in 45 min at a constant flow of 300 nl/min. Eluted peptides were analyzed with a top 10 data-dependent acquisition method and identified using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4; Thermo Scientific) coupled with MASCOT (version 2.4.1; Matrix Science, London, UK). Orbitrap MS resolving power was set to 70,000 at m/z 200 for MS1 and 17,500 at m/z 200 for MS2. Tryptic peptides with up to one missed cleavage were searched against the SwissProt S. cerevisiae database (2013; 7798 sequences) with dynamic modifications for carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), deamidation (N, Q) monomethyl (K), dimethyl (K), and trimethyl (K). Precursor and product ion mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.005 Da, respectively. Methylated EF2 peptides identified by MASCOT were manually examined and confirmed from the corresponding MS/MS spectra. Manually confirmed EF2 peptides with methylated lysine residues were further examined by targeted parallel reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry (PRM-MS) to explore the effects of EFM2 and EFM3 deletions on EF2 methylation. Samples (described above) were reanalyzed by a targeted MS/MS acquisition method using an inclusion list containing the doubly and triply charged mass-to-charge (m/z) values of the manually confirmed EF2 peptides from wild type lysate. Peaks corresponding to methylated EF2 peptides were visualized in Xcalibur Qual Browser software (Thermo Scientific) using precursor → fragment transitions extracted within 10 ppm mass accuracy. The following transitions (m/z) were used to identify methylated and unmethylated peptides of interest: 286.1920 → 372.2423 (LVEGLKTMK509R); 281.5201 → 251.1790 (LVEGLKDMK509R); 390.2060 → 402.2823 (DDFKDMK613AR); 383.1981 → 268.1712 (DDFKMMK613AR); 329.7103 → 446.2609 (LVEGLK); 376.1903 → 521.3194 (DDFKAR). Whole protein sequences for translocase (EF2 or EF-G) were aligned using Clustal Omega. A protein-protein BLAST search was performed using S. cerevisiae Efm3 (UniProt P47163) or Efm2 (UniProt P32324) as the query. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (multiple-sequence comparison by log-expectation) in MEGA 6. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method to create phylogenetic trees. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method. All positions containing gaps and missing data were partially eliminated. In instances where poor homology was found, organisms were eliminated from the alignment or replaced by a different representative from the same kingdom. Changes in sensitivity to various translation inhibitors were determined using serial dilution spot test growth assays. Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium to an A600 of ∼0.5. 1 ml of each culture was centrifuged down at 5000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed with water, and the pellets were diluted to an A600 of 0.5. The cells were then diluted in a 5-fold series in water under sterile conditions. 3 µl of each dilution was spotted onto a 10-cm 2% agar plate containing YPD or YPD + antibiotic and incubated at 30 °C for 2–5 days. Antibiotics used were cycloheximide (Sigma, C7698), puromycin (VWR, 97064-280), paromomycin (Sigma, P9297), anisomycin (Sigma, A9789), tunicamycin (Sigma, T7765), and verrucarin A (Sigma, V4877).

https://openalex.org/W2089541589,"Glycine can persistently potentiate or depress AMPA responses through differential actions on two binding sites: NMDA and glycine receptors. Whether glycine can induce long-lasting modifications in NMDA responses, however, remains unknown. Here, we report that glycine induces long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) of NMDA responses (Gly-LTP(NMDA) or Gly-LTD(NMDA)) in a dose-dependent manner in hippocampal CA1 neurons. These modifications of NMDA responses depend on NMDAR activation. In addition, the induction of Gly-LTP(NMDA) requires binding of glycine with NMDARs, whereas Gly-LTD(NMDA) requires that glycine bind with both sites on NMDARs and GlyRs. Moreover, activity-dependent exocytosis and endocytosis of postsynaptic NMDARs underlie glycine-induced bidirectional modification of NMDA excitatory postsynaptic currents. Thus, we conclude that glycine at different levels induces bidirectional plasticity of NMDA responses through differentially regulating NMDA receptor trafficking. Our present findings reveal important functions of the two glycine binding sites in gating the direction of synaptic plasticity in NMDA responses."
https://openalex.org/W2086968708,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, particularly abundant in plastids and mitochrondria of angiosperms, include a large number of sequence-specific RNA binding proteins that are involved in diverse aspects of organelle RNA metabolisms. PPR proteins contain multiple tandom repeats, and each repeat can specifically recognize a RNA base through residues 2, 5, and 35 in a modular fashion. The crystal structure of PPR10 from maize chloroplast exhibits dimeric existence both in the absence and presence of the 18-nucleotide psaJ RNA element. However, previous biochemical analysis suggested a monomeric shift of PPR10 upon RNA binding. In this report, we show that the amino-terminal segments of PPR10 determine the dimerization state of PPR10. A single amino acid alteration of cysteine to serine within repeat 10 of PPR10 further drives dimerization of PPR10. The biochemical elucidation of the determinants for PPR10 dimerization may provide an important foundation to understand the working mechanisms of PPR proteins underlying their diverse physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2316554898,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is composed of a phosphatidylinositol anchor followed by a mannan followed by an arabinan that may be capped with various motifs including oligosaccharides of mannose. A related polymer, lipomannan (LM), is composed of only the phosphatidylinositol and mannan core. Both the structure and the biosynthesis of LAM have been studied extensively. However, fundamental questions about the branching structure of LM and the number of arabinan chains on the mannan backbone in LAM remain. LM and LAM molecules produced by three different glycosyltransferase mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis were used here to investigate these questions. Using an MSMEG_4241 mutant that lacks the α-(1,6)-mannosyltransferase used late in LM elongation, we showed that the reducing end region of the mannan that is attached to inositol has 5–7 unbranched α-6-linked-mannosyl residues followed by two or three α-6-linked mannosyl residues branched with single α-mannopyranose residues at O-2. After these branched mannosyl residues, the α-6-linked mannan chain is terminated with an α-mannopyranose at O-2 rather than O-6 of the penultimate residue. Analysis of the number of arabinans attached to the mannan core of LM in two other mutants (ΔembC and ΔMSMEG_4247) demonstrated exactly one arabinosyl substitution of the mannan core suggestive of the arabinosylation of a linear LM precursor with ∼10–12 mannosyl residues followed by additional mannosylation of the core and arabinosylation of a single arabinosyl “primer.” Thus, these studies suggest that only a single arabinan chain attached near the middle of the mannan core is present in mature LAM and allow for an updated working model of the biosynthetic pathway of LAM and LM. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is composed of a phosphatidylinositol anchor followed by a mannan followed by an arabinan that may be capped with various motifs including oligosaccharides of mannose. A related polymer, lipomannan (LM), is composed of only the phosphatidylinositol and mannan core. Both the structure and the biosynthesis of LAM have been studied extensively. However, fundamental questions about the branching structure of LM and the number of arabinan chains on the mannan backbone in LAM remain. LM and LAM molecules produced by three different glycosyltransferase mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis were used here to investigate these questions. Using an MSMEG_4241 mutant that lacks the α-(1,6)-mannosyltransferase used late in LM elongation, we showed that the reducing end region of the mannan that is attached to inositol has 5–7 unbranched α-6-linked-mannosyl residues followed by two or three α-6-linked mannosyl residues branched with single α-mannopyranose residues at O-2. After these branched mannosyl residues, the α-6-linked mannan chain is terminated with an α-mannopyranose at O-2 rather than O-6 of the penultimate residue.

Emerging data point to a critical role of LAM and biosynthetic precursors in the integrity of the mycobacterial cell envelope and cell division (1Angala S.K. Belardinelli J.M. Huc-Claustre E.

Consistently, many of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these glycoconjugates are essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, providing exciting opportunities for drug development (1Angala S.K.

The importance of these molecules in promoting the entry of M. tuberculosis inside phagocytic cells, regulating phagosome maturation, and modulating the host immune response has also been well documented (1Angala S.K.

The fact that even subtle variations in their structures, including their degree of acylation and mannan branching, the length of their mannan and arabinan domains, and the nature of the substituents capping the non-reducing end of the arabinan domain, dramatically impact their biological activities adds further support to the hypothesis that these molecules serve as important modulators of host-pathogen interactions in the course of infection. lipoarabinomannan mannopyranosyl phosphatidylinositol mannoside arabinofuranosyl mannosyltransferase lipomannan precursor LM arabinosyltransferase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine collision-induced dissociation.

The phosphatidylinositol anchor is composed of a myo-inositol phosphoryl diacylglycerol substituted at the 2-position with a single mannopyranose (Manp) and at the 6-position with the mannan (6Chatterjee D.

To date, our cumulative structural data are consistent with the mannan core in both LAM and LM being based on an α-(1,6)-linked backbone, substituted to varying degrees at position 2 with single α-Manp residues and containing ∼35 α-Manp residues in total (1Angala S.K.

The arabinan portion of LAM contains about 60 arabinofuranosyl (Araf) units (1Angala S.K. Belardinelli J.M. Huc-Claustre E. Wheat W.H. Jackson M.

The arabinan region is conveniently visualized as an internal region and non-reducing termini. The innermost region consists of a linear α-(1,5)-linked Araf backbone of unknown and likely variable length that is attached at its reducing end to the mannan core. This linear region is then followed by a branched region the details of which are poorly understood, although an interesting hypothesis suggesting elongation and further branching based on the structure of the more fully understood arabinan present in arabinogalactan has been put forth (9Shi L.

The non-reducing termini are better understood and consist of branched hexaarabinofuranosides (Ara6) and linear tetraarabinofuranosides (Ara4). In both these cases the arabinan ends with a β-Araf-(1,2)-α-Araf unit (two of these in the case of Ara6 and one in the case of Ara4). In Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium fortuitum the β-Araf units can be capped with an inositol phosphate residue; more commonly, in slow-growing species such as M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, they are capped with α-Manp, α-Manp-(1,2)-α-Manp, and α-Manp-(1,2)-α-Manp-(1,2)-α-Manp (1Angala S.K.

Nothing was known until recently about the enzymes, intermediates, and steps involved in the biosynthesis of the mannan backbone and arabinan domain of LM/LAM.

The α-1,6-ManT(s) responsible for the presence of the α-(1,6) mannosyl residues at the reducing end of LAM has not been identified but will be designated ManT-E for earlier in the pathway. Rv2174 (and MSMEG_4241) are designated α-1,6-ManT-L for later in the pathway. We identified Rv2181 as the α-1,2-ManT responsible for the synthesis of the α-(1,2) Manp-linked branches characteristic of the mannan backbone of LM and LAM (16Kaur D. Berg S. Dinadayala P.

Inactivation of the M. smegmatis orthologous gene (MSMEG_4247) by allelic exchange blocked the synthesis of mature, branched LM and resulted in the accumulation of a LAM-like product shown by MALDI-TOF/MS to be lower in molecular weight than WT LAM and devoid of 2,6-linked Manp and the corresponding terminal Manp residues. This product had little alteration in the known arabinan motifs, suggesting that a linear α-(1,6) mannan devoid of any α-(1,2) Manp branching is capable of being arabinosylated in a normal fashion (16Kaur D.

The ΔMSMEG_4247, ΔMSMEG_4241, and ΔembC knock-out mutants of M. smegmatis were cultured in the presence of kanamycin (50 µg/ml). M. smegmatis strains were harvested in late logarithmic phase from liquid medium and lyophilized. Dried cells were delipidated with organic solvents and freeze-thawed before disruption by sonication. The resulting suspension was refluxed in 50% ethanol several times; extracts were combined, evaporated, and digested with proteinase K followed by dialysis and subjection to a two-step purification protocol involving hydrophobic and gel exclusion chromatography. The resulting LAM-like and LM-like-containing fractions were monitored on Tricine gels stained with periodic acid/Schiff reagent, pooled, and dialyzed. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a mixture of water/acetonitrile (1:1 (v/v)) containing 0.1% TFA and 10 µg of lipoglycan mixed with 1.0 µl of the matrix solution. Analyses were performed on an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) using reflector mode detection. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode for the underivatized sample on a 30-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 94% and full accelerating voltage (25 kV). The mass spectra were mass-assigned through external calibration. Samples were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described (18Ciucanu I. Kerek F.

MALDI-MS profiling and collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS sequencing were performed on either a quadrupole-time of flight (Q/TOF) Ultima MALDI (Micromass) or a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), both operated in reflectron positive ion mode. For acquisition on the Q/TOF instrument, the permethylated samples in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix (5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) for spotting onto the target plate. MS survey and CID MS/MS data were manually acquired. For data acquisition on the TOF/TOF instrument (4700 Proteomics Analyzer), the permethyl derivatives in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix (10 mg/ml in water), whereas underivatized samples in water were mixed 1:1 with 10 mg/ml DHB matrix in acetonitrile for spotting onto the target plate. For high energy CID MS/MS on the TOF/TOF, the potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell was set at 2 or 3 kV to obtain optimum fragmentation. The indicated collision cell pressure was normally increased from 3 × 10−8 torr (no collision gas) to 5 × 10−7 torr or up to a maximum of 2 × 10−6 torr (argon). M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4241 is missing α-1,6-ManT-L that is used in the later elongation of the mannan present in LM and LAM. This mutant mostly produces pLM of 12–18 mannosyl residues compared with 21–34 mannosyl residues in WT LM (14Kaur D. McNeil M.R. Khoo K.-H. Chatterjee D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J.

No arabinosyl-containing LM or LAM-like molecules are found suggesting that α-1,6-ManT-L is required for arabinosylation to occur. The LM-like molecule produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4241 was purified and yielded the expected truncated LM with 12–17 mannosyl residues (with quantitatively minor species containing 5–12 and 18–20 residues), as determined by the value of their M+Na+ ions in MALDI-TOF/MS as previously reported.

For structural details, the quantitatively major components containing 12, 13, 14, and 15 mannosyl units were analyzed by high energy CID MS/MS on the parent [M+Na]+ ion. An exemplary MALDI-MS/MS spectrum for M13-pLM (sodiated parent ion at m/z 3122.5) is shown in Fig. 1 along with a schematic drawing illustrating the deduced fragmentation pattern and the structures of the major product ion series. Interpretation is based primarily on the experience derived from similar high energy CID MS/MS analysis of permethylated N- and O-glycans as reported previously (20Yu S.Y. Wu S.W. Khoo K.H. Distinctive characteristics of MALDI-Q/TOF and TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry for sequencing of permethylated complex type N-glycans.Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the known structural features of LM. We have further limited the possible range of structural isomers to an α-6-mannan core, with single-α2-Man branching along the backbone attached to O-6 of inositol, which is further substituted by another single Man at O-2 and a phosphoglycerol unit at O-1. The 1,5X series was particularly informative in determining the positions of branching along the six-linked mannan backbone. The 1,5X cleavage ions carry the reducing end of the molecule, and the branching residues can be located by “missing” ions in the series. Thus the largest of the series, i.e. the sodiated ion at m/z 2932, can be derived from cleavage at any of the terminal Manp residues, whereas the next cleavage, where 2 Manp residues are lost, forms the ion at m/z 2728 (Fig. 1). The 1,5X cleavage that would loose 3 Manp residues to yield an ion at m/z 2524 is missing, but the next in series, namely loss of four Manp residues, does occur to yield an ion at m/z 2320. This cleavage pattern is indicative of a branched non-reducing terminus as depicted in Fig. 1. In accordance to this picture, the ion at m/z 2116 is missing because of the next branch point, but the presence of the remainder of the ion series at m/z 1912, 1708, 1503, 1299, 1095, 891, and 687 suggests that the rest of the mannan chain is mostly unbranched up to the inositol residue. The 3,5A ions, which contain the reducing end of the LM molecule, confirm the same branching pattern. Together with the 0,4A ions at 28 atomic mass units lower (not annotated for simplicity), they also directly demonstrate that the backbone is 6-linked. This 3,5A ion series starts at m/z 2370, which contains 11 complete Manp residues and C-6, -5, and -4 from an additional Manp at the reducing end. It continues with ions at m/z 2166, 1962, 1758, 1553, and 1349 showing the same 6 unbranched Manp residues as the 1,5X ion series. The ion at m/z 1145 is missing due to the first branch at the non-reducing end, but the series continues again with an ion at m/z 941, and then no further ions in this series are seen. m/z 737 should be missing, but we cannot explain the lack of an ion at m/z 533. It is possible that the ion at m/z 533 is not formed due to some structural constraints at the non-reducing end of the molecule. The same linear structure at the reducing end and branched structure at the non-reducing end is also supported by the series of E ions beginning at m/z 2456, proceeding downward to m/z 1435 with each intervening mass present (m/z 2456, 2252, 2048, 1843, 1639, 1435), and then m/z 1027 where the Manp at O-2 is eliminated, with the ion at m/z 1231 conspicuously absent. Both m/z 823 and m/z 619 are present; m/z 619 is formed as illustrated in Fig. 1 but m/z 823 is not expected. It could possibly be formed from the ion at m/z 1027 by the expulsion of a non-branched internal Manp, as documented previously for chemical ionization MS of per-O-methylated oligosaccharide alditols (21McNeil M. Elimination of internal glycosyl residues during chemical ionization-mass spectrometry of per-O-alkylated oligosaccharide-alditols.Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: 31-40Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the E, 3,5A, and 1,5X series all demonstrate the presence of 6 unbranched 6-linked Manp residues attached to the inositol ring. Nevertheless, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of other slightly different arrangements of branching occurring at the reducing end of some or all of the molecules affording the same parent ion at m/z 3122.5 The MS/MS data of other size pLMs also supports related structures to that of Man13-pLM. Analysis of the CID MS/MS of the M+Na+ ions at m/z 3530 of M15-plM suggests that the additional two mannosyl residues are present as an additional branched unit at the non-reducing end and retain the six linear 6-linked mannosyl residues at the reducing end. In contrast, M12-pLM and M14-pLM (Fig. 2) appear to be mixtures with five or seven internal linear 1,6-mannosyl units and have two, three or four terminal mannosyl units attached to the O-2 of mannosyl units in the main chain. These major structures are shown in Fig. 3). It should be noted that although the data support these structures as the quantitatively major arrangements, we cannot rule out small amounts of additional isomers.FIGURE 3The major species of pLM produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4241.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MSMEG_6387 encodes the α-1,5-AraT (EmbC), which is expected to be the second enzyme involved in the arabinosylation of LAM after the “priming enzyme,” which puts the first arabinosyl residue on the mannan chain (this enzyme is not yet identified). In the hope that the embC knock-out mutant would accumulate the LAM mannan substituted with one or more arabinosyl residues (depending on how many arabinan chains are present), we analyzed the LM produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_6387 by MALDI-TOF MS, which by yielding the molecular weight of the components allows for determination of exactly how many, if any, arabinosyl residues are present. We showed previously that LM from WT M. smegmatis contains no arabinosyl residues (14Kaur D. McNeil M.R. Khoo K.-H. Chatterjee D. Crick D.C. Jackson M. Brennan P.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 27133-27140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In dramatic contrast, the LM-like material produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_6387, regardless of the number of mannosyl residues, was arabinosylated with a single arabinosyl residue (Fig. 4). These LAM biosynthetic precursors containing a single arabinosyl residue ranged from 17 to 29 mannosyl residues with 21–26 mannosyl residues being quantitatively major. Importantly, the results show that only a single arabinan is present on each mannan core of LAM. Very small amounts of ions corresponding to two arabinosyl residues and no arabinosyl residues were also detected as shown in the insert to Fig. 4, but these ions were in the midst of inexplicable ions, and we hesitate to assign them. Previous work has shown that the arabinan is attached to the mannan core at O-2 of a 2,6-Manp residue in M. tuberculosis LAM (8Chatterjee D. Bozic C.M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Structural features of the arabinan component of the lipoarabinomannan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9652-9660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4247, a knock-out mutant of the α-1,2-ManT, makes a LAM of a smaller size than the WT parent strain with no detectable LM-like lipoglycan due to the lack of branching (and possible extension) of the mannan core (16Kaur D.

We, therefore, analyzed the mannan core present in this LAM-like molecule upon treatment with Cellulomonas arabinases (23McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Enzymatic evidence for the presence of a critical terminal hexa-arabinoside in the cell walls of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to remove most of the arabinan. The material retained after passage through a 10,000 molecular mass cutoff membrane was analyzed directly (without methylation) by negative ion MALDI-TOF MS as shown in Fig. 5 (analysis after methylation gave similar results, but the spectrum was stronger in the negative ion non-methylated sample). The predominant acylation pattern was C-16 and C-19 (diacylated). LM precursors with and without a single arabinosyl residue were found from Man10 through Man18 confirming the results above that only a single arabinan chain is attached to the mannan. Presumably, all these mannans were linear due to the lack of the α-1,2-ManT. The biosynthesis of LM, LAM, and arabinogalactan is complex and carefully controlled. One of the key biosynthetic distinctions is the different arabinosylation pattern on LAM in contrast to arabinogalactan. More germane to this study is the destination of PIM4 to its three possible end products, PIM6, or as shown in Fig. 6, LM or LAM. The branch point in the pathway to PIM6 occurs by the action of PimE, an α-1,2-ManT that adds a mannosyl residue to O-2 of the third α-(1,6)-mannosyl unit attached at O-6 of the inositol (24Morita Y.S. Sena C.B. Waller R.F. Kurokawa K. Sernee M.F. Nakatani F. Haites R.E. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. PimE is a polyprenol phosphate-mannose-dependent mannosyltransferase that transfers the fifth mannose of phosphatidylinositol mannoside in mycobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25143-25155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, in the pathway to LM and LAM, the PIM4 is elongated by as yet to be identified α-1,6-ManT(s), designated as α-1,6-ManT-E. The key branch point between LAM and LM is postulated to be the final linear product of ManT-E, which contains a linear α-1,6-mannan of around 9 residues (M10–11-pLM). In the absence of the second α-1,6-ManT, α-1,6-ManT-L, this product can be acted on by the branching ManT (α-1,2-ManT, the gene product of MSMEG_4247) to form the branched end product produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4241 and analyzed in detail in this report (see the lower left of Fig. 6). In contrast, the priming α-1,2-AraT cannot act on M10–11-pLM in the absence of α-1,6-ManT-L, and no LAM is formed in this mutant. When α-1,6-ManT-L and α-1,2-AraT are present, M10–11-pLM can be arabinosylated and elongated, and in the absence of the α-1,2-ManT, all of M10–11-pLM is converted to LAM (with a linear mannan) as found in M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4247. In the presence of all three enzymes, both LAM and LM are formed, and the distribution of the two macromolecules is presumably controlled by the ratios of the three proteins. The mannan with (LAM) or without (LM) the priming arabinosyl residue is further elongated and branched. As shown in elegant experiments by the Morita and co-workers (22Sena C.B. Fukuda T. Miyanagi K. Matsumoto S. Kobayashi K. Murakami Y. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Morita Y.S. Controlled expression of branch-forming mannosyltransferase is critical for mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13326-13336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the degree of elongation of the mannan is dependent on the ratio of the α-1,2-ManT to the α-1,6-ManT-L. Presumably, the α-1,2-ManT prefers to add an α-Manp to a 6-linked Manp but can add a mannosyl residue to the terminal α-Manp unit, and when it does so, it terminates the growth of the mannan as α-1,6-ManT-L cannot act on this substrate. Thus, depending on the relative abundance of linear α-1,6-Manp residues to α-t-Manp residue (which itself is dependent on the activity of α-1,6-ManT-L), the mannan chain is further elongated or terminated. The arabinan is elongated in the presence of the α-1,5-AraT gene product of embC (and other AraT(s)) as shown in the top right of Fig. 6 to result in WT LAM. Alternatively, as shown in the bottom right of Fig. 6, LAM with an unbranched linear mannan is formed in the absence of the α-1,2-ManT. In the absence of EmbC, the penultimate product shown in the top right of Fig. 6 is formed as analyzed in M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_6387. Presumably, mannan elongation and branching and arabinan synthesis can go on simultaneously. The biosynthetic model of Fig. 6 is based on the present experimental evidence but also has testable assumptions and leads to further questions. Some of these include the assumption that the α-1,2-AraT adds an arabinosyl residue to a linear α-1,6-Manp as shown in Fig. 6 and not to the t-Manp at the end of the mannan chain. Presumably, if the arabinosyl residue was added to the end of the chain this would inhibit its further mannosylation. The model further predicts that the arabinosyl residue is generally in the middle of the mannan chain; detailed structure analysis of the end product produced by M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_6387 and ΔMSMEG_4247 should confirm this. An unanswered question is whether the inability of the α-1,2-AraT to act when α-1,6-ManT-L is missing is due to the size of the substrate (as shown in Fig. 6) or due to lack of protein/protein interactions assuming that LM and LAM are assembled by a multienzyme complex; the presence of Ara-Man10-inositol-phosphoryl-glycerol in the lipoglycan products of M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_4247 might suggest (in contrast to the pathway presented in Fig. 6) that the size of the substrate is not the cause of the lack of priming Araf transfer in the ΔMSMEG_4241 (α-1,6-ManT-L) knock-out mutant. And finally, one of the most basic questions remains, which is how the arabinan synthesis is directed to LAM rather than arabinogalactan type arabinan. These questions can be addressed at least in part by further detailed analysis of the polymers of the mutants described herein, by the generation of additional mutants, and finally by the expression and purification of active AraTs and ManTs followed by the study of their catalytic activity on specifically prepared substrates. The MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS data were acquired at the previous National Research Program for Genomic Medicine Core Facilities for Proteomics and Glycomics (NSC 99-3112-B-001-025) and current Core Facilities for Protein Structural Analysis at Academia Sinica, supported under the Taiwan National Core Facility Program for Biotechnology, NSC 100-2325-B-001-029."
https://openalex.org/W1974526599,"Neonatal meningitis, caused by Escherichia coli K1, is a serious central nervous system disease. We have established that macrophages serve as permissive niches for E. coli K1 to multiply in the host and for attaining a threshold level of bacterial load, which is a prerequisite for the onset of the disease. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that three N-glycans in FcγRIa interact with OmpA of E. coli K1 for binding to and entering the macrophages. Adoptive transfer of FcγRIa(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages transfected with FcγRIa into FcγRIa(-/-) newborn mice renders them susceptible to E. coli K1-induced meningitis. In contrast, mice that received bone marrow-derived macrophages transfected with FcγRIa in which N-glycosylation sites 1, 4, and 5 are mutated to alanines exhibit resistance to E. coli K1 infection. Our molecular dynamics and simulation studies predict that N-glycan 5 exhibits strong binding at the barrel site of OmpA formed by loops 3 and 4, whereas N-glycans 1 and 4 interact with loops 1, 3, and 4 of OmpA at tip regions. Molecular modeling data also suggest no role for the IgG binding site in the invasion process. In agreement, experimental mutations in IgG binding site had no effect on the E. coli K1 entry into macrophages in vitro or on the onset of meningitis in newborn mice. Together, this integration of experimental and computational studies reveals how the N-glycans in FcγRIa interact with the OmpA of E. coli K1 for inducing the disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1989663640,"The initial step in initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication involves the assembly of pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In metazoans initiation is inhibited by the regulatory factor Geminin. We have purified the human pre-RC proteins, studied their interactions in vitro with each other and with origin DNA, and analyzed the effects of HsGeminin on formation of DNA-protein complexes. The formation of an initial complex containing the human origin recognition complex (HsORC), HsCdt1, HsCdc6, and origin DNA is cooperative, involving all possible binary interactions among the components. Maximal association of HsMCM2-7, a component of the replicative helicase, requires HsORC, HsCdc6, HsCdt1, and ATP, and is driven by interactions of HsCdt1 and HsCdc6 with multiple HsMCM2-7 subunits. Formation of stable complexes, resistant to high salt, requires ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of HsMCM proteins, HsGeminin inhibits the association of HsCdt1 with DNA or with HsORC-HsCdc6-DNA complexes. However, HsGeminin does not inhibit recruitment of HsMCM2-7 to DNA to form complexes containing all of the pre-RC proteins. In fact, HsGeminin itself is a component of such complexes, and interacts directly with the HsMcm3 and HsMcm5 subunits of HsMCM2-7, as well as with HsCdt1. Although HsGeminin does not prevent the initial formation of DNA-protein complexes containing the pre-RC proteins, it strongly inhibits the formation of stable pre-RCs that are resistant to high salt. We suggest that bound HsGeminin prevents transition of the pre-RC to a state that is competent for initiation of DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2040009155,"Francisella tularensis is the etiological agent of tularemia, or rabbit fever. Although F. tularensis is a recognized biothreat agent with broad and expanding geographical range, its mechanism of infection and environmental persistence remain poorly understood. Previously, we identified seven F. tularensis proteins that induce a rapid encystment phenotype (REP) in the free-living amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii. Encystment is essential to the pathogen's long term intracellular survival in the amoeba. Here, we characterize the cellular and molecular function of REP34, a REP protein with a mass of 34 kDa. A REP34 knock-out strain of F. tularensis has a reduced ability to both induce encystment in A. castellanii and invade human macrophages. We determined the crystal structure of REP34 to 2.05-Å resolution and demonstrate robust carboxypeptidase B-like activity for the enzyme. REP34 is a zinc-containing monomeric protein with close structural homology to the metallocarboxypeptidase family of peptidases. REP34 possesses a novel topology and substrate binding pocket that deviates from the canonical funnelin structure of carboxypeptidases, putatively resulting in a catalytic role for a conserved tyrosine and distinct S1' recognition site. Taken together, these results identify REP34 as an active carboxypeptidase, implicate the enzyme as a potential key F. tularensis effector protein, and may help elucidate a mechanistic understanding of F. tularensis infection of phagocytic cells."
