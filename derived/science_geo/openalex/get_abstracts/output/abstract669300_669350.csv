https://openalex.org/W3131634425,"The advent of single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling has accelerated the ability to map gene regulatory landscapes but has outpaced the development of scalable software to rapidly extract biological meaning from these data. Here we present a software suite for single-cell analysis of regulatory chromatin in R (ArchR; https://www.archrproject.com/ ) that enables fast and comprehensive analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. ArchR provides an intuitive, user-focused interface for complex single-cell analyses, including doublet removal, single-cell clustering and cell type identification, unified peak set generation, cellular trajectory identification, DNA element-to-gene linkage, transcription factor footprinting, mRNA expression level prediction from chromatin accessibility and multi-omic integration with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Enabling the analysis of over 1.2 million single cells within 8 h on a standard Unix laptop, ArchR is a comprehensive software suite for end-to-end analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility that will accelerate the understanding of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells."

We present 64 assembled haplotypes from 32 diverse human genomes. These highly contiguous haplotype assemblies (average minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome: 26 million base pairs) integrate all forms of genetic variation, even across complex loci. We identified 107,590 structural variants (SVs), of which 68% were not discovered with short-read sequencing, and 278 SV hotspots (spanning megabases of gene-rich sequence). We characterized 130 of the most active mobile element source elements and found that 63% of all SVs arise through homology-mediated mechanisms. This resource enables reliable graph-based genotyping from short reads of up to 50,340 SVs, resulting in the identification of 1526 expression quantitative trait loci as well as SV candidates for adaptive selection within the human population."

Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies in serum samples collected from 431 humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 251 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ∼20% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but they were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3132221372,"To identify circulating proteins influencing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity, we undertook a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, rapidly scanning hundreds of circulating proteins while reducing bias due to reverse causation and confounding. In up to 14,134 cases and 1.2 million controls, we found that an s.d. increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, P = 7 × 10-8), hospitalization (OR = 0.61, P = 8 × 10-8) and susceptibility (OR = 0.78, P = 8 × 10-6). Measuring OAS1 levels in 504 individuals, we found that higher plasma OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with reduced COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 in individuals of European ancestry affords this protection. Thus, evidence from MR and a case-control study support a protective role for OAS1 in COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Available pharmacological agents that increase OAS1 levels could be prioritized for drug development."

Bluvstein et al. built an array of up to 200 Rydberg atoms and subjected the system to periodic excitation. Under such driven excitation, they found that the array of atoms stabilized, freezing periodically into what looked like time crystals.

https://openalex.org/W3133429828,"Overexpressed tumor-associated antigens [for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)] are attractive targets for therapeutic T cells, but toxic ""off-tumor"" cross-reaction with normal tissues that express low levels of target antigen can occur with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. Inspired by natural ultrasensitive response circuits, we engineered a two-step positive-feedback circuit that allows human cytotoxic T cells to discriminate targets on the basis of a sigmoidal antigen-density threshold. In this circuit, a low-affinity synthetic Notch receptor for HER2 controls the expression of a high-affinity CAR for HER2. Increasing HER2 density thus has cooperative effects on T cells-it increases both CAR expression and activation-leading to a sigmoidal response. T cells with this circuit show sharp discrimination between target cells expressing normal amounts of HER2 and cancer cells expressing 100 times as much HER2, both in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W3129602173,"Mitogens trigger cell division in animals. In plants, cytokinins, a group of phytohormones derived from adenine, stimulate cell proliferation. Cytokinin signaling is initiated by membrane-associated histidine kinase receptors and transduced through a phosphorelay system. We show that in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM), cytokinin regulates cell division by promoting nuclear shuttling of Myb-domain protein 3R4 (MYB3R4), a transcription factor that activates mitotic gene expression. Newly synthesized MYB3R4 protein resides predominantly in the cytoplasm. At the G2-to-M transition, rapid nuclear accumulation of MYB3R4-consistent with an associated transient peak in cytokinin concentration-feeds a positive feedback loop involving importins and initiates a transcriptional cascade that drives mitosis and cytokinesis. An engineered nuclear-restricted MYB3R4 mimics the cytokinin effects of enhanced cell proliferation and meristem growth."

Key technical challenges for physical random number generation are speed and scalability. We demonstrate a method for ultrafast generation of hundreds of random bit streams in parallel with a single laser diode. Spatio-temporal interference of many lasing modes in a specially designed cavity is introduced as a scheme for greatly accelerated random bit generation. Spontaneous emission, caused by quantum fluctuations, produces stochastic noise that makes the bit streams unpredictable. We achieve a total bit rate of 250 terabits per second with off-line post-processing, which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the current post-processing record. Our approach is robust, compact, and energy efficient with potential applications in secure communication and high-performance computation."

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. Methods We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. Results Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls. Conclusions There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status. Almost half of cases are asymptomatic, and therefore undiagnosed by local testing strategies. These results cannot be explained by low assay specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3132778312,"Point mutations within the histone H3.3 are frequent in aggressive childhood brain tumors known as pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs). Intriguingly, distinct mutations arise in discrete anatomical regions: H3.3-G34R within the forebrain and H3.3-K27M preferentially within the hindbrain. The reasons for this contrasting etiology are unknown. By engineering human fetal neural stem cell cultures from distinct brain regions, we demonstrate here that cell-intrinsic regional identity provides differential responsiveness to each mutant that mirrors the origins of pHGGs. Focusing on H3.3-G34R, we find that the oncohistone supports proliferation of forebrain cells while inducing a cytostatic response in the hindbrain. Mechanistically, H3.3-G34R does not impose widespread transcriptional or epigenetic changes but instead impairs recruitment of ZMYND11, a transcriptional repressor of highly expressed genes. We therefore propose that H3.3-G34R promotes tumorigenesis by focally stabilizing the expression of key progenitor genes, thereby locking initiating forebrain cells into their pre-existing immature state."
https://openalex.org/W3130738521,"The origin of r-process elements Theoretical models predict that the synthesis of heavy elements by the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) occurs in extreme astrophysical environments such as neutron star mergers or some types of supernovae. Testing those predictions by comparing them with the isotopic record has been difficult. Côté et al. examined two r-process isotopes, iodine-129 and curium-247, both of which have half-lives of 15.6 million years. Therefore, their ratio remains constant even long after the nucleosynthesis event. The ratio of those isotopes at the time of Solar System formation is recorded in meteorites. Comparing this value with nuclear astrophysics calculations shows that the most likely source was moderately neutron-rich material ejected from a binary neutron star merger.

https://openalex.org/W3131548722,"H3.3G34R-mutant gliomas are lethal tumors of the cerebral hemispheres with unknown mechanisms of regional specificity and tumorigenicity. We developed a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based model of H3.3G34R-mutant glioma that recapitulates the key features of the tumors with cell-type specificity to forebrain interneuronal progenitors but not hindbrain precursors. We show that H3.3G34R, ATRX, and TP53 mutations cooperatively impact alternative RNA splicing events, particularly suppression of intron retention. This leads to increased expression of components of the Notch pathway, notably NOTCH2NL, a human-specific gene family. We also uncover a parallel mechanism of enhanced NOTCH2NL expression via genomic amplification of its locus in some H3.3G34R-mutant tumors. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby evolutionary pathways that lead to larger brain size in humans are co-opted to drive tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W3132495570,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate neurons throughout life in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. With advancing age, levels of neurogenesis sharply drop, which has been associated with a decline in hippocampal memory function. However, cell-intrinsic mechanisms mediating age-related changes in NSC activity remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1 (LB1) is downregulated with age in mouse hippocampal NSCs, whereas protein levels of SUN-domain containing protein 1 (SUN1), previously implicated in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), increase. Balancing the levels of LB1 and SUN1 in aged NSCs restores the strength of the endoplasmic reticulum diffusion barrier that is associated with segregation of aging factors in proliferating NSCs. Virus-based restoration of LB1 expression in aged NSCs enhances stem cell activity in vitro and increases progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in vivo. Thus, we here identify a mechanism that mediates age-related decline of neurogenesis in the mammalian hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W3130388974,"Despite dominating biodiversity in the Mesozoic, dinosaurs were not speciose. Oviparity constrained even gigantic dinosaurs to less than 15 kg at birth; growth through multiple morphologies led to the consumption of different resources at each stage. Such disparity between neonates and adults could have influenced the structure and diversity of dinosaur communities. Here, we quantified this effect for 43 communities across 136 million years and seven continents. We found that megatheropods (more than 1000 kg) such as tyrannosaurs had specific effects on dinosaur community structure. Although herbivores spanned the body size range, communities with megatheropods lacked carnivores weighing 100 to 1000 kg. We demonstrate that juvenile megatheropods likely filled the mesocarnivore niche, resulting in reduced overall taxonomic diversity. The consistency of this pattern suggests that ontogenetic niche shift was an important factor in generating dinosaur community structure and diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3131350548,"Background The world is becoming individualized due to modernization. International migration is one of the factors that lead to family dissociation and a lack of social support. Social support is viewed as a crucial factor that contributes to psychological well-being and satisfaction with life among migrants. However, very little is known about the impacts of social support on psychological distress and satisfaction with life among migrants. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the association of perceived social support with psychological distress and satisfaction with life among Nepalese migrants, and we evaluated the factors associated with receiving social support. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted with a convenience sample of Nepalese migrants (N = 249) living in Tokyo. Self-administered online questionnaires were distributed using social networks and chain referral methods. The measures included the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the General Health Questionnaire, and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Descriptive analysis, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 25. Results The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 31.8 years old (7.3). The family, friends, and significant others subscales of the multidimensional scale of perceived social support were negatively correlated with psychological distress (p&lt;0.01). The family subscale was positively correlated with satisfaction with life (p&lt;0.05), and the friend and significant others subscales were positively correlated with satisfaction with life (p&lt;0.01). Social support from the family was significantly and negatively associated with the type of visa (Beta = -0.160, p = 0.049), and marital status was negatively associated with support from significant others (Beta = -0.175, p = 0.024). Conclusion Social support from family, friends, and significant others was found to be influential in decreasing psychological distress and increasing satisfaction with life among Nepalese migrants in Tokyo. Strengthing social support system through the expansion of interpersonal network may help minimize the psychological distress"

https://openalex.org/W3129451191,"The development of thermogenic adipocytes concurs with mitochondrial biogenesis, an iron-dependent pathway. Iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1 and 2 are RNA-binding proteins that regulate intracellular iron homeostasis. IRPs bind to the iron-response element (IRE) of their target mRNAs, balancing iron uptake and deposition at the posttranscriptional levels. However, IRP/IRE-dependent iron regulation in adipocytes is largely unknown. We hypothesized that iron demands are higher in brown/beige adipocytes than white adipocytes to maintain the thermogenic mitochondrial capacity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the IRP/IRE regulatory system in different depots of adipose tissue. Our results revealed that 1) IRP/IRE interaction was increased in proportional to the thermogenic function of the adipose depot, 2) adipose iron content was increased in adipose tissue browning upon β3-adrenoceptor stimulation, while decreased in thermoneutral conditions, and 3) modulation of iron content was linked with mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the iron requirement was higher in HIB1B brown adipocytes than 3T3-L1 white adipocytes during differentiation. The reduction of the labile iron pool (LIP) suppressed the differentiation of brown/beige adipocytes and mitochondrial biogenesis. Using the 59Fe-Tf, we also demonstrated that thermogenic stimuli triggered cell-autonomous iron uptake and mitochondrial compartmentalization as well as enhanced mitochondrial respiration.

Collectively, our work demonstrated that IRP/IRE signaling and subsequent adaptation in iron metabolism are a critical determinant for the thermogenic function of adipocytes. At least three different types of adipocytes exist in mammals based on thermogenic capacity, nonthermogenic white adipocytes and two types of thermogenic adipocytes, i.e., constitutively brown and inducible beige adipocytes (1Peirce V. Carobbio S. Vidal-Puig A. The different shades of fat.Nature. 2014; 510: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). White adipocytes are specialized to store extra energy into triglyceride (TG), while brown/beige adipocytes are proficient in burning energy into heat (2Townsend K.L. Tseng Y.-H. Brown fat fuel utilization and thermogenesis.Trends Endrocrinol. Metab. 2014; 25: 168-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). White adipocytes have a big and unilocular lipid droplet to maximize the triglyceride storage capacity, while brown/beige adipocytes possess small and multilocular lipid droplets to facilitate beta-oxidation (2Townsend K.L. Tseng Y.-H. Brown fat fuel utilization and thermogenesis.Trends Endrocrinol. Metab. 2014; 25: 168-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to these morphological features, the brownish color of adipose tissue provides an immediate clue to distinguish the thermogenic capacity of the adipose depots. The brownish tint of adipocytes proportionally increases with the number of mitochondria and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). More precisely, the brownish color of thermogenic adipocytes stems from the iron–porphyrin complexes of the mitochondrial respiration chain (3Altshuler-Keylin S. Shinoda K. Hasegawa Y. Ikeda K. Hong H. Kang Q. Yang Y. Perera R.M. Debnath J. Kajimura S. Beige adipocyte maintenance is regulated by autophagy-induced mitochondrial clearance.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 402-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, nonheme iron found in the iron–sulfur cluster (Fe-S) proteins plays a crucial role in the redox reaction of electron transfer in mitochondria. Although these studies suggest that iron demands for brown/beige adipocytes are higher than that of white adipocytes, little information is available regarding the iron regulatory mechanisms that discern white, beige, and brown adipocytes. The depot specificity of adipose tissue is dependent on the developmental and transcriptional traits of the progenitor cells. It has been demonstrated that white and beige precursor cells share the white adipocyte lineage, while classical brown precursor cells share their ancestral lineage with myocytes (4Seale P. Bjork B. Yang W. Kajimura S. Chin S. Kuang S. Scime A. Devarakonda S. Conroe H.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch.Nature. 2008; 454: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Recently, the existence of four distinct adipocyte progenitors is identified in human mesenchymal stem cells that differentiate into different adipocyte subtypes (5Min S.Y. Desai A. Yang Z. Sharma A. DeSouza T. Genga R.M. Kucukural A. Lifshitz L.M. Nielsen S. Scheele C. Diverse repertoire of human adipocyte subtypes develops from transcriptionally distinct mesenchymal progenitor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 17970-17979Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, one of the key characteristics to discern thermogenic cell progenitors from white adipocyte precursors is the transcriptional capacity accumulating iron and protecting oxidative stress (5Min S.Y. Desai A. Yang Z. Sharma A. DeSouza T. Genga R.M. Kucukural A. Lifshitz L.M. Nielsen S. Scheele C. Diverse repertoire of human adipocyte subtypes develops from transcriptionally distinct mesenchymal progenitor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 17970-17979Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results implicate that the modification of iron metabolism constitutes the fundamental processes involving thermogenic adipocyte formation. The cellular iron metabolism is tightly regulated by the intracellular need of iron to coordinate iron uptake, storage, and export via iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1 and 2 (6Anderson C.P. Shen M. Eisenstein R.S. Leibold E.A. Mammalian iron metabolism and its control by iron regulatory proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1468-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). IRP1 and 2 are RNA-binding proteins that regulate iron metabolism-related gene expression in posttranscriptional levels. In iron adequate conditions, IRPs are unable to bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs). The Fe-S cluster binding-induced conformational change in IRP1 blocks its interaction with IREs at its target RNA species, and thus IPR1 mainly serves as cytosolic aconitase. IRP2 undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation in the presence of sufficient iron (6Anderson C.P. Shen M. Eisenstein R.S. Leibold E.A. Mammalian iron metabolism and its control by iron regulatory proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1468-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In iron-depleted conditions, IRPs bind to IREs at the 5′ or 3′ UTR of target mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron uptake, storage, and export; The IRP-IRE binding at the 3′ UTR region in transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) increases RNA stability, promoting iron uptake. In contrast, IRP-IRE binding at the 5′ UTR region in ferritin (Ft), an iron storage protein, represses its translation, which decreases iron sequestration but increases intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) (6Anderson C.P. Shen M. Eisenstein R.S. Leibold E.A. Mammalian iron metabolism and its control by iron regulatory proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1468-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Despite the well-established posttranscriptional regulation that cells have evolved to maintain the iron homeostasis against the fluctuating environmental iron, little is known about how this IRP/IRE regulatory system plays a role in the development of different adipocyte subtypes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the differential regulation of iron metabolism in white, brown, and beige adipogenesis by using the depot-specific adipose tissue as well as defined cell models of white, beige, and brown adipocytes. Our results demonstrate that enhanced IRP/IRE interaction and the subsequent iron influx into the mitochondria are essential for the differentiation of thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes. Cellular iron homeostasis is tightly regulated by two cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). IRPs/IRE regulatory system is likely operated in a cell-type-specific manner to satisfy metabolic needs. Based on the high metabolic rate of brown fat, we first hypothesized that iron demands and IRP/IRE interaction would be higher in brown adipose tissue than white adipose tissue. To investigate IRP/IRE binding, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using an IRDye700-labeled IRE probe with the cytosolic fractions prepared from epididymal (eWAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and interscapular brown fat (iBAT) that represent visceral, subcutaneous fat and classical brown fat, respectively. The IRP/IRE binding was barely noticeable, and only free IRE was observed in eWAT, while IRP/IRE binding was obvious in iWAT. In contrast to WAT, the IRP/IRE band was intense in the cytosolic fraction of iBAT, indicating the higher demands for iron in BAT than WAT (Fig. 1B). We next examined the expression levels of iron-handling proteins and mitochondrial respiratory components in each depot. In the basal levels, iron-deficiency responses (i.e., IRP2 accumulation, increased TfR1, and reduced FT light chain), were apparent in iBAT, but not in eWAT and iWAT (Fig. 2A, Left), which is consistent with the intense IRP/IRE-binding pattern (Fig. 1A). Notably, the endogenous levels of Fe-S cluster scaffold protein ISCU were distinctively lower in iBAT compared with iWAT or eWAT (Fig. 2A). The expression levels of the respiratory chain components were significantly higher in the iBAT than eWAT or iWAT, which is consistent with more mitochondrial OxPhos proteins in iBAT than WAT (7Moreno-Navarrete J.M. Ortega F. Moreno M. Ricart W. Fernández-Real J.M. Fine-tuned iron availability is essential to achieve optimal adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis.Diabetologia. 2014; 57: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reflecting the increased TfR1 protein expression in iBAT, the total iron content in iBAT was approximately threefold higher than in eWAT or iWAT (Fig. 2B). Next, we questioned whether the environmental stresses that alter the thermogenic potential could also modulate the intracellular iron content. To test this, we administrated the C57BL/6 mice with β3-adrenergic agonist CL 316,243 (CL) for 5 days to induce adipose tissue browning, and depot-specific adipose tissues were collected. In agreement with the fact that eWAT is less susceptible to adipose browning than iWAT, CL treatment did not affect the expression levels of UCP1 or IRP2 in eWAT. Importantly, enhanced browning in iWAT was accompanied by a significant increase of iron-starvation responses, including stabilized IRP2, increased TfR1, and decreased FTL and ISCU expression along with increased UCP1 expression (Fig. 2A, Right). Consistently, the iron content in iWAT was increased in response to CL treatment (Fig. 2C), with the rank order of iron content as eWAT < iWAT < iWATCL < iBAT. The increase of iron content in response to CL treatment was consistent with increased mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins (Fig. 2A, Right) and mitochondrial DNA content (Fig. 2D). Conversely, when the mice were kept in thermoneutral conditions (30 °C) for 2 weeks to dampen the thermogenesis, the iron content of adipose tissue was significantly reduced compared with iron levels at ambient temperature (22 °C) in all three adipose depots (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). Within the same temperature setting, iBAT maintained the highest iron content when compared with eWAT and iWAT (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). The decrease of UCP1 levels of iBAT at 30 °C induced an increase of FTL, suggesting an iron deposition into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E). Intriguingly, the reduction of IRP2 and TfR1 was not readily detectable in thermoneutral iBAT (Fig. 2E). Instead, we identified 1) upregulation of ER stress proteins, including CHOP, p-eIF2a, p-JNK, and p-38 (Fig. 2F); and 2) augmented autophagy, including the upregulation of autophagosome machinery (Beclin 1 and ATG5) and LC3II formation (Fig. 2G). These data imply that thermoneutral conditions induce ER stress in the iBAT and autophagic clearance of unnecessary mitochondria. Further, the iron released from the mitochondria seems to be sequestered into ferritin to avoid iron toxicity and exported out of iBAT. Taken together, the changes in the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissues are correlated with the control of the IRP/IRE signaling and iron homeostasis. Next, we questioned whether the regulation of IRP/IRE signaling and iron levels are the cell-autonomous mechanism that dictates white versus brown adipocyte differentiation. To address this question, 3T3-L1 and H1B1B cells, murine white and brown preadipocytes, respectively, were induced to differentiate (Fig. 3A), and we analyzed the kinetic changes of the proteins (Fig. 3) and mRNA (Fig. 4) related to iron regulation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Both 3T3-L1 and HIB1B cells were differentiated into lipid-laden mature adipocytes after 10 days of differentiation, showing the differentiation efficiency of ∼90% in both adipocytes (Fig. S1A). The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator in the complex process of adipocyte differentiation, was significantly increased over the differentiation process in both types of adipocytes. The protein levels of UCP1 and PRDM16, brown-specific markers, were markedly increased upon differentiation of brown adipocytes, which were negligible in white adipocytes. (Fig. 3B). In response to adipocyte differentiation, TfR1 expression continuously rises in brown adipocytes, while it showed only a transient increase of TfR1 in white adipocytes. In contrast to TfR1 expression, FTL was maintained remarkably low throughout the brown adipocyte differentiation, while FTL levels were kept high in white adipocytes with a transient decrease at day 4 (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the total iron content of 3T3L1 preadipocytes was higher than HIB1B preadipocytes, but it remained unchanged after 10 days of differentiation. However, the iron content of HIB1B cells was significantly increased after differentiation (62.5 versus 82.3 ng Fe/mg protein) (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that iron demands consistently rise for brown adipocyte differentiation, while iron demands are transiently increased only at the early differentiation process of white adipocytes, and the excess iron is stored as ferritin.Figure 4The increase of transferrin receptor 1 was specific to brown adipocytes and paralleled mitochondrial biogenesis during differentiation. HIB1B brown preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 white preadipocytes are differentiated into brown and white adipocytes, respectively. The kinetic changes (day 0, 4, 7, and 10) in mRNA levels during white or brown differentiation were measured qPCR (n = 3 for each time points/per group), A, mRNA levels of white adipocyte signature genes, PPARγ, adiponectin (AdipoQ), and Leptin, B, mRNA levels of brown adipocyte signature genes of Prdam16 and Ucp1 along with iron transporter Tfr1. C, mRNA levels of mitochondrial biogenesis related genes of Pgc1α, Tfam, and Crls1. In all data, 36b4 was the reference gene. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Two-way ANOVA analysis with two main factors of cell type (3T3-L1 or HIB1B) and differentiation time was used (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the differential regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 during brown versus white adipocyte differentiation. The abundance of IRP1 was gradually increased in both white and brown adipocytes, with a higher expression in brown than white adipocytes. Interestingly, the ISCU protein, a scaffold for synthesis of Fe-S cluster that masks IRP1-binding affinity to IRE, was higher in white adipocytes than in brown, suggesting that a bigger portion of IRP1 would be free to serve as RNA-binding protein in the brown adipocytes (Fig. 3D). In turn, IRP2 protein levels were barely detectable in white adipocytes upon full differentiation at day 10, while IRP2 accumulation showed an overt increase as early as 4 days postdifferentiation and continuously rose during brown adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 3D). IRP2, which does not bind a Fe-S cluster, is known to undergo targeted degradation by the iron-stabilized E3 ligase component FBXL5 (8Vashisht A.A. Zumbrennen K.B. Huang X. Powers D.N. Durazo A. Sun D. Bhaskaran N. Persson A. Uhlen M. Sangfelt O. Control of iron homeostasis by an iron-regulated ubiquitin ligase.Science. 2009; 326: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9Salahudeen A.A. Thompson J.W. Ruiz J.C. Ma H.-W. Kinch L.N.

An E3 ligase possessing an iron-responsive hemerythrin domain is a regulator of iron homeostasis.Science. 2009; 326: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This inverse relationship between FBXL5 and IRP2 was evident during adipocyte differentiation; the abundance of FBXL5 in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes correlated with a near absence of IRP2. Conversely, reduced FBXL5 protein in HIB1B adipocytes was enabled to escape FBXL5-mediated degradation and accumulate IRP2 within the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). Consequently, the augmented iron influx and low iron storage during brown adipocytes (Fig. 3, B and C) are under the coordinated regulation of IRP1 and 2 (Fig. 3D). In parallel with an increase of iron import during brown adipocyte differentiation, there was a significant increase of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins, suggesting that mitochondrial biogenesis is a key driving force for iron influx during brown adipocyte formation (Fig. 3E). Next, we compared the kinetic changes of mRNA levels related to white- and brown adipocyte formation and mitochondrial biogenesis. The analysis was conducted with two-way ANOVA to determine the individual effect of cell type and time. All genes were significantly increased during the differentiation process in both white and brown adipocytes (time < 0.0001) (Fig. 4). The increase of Pparγ and adiponectin (adipoQ) shows no statistical significance between two cell types, although adipoQ levels reached a higher plateau in white adipocytes (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, leptin gene expression was significantly higher in white adipocyte differentiation than brown adipocytes, confirming that leptin is a white adipocyte marker (Fig. 4A). The increase of brown-specific markers, such as Prdm16 and Ucp1, was significantly higher in brown adipocytes than white adipocytes (Fig. 4B), consistent with their protein expression (Fig. 3B). The mRNA expression levels of Tfr1 were distinctively higher in brown adipocytes than in white adipocytes (Fig. 4B), which conforms with the posttranscriptional control by IRPs to stabilize their target mRNAs that possess IRE at the 3’UTR (6Anderson C.P. Shen M. Eisenstein R.S. Leibold E.A. Mammalian iron metabolism and its control by iron regulatory proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1468-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The changes of mRNAs that are crucial for transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., Pgc1α and Tfam) were dramatically higher in brown adipocytes than white adipocytes (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the increase of mRNA of cardiolipin synthase 1 (Crls1) that is a critical phospholipid for mitochondrial biogenesis was dramatically higher in concomitant with brown differentiation compared with white differentiation (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results indicate that brown adipocyte, but not white, differentiation is concurrent with the expansion of LIP (increased uptake but decreased storage). This brown-specific iron metabolism is under the control of IRPs to promote iron influx via TfR1 and to meet the demands for mitochondrial biogenesis. The cellular LIP reflects transitory and chelatable iron. We hypothesized that limiting the LIP compromises the cell-autonomous brown adipocyte differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we depleted the cellular iron by adding deferoxamine (DFO, 100 nM), a cell-permeable iron chelator, during HIB1B adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5A). Chelation of intracellular iron right after adipocyte commitment step in HIB1B cells dampened brown adipocyte differentiation, including dramatic reductions in mRNA levels of Prdm16, Pparγ, Pgc1α, and Ucp1 (Fig. 5B) and their protein levels (Fig. 5C). The decrease of LIP was confirmed by decreased iron storage protein ferritin (Fig. 5C) and augmented Tfr1 mRNA (Fig. 5B) in the DFO-received cells compared with control. Accordingly, protein expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) components I to V, as well as cytochrome C, was significantly reduced in response to DFO treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). Notably, the abundance of respiratory components I and II, which contain eight and three moieties of the Fe-S clusters, is more strongly affected by DFO treatment than components III and IV, which contain one moiety of Fe-S cluster or only heme irons (10Xu W. Barrientos T. Andrews N.C. Iron and copper in mitochondrial diseases.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, component V, which has no iron, was minimally affected by DFO. These results are reminiscent of the iron limitation in myotubes by DFO treatment (11Rensvold J.W. Ong S.E. Jeevananthan A. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K. Pagliarini D.J. Complementary RNA and protein profiling identifies iron as a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the chelation of labile iron significantly interferes with the entire differentiation process of brown adipocytes. To determine the iron requirements during the beige differentiation, a similar experimental scheme was employed to C3H/10T1/2 cells, a pluripotent stem cell that is commonly used to obtain beige adipocytes (Fig. 5E). The DFO treatment in C3H/10T1/2 cells did not cause a significant difference in Prdm16 mRNA levels (Fig. 5F), but PRDM16 protein levels were significantly lower than the control (Fig. 5G). DFO treatment significantly depleted the LIP, evidenced by the iron starvation responses displaying FTL suppression and TfR1 and IRP2 induction (Fig. 5G). Compared with the complete inhibition of mitochondrial proteins in HIB1B cells (Fig. 5D), DFO treatment only affects complex I and II and cytochrome C levels without changes in complexes III, IV, and V (Fig. 5H). This result reflects the higher iron requirement of CI and CII. More importantly, UCP1 expression was almost completely blunted upon DFO treatment. Collectively, limited iron availability during adipocyte differentiation significantly disrupts the brown and beige adipocyte differentiation program per se, a lesser degree to beige, and posed a detrimental impact on thermogenic mitochondrial biogenesis. To reduce LIP without causing serious effects on the adipocyte transcriptional program, we selectively depleted the transferrin receptor 1 by adding the siRNA targeting TfR1 (siTfR1) in comparison with the nontargeting siRNA (siCont) during HIB1B differentiation (Fig. 6A). The addition of siTfR1 resulted in a decrease of Tfr1 mRNA levels by 40% (Fig. 6B) and its protein levels by ∼20% (Fig. 6, C and D). Reduction in ∼20% of TfR1 showed no significant challenge on adipocyte differentiation program, exhibiting similar levels of Prdm16, Pparγ, and Pgc1α compared with control (Fig. 6B). However, depletion of ∼20% of TfR1 expression resulted in ∼40% decrease of ferritin, indicating the reduced LIP size. Despite no noticeable differences in PPARγ (Fig. 6C) and mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins (Fig. S2), there was a significant reduction in UCP1 expression by 60% and a slight but significant reduction in cytochrome C by ∼15% (Fig. 6, C and D). Collectively, iron availability is a crucial determinant not only for brown adipocyte differentiation per se but also for competent thermogenic function. To confirm the role of IRP-dependent iron distribution in thermogenic adipocytes, we sought to compare the physical movement of iron and intracellular translocation during the white or beige adipocyte differentiation. To address this question, uncommitted human stromal vascular (hSV) cells were differentiated into either white or beige adipocytes (adding T3 and indomethacin) for 3 days, and then we measured iron uptake for 12 h by using 59Fe-Tf (transferrin bound 59Fe) as an iron tracer with or without cAMP analog. (Fig. 7A, upper). There was a substantial increase of 59Fe-Tf uptake after 3 days of incubation with beige differentiation medium compared with that of white differentiation (Fig. 7A, lower). Upon addition of dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2-cAMP), a cell-permeable nondegradable cAMP analog as key downstream signaling of β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation, the 59Fe-Tf uptake was further augmented by 1.8-fold in beige differentiation compared with white adipocytes (Fig. 7A). The intracellular distribution of 59Fe-iron between cytosol and mitochondria was tracked for 12 h. There was a stepwise decrease of cytosolic 59Fe, but a corresponding increase of mitochondrial 59Fe in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7B), indicating the redistribution of cytosolic iron into mitochondria and the maintenance of low-cytosolic iron status as a consequence. To obtain a better understanding of the relationship among iron demand, IRP activation, and adapted metabolic responses in adipocytes, we compared the iron-starvation responses induced by DFO (iron immobilization) versus Bt2-cAMP (adipocyte browning) stimulation. Similar to DFO responses in HIB1B and C3H/10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5), DFO treatment resulted in depletion of iron-storage protein FTL, stabilization of IRP2, and a robust increase of TfR1 expression in adipocytes as a collective sign of iron deficiency (Fig. 7C). However, DFO treatment decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig. 7D) as well as OxPhos protein expression (Fig. 7E), confirming the notion that adipocyte iron is required for mitochondrial function and respiratory protein transcription (7Moreno-Navarrete J.M. Ortega F. Moreno M. Ricart W. Fernández-Real J.M. Fine-tuned iron availability is essential to achieve optimal adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis.Diabetologia. 2014; 57: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Bt2-cAMP with human SV cells during beige differentiation triggered a substantial accumulation of IRP2, upregulation of TfR1, and slight reduction of FTL, which was comparable with DFO treatment (Fig. 7C). In contrast to DFO, Bt2-cAMP treatment resulted in increased OCR (Fig. 7D) and OxPhos protein expression compared with the control (Fig. 7E). These results suggest that IRP/IRE signaling should be coupled with external iron import and subsequent relocation into mitochondria for thermogenic mitochondrial development. Based on these results, we propose a novel iron-regulatory network that β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation instigates cell-autonomous iron movement into mitochondria, which creates an iron-gradient between cytosol and mitochondria, thereby leading to subsequent IRP binding to IRE and iron uptake for thermogenic activation. Iron is an essential but potentially hazardous biometal. Intracellular iron levels are tightly regulated in a narrow range to meet the lowest-sufficient level of cellular need, but to avoid the excess of harmful free iron (12Mackenzie E.L. Iwasaki K.

ATLL dysregulates various biological pathways related to the viral infection and cancer progression through the dysexpression of miRNAs and mRNAs. In this study, the potential regulatory subnetworks were constructed aiming to shed light on the pathogenesis mechanism of ATLL. For this purpose, two mRNA and one miRNA expression datasets were firstly downloaded from the GEO database. Next, the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs (DEGs and DE-miRNAs, respectively), as well as differentially co-expressed gene pairs (DCGs), were determined. Afterward, common DEGs and DCGs targeted by experimentally validated DE-miRNAs were explored. The oncogenic and anti-oncogenic miRNA-mRNA regulatory subnetworks were then generated. The expression levels of four genes and two miRNAs were examined in the blood samples by qRT-PCR. The members of three oncogenic/anti-oncogenic subnetworks were generally enriched in immune, virus, and cancer-related pathways. Among them, FZD6 , THBS4 , SIRT1 , CPNE3 , miR-142-3p, and miR-451a were further validated by real-time PCR. The significant up-regulation of FZD6 , THBS4 , and miR-451a as well as down-regulation of CPNE3 , SIRT1 , and miR-142-3p were found in ATLL samples than normal samples. The identified oncogenic/anti-oncogenic subnetworks are pieces of the pathogenesis puzzle of ATLL. The ultimate winner is probably an oncogenic network that determines the final fate of the disease. The identified genes and miRNAs are proposed as novel prognostic biomarkers for ATLL."

Methods Four microarray datasets containing primary prostate cancer samples and benign prostate samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), then differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by R software (version 3.6.2). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to identify the function of DEGs. Using STRING and Cytoscape (version 3.7.1), we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identified the hub gene of prostate cancer. Clinical data on GSE70770 and TCGA was collected to show the role of hub gene in prostate cancer progression. The correlations between hub gene and clinical parameters were also indicated by cox regression analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to highlight the function of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex (UBE2C) in prostate cancer. Results 243 upregulated genes and 298 downregulated genes that changed in at least two microarrays have been identified. GO and KEGG analysis indicated significant changes in the oxidation-reduction process, angiogenesis, TGF-beta signaling pathway. UBE2C, PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3), topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and MKI67 were identified as the candidate hub genes, which were all correlated with prostate cancer patient’ disease-free survival in TCGA. In fact, only UBE2C was highly expressed in prostate cancer when compared with benign prostate tissue in TCGA and the expression of UBE2C was also in parallel with the Gleason score of prostate cancer. Cox regression analysis has indicated UBE2C could function as the independent prognostic factor of prostate cancer. GSEA showed UBE2C had played an important role in the pathway of prostate cancer, such as NOTCH signaling pathway, WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway. Conclusions UBE2C was pivotal for the progression of prostate cancer and the level of UBE2C was important to predict the prognosis of patients."

https://openalex.org/W3133203186,"Collagen is the most abundant protein in humans. It has a characteristic triple-helix structure and is heavily posttranslationally modified. The complex biosynthesis of collagen involves processing by many enzymes and chaperones in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) is required to hydroxylate lysine for cross-linking and carbohydrate attachment within collagen triple helical sequences. Additionally, a recent study of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3) demonstrated that this enzyme may be critical for LH1 activity; however, the details surrounding its involvement remain unclear. If P3H3 is an LH1 chaperone that is critical for LH1 activity, P3H3 and LH1 null mice should display a similar deficiency in lysyl hydroxylation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the amount and location of hydroxylysine in the triple helical domains of type V and I collagen from P3H3 null, LH1 null, and wild-type mice. The amount of hydroxylysine in type V collagen was reduced in P3H3 null mice, but surprisingly type V collagen from LH1 null mice contained as much hydroxylysine as type V collagen from wild-type mice. In type I collagen, our results indicate that LH1 plays a global enzymatic role in lysyl hydroxylation. P3H3 is also involved in lysyl hydroxylation, particularly at cross-link formation sites, but is not required for all lysyl hydroxylation sites. In summary, our study suggests that LH1 and P3H3 likely have two distinct mechanisms to recognize different collagen types and to distinguish cross-link formation sites from other sites in type I collagen."
https://openalex.org/W3131237470,"The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20 th in Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe overload during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal possible new health system stress periods with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people “overcrowded” social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of possible new health system overloads, we analysed data both from Twitter and emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Particularly, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast new stress periods. Since we analysed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis."
https://openalex.org/W3132832555,"Neutrophils participate in the early phase of the innate response to uncomplicated influenza A virus (IAV) infection but also are a major component in later stages of severe IAV or COVID 19 infection where neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and associated cell free histones are highly pro-inflammatory. It is likely that IAV interacts with histones during infection. We show that histone H4 binds to IAV and aggregates viral particles. In addition, histone H4 markedly potentiates IAV induced neutrophil respiratory burst responses. Prior studies have shown reactive oxidants to be detrimental during severe IAV infection. C reactive protein (CRP) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) rise during IAV infection. We now show that both of these innate immune proteins bind to histone H4 and significantly down regulate respiratory burst and other responses to histone H4. Isolated constructs composed only of the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D also bind to histone H4 and partially limit neutrophil responses to it. These studies indicate that complexes formed of histones and IAV are a potent neutrophil activating stimulus. This finding could account for excess inflammation during IAV or other severe viral infections. The ability of CRP and SP-D to bind to histone H4 may be part of a protective response against excessive inflammation in vivo."

Comparisons of clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters were performed across all phenotypic groups of PCOS and with controls (n = 270) by Welch’s ANOVA with subsequent Games-Howell post-hoc test. We found maximum prevalence of normoandrogenic phenotype D, which is milder form of PCOS in terms of insulin resistance, gonadotropin levels and dyslipidemia, followed by phenotype A, in our total study population. After classification of the study group into lean and obese groups, only few insulin and lipid-related traits showed marked differences between phenotypes. Further, we noted that obese women showed adverse metabolic but not androgenic traits compared to lean counterparts in the same phenotype. Metabolic syndrome frequency is increased in hyperandrogenic phenotypes with HDL-C and waist circumference being most predominant contributing factors in total, lean and obese groups. We demonstrate that in our study population there is greater occurrence of phenotype D of PCOS.

https://openalex.org/W3129915561,"Recent studies have shown that the expression of ENPP1 is related to differentiation, death, dissemination and chemosensitivity of tumor cells. So far, there is no research in ovarian carcinoma. This study aimed at exploring the role of ENPP1 gene in ovarian carcinoma, the relationship with prognostic indicators and chemotherapy resistance, and investigates the possibility of molecular targeted therapy. The expression of ENPP1 in 41 normal ovarian epithelial tissues, 97 ovarian serous cystadenoma and 103 HGSOC tissues was detected by IHC. In ovarian cancer tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines, mRNA and protein expression of ENPP1 was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The ENPP1 expression was knockdowned by siRNA. Cell proliferation was measured with the BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA. Cell migration and invasion were detected by Wound-Healing, Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assay. Caspase 3 activity was determined by the CaspACE. The expression of EMT markers such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin was measured, and the expression of PCNA and MMP9 was also be detected. The results showed that the expression of ENPP1 was significantly increased in high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, the number of strong expression was 85.4% (22.3%+63.1%) and only 1.03% (1.03%+0.0%) in serous cystadenoma, but no in normal ovarian epithelium (P&lt; 0.05). And the stronger the expression of ENPP1, the later the FIGO stage and the poorer differentiation of cells (P = 0.001 or &lt;0.001, respectively). However, no correlation was found between the expression of ENPP1 and chemosensitivity. ENPP1 was also highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, CaoV3, OVCAR3, SKOV3 and 3ao). After down-regulation of ENPP1 expression by RNA interference, the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cell decreased significantly, the expression of apoptosis related gene caspase 3 increased significantly, while the expression of PCNA and MMP9 was significantly down regulated. In addition, EMT biological characteristics of A2780 and SKOV3 cells were also inhibited. In summary, the increased expression of ENPP1 may be related to the occurrence of HGSOC, and indicate that the disease progresses rapidly and the prognosis is poor. ENPP1 may be considered as a potential molecular therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3130074383,"Plant detritus represents the major source of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and changes in its quantity can influence below-ground biogeochemical processes in forests. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how above- and belowground detrital inputs affect soil C and N in mountain forests in an arid land. Here, we explored the effects of litter and root manipulations (control (CK), doubled litter input (DL), removal of litter (NL), root exclusion (NR), and a combination of litter removal and root exclusion (NI)) on soil C and N concentrations, enzyme activity and microbial biomass during a 2-year field experiment. We found that DL had no significant effect on soil total organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) but significantly increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass C, N and inorganic N as well as soil cellulase, phosphatase and peroxidase activities. Conversely, NL and NR reduced soil C and N concentrations and enzyme activities. We also found an increase in the biomass of soil bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes in the DL treatment, while NL reduced the biomass of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungi by 5.15%, 17.50% and 14.17%, respectively. The NR decreased the biomass of these three taxonomic groups by 8.97%, 22.11% and 21.36%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that soil biotic factors (enzyme activity and microbial biomass) and abiotic factors (soil moisture content) significantly controlled the change in soil C and N concentrations ( P &lt; 0.01). In brief, we found that the short-term input of plant detritus could markedly affect the concentrations and biological characteristics of the C and N fractions in soil. The removal experiment indicated that the contribution of roots to soil nutrients is greater than that of the litter."
https://openalex.org/W3130216862,"Natural biopolymer-based hydrogels especially agarose and collagen gels, considering their biocompatibility with cells and their capacity to mimic biological tissues, have widely been used for in-vitro experiments and tissue engineering applications in recent years; nevertheless their mechanical properties are not always optimal for these purposes. Regarding the importance of the mechanical properties of hydrogels, many mechanical characterization studies have been carried out for such biopolymers. In this work, we have focused on understanding the mechanical role of agarose and collagen concentration on the hydrogel strength and elastic behavior. In this direction, Amirkabir Magnetic Bead Rheometry (AMBR) characterization device equipped with an optimized electromagnet, was designed and constructed for the measurement of hydrogel mechanical properties. The operation of AMBR set-up is based on applying a magnetic field to actuate magnetic beads in contact with the gel surface in order to actuate the gel itself. In simple terms the magnetic beads leads give rise to mechanical shear stress on the gel surface when under magnetic influence and together with the associated bead-gel displacement it is possible to calculate the hydrogel shear modulus. Agarose and Collagen gels with respectively 0.2–0.6 wt % and 0.2–0.5 wt % percent concentrations were prepared for mechanical characterization in terms of their shear modulus. The shear modulus values for the different percent concentrations of the agarose gel were obtained in the range 250–650 Pa, indicating the shear modulus increases by increasing in the agar gel concentration. In addition to this, the values of shear modulus for the collagen gel increase as function of concentration in the range 240–520 Pa in accordance with an approximately linear relationship between collagen concentration and gel strength."
https://openalex.org/W3131660639,"Background Considering the high invasiveness and mortality of glioma as well as the unclear key genes and signaling pathways involved in the development of gliomas, there is a strong need to find potential gene biomarkers and available drugs. Methods Eight glioma samples and twelve control samples were analyzed on the GSE31095 datasets, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained via the R software. The related glioma genes were further acquired from the text mining. Additionally, Venny program was used to screen out the common genes of the two gene sets and DAVID analysis was used to conduct the corresponding gene ontology analysis and cell signal pathway enrichment. We also constructed the protein interaction network of common genes through STRING, and selected the important modules for further drug-gene analysis. The existing antitumor drugs that targeted these module genes were screened to explore their efficacy in glioma treatment. Results The gene set obtained from text mining was intersected with the previously obtained DEGs, and 128 common genes were obtained. Through the functional enrichment analysis of the identified 128 DEGs, a hub gene module containing 25 genes was obtained. Combined with the functional terms in GSE109857 dataset, some overlap of the enriched function terms are both in GSE31095 and GSE109857. Finally, 4 antitumor drugs were identified through drug-gene interaction analysis. Conclusions In this study, we identified that two potential genes and their corresponding four antitumor agents could be used as targets and drugs for glioma exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3129326394,"Background and objective During pregnancy, absence from work increases significantly. Job adjustments have been shown to decrease absences; however, studies show only half of pregnant women who need job adjustments receive them. Little is known about the viewpoints of managers and possible challenges in the management of pregnant employees. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and considerations of managers in relation to managing pregnant hospital staff members and to describe the experiences of an active management policy for pregnant individuals. Methods A qualitative study based on five focus group interviews was conducted at five public hospitals in Zealand, Denmark with participation of 19 hospital managers, from 17 different wards, representing six different medical specialties. The interviews took place from February to May 2019. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results Four themes were identified: (1) The everyday management, (2) Managerial dilemmas, (3) Acknowledging the workplace culture, and (4) Dialogue as a means for the working relationship. The managers’ experiences revolved around investing a lot of effort into the working relationship with pregnant staff members by adjusting job tasks and work schedules while balancing work tasks between all staff members. The dialogue was considered central in order to identify the needs of the individual staff member. Conclusions Overall, management dialogue constituted a central tool in order to identify the needs of the individual staff member. A proactive and open approach increased the chances of a fruitful dialogue. The individual staff member, the influence of the workplace culture, and the everyday management of the workplace all shaped the experiences of the managers. The concept of an active management policy for pregnant individuals was perceived to entail useful elements, but also as replicating what managers already did."
https://openalex.org/W3131513453,"Right ventricular dysfunction is a predictor for worse outcomes in patients with congenital heart disease. Myocardial ischemia is primarily associated with right ventricular dysfunction in patients with congenital heart disease and may be a therapeutic target for right ventricular dysfunction. Previously, autologous skeletal myoblast patch therapy showed an angiogenic effect for left ventricular dysfunction through cytokine paracrine effects; however, its efficacy in right ventricular dysfunction has not been evaluated. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the angiogenic effect of autologous skeletal myoblast patch therapy and amelioration of metabolic and functional dysfunction, in a pressure-overloaded right heart porcine model. Pulmonary artery stenosis was induced by a vascular occluder in minipigs; after two months, autologous skeletal myoblast patch implantation on the right ventricular free wall was performed (n = 6). The control minipigs underwent a sham operation (n = 6). The autologous skeletal myoblast patch therapy alleviated right ventricular dilatation and ameliorated right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. 11 C-acetate kinetic analysis using positron emission tomography showed improvement in myocardial oxidative metabolism and myocardial flow reserve after cell patch implantation. On histopathology, a higher capillary density and vascular maturity with reduction of myocardial ischemia were observed after patch implantation. Furthermore, analysis of mRNA expression revealed that the angiogenic markers were upregulated, and ischemic markers were downregulated after patch implantation. Thus, autologous skeletal myoblast patch therapy ameliorated metabolic and functional dysfunction in a pressure-overloaded right heart porcine model, by alleviating myocardial ischemia through angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3132786165,"The human auditory system often relies on relative pitch information to extract and identify auditory objects; such as when the same melody is played in different keys. The current study investigated the mental chronometry underlying the active discrimination of unfamiliar melodic six-tone patterns by measuring behavioural performance and event-related potentials (ERPs). In a roving standard paradigm, such patterns were either repeated identically within a stimulus train, carrying absolute frequency information about the pattern, or shifted in pitch (transposed) between repetitions, so only relative pitch information was available to extract the pattern identity. Results showed that participants were able to use relative pitch to detect when a new melodic pattern occurred. Though in the absence of absolute pitch sensitivity significantly decreased and behavioural reaction time to pattern changes increased. Mismatch-Negativity (MMN), an ERP indicator of auditory deviance detection, was elicited at approximately 206 ms after stimulus onset at frontocentral electrodes, even when only relative pitch was available to inform pattern discrimination. A P3a was elicited in both conditions, comparable in amplitude and latency. Increased latencies but no differences in amplitudes of N2b, and P3b suggest that processing at higher levels is affected when, in the absence of absolute pitch cues, relative pitch has to be extracted to inform pattern discrimination. Interestingly, the response delay of approximately 70 ms on the behavioural level, already fully manifests at the level of N2b. This is in accordance with recent findings on implicit auditory learning processes and suggests that in the absence of absolute pitch cues a slowing of target selection rather than a slowing of the auditory pattern change detection process causes the deterioration in behavioural performance."
https://openalex.org/W3130114639,"Identifying barriers and facilitators in HIV-indicator reporting contributes to strengthening HIV monitoring and evaluation efforts by acknowledging contributors to success, as well as identifying weaknesses within the system that require improvement. Nonetheless, there is paucity in identifying and comparing barriers and facilitators in HIV-indicator data reporting among facilities that perform well and those that perform poorly at meeting reporting completeness and timeliness requirements. Therefore, this study aims to use a qualitative approach in identifying and comparing the current state of barriers and facilitators in routine reporting of HIV-indicators by facilities performing well, and those performing poorly in meeting facility reporting completeness and timeliness requirements to District Health Information Software2 (DHIS2). A multiple qualitative case study design was employed. The criteria for case selection was based on performance in HIV-indicator facility reporting completeness and timeliness. Areas of interest revolved around reporting procedures, organizational, behavioral, and technical factors. Purposive sampling was used to identify key informants in the study. Data was collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 participants, and included archival records on facility reporting performance, looking into documentation, and informal direct observation at 13 facilities in Kenya. Findings revealed that facilitators and barriers in reporting emerged from the following factors: interrelationship between workload, teamwork and skilled personnel, role of an EMRs system in reporting, time constraints, availability and access-rights to DHIS2, complexity of reports, staff rotation, availability of trainings and mentorship, motivation, availability of standard operating procedures and resources. There was less variation in barriers and facilitators faced by facilities performing well and those performing poorly. Continuous evaluations have been advocated within health information systems literature. Therefore, continuous qualitative assessments are also necessary in order to determine improvements and recurring of similar issues. These assessments have also complemented other quantitative analyses related to this study."
https://openalex.org/W3132145087,"A single instrument that includes multiple optical channels was developed to simultaneously measure various optical and associated biophysical characteristics of a bacterial colony. The multi-channel device can provide five distinct optical features without the need to transfer the sample to multiple locations or instruments. The available measurement channels are bright-field light microscopy, 3-D colony-morphology map, 2-D spatial optical-density distribution, spectral forward-scattering pattern, and spectral optical density. The series of multiple morphological interrogations is beneficial in understanding the bio-optical features of a bacterial colony and the correlations among them, resulting in an enhanced power of phenotypic bacterial discrimination. To enable a one-shot interrogation, a confocal laser scanning module was built as an add-on to an upright microscope. Three different-wavelength diode lasers were used for the spectral analysis, and high-speed pin photodiodes and CMOS sensors were utilized as detectors to measure the spectral OD and light-scatter pattern. The proposed instrument and algorithms were evaluated with four bacterial genera, Escherichia coli , Listeria innocua , Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus ; their resulting data provided a more complete picture of the optical characterization of bacterial colonies."
https://openalex.org/W3129735533,"In the present study, we have quantified the effects of transport, relocation and acclimate/adapt to their new surroundings on female squirrel monkey. These responses are measured in blood samples obtained from squirrel monkeys, at different time points relative to their relocation from their old home to their new home. A group of squirrel monkeys we transported, by truck, for approximately 10 hours. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were assayed in order to evaluate the phenotype of lymphocyte subsets by flow, mitogen-specific immune responses of PBMCs in vitro, and levels of cytokines at various time points including immediately before transport, immediately upon arrival, and after approximately 150 days of acclimation. We observed significant changes in T cells and subsets, NK and B cells (CD4 + , CD8 + , CD4 + /CD8 + , CD16 + , and CD20 + ). Mitogen specific ( e . g . PHA, PWM and LPS) proliferation responses, IFN-γ by ELISPOT assay, and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and VEGF) significant changes were observed. Changes seen in the serum chemistry measurements mostly complement those seen in the hematology data. The specific goal was to empirically assess the effects of relocation stress in squirrel monkeys in terms of changes in the numbers and functions of various leukocyte subsets in the blood and the amount of time required for acclimating to their new environment. Such data will help to determine when newly arrived animals become available for use in research studies."

https://openalex.org/W3130088121,"On the morning of my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I rolled out of bed, showered, and slid into my navy blue blazer and matching checkered pants. Next came the makeup. I brushed on a layer of foundation and drew thick black lines around my eyes—a look that signified the boldness I wanted to embody during my presentation. I put on heels and walked around my apartment, a test drive to ensure I wouldn't collapse on the floor in pain. After a few laps, I looked in the mirror. I felt confident—ready to face the members of my Ph.D. committee and answer whatever questions they threw at me. It's a strategy I developed thanks to an unlikely inspiration: Lady Gaga.



> “My naturally shy and quiet personality was not exactly ideal for public speaking.” 

I've always struggled with being confident. As an undergraduate, my heart pounded whenever I raised my hand to answer questions posed by professors. I knew the material, but the prospect of getting the answer wrong in front of all my classmates was daunting.

Later, in graduate school, I especially feared giving presentations about my research. Beforehand, I would practice for hours on end. I knew I risked sounding rehearsed and boring, but calming my nerves was more important. The practice helped somewhat, but on presentation day, I still sounded flustered.

I pored over books to find the best ways to format and outline a presentation. If I had clear slides, I reasoned, maybe then I'd have the courage to speak with authority. I ended up with well-designed slides, but I could not present them any better.

Unlocking the key to my confidence was much more difficult than I anticipated. I realized I couldn't expect to wake up one day, look in the mirror, and say, “OK, today is the big day; today I am going to be confident.” But perhaps I could find a creative solution that would work for me.

The breakthrough came during the month before my qualifying exam—a major milestone in my Ph.D. program that triggered waves of self-doubt—when I listened to a Lady Gaga album titled Joanne . As an avid fan, I noticed it sounded completely different from her past albums. She had switched from her usual dance-pop to soft rock and country, and her outfits—now cowgirl getups—had changed as well. I was intrigued. Lady Gaga was taking a huge professional risk, but she was confident in the music she released, confident in herself, and confident in her ability to adopt a new image.

That got me thinking: Could I do something similar before I stepped on stage? My naturally shy and quiet personality was not exactly ideal for public speaking, so I thought about the traits and the image I wanted my professional self to possess. I pictured a steady, clear voice and a tall, commanding stance. I imagined myself as the expert in the room who wasn't afraid to say, “I'm not sure.” I thought about the moments when I felt the most put together, when I wore professional clothing and highlighted my features through makeup. To me, makeup wasn't a mask. It signified boldness, femininity, and self-assurance—all traits I associated with strength and power.

I experimented with the idea during a practice presentation at home. I stood next to my laptop in professional attire, speaking loudly and fluidly—a sharp contrast to my usual practice routine, which involved sitting at my desk in pajamas speaking quietly. It was a promising start. I decided to give my new presenter persona a try at my qualifying exam.

When I walked into the exam room, I was pleased to discover I had a newfound confidence. Sure, I was nervous, but an unfamiliar sense of calm rushed through me as soon as I began my talk. I was able to answer questions without a quaver in my voice, and I took ownership of the work I presented. Finally, I was the expert. At that moment, I realized that we either succumb to feelings of doubt or find innovative ways to overcome them.

In the years since, my presenter persona has given me confidence during many talks and interviews, and I've become more comfortable transforming into this role when necessary. There's no surefire way to become a confident presenter. But thanks to Lady Gaga, I now have a strategy that works."
https://openalex.org/W3132076874,"Background Hydrocele is a chronic condition in males in which there is an excessive collection of straw-colored fluid, which leads to enlargement of the scrotum. It is a common manifestation of lymphatic filariasis (LF) affecting nearly 25 million men worldwide. Surgery is the recommended treatment for hydrocele and is available free of cost in all government hospitals in Nepal. This research explored patient, provider, and community factors related to accessing hydrocele surgery services by the patients. Methods This study employed a qualitative method. The research was conducted in two LF endemic districts, namely Kanchanpur and Dhading, which are reported to have the highest number of hydrocele cases during morbidity mapping conducted in 2016. In addition to five key informant interviews with the LF focal persons (one national and 4 district-level), nine in-depth interviews were conducted with hydrocele patients (5 of whom had undergone surgery and 4 who had not undergone surgery) and with 3 family members, and two focus group discussions with the female community health volunteers. Results Most of the respondents did not have knowledge of hydrocele as one of the clinical manifestations of LF nor that it is transmitted through a mosquito bite. Although perceived as treatable with surgery, most of the patients interviewed believed in as well as practiced home remedies. Meanwhile, fear of surgery, embarrassment, lack of money, along with no knowledge of the free hydrocele surgery acted as barriers for accessing the surgery. On the other hand, financial support, flexible guidelines enabling the hospital to conduct surgery, decentralization and scaling up of morbidity mapping along with free hydrocele surgery camps in any remaining endemic districts were identified as enablers for accessing surgery. Conclusion Hydrocele surgery coverage could be improved if the program further addresses community awareness. There is a need for more focus on information dissemination about hydrocele and hydrocele surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3132190377,"Background Abdominal obesity predict metabolic syndrome parameters at low levels of waist circumference (WC) in Africans. At the same time, the African lipid profile phenotype of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol without concomitant elevated triglyceride levels renders high triglyceride levels detrimental to cardiometabolic health unsuitable for identifying cardiometabolic risk in black African populations. Objectives We aimed to identify simple clinical measures for cardiometabolic risk based on WC and HDL in an adult Kenyan population in order to determine which of the two predictors had the strongest impact. Methods We used linear regression analyses to assess the association between the two exposure variables WC and HDL with cardiometabolic risk factors including ultrasound-derived visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) accumulation, fasting and 2-h venous glucose, fasting insulin, fasting lipid profile, and blood pressure in adult Kenyans (n = 1 370), and a sub-population with hyperglycaemia (diabetes and pre-diabetes) (n = 196). The same analyses were performed with an interaction between WC and HDL to address potential effect modification. Ultrasound-based, semi-quantitative hepatic steatosis assessment was used as a high-risk measure of cardiometabolic disease. Results Mean age was 38.2 (SD 10.7) (range 17–68) years, mean body mass index was 22.3 (SD 4.5) (range 13.0–44.8) kg/m 2 , and 57.8% were women. Cardiometabolic risk was found in the association between both WC and HDL and all outcome variables (p&lt;0.05) except for HDL and SAT, fasting and 2-h venous glucose. Additive cardiometabolic risk (WC and HDL interaction) was found for SAT, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. No differences in the association between WC and HDL and the outcome variables were found when comparing the full study population and the hyperglycaemia sub-population. Increase in WC and HDL were both associated with hepatic steatosis (OR 1.09, p&lt;0.001, and OR 0.46, p = 0.031, respectively). Conclusion In adult Kenyans, increasing WC identified more cardiometabolic risk factors compared to HDL."
