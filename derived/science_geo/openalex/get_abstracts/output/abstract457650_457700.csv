https://openalex.org/W2083725282,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The gut-derived endotoxin plays an essential role in the pathophysiological development and progression of NAFLD. By using rat models of choline-deficient/L-amino acid-defined (CDAA)-diet-induced NAFLD, we examined whether MIYAIRI 588–a butyrate-producing probiotic – prevents the progression of pathophysiological changes from steatosis to hepatocarcinogenesis. In vivo experiments showed that treatment with MIYAIRI 588 reduced CDAA-diet-induced hepatic lipid deposition and significantly improved the triglyceride content, insulin resistance, serum endotoxin levels, and hepatic inflammatory indexes. We also found that MIYAIRI 588 substantially increased the activation of hepatic adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT and the expression of lipogenesis- or lipolysis-related proteins. MIYAIRI 588 also improved CDAA-diet-induced delocalization and substantially decreased the expression of the tight-junction proteins intestinal zonula occluden-1 and occludin in CDAA-diet-fed rats. Further, the MIYAIRI 588-treated rats also showed remarkable induction of nuclear factor erythoid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its targeted antioxidative enzymes, which suppressed hepatic oxidative stress. In vitro studies revealed that treatment with sodium butyrate (NaB) also activated AMPK and AKT and enhanced Nrf2 expression by precluding ubiquitination, thereby increasing the half-life of the Nrf2 protein. Pharmacological studies and siRNA knockdown experiments showed that NaB-mediated AMPK activation induced the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Sirtuin 1, leading to the increased assembly of mammalian TOR complex 2 and phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 and subsequent induction of Nrf2 expression and activation. These favorable changes caused an obvious decrease in hepatic fibrous deposition, GST-P-positive foci development, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Our data clearly established that the probiotic MIYAIRI 588 has beneficial effects in the prevention of NAFLD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2059137431,"Objective Brain dopamine dysfunction in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could explain why stimulant medications, which increase dopamine signaling, are therapeutically beneficial. However while the acute increases in dopamine induced by stimulant medications have been associated with symptom improvement in ADHD the chronic effects have not been investigated. Method We used positron emission tomography and [11C]cocaine (dopamine transporter radioligand) to measure dopamine transporter availability in the brains of 18 never-medicated adult ADHD subjects prior to and after 12 months of treatment with methylphenidate and in 11 controls who were also scanned twice at 12 months interval but without stimulant medication. Dopamine transporter availability was quantified as non-displaceable binding potential using a kinetic model for reversible ligands. Results Twelve months of methylphenidate treatment increased striatal dopamine transporter availability in ADHD (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum: +24%, p<0.01); whereas there were no changes in control subjects retested at 12-month interval. Comparisons between controls and ADHD participants revealed no significant difference in dopamine transporter availability prior to treatment but showed higher dopamine transporter availability in ADHD participants than control after long-term treatment (caudate: p<0.007; putamen: p<0.005). Conclusion Upregulation of dopamine transporter availability during long-term treatment with methylphenidate may decrease treatment efficacy and exacerbate symptoms while not under the effects of the medication. Our findings also suggest that the discrepancies in the literature regarding dopamine transporter availability in ADHD participants (some studies reporting increases, other no changes and other decreases) may reflect, in part, differences in treatment histories."
https://openalex.org/W2079723480,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelinating and degenerative processes within the central nervous system. Unlike conventional MRI,new advanced imaging techniques improve pathological specificity and better highlight the relationship between anatomical damage and clinical impairment. Objective To investigate the relationship between clinical disability and both grey (GM) and white matter (WM) regional damage in MS patients. Methods Thirty-six relapsing remitting-MS patients and 25 sex- and age-matched controls were enrolled. All patients were clinically evaluated by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scale, which includes the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), the timed 25-feet walking test (T25FW) and the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT). All subjects were imaged by a 3.0 T scanner: dual-echo fast spin-echo, 3DT1-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) sequences were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were run for regional GM and WM assessment, respectively. T2 lesion volumes were also calculated, by using a semi-automated technique. Results Brain volumetric assessment of GM and DTI measures revealed significant differences between patients and controls. In patients, different measures of WM damage correlated each-other (p<0.0001), whereas none of them correlated with GM volume. In patients, focal GM atrophy and widespread WM damage significantly correlated with clinical measures. In particular, VBM analysis revealed a significant correlation (p<0.05) between GM volume and 9HPT in cerebellum and between GM volume and PASAT in orbito-frontal cortex. TBSS showed significant correlations between DTI metrics with 9HPT and PASAT scores in many WM bundles (p<0.05), including corpus callosum, internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiations, cerebral peduncles. Conclusions Selective GM atrophy and widespread WM tracts damage are associated with functional impairment of upper-limb motion and cognition. The combined analysis of volumetric and DTI data may help to better understand structural alterations underlying physical and cognitive dysfunction in MS."
https://openalex.org/W1975387938,"We have previously reported that the mitochondria inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), induces the expression of DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator1 (DRAM1) and activation of autophagy in rat striatum. Although the role of DRAM1 in autophagy has been previously characterized, the detailed mechanism by which DRAM1 regulates autophagy activity has not been fully understood. The present study investigated the role of DRAM1 in regulating autophagy flux. In A549 cells expressing wilt-type TP53, 3-NP increased the protein levels of DRAM1 and LC3-II, whereas decreased the levels of SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1). The increase in LC3-II and decrease in SQSTM1 were blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl-adenine. Lack of TP53 or knock-down of TP53 in cells impaired the induction of DRAM1. Knock-down of DRAM1 with siRNA significantly reduced 3-NP-induced upregulation of LC3-II and downregulation of SQSTM1, indicating DRAM1 contributes to autophagy activation. Knock-down of DRAM1 robustly decreased rate of disappearance of induced autophagosomes, increased RFP-LC3 fluorescence dots and decreased the decline of LC3-II after withdraw of rapamycin, indicating DRAM1 promotes autophagy flux. DRAM1 siRNA inhibited lysosomal V-ATPase and acidification of lysosomes. As a result, DRAM1 siRNA reduced activation of lysosomal cathepsin D. Similar to DRAM1 siRNA, lysosomal inhibitors E64d and chloroquine also inhibited clearance of autophagosomes and activation of lysosomal cathapsin D after 3-NP treatment. These data suggest that DRAM1 plays important roles in autophagy activation induced by mitochondria dysfunction. DRAM1 affects autophagy through argument of lysosomal acidification, fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes and clearance of autophagosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2078617909,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to cancer through their involvement in cancer invasion and metastasis. We evaluated genetic variation in MMP1 (9 SNPs), MMP2 (8 SNPs), MMP3 (4 SNPs), and MMP9 (3 SNPs) and breast cancer risk among Hispanic (2111 cases, 2597 controls) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) (1481 cases, 1586 controls) women in the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study. Ancestral informative markers (n = 104) were assessed to determine Native American (NA) ancestry. MMP1 [4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] and MMP2 (2 SNPs) were associated with breast cancer overall. MMP1 rs996999 had strongest associations among women with the most NA ancestry (OR 1.61,95% CI 1.09,2.40) as did MMP3 rs650108 (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05,1.75) and MMP9 rs3787268 (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09,2.13). The adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) showed a significant pathway partp value of 0.04, with a stronger association among women with the most NA ancestry (partp = 0.02). Significant pathway genes using the ARTP were MMP1 for all women (partp = 0.02) and MMP9 for women with the most NA ancestry (partp = 0.024); MMP2 was borderline significant overall (partp = 0.06) and MMP1 and MMP3 were borderline significant for women with the most NA ancestry (partp = 0.07 and 0.06 respectively). MMP1 and MMP2 were associated with ER+/PR+ and ER+/PR-tumors; MMP3 and MMP9 were associated with ER−/PR− tumors. The pathway was highly significant with survival (partp = 0.0041) with MMP2 having the strongest gene association (partp = 0.0007). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in MMP genes influence breast cancer development and survival in this genetically admixed population."
https://openalex.org/W2088846648,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play a vital role in regulate tumor progression and invasion. However, the expression of miR-339-5p in colorectal cancer and its effects are not known. Here, we report that miR-339-5p is a tumor suppressor by regulating expression of PRL-1. In this study, we showed that downregulated miR-339-5p levels in colorectal cancer tissues and highly invasive CRC cell lines. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of miR-339-5p inhibited CRC cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. We then screened and identified a novel miR-339-5p target, phosphatases of regenerating liver-1 1 (PRL-1), and it was further confirmed by luciferase assay. Overexpression of miR-339-5p would also reduce the expression of PRL-1 mRNA and protein. The reduced PRL-1 expression was associated with low expression of phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulatedkinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2). Conversely, reduction of miR-339-5p by inhibitors in cells stimulated these phenotypes. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-339-5p functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a role in inhibiting growth and metastasis of CRC cells through targeting PRL-1 and regulating p-ERK1/2 .These findings suggest that miR-339-5p may be useful as a new potential therapeutic target for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2087268897,"The osteolytic nature of bone metastasis results from a tumor-driven increased bone resorption. Bone remodeling is orchestrated by the molecular triad RANK-RANKL-OPG. This process is dysregulated in bone metastases, mostly via induction of RANKL by tumor-derived factors. These factors increase expression of RANKL, which induce osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby increasing bone resorption. RANK is unexpectedly expressed by cancer cells, and the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway correlates with an increased invasive phenotype. To investigate the interaction between RANK expression in human breast and prostate cancer cells and their pro-metastatic phenotype we analyzed the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway and its effects on cell migration, invasion, gene expression in vitro, and osteolysis-inducing ability in vivo. RANKL activates kinase signaling pathways, stimulates cell migration, increases cell invasion, and up-regulates MMP-1 expression. In vivo, MMP-1 knockdown resulted in smaller x-ray osteolytic lesions and osteoclastogenesis, and decreased tumor burden. Therefore, RANKL inhibition in bone metastatic disease may decrease the levels of the osteoclastogenesis inducer MMP-1, contributing to a better clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2095031298,"Dendritic spines are are small membranous protrusions that extend from neuronal dendrites and harbor the majority of excitatory synapses. Increasing evidence has shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of extracellularly acting and Zn(2+)-dependent endopeptidases, are able to rapidly modulate dendritic spine morphology. Spine head protrusions (SHPs) are filopodia-like processes that extend from the dendritic spine head, representing a form of postsynaptic structural remodeling in response to altered neuronal activity. Herein, we show that chemically induced long-term potentiation (cLTP) in dissociated hippocampal cultures upregulates MMP-9 activity that controls the formation of SHPs. Blocking of MMPs activity or microtubule dynamics abolishes the emergence of SHPs. In addition, autoactive recombinant MMP-9, promotes the formation of SHPs in organotypic hippocampal slices. Furthermore, spines with SHPs gained postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors upon cLTP and the synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors was controlled by MMPs. The present results strongly imply that MMP-9 is functionally involved in the formation of SHPs and the control of postsynaptic receptor distribution upon cLTP."
https://openalex.org/W2038266768,"Though difficult, the study of gene-environment interactions in multifactorial diseases is crucial for interpreting the relevance of non-heritable factors and prevents from overlooking genetic associations with small but measurable effects. We propose a “candidate interactome” (i.e. a group of genes whose products are known to physically interact with environmental factors that may be relevant for disease pathogenesis) analysis of genome-wide association data in multiple sclerosis. We looked for statistical enrichment of associations among interactomes that, at the current state of knowledge, may be representative of gene-environment interactions of potential, uncertain or unlikely relevance for multiple sclerosis pathogenesis: Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, HHV8-Kaposi sarcoma, H1N1-influenza, JC virus, human innate immunity interactome for type I interferon, autoimmune regulator, vitamin D receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and a panel of proteins targeted by 70 innate immune-modulating viral open reading frames from 30 viral species. Interactomes were either obtained from the literature or were manually curated. The P values of all single nucleotide polymorphism mapping to a given interactome were obtained from the last genome-wide association study of the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium & the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2. The interaction between genotype and Epstein Barr virus emerges as relevant for multiple sclerosis etiology. However, in line with recent data on the coexistence of common and unique strategies used by viruses to perturb the human molecular system, also other viruses have a similar potential, though probably less relevant in epidemiological terms."
https://openalex.org/W2093252486,"Although mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is characterized by the pathological changes in mesial temporal lobe, function alteration was also found in extratemporal regions. Our aim is to investigate the information flow between the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and other brain regions. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data were recorded from 23 patients with left mTLE and matched controls. We first identified the potential EZ using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of RS-fMRI signal, then performed voxel-wise Granger causality analysis between EZ and the whole brain. Relative to controls, patients demonstrated decreased driving effect from EZ to thalamus and basal ganglia, and increased feedback. Additionally, we found an altered causal relation between EZ and cortical networks (default mode network, limbic system, visual network and executive control network). The influence from EZ to right precuneus and brainstem negatively correlated with disease duration, whereas that from the right hippocampus, fusiform cortex, and lentiform nucleus to EZ showed positive correlation. These findings demonstrate widespread brain regions showing abnormal functional interaction with EZ. In addition, increased ALFF in EZ was positively correlated with the increased driving effect on EZ in patients, but not in controls. This finding suggests that the initiation of epileptic activity depends not only on EZ itself, but also on the activity emerging in large-scale macroscopic brain networks. Overall, this study suggests that the causal topological organization is disrupted in mTLE, providing valuable information to understand the pathophysiology of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2076014547,"Background Evidence has been provided that a cell-based therapy combined with the use of bioactive materials may significantly improve bone regeneration prior to dental implant, although the identification of an ideal source of progenitor/stem cells remains to be determined. Aim In the present research, the bone regenerative property of an emerging source of progenitor cells, the amniotic epithelial cells (AEC), loaded on a calcium-phosphate synthetic bone substitute, made by direct rapid prototyping (rPT) technique, was evaluated in an animal study. Material And Methods Two blocks of synthetic bone substitute (∼0.14 cm3), alone or engineered with 1×106 ovine AEC (oAEC), were grafted bilaterally into maxillary sinuses of six adult sheep, an animal model chosen for its high translational value in dentistry. The sheep were then randomly divided into two groups and sacrificed at 45 and 90 days post implantation (p.i.). Tissue regeneration was evaluated in the sinus explants by micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), morphological, morphometric and biochemical analyses. Results And Conclusions The obtained data suggest that scaffold integration and bone deposition are positively influenced by allotransplantated oAEC. Sinus explants derived from sheep grafted with oAEC engineered scaffolds displayed a reduced fibrotic reaction, a limited inflammatory response and an accelerated process of angiogenesis. In addition, the presence of oAEC significantly stimulated osteogenesis either by enhancing bone deposition or making more extent the foci of bone nucleation. Besides the modulatory role played by oAEC in the crucial events successfully guiding tissue regeneration (angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor expression and inflammation), data provided herein show that oAEC were also able to directly participate in the process of bone deposition, as suggested by the presence of oAEC entrapped within the newly deposited osteoid matrix and by their ability to switch-on the expression of a specific bone-related protein (osteocalcin, OCN) when transplanted into host tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1975316819,"Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) severely damages and reduces the yield of many economically important plants worldwide. In this study, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 10 TSWV isolates recently identified from various regions and hosts in Korea. Phylogenetic analysis of these 10 isolates as well as the three previously sequenced isolates indicated that the 13 Korean TSWV isolates could be divided into two groups reflecting either two different origins or divergences of Korean TSWV isolates. In addition, the complete nucleotide sequences for the 13 Korean TSWV isolates along with previously sequenced TSWV RNA segments from Korea and other countries were subjected to phylogenetic and recombination analysis. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that both the RNA L and RNA M segments of most Korean isolates might have originated in Western Europe and North America but that the RNA S segments for all Korean isolates might have originated in China and Japan. Recombination analysis identified a total of 12 recombination events among all isolates and segments and five recombination events among the 13 Korea isolates; among the five recombinants from Korea, three contained the whole RNA L segment, suggesting reassortment rather than recombination. Our analyses provide evidence that both recombination and reassortment have contributed to the molecular diversity of TSWV."
https://openalex.org/W2086838022,"Infectious mastitis cuts down milk production profitability and is a major animal welfare problem. Bacteria-induced inflammation in the mammary gland (MG) is driven by innate immunity, but adaptive immunity can modulate the innate response. Several studies have shown that it is possible to elicit inflammation in the MG by sensitization to an antigen subsequently infused into the lumen of the gland. The objective of our study was to characterize the inflammation triggered in the MG of cows sensitized to ovalbumin, by identifying the cytokines and chemokines likely to play a part in the reaction. Among immunized cows, responders mobilized locally high numbers of leukocytes. An overexpression of the genes encoding IL-17a, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 and INF-γ was found in milk cell RNA extracts in the early phase of the inflammatory response. At the protein level, IL-17A was detected in milk as soon as the first sampling time (8 h post-challenge), and both IL-17A and IFN-γ concentrations peaked at 12 to 24 h post-challenge. In mammary tissue from challenged quarters, overexpression of the genes encoding IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-26 and IFN-γ was observed. Neutrophil-attracting chemokines (CXCL3 and CXCL8) were found in milk, and overexpressed transcripts of chemokines attracting lymphocytes and other mononuclear leukocytes (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CCL20) were detected in mammary tissue. Expression of IL-17A, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, was located in epithelial cells, in leukocytes in the connective tissue and in association with the epithelium, and in migrated alveolar leukocytes of challenged quarters. Altogether, these results show that antigen-specific inflammation in the MG was characterized by the production of IL-17 and IFN-γ. The orientation of the inflammatory response induced by the antigen-specific response has the potential to strongly impact the outcome of bacterial infections of the MG."
https://openalex.org/W1976912355,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is critical to promote maternal health and prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). The separation of services for antenatal care (ANC) and ART may hinder antenatal ART initiation. We evaluated ART initiation during pregnancy under different service delivery models in Cape Town, South Africa.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected clinic data. Three models for ART initiation in pregnancy were evaluated ART 'integrated' into ANC, ART located 'proximal' to ANC, and ART located some distance away from ANC ('distal'). Kaplan-Meier methods and Poisson regression were used to examine the association between service delivery model and antenatal ART initiation.Among 14 617 women seeking antenatal care in the three services, 30% were HIV-infected and 17% were eligible for ART based on CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL. A higher proportion of women started ART antenatally in the integrated model compared to the proximal or distal models (55% vs 38% vs 45%, respectively, global p = 0.003). After adjusting for age and gestation at first ANC visit, women who at the integrated service were significantly more likely to initiate ART antenatally (rate ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.64) compared to women attending the distal model; there was no difference between the proximal and distal models in antenatal ART initiation however (p = 0.704).Integration of ART initiation into ANC is associated with higher levels of ART initiation in pregnancy. This and other forms of service integration may represent a valuable intervention to enhance PMTCT and maternal health."
https://openalex.org/W2059823715,"The chlamydial inclusion membrane is extensively modified by the insertion of type III secreted effector proteins. These inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) are exposed to the cytosol and share a common structural feature of a long, bi-lobed hydrophobic domain but little or no primary amino acid sequence similarity. Based upon secondary structural predictions, over 50 putative inclusion membrane proteins have been identified in Chlamydia trachomatis. Only a limited number of biological functions have been defined and these are not shared between chlamydial species. Here we have ectopically expressed several C. trachomatis Incs in HeLa cells and find that they induce the formation of morphologically distinct membranous vesicular compartments. Formation of these vesicles requires the bi-lobed hydrophobic domain as a minimum. No markers for various cellular organelles were observed in association with these vesicles. Lipid probes were incorporated by the Inc-induced vesicles although the lipids incorporated were dependent upon the specific Inc expressed. Co-expression of Inc pairs indicated that some colocalized in the same vesicle, others partially overlapped, and others did not associate at all. Overall, it appears that Incs may have an intrinsic ability to induce membrane formation and that individual Incs can induce membranous structures with unique properties."
https://openalex.org/W1992556168,"The Mycobacterium abscessus complex is an emerging cause of chronic pulmonary infection in patients with underlying lung disease. The M. abscessus complex is regarded as an environmental pathogen but its molecular adaptation to the human lung during long-term infection is poorly understood. Here we carried out a longitudinal molecular epidemiological analysis of 178 M. abscessus spp. isolates obtained from 10 cystic fibrosis (CF) and 2 non CF patients over a 13 year period. Multi-locus sequence and molecular typing analysis revealed that 11 of 12 patients were persistently colonized with the same genotype during the course of the infection while replacement of a M. abscessus sensu stricto strain with a Mycobacterium massiliense strain was observed for a single patient. Of note, several patients including a pair of siblings were colonized with closely-related strains consistent with intra-familial transmission or a common infection reservoir. In general, a switch from smooth to rough colony morphology was observed during the course of long-term infection, which in some cases correlated with an increasing severity of clinical symptoms. To examine evolution during long-term infection of the CF lung we compared the genome sequences of 6 sequential isolates of Mycobacterium bolletii obtained from a single patient over an 11 year period, revealing a heterogeneous clonal infecting population with mutations in regulators controlling the expression of virulence factors and complex lipids. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the epidemiology of M. abscessus spp. during long-term infection of the CF lung, and the molecular transition from saprophytic organism to human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1989734072,"Murine very small embryonic-like (VSEL) cells, defined by the Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-) phenotype and small size, were described as pluripotent cells and proposed to be the most primitive hematopoietic precursors in adult bone marrow. Although their isolation and potential application rely entirely on flow cytometry, the immunophenotype of VSELs has not been extensively characterized. Our aim was to analyze the possible heterogeneity of Lin(-)Sca(+)CD45(-) population and investigate the extent to which VSELs characteristics may overlap with that of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The study evidenced that murine Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-) population was heterogeneous in terms of c-Kit and KDR expression. Accordingly, the c-Kit(+)KDR(-), c-Kit(-)KDR(+), and c-Kit(-)KDR(-) subpopulations could be distinguished, while c-Kit(+)KDR(+) events were very rare. The c-Kit(+)KDR(-) subset contained almost solely small cells, meeting the size criterion of VSELs, in contrast to relatively bigger c-Kit(-)KDR(+) cells. The c-Kit(-)KDR(-)FSC(low) subset was highly enriched in Annexin V-positive, apoptotic cells, hence omitted from further analysis. Importantly, using qRT-PCR, we evidenced lack of Oct-4A and Oct-4B mRNA expression either in whole adult murine bone marrow or in the sorted of Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-)FSC(low) population, even by single-cell qRT-PCR. We also found that the Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-)c-Kit(+) subset did not exhibit hematopoietic potential in a single cell-derived colony in vitro assay, although it comprised the Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)Lin(-) (SKL) CD34(-)CD45(-)CD105(+) cells, expressing particular HSC markers. Co-culture of Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-)FSC(low) with OP9 cells did not induce hematopoietic potential. Further investigation revealed that SKL CD45(-)CD105(+) subset consisted of early apoptotic cells with fragmented chromatin, and could be contaminated with nuclei expelled from erythroblasts. Concluding, murine bone marrow Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-)FSC(low) cells are heterogeneous population, which do not express the pluripotency marker Oct-4A. Despite expression of some hematopoietic markers by a Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD45(-)c-Kit(+)KDR(-) subset of VSELs, they do not display hematopoietic potential in a clonogenic assay and are enriched in early apoptotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2170030229,"Cigarette smoking is increased in people with trait anxiety and anxiety disorders, however no longitudinal data exist illuminating whether smoking in adolescence can influence the developmental trajectory of anxiety symptoms from early vulnerability in infancy to adult anxiety expression. Using The Tracing Opportunities and Problems in Childhood and Adolescence (TOPP) Study, a community-based cohort of children and adolescents from Norway who were observed from the age of 18months to age 18–19years, we explored the relationship between adolescent smoking, early vulnerability for anxiety in infancy (e.g. shyness, internalizing behaviors, emotional temperaments) and reported early adult anxiety. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that adolescent active smoking was positively associated with increased early adulthood anxiety (β = 0.17, p<0.05), after controlling for maternal education (proxy for socioeconomic status). Adolescent anxiety did not predict early adult smoking. Adolescent active smoking was a significant effect modifier in the relationship between some infant vulnerability factors and later anxiety; smoking during adolescence moderated the relationship between infant internalizing behaviors (total sample: active smokers: β = 0.85,p<0.01, non-active smokers: ns) and highly emotional temperament (total sample: active smokers: β = 0.55,p<0.01,non-active smokers: ns), but not shyness, and anxiety in early adulthood. The results support a model where smoking acts as an exogenous risk factor in the development of anxiety, and smoking may alter the developmental trajectory of anxiety from infant vulnerability to early adult anxiety symptom expression. Although alternative non-mutually exclusive models may explain these findings, the results suggest that adolescent smoking may be a risk factor for adult anxiety, potentially by influencing anxiety developmental trajectories. Given the known adverse health effects of cigarette smoking and significant health burden imposed by anxiety disorders, this study supports the importance of smoking prevention and cessation programs targeting children and adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2130478113,"A lysine instead of the usual carboxyl group is in place of the internal proton donor to the retinal Schiff base in the light-driven proton pump of Exiguobacterium sibiricum (ESR). The involvement of this lysine in proton transfer is indicated by the finding that its substitution with alanine or other residues slows reprotonation of the Schiff base (decay of the M intermediate) by more than 2 orders of magnitude. In these mutants, the rate constant of the M decay linearly decreases with a decrease in proton concentration, as expected if reprotonation is limited by the uptake of a proton from the bulk. In wild type ESR, M decay is biphasic, and the rate constants are nearly pH-independent between pH 6 and 9. Proton uptake occurs after M formation but before M decay, which is especially evident in D2O and at high pH. Proton uptake is biphasic; the amplitude of the fast phase decreases with a pKa of 8.5 ± 0.3, which reflects the pKa of the donor during proton uptake. Similarly, the fraction of the faster component of M decay decreases and the slower one increases, with a pKa of 8.1 ± 0.2. The data therefore suggest that the reprotonation of the Schiff base in ESR is preceded by transient protonation of an initially unprotonated donor, which is probably the ε-amino group of Lys-96 or a water molecule in its vicinity, and it facilitates proton delivery from the bulk to the reaction center of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1974061038,"Boar taint is an unpleasant smell and taste of pork meat derived from some entire male pigs. The main causes of boar taint are the two compounds androstenone (5α-androst-16-en-3-one) and skatole (3-methylindole). It is crucial to understand the genetic mechanism of boar taint to select pigs for lower androstenone levels and thus reduce boar taint. The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome differences in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). The total number of reads produced for each testis and liver sample ranged from 13,221,550 to 33,206,723 and 12,755,487 to 46,050,468, respectively. In testis samples 46 genes were differentially regulated whereas 25 genes showed differential expression in the liver. The fold change values ranged from -4.68 to 2.90 in testis samples and -2.86 to 3.89 in liver samples. Differentially regulated genes in high androstenone testis and liver samples were enriched in metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and molecular transport. This study provides evidence for transcriptome profile and gene polymorphisms of boars with divergent androstenone level using RNA-Seq technology. Digital gene expression analysis identified candidate genes in flavin monooxygenease family, cytochrome P450 family and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family. Moreover, polymorphism and association analysis revealed mutation in IRG6, MX1, IFIT2, CYP7A1, FMO5 and KRT18 genes could be potential candidate markers for androstenone levels in boars. Further studies are required for proving the role of candidate genes to be used in genomic selection against boar taint in pig breeding programs."

Also the array of targets whose inhibition results in Mucorales death is limited. Recently, researchers identified mitochondria as important regulators of detoxification and virulence mechanisms in fungi. In this context, targeting the mitochondrial respiratory chain may provide a new platform for antifungal development. We hypothesized that targeting respiratory pathways potentiates triazoles activity via apoptosis. We found that simultaneous administration of antimycin A (AA) and benzohydroxamate (BHAM), inhibitors of classical and alternative mitochondrial pathways respectively, resulted in potent activity of posaconazole (PCZ) and itraconazole (ICZ) against Rhizopus oryzae. We observed cellular changes characteristic of apoptosis in R. oryzae cells treated with PCZ or ICZ in combination with AA and BHAM. The fungicidal activity of this combination against R. oryzae was correlated with intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation (ROS), phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and increased caspase like activity. DNA fragmentation and condensation assays also revealed apoptosis of R. oryzae cells. These apoptotic features were prevented by the addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. Taken together, these findings suggest that the use of PCZ or ICZ in combination with AA and BHAM makes R. oryzae exquisitely sensitive to treatment with triazoles via apoptosis. This strategy may serve as a new model for the development of improved or novel antifungal agents."
https://openalex.org/W2080639894,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) is a major therapeutic target for cancer. We recently reported that IGF1 directly binds to integrins (αvβ3 and α6β4) and induces ternary complex formation (integrin-IGF1-IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)) and that the integrin binding-defective mutant of IGF1 (R36E/R37E) is defective in signaling and ternary complex formation. These findings predict that R36E/R37E competes with WT IGF1 for binding to IGF1R and inhibits IGF signaling. Here, we described that excess R36E/R37E suppressed cell viability increased by WT IGF1 in vitro in non-transformed cells. We studied the effect of R36E/R37E on viability and tumorigenesis in cancer cell lines. We did not detect an effect of WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E in cancer cells under anchorage-dependent conditions. However, under anchorage-independent conditions, WT IGF1 enhanced cell viability and induced signals, whereas R36E/R37E did not. Notably, excess R36E/R37E suppressed cell viability and signaling induced by WT IGF1 under anchorage-independent conditions. Using cancer cells stably expressing WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E, we determined that R36E/R37E suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo, whereas WT IGF1 markedly enhanced it. R36E/R37E suppressed the binding of WT IGF1 to the cell surface and the subsequent ternary complex formation induced by WT IGF1. R36E/R37E suppressed activation of IGF1R by insulin. WT IGF1, but not R36E/R37E, induced ternary complex formation with the IGF1R/insulin receptor hybrid. These findings suggest that 1) IGF1 induces signals under anchorage-independent conditions and that 2) R36E/R37E acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of IGF1R (IGF1 decoy). Our results are consistent with a model in which ternary complex formation is critical for IGF signaling."

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) that target GD2 have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of GD2 expressing tumors, and are expected to be the new standard of care for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma. In this study, the crystal structure of anti-GD2 murine MoAb 3F8 was solved to 1.65 Å resolution and used as a template for molecular docking simulations of its antigen, the penta-saccharide head group of GD2. Molecular docking revealed a binding motif composed of 12 key interacting amino acid side-chains, involving an extensive network of interactions involving main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonding, two Pi – CH interactions, and an important charged interaction between Arg95 of the H3 loop with the penultimate sialic acid residue of GD2. Based on in silico scanning mutagenesis of the 12 interacting amino acids from the docked 3F8:GD2 model, a single point mutation (Heavy Chain: Gly54Ile) was engineered into a humanized 3F8 (hu3F8) MoAb and found to have a 6–9 fold enhancement in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines. With enhanced tumor-killing properties, the re-engineered hu3F8 has the potential be a more effective antibody for the treatment of GD2-positive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2082129456,"Reducing health inequalities is a key objective for many governments and public health organizations. Whether inequalities are measured on the absolute (difference) or relative (ratio) scale can have a significant impact on judgments about whether health inequalities are increasing or decreasing, but both of these measures are not often presented in empirical studies. In this study we investigated the impact of selective presentation of health inequality measures on judgments of health inequality trends among 40 university undergraduates. We randomized participants to see either a difference or ratio measure of health inequality alongside raw mortality rates in 5 different scenarios. At baseline there were no differences between treatment groups in assessments of inequality trends, but selective exposure to the same raw data augmented with ratio versus difference inequality graphs altered participants’ assessments of inequality change. When absolute inequality decreased and relative inequality increased, exposure to ratio measures increased the probability of concluding that inequality had increased from 32.5% to 70%, but exposure to difference measures did not (35% vs. 25%). Selective exposure to ratio versus difference inequality graphs thus increased the difference between groups in concluding that inequality had increased from 2.5% (95% CI −9.5% to 14.5%) to 45% (95% CI 29.4 to 60.6). A similar pattern was evident for other scenarios where absolute and relative inequality trends gave conflicting results. In cases where measures of absolute and relative inequality both increased or both decreased, we did not find any evidence that assignment to ratio vs. difference graphs had an impact on assessments of inequality change. Selective reporting of measures of health inequality has the potential to create biased judgments of progress in ameliorating health inequalities."

We examine male behavior toward testing and condom use.To determine factors associated with never testing for HIV and consistent condom use among men who never test in Soweto.A cross-sectional survey in Soweto was conducted in 1539 men aged 18-32 years in 2007. Data were collected on socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics to determine factors associated with not testing and consistent condom use.Over two thirds (71%) of men had not had an HIV test and the majority (55%, n = 602) were young (18-23). Of those not testing, condom use was poor (44%, n = 304). Men who were 18-23 years (aOR: 2.261, CI: 1.534-3.331), with primary (aOR: 2.096, CI: 1.058-4.153) or high school (aOR: 1.622, CI: 1.078-2.439) education, had sex in the last 6 months (aOR: 1.703, CI: 1.055-2.751), and had ≥1 sexual partner (aOR: 1.749, CI: 1.196-2.557) were more likely not to test. Of those reporting condom use (n = 1036, 67%), consistent condom use was 43% (n = 451). HIV testing did not correlate with condom use.Low rates of both condom use and HIV testing among men in a high HIV prevalence setting are worrisome and indicate an urgent need to develop innovative behavioral strategies to address this shortfall. Condom use is poor in this population whether tested or not tested for HIV, indicating no association between condom use and HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W2014716867,"Poor prognosis and resistance to therapy in malignant gliomas is mainly due to the highly dispersive nature of glioma cells. This dispersive characteristic results from genetic alterations in key regulators of cell migration and diffusion. A better understanding of these regulatory signals holds promise to improve overall survival and response to therapy. Using mapping arrays to screen for genomic alterations in gliomas, we recently identified alterations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa gene (PTPRK) that correlate to patient outcomes. These PTPRK alterations are very relevant to glioma biology as PTPRK can directly sense cell-cell contact and is a dephosphorylation regulator of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling, which is a major driving force behind tumor development and progression. Subsequent sequencing of the full length PTPRK transcripts revealed novel PTPRK gene deletion and missense mutations in numerous glioma biopsies. PTPRK mutations were cloned and expressed in PTPRK-null malignant glioma cells. The effect of these mutations on PTPRK anti-oncogenic function and their association with response to anti-glioma therapeutics, such as temozolomide and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was subsequently analyzed using in vitro cell-based assays. These genetic variations altered PTPRK activity and its post-translational processing. Reconstitution of wild-type PTPRK in malignant glioma cell lines suppressed cell growth and migration by inhibiting EGFR and β-catenin signaling and improved the effect of conventional therapies for glioma. However, PTPRK mutations abrogated tumor suppressive effects of wild-type PTPRK and altered sensitivity of glioma cells to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2073625243,"Our group has recently demonstrated that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection significantly associates with T1D in Sardinian adult patients. Due to the potential role played by MAP in T1D pathogenesis, it is relevant to better characterize the prevalence of anti-MAP antibodies (Abs) in the Sardinian population, studying newly diagnosed T1D children. Therefore, we investigated the seroreactivity against epitopes derived from the ZnT8 autoantigen involved in children at T1D onset and their homologous sequences of the MAP3865c protein. Moreover, sera from all individuals were tested for the presence of Abs against: the corresponding ZnT8 C-terminal region, the MAP specific protein MptD, the T1D autoantigen GAD65 and the T1D unrelated Acetylcholine Receptor. The novel MAP3865c281-287 epitope emerges here as the major C-terminal epitope recognized. Intriguingly ZnT8186-194 immunodominant peptide was cross-reactive with the homologous sequences MAP3865c133-141, strengthening the hypothesis that MAP could be an environmental trigger of T1D through a molecular mimicry mechanism. All eight epitopes were recognized by circulating Abs in T1D children in comparison to healthy controls, suggesting that these Abs could be biomarkers of T1D. It would be relevant to investigate larger cohorts of children, followed over time, to elucidate whether Ab titers against these MAP/Znt8 epitopes wane after diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068720315,"Here we examined ocular pursuit and spatial estimation in a linear prediction motion task that emphasized extrapolation of occluded accelerative object motion. Results from the ocular response up to occlusion showed that there was evidence in the eye position, velocity and acceleration data that participants were attempting to pursue the moving object in accord with the veridical motion properties. They then attempted to maintain ocular pursuit of the randomly-ordered accelerative object motion during occlusion but this was not ideal, and resulted in undershoot of eye position and velocity at the moment of object reappearance. In spatial estimation there was a general bias, with participants less likely to report object reappearance being behind than ahead of the expected position. In addition, participants’ spatial estimation did not take into account the effects of object acceleration. Logistic regression indicated that spatial estimation was best predicted for the majority of participants by the difference between actual object reappearance position and an extrapolation based on pre-occlusion velocity. In combination, and in light of previous work, we interpret these findings as showing that eye movements are scaled in accord with the effects of object acceleration but do not directly specify information for accurate spatial estimation in prediction motion."
https://openalex.org/W2037017822,"Birth order has been suggested to be linked to several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, but the evidence is still inconsistent. We aim to determine the associations of birth order with body mass index (BMI), muscle strength and blood pressure. Further we will analyse whether these relationships are affected by family characteristics.BMI, elbow flexion, hand grip and knee extension strength and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at conscription examination in 1,065,710 Swedish young men born between 1951 and 1975. The data were analysed using linear multivariate and fixed effects regression models; the latter compare siblings and account for genetic and social factors shared by brothers.Fixed effect regression analysis showed that birth order was inversely associated with BMI: second and third born had 0.8% and 1.1% (p<0.001) lower BMI than first-born, respectively. The association pattern differed among muscle strengths. After adjustment for BMI, first-born presented lower elbow flexion and hand grip strength than second-born (-5.9 N and -3.8 N, respectively, p<0.001). Knee extension strength was inversely related to birth order though not always significantly. The association between birth order and blood pressure was not significant.Birth order is negatively associated with BMI and knee extension strength, positively with elbow flexion and hand grip strength, and is not associated with blood pressure among young men. Although the effects are small, the link between birth order and some CVD risk factors is already detectable in young adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2068911533,"Purpose This study investigated possible mechanisms of autoregulation of Ca2+ signalling pathways in adipocytes responsible for Ca2+ and NO oscillations and switching phenomena promoted by acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Methods Fluorescent microscopy was used to detect changes in Ca2+ and NO in cultures of rodent white adipocytes. Agonists and inhibitors were applied to characterize the involvement of various enzymes and Ca2+-channels in Ca2+ signalling pathways. Results ACh activating M3-muscarinic receptors and Gβγ protein dependent phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase induces Ca2+ and NO oscillations in adipocytes. At low concentrations of ACh which are insufficient to induce oscillations, NE or α1, α2-adrenergic agonists act by amplifying the effect of ACh to promote Ca2+ oscillations or switching phenomena. SNAP, 8-Br-cAMP, NAD and ANP may also produce similar set of dynamic regimes. These regimes arise from activation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) with the implication of a long positive feedback loop (PFL): Ca2+→ NO→cGMP→cADPR→Ca2+, which determines periodic or steady operation of a short PFL based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release via RyR by generating cADPR, a coagonist of Ca2+ at the RyR. Interplay between these two loops may be responsible for the observed effects. Several other PFLs, based on activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or of protein kinase B by Ca2+-dependent kinases, may reinforce functioning of main PFL and enhance reliability. All observed regimes are independent of operation of the phospholipase C/Ca2+-signalling axis, which may be switched off due to negative feedback arising from phosphorylation of the inositol-3-phosphate receptor by protein kinase G. Conclusions This study presents a kinetic model of Ca2+-signalling system operating in adipocytes and integrating signals from various agonists, which describes it as multivariable multi feedback network with a family of nested positive feedback."
https://openalex.org/W1585132442,"Observational studies implicate higher dietary energy density (DED) as a potential risk factor for weight gain and obesity. It has been hypothesized that DED may also be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but limited evidence exists. Therefore, we investigated the association between DED and risk of T2D in a large prospective study with heterogeneity of dietary intake.A case-cohort study was nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study of 340,234 participants contributing 3.99 million person years of follow-up, identifying 12,403 incident diabetes cases and a random subcohort of 16,835 individuals from 8 European countries. DED was calculated as energy (kcal) from foods (except beverages) divided by the weight (gram) of foods estimated from dietary questionnaires. Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models were fitted by country. Risk estimates were pooled by random effects meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated. Estimated mean (sd) DED was 1.5 (0.3) kcal/g among cases and subcohort members, varying across countries (range 1.4-1.7 kcal/g). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, energy intake from beverages and misreporting of dietary intake, no association was observed between DED and T2D (HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93-1.13), which was consistent across countries (I(2) = 2.9%).In this large European case-cohort study no association between DED of solid and semi-solid foods and risk of T2D was observed. However, despite the fact that there currently is no conclusive evidence for an association between DED and T2DM risk, choosing low energy dense foods should be promoted as they support current WHO recommendations to prevent chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2007436647,"Finding a universal description of the algorithm optimization is one of the key challenges in personalized recommendation. In this article, for the first time, we introduce a scaling-based algorithm (SCL) independent of recommendation list length based on a hybrid algorithm of heat conduction and mass diffusion, by finding out the scaling function for the tunable parameter and object average degree. The optimal value of the tunable parameter can be abstracted from the scaling function, which is heterogeneous for the individual object. Experimental results obtained from three real datasets, Netflix, MovieLens and RYM, show that the SCL is highly accurate in recommendation. More importantly, compared with a number of excellent algorithms, including the mass diffusion method, the original hybrid method, and even an improved version of the hybrid method, the SCL algorithm remarkably promotes the personalized recommendation in three other aspects: solving the accuracy-diversity dilemma, presenting a high novelty, and solving the key challenge of cold start problem."
https://openalex.org/W2009765870,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in Australian wheat-growing areas were simulated from 1960 to 2010 using Agro-C, a calibrated and validated biogeophysical model. Previously published data from field measurements were used to parameterize the Agro-C model. Model simulations show a decreasing trend in SOC over the last 50 years, mainly attributable to relatively low organic carbon (C) inputs. The rate of decrease in SOC tended to slow in the last two decades due primarily to an increase in wheat yields, which resulted in an increase in C input. Overall, we estimate that Australian wheat-growing areas, covering an area of 15.09 million hectares (Mha), lost 156 (86–222, 95% confidence interval) Tg C in the topsoil (to 30 cm depth) from 1960 to 2010. Approximately 80% of the SOC loss occurred in the period between the 1960s and the 1980s. Spatially, the SOC loss in areas with relatively high temperature and low precipitation, such as Queensland, the northern part of New South Wales and Western Australia, was more significant than that in other areas. We suggest that the loss of SOC could be halted, or even reversed, with an additional input of organic C into the soil at a minimum rate of 0.4 Mg ha–1 yr–1."

Significance: Identification of the essential components of the ATR checkpoint response is crucial for understanding this important signal transduction pathway. In eukaryotic cells, the duplication of the genome involves the orchestrated assembly of proteins onto origins of replication (1Diffley J.F. Quality control in the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2011; 366: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). During G1, the origin recognition complex recognizes origins of replication and binds Cdc6 and Cdt1, which facilitates the loading of the Mcm2-7 helicase complex onto DNA to form the pre-replication complex (2Bell S.P. Dutta A. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.Annu. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The loaded helicase is activated by CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) upon entry into S phase, and additional proteins, including TopBP1 (topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1), Cdc45, and the GINS complex, are recruited at this phase (3Hashimoto Y.

Once activated, the bidirectional replisomes unwind DNA around the origins of replication to create a template for DNA polymerases to replicate the DNA. DNA damage checkpoints delay cell cycle progression when damage is detected and thus ensure the fidelity of genome propagation. Several DNA damage checkpoints exist, such as the G1/S checkpoint, the G2/M checkpoint, and the replication checkpoint (which includes the intra-S and S/M checkpoints). Although the different checkpoints are distinct, the damage sensor molecules that activate the various checkpoints appear to be shared by all (6Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-KaÇmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). In particular, the G2/M checkpoint blocks mitotic entry when DNA is damaged by exposure to UV light or ionizing radiation in G2 phase. The replication checkpoint (S/M) prevents the cell from prematurely entering mitosis before it has fully replicated its genome (7Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Checking on DNA damage in S phase.Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Abrogation of the S/M pathway allows cells to enter mitosis with incompletely replicated chromosomes (8Canman C.E. Replication checkpoint: preventing mitotic catastrophe.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R121-R124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and RAD3-related) is required for the UV light-induced G2/M and S/M checkpoints (6Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-KaÇmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). Once activated, ATR phosphorylates and activates the Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1) kinase, which in turn inhibits CDK activation. Thus, ATR activation blocks cell cycle progression. During checkpoint responses, TopBP1 serves as a direct activator of ATR (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. TopBP1 activates the ATR-ATRIP complex.Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). TopBP1 contains multiple BRCT motifs (nine in humans), which mediate protein-protein interactions, and pairs of BRCT domains act as phosphopeptide-binding motifs (10Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M.

A genetic screen for G2/M checkpoint regulators in zebrafish identified ticrr (TopBP1-interacting, checkpoint, and replication regulator) as a novel gene required for DNA replication (11Sansam C.L. Cruz N.M. Danielian P.S. Amsterdam A. Lau M.L. Hopkins N. Lees J.A. A vertebrate gene, ticrr, is an essential checkpoint and replication regulator.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ticrr, also called Treslin (TopBP1-interacting replication-stimulating protein), was also discovered as a binding partner for TopBP1 in Xenopus egg extracts (15Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Treslin collaborates with TopBP1 in triggering the initiation of DNA replication.Cell. 2010; 140: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Treslin acts in collaboration with TopBP1 at an early step in replication to facilitate the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin (15Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G.

Phosphorylation of a single conserved site in Treslin (Ser-1000) by CDK/cyclin regulates both its binding to TopBP1 and its ability to promote DNA replication (22Boos D. Sanchez-Pulido L. Rappas M.

Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Data from the Ticrr study in zebrafish indicated that Ticrr-deficient cells enter mitosis with partially replicated DNA and also fail to arrest in mitosis in response to ionizing radiation (11Sansam C.L. Cruz N.M. Danielian P.S. Amsterdam A. Lau M.L. Hopkins N. Lees J.A. A vertebrate gene, ticrr, is an essential checkpoint and replication regulator.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data suggested a possible role for Ticrr in checkpoint regulation. However, there was no direct evidence that Ticrr participated in the checkpoint response, and the G/M checkpoint screen that identified Ticrr did not eliminate the possibility that the observed effect was a secondary consequence of the replication function of Ticrr (11Sansam C.L. Cruz N.M. Danielian P.S. Amsterdam A. Lau M.L. Hopkins N. Lees J.A. A vertebrate gene, ticrr, is an essential checkpoint and replication regulator.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that human Treslin/Ticrr plays a direct role in the checkpoint response. We show that Treslin activates ATR-mediated and TopBP1-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation both in vitro in a defined system and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the phosphorylation state of Treslin and its binding to TopBP1 are important for this activation. The oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (catalog no. A2220) and FLAG peptide (catalog no. F4799) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (rabbit mAb 2348), anti-TopBP1 antibody was from Millipore (catalog no. AB3245), anti-Treslin antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories (catalog no. A303-472A), and anti-Chk1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-8408). Plasmid containing full-length (FL) human Treslin (pcDNA5TO-FL-Treslin) was a gift from Dr. W. Dunphy (15Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Treslin collaborates with TopBP1 in triggering the initiation of DNA replication.Cell. 2010; 140: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This plasmid was the template for PCR with the following Treslin fragment (FR) oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-GCGATCCGTGATATCGGATCCGCCACCATGGCTCCTCAGCAGCCTTCCCAGCCAGTGAAAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-ACGCATGCGGCTAGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCCATGAAGGCTGCTGCTCTCGGAGGTGTTCTGAGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRV and NheI and cloned into these sites of the backbone vector pcDNA5TO-3Myc-NLS, obtained from the original plasmid (pcDNA5TO-FL-Treslin). As a result, plasmid pcDNA5TO-Treslin-FR-FLAG-3Myc-NLS was obtained, which expresses amino acids 893–1257 of Treslin, which, together with the tags, result in a 428-amino acid fragment with a mass of ∼48 kDa. Treslin-FR was also cloned into the NcoI/XhoI sites of the pET28a(+) vector for expression in Escherichia coli. Constructs expressing FL-TopBP1 and its derived fragments were reported previously (18Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Cooperative activation of the ATR checkpoint kinase by TopBP1 and damaged DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmid expressing LacR-FL-TopBP1 was constructed earlier in our laboratory (24Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Tethering DNA damage checkpoint mediator proteins topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) and Claspin to DNA activates ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1).J.

Constructs for expressing Treslin-FR-S1000A, FL-Treslin-S1000A and LacR-FL-TopBP1-W1145R were produced by PCR using standard molecular biology techniques. All plasmid sequences were verified by sequencing at the Genome Analysis Facility of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. HEK293T cells in four 150-mm plates (∼90% confluency) were transfected with the Treslin-FR-expressing plasmids using FuGENE HD (Promega). Cells were harvested after 24 h, washed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture). Treslin was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on FLAG-agarose resin (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and using the column format. However, we included a 12-column volume high salt wash step with TBS500 (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 500 mm NaCl) to specifically remove endogenous TopBP1 that might bind to Treslin. Subsequently, the column was equilibrated with TBS150 (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) before competitively eluting with FLAG peptides. DTT (5 mm) and glycerol (10%) were finally added, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Treslin-FR was also purified from E. coli cells by immunoaffinity chromatography on FLAG-agarose resin according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Native ATR-ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein), GST-TopBP1, and His-FLAG-tagged kinase-dead Chk1 were purified as described previously (16Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A.

Plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged Treslin-FR were transfected into HEK293T cells and harvested 24 h later. FLAG-tagged proteins were bound to agarose beads, washed with TBS150, washed with TBS500 to remove endogenous TopBP1 bound to Treslin, and then equilibrated back with TBS150. GST-tagged FL-TopBP1 or fragments were then added to the beads and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with TBS150 and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The kinase assay used was essentially the same as described previously (27Lindsey-Boltz L.A. SerÇin O. Choi J.H. Sancar A. Reconstitution of human Claspin-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 by the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and rad3-related) checkpoint kinase.J. Biol.

Reactions contained 14 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 30 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm DTT, and 1 μm microcystin in a 10-μl final volume. Purified ATR-ATRIP (0.25 nm) was incubated in the reaction buffer for 20 min at 30 °C with 12 nm His-FLAG-tagged kinase-dead Chk1 and the indicated amounts of Treslin and TopBP1. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Chk1 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) antibodies, and the levels of total Chk1 protein were subsequently detected by immunoblotting the same membrane. Levels of phosphorylation were quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics) after scanning the immunoblots. The highest level of Chk1 phosphorylation in each experiment was set equal to 100, and the levels of phosphorylated Chk1 in the other lanes were determined relative to this value. The averages from three independent experiments were graphed. HEK293T cells were from our laboratory collection. NIH2/4 (NIH3T3 cells containing LacO arrays) were described previously (28Soutoglou E. Dorn J.F. Sengupta K. Jasin M. Nussenzweig A. Ried T. Danuser G. Misteli T. Positional stability of single double-strand breaks in mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). NIH2/4 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. For transient expression of LacR fusion proteins, 3 × 105 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated amount of plasmid using 6.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 18 h after transfection, rinsed with PBS, and lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After brief sonication and boiling, samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel for immunoblotting as described above. Although an unbiased genetic screen identified Treslin as a novel replication/checkpoint regulator (11Sansam C.L. Cruz N.M. Danielian P.S. Amsterdam A. Lau M.L. Hopkins N. Lees J.A. A vertebrate gene, ticrr, is an essential checkpoint and replication regulator.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and biochemical studies have discovered an interaction of Treslin with TopBP1 (15Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Treslin collaborates with TopBP1 in triggering the initiation of DNA replication.Cell. 2010; 140: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Boos D. Sanchez-Pulido L. Rappas M. Pearl L.H. Oliver A.W. Ponting C.P. Diffley J.F. Regulation of DNA replication through Sld3-Dpb11 interaction is conserved from yeast to humans.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1152-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the essential role of Treslin and TopBP1 in DNA replication initiation has prevented the analysis of Treslin function in checkpoint signaling. To further investigate this potential role, we decided to test Treslin in a defined in vitro ATR kinase assay developed in our laboratory. We chose a Treslin fragment (amino acids 893–1257) previously reported to interact strongly with TopBP1 (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We first expressed and purified Treslin from HEK293T cells and then added it to an ATR kinase assay containing human Chk1 as a substrate. The result is displayed in Fig. 1A and shows stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation by Treslin. The increase in Chk1 phosphorylation was dose-dependent and resulted in up to 6-fold stimulation. A time course experiment shown in Fig. 1B reveals significant stimulation in the rate of Chk1 phosphorylation when Treslin was added to the kinase reaction. To test the contribution of each of the reaction components in our defined Chk1 phosphorylation assay, we carried out the experiment in Fig. 1C, in which individual components were successively eliminated while maintaining a high Treslin concentration. Our results show that omitting TopBP1 or ATR from the kinase reaction abolished Chk1 phosphorylation under our reaction conditions (compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 3). These results indicate that stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation by Treslin is both TopBP1- and ATR-dependent. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the purification of WT-Treslin and its S1000A mutant, which was previously reported to have reduced binding to TopBP1 (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The high salt wash step (labeled W2) removed the endogenous TopBP1 bound to Treslin (lane 4). This, in conjunction with the results from Fig. 1C, suggests that the stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation can indeed be attributed to Treslin and not additional TopBP1. It is also noticeable that ATR was detected on the agarose beads of WT-Treslin (Fig. 2A, lane 12), but not those of the Treslin mutant, which bound less TopBP1 (Fig. 2B, lane 12), suggesting that Treslin and ATR function in the same pathway and that the interaction of Treslin with ATR is mediated through TopBP1. We also cloned the Treslin fragment into the pET28a vector and purified it from E. coli. To our surprise, Treslin purified from E. coli failed to stimulate Chk1 phosphorylation. In Fig. 2C, we added increasing concentrations of TopBP1 to kinase reactions while maintaining a constant concentration of Treslin. Treslin purified from HEK293T cells stimulated Chk1 phosphorylation ∼5-fold, whereas Treslin purified from E. coli had no effect. We reasoned that Treslin produced in E. coli lacked a proper post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, important for stimulation. In Fig. 2D, we compared the mobility of the Treslin proteins treated with phosphatase on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Treslin made in HEK293T cells had slower mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel relative to the Treslin made in E. coli, and upon phosphatase treatment, it exhibited the same mobility as the protein made in E. coli, indicating that Treslin purified from HEK293T cells is phosphorylated. Phosphatase treatment of the Treslin produced in E. coli (lane 2) did not alter its mobility compared with the untreated protein (lane 1). The in vitro checkpoint assays discussed so far included only FL-TopBP1 protein. Because Treslin specifically interacts with the N terminus of TopBP1 (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we asked whether the N terminus of TopBP1 is required for stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR. We have previously demonstrated that fragments of TopBP1 containing the AAD (depicted in Fig. 3A) are functional in our in vitro checkpoint assay (18Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Cooperative activation of the ATR checkpoint kinase by TopBP1 and damaged DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of Treslin to stimulate ATR in reactions containing these TopBP1 fragments, and the results are shown in Fig. 3B. As expected, Treslin stimulated Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR in the presence of FL-TopBP1 (lanes 2–4 and 9–11). However, neither of the TopBP1 fragments lacking the N terminus could support Treslin-dependent stimulation (lanes 5–7 and 12–14). These results indicate that the N terminus of TopBP1 plays an important role in Treslin-mediated ATR activation. The C-terminal fragments activated ATR similar to FL-TopBP1, indicating that the AADs are folded properly (compare lanes 5 and 12 with lanes 2 and 9 relative to lane 1 without TopBP1). Next, we examined the interaction of Treslin with the TopBP1 fragments used in these assays. The results from binding studies are displayed in Fig. 3C and show that Treslin bound to the TopBP1 fragments lacking the N terminus only 5–10% as well as it bound to FL-TopBP1. Therefore, the N terminus of TopBP1 is required for efficient Treslin binding and activation of ATR kinase activity. Because it appeared that checkpoint stimulation by Treslin was dependent on its interaction with TopBP1, we wished to use a Treslin mutant that could not interact with TopBP1 in our kinase assay to further confirm this conclusion. It has been reported that Treslin interacts with TopBP1 upon phosphorylation by CDKs at a specific amino acid residue (Ser-1000 in human Treslin) (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and that mutation of this amino acid disrupts the interaction. We first analyzed the interaction of wild-type and S1000A mutant Treslin with TopBP1 in extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type or S1000A mutant Treslin plasmid. The results from pulldown assays are displayed in Fig. 4A and show a 90% reduction in the amount of TopBP1 bound to mutant Treslin (compare lanes 5 and 6). Remarkably, when added to the kinase assay, the S1000A mutant failed to stimulate Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) in contrast to WT-Treslin. Together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Treslin is essential for its interaction with TopBP1 and a subsequent ability to stimulate ATR kinase. Because we observed a stimulating effect of Treslin on checkpoint activation in our in vitro system in the absence of DNA damage signaling, we wished to determine whether this stimulation could be observed in vivo. We have previously shown that LacR-TopBP1 induces ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 in mammalian cells containing an array of the LacO sequence (24Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Tethering DNA damage checkpoint mediator proteins topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) and Claspin to DNA activates ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19229-19236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this system to determine whether Treslin affects checkpoint activity. We transiently expressed LacR-TopBP1 and FL-Treslin in the NIH2/4 cell line containing a LacO array stably integrated into its genome (28Soutoglou E. Dorn J.F. Sengupta K. Jasin M. Nussenzweig A. Ried T. Danuser G. Misteli T. Positional stability of single double-strand breaks in mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and the results are shown in Fig. 5A. Because transfecting NIH2/4 cells with high concentrations of LacR-TopBP1 or FL-Treslin plasmid activated ATR on its own, we transfected limiting amounts of these plasmids so that the Chk1 phosphorylation signal was just above the background with either plasmid alone (lanes 2 and 3). However, coexpression of LacR-TopBP1 and FL-Treslin resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in Chk1 phosphorylation in comparison with cells expressing only the individual proteins (compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, we conclude that, as was observed in vitro, induced proximity of Treslin and TopBP1 activates ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 in vivo, indicating that spatial organization of ATR and its activators is a primary mechanism for initiating checkpoint signaling. Because we observed that the S1000A mutation abrogated the ability of Treslin to bind TopBP1 and mediate ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 in vitro, we decided to test this mutation in vivo. Fig. 5B shows the results from transfecting NIH2/4 cells with wild-type or S1000A mutant FL-Treslin at a constant concentration while increasing the concentration of Lac-TopBP1. The increase in Chk1 phosphorylation was attenuated with Treslin-S1000A compared with WT-Treslin, especially at the highest concentration of TopBP1 (compare lanes 7 and 12). Together, these results agree with the in vitro results that disruption of the ability of Treslin to interact with TopBP1 abrogates its effect on checkpoint activation. One potential complication with the experimental approach described above is that the expression of different replication proteins could alter replication, which would result in the activation of ATR. To address this issue, we introduced a point mutation (W1145R) into the AAD of TopBP1. Mutation of this tryptophan residue, analogous to Trp-1138 of Xenopus TopBP1, abrogates TopBP1 activation of ATR (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. TopBP1 activates the ATR-ATRIP complex.Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and is unlikely to affect replication because the whole AAD in not required for replication (15Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Treslin collaborates with TopBP1 in triggering the initiation of DNA replication.Cell. 2010; 140: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fig. 5C shows the results of transfecting NIH2/4 cells with FL-WT-Treslin at a constant concentration while titrating wild-type or W1145R mutant TopBP1. Coexpression of W1145R mutant TopBP1 with FL-Treslin displayed Chk1 phosphorylation levels close to the background, in contrast to coexpression with WT-TopBP1 (compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 9–11). These results indicate that the observed stimulation of checkpoint activation is due in fact to the direct function of Treslin and TopBP1 in ATR activation. Treslin was identified through a G2/M checkpoint screen in zebrafish exposed to ionizing radiation (11Sansam C.L. Cruz N.M. Danielian P.S. Amsterdam A. Lau M.L. Hopkins N. Lees J.A. A vertebrate gene, ticrr, is an essential checkpoint and replication regulator.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Treslin-deficient cells failed to arrest before mitosis after DNA damage and thus had a deficient G2/M checkpoint response. In addition, in the absence of DNA damage, Treslin-deficient cells demonstrated an S/M checkpoint defect by entering mitosis with partially replicated DNA. However, because Treslin is required for proper replication initiation at origins of replication, it is not clear whether these observed phenotypes are due to a role in checkpoint signaling or a reflection of the replication function of Treslin. In this study, we report that Treslin activates ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that, in addition to its role in replication initiation, Treslin possesses an additional role in checkpoint signaling. There is precedence for proteins with dual replication/checkpoint functions. The best known example is TopBP1. In addition, it was recently reported that the essential lagging strand maturation factor Dna2 is a component of the replication checkpoint machinery in yeast (29Kumar S. Burgers P.M. Lagging strand maturation factor Dna2 is a component of the replication checkpoint initiation machinery.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, there is growing evidence that replication and checkpoint signaling pathways are more intimately associated than previously thought. Our in vitro results show that checkpoint stimulation is dependent on TopBP1. Preventing the interaction of Treslin with TopBP1 (through deletion of the N terminus of TopBP1 or mutation of the corresponding interacting domain in Treslin) abrogates Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR. This highlights the importance of the Treslin-TopBP1 interaction interface in checkpoint stimulation. The precise molecular mechanism for this stimulation of ATR activation is still unclear. When we purified Treslin by immunoaffinity chromatography, the protein preparations contained both TopBP1 and ATR in addition to Treslin (Fig. 2A). This supports the presence of a Treslin-TopBP1-ATR ternary complex in mammalian cells. The conditions that lead to the formation of this complex remain to be determined. Our in vivo results validate a model of direct checkpoint activation by Treslin. We used our previously reported system in which TopBP1 tethered to DNA via the LacR/LacO array activates ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 in mammalian cells in the absence of DNA damage (24Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Tethering DNA damage checkpoint mediator proteins topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) and Claspin to DNA activates ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19229-19236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This system essentially concentrates checkpoint proteins onto chromatin and thus constitutes a good system to study the role of Treslin outside of replication. Treslin binds to TopBP1 on chromatin when it is phosphorylated at Ser-1000 (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and consequently, the S1000A mutant displayed a reduced stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). The fact that there was residual Chk1 phosphorylation in reactions with S1000A mutant Treslin can be attributed to the presence of a second TopBP1-interacting domain in the N-terminal region of Treslin (residues 1–463). This fragment is reported to retain significant binding to TopBP1, although weaker compared with fragment 893–1257 (23Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Direct regulation of Treslin by cyclin-dependent kinase is essential for the onset of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutating TopBP1 in its AAD (W1145R) completely eliminated Chk1 phosphorylation and stopped the signal transduction at the TopBP1-ATR interface (Fig. 5C). Although our data clearly demonstrate a role for Treslin in the activation of ATR, the physiological role of Treslin in the ATR-mediated checkpoints remains to be further investigated. ATR has been reported to regulate the timing of DNA replication origin firing in the absence of overt DNA damage (30Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. ATR and ATM regulate the timing of DNA replication origin firing.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Our results provide the conceptual framework for examining activities of Treslin and TopBP1 in ATR signaling at origins of DNA replication. In addition, Treslin could play an important role after DNA damage or replication fork stalling in blocking late origin firing. The yeast homolog of Treslin, Sld3, is phosphorylated by Rad53 (the functional homolog of Chk1), and this phosphorylation has been shown to block late origin firing (31Lopez-Mosqueda J. Maas N.L. Jonsson Z.O. Defazio-Eli L.G. Wohlschlegel J. Toczyski D.P. Damage-induced phosphorylation of Sld3 is important to block late origin firing.Nature. 2010; 467: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent data have demonstrated that the interaction of Treslin with TopBP1 is inhibited upon replication fork stalling (22Boos D. Sanchez-Pulido L. Rappas M. Pearl L.H. Oliver A.W. Ponting C.P. Diffley J.F. Regulation of DNA replication through Sld3-Dpb11 interaction is conserved from yeast to humans.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1152-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and this abrogated interaction is Chk1-dependent. Thus, Treslin and TopBP1 may function not only upstream of ATR, being required for ATR-Chk1 pathway activation, but also downstream, as an ultimate effector of Chk1 signaling. Although much work remains to be done to elucidate the role of Treslin in DNA replication and checkpoint signaling, our results demonstrate that Treslin stimulates ATR activity in a TopBP1-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, and thus, Treslin is directly involved in checkpoint activation (model displayed in Fig. 5D)."

For reactions with complex lifetimes comparable to the time-scale of sedimentation, MSSV reveals the number and stoichiometry of co-existing complexes. For systems with short complex lifetimes, MSSV reveals the composition of the reaction boundary of the coupled reaction/migration process, which we show here may be used to directly determine an association constant. A prerequisite for MSSV is that the interacting components are spectrally distinguishable, which may be a result, for example, of extrinsic chromophores or of different abundances of aromatic amino acids contributing to the UV absorbance. For interacting components that are spectrally poorly resolved, here we introduce a method for additional regularization of the spectral deconvolution by exploiting approximate knowledge of the total loading concentrations. While this novel mass conservation principle does not discriminate contributions to different species, it can be effectively combined with constraints in the sedimentation coefficient range of uncomplexed species. We show in theory, computer simulations, and experiment, how mass conservation MSSV as implemented in SEDPHAT can enhance or even substitute for the spectral discrimination of components. This should broaden the applicability of MSSV to the analysis of the composition of reversible macromolecular complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2001344510,"Background Male germ cell RacGTPase activating protein (MgcRacGAP) is an important regulator of the Rho family GTPases — RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 — and is indispensable in cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. Inactivation of RhoA by phosphorylated MgcRacGAP is an essential step in cytokinesis. MgcRacGAP is also involved in G1-S transition and nuclear transport of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5). Expression of MgcRacGAP is strictly controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Using MgcRacGAP deletion mutants and the fusion proteins of full-length or partial fragments of MgcRacGAP to mVenus fluorescent protein, we demonstrated that MgcRacGAP is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the late M to G1 phase via APCCDH1. We also identified the critical region for destruction located in the C-terminus of MgcRacGAP, AA537–570, which is necessary and sufficient for CDH1-mediated MgcRacGAP destruction. In addition, we identified a PEST domain-like structure with charged residues in MgcRacGAP and implicate it in effective ubiquitination of MgcRacGAP. Conclusions/Significance Our findings not only reveal a novel mechanism for controlling the expression level of MgcRacGAP but also identify a new target of APCCDH1. Moreover our results identify a C-terminal region AA537–570 of MgcRacGAP as its degron."
https://openalex.org/W2027345475,"BACKGROUND OF THE WORK: The phylogenetic position and evolution of Hemidactylus anamallensis (family Gekkonidae) has been much debated in recent times. In the past it has been variously assigned to genus Hoplodactylus (Diplodactylidae) as well as a monotypic genus 'Dravidogecko' (Gekkonidae). Since 1995, this species has been assigned to Hemidactylus, but there is much disagreement between authors regarding its phylogenetic position within this genus. In a recent molecular study H. anamallensis was sister to Hemidactylus but appeared distinct from it in both mitochondrial and nuclear markers. However, this study did not include genera closely allied to Hemidactylus, thus a robust evaluation of this hypothesis was not undertaken.The objective of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic position of H. anamallensis within the gekkonid radiation. To this end, several nuclear and mitochondrial markers were sequenced from H. anamallensis, selected members of the Hemidactylus radiation and genera closely allied to Hemidactylus. These sequences in conjunction with published sequences were subjected to multiple phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore the nuclear dataset was also subjected to molecular dating analysis to ascertain the divergence between H. anamallensis and related genera.Results showed that H. anamallensis lineage was indeed sister to Hemidactylus group but was separated from the rest of the Hemidactylus by a long branch. The divergence estimates supported a scenario wherein H. anamallensis dispersed across a marine barrier to the drifting peninsular Indian plate in the late Cretaceous whereas Hemidactylus arrived on the peninsular India after the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate. Based on these molecular evidence and biogeographical scenario we suggest that the genus Dravidogecko should be resurrected."
https://openalex.org/W2052142020,"Previous studies have determined that the type-1 PDZ sequence at the extreme carboxy-terminus of the ß1-adrenergic receptor (ß1-AR) binds SAP97 and AKAP79 to organize a scaffold involved in trafficking of the ß1-AR. In this study we focused on characterizing the domains in SAP97 that were involved in recycling and resensitization of the ß1-AR in HEK-293 cells. Using a SAP97 knockdown and rescue strategy, we determined that PDZ-deletion mutants of SAP97 containing PDZ2 rescued the recycling and resensitization of the ß1-AR. Among the three PDZs of SAP97, PDZ2 displayed the highest affinity in binding to the ß1-AR. Expression of isolated PDZ2, but not the other PDZs, inhibited the recycling of the ß1-AR by destabilizing the macromolecular complex involved in trafficking and functional resensitization of the ß1-AR. In addition to its PDZs, SAP97 contains other protein interacting domains, such as the I3 sequence in the SRC homology-3 (SH3) domain, which binds to AKAP79. Deletion of I3 from SAP97 (ΔI3-SAP97) did not affect the binding of SAP97 to the ß1-AR. However, ΔI3-SAP97 could not rescue the recycling of the ß1-AR because it failed to incorporate AKAP79/PKA into the SAP97-ß1-AR complex. Therefore, bipartite binding of SAP97 to the ß1-AR and to AKAP79 is necessary for SAP97-mediated effects on recycling, externalization and functional resensitization of the ß1-AR. These data establish a prominent role for PDZ2 and I3 domains of SAP97 in organizing the ß1-adrenergic receptosome involved in connecting the ß1-AR to trafficking and signaling networks."
https://openalex.org/W2025192852,"PolC is the C-family replicative polymerase in low G+C content Gram-positive bacteria. To date several structures of C-family polymerases have been reported, including a high resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex of PolC with DNA and incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). However, kinetic information needed to understand the enzymatic mechanism of C-family polymerases is limited. For this study we have performed a detailed steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic characterization of correct dNTP incorporation by PolC from the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, using a construct lacking both the non-conserved N-terminal domain and the 3′–5′ exonuclease domain (Sau-PolC-ΔNΔExo). We find that Sau-PolC-ΔNΔExo has a very fast catalytic rate (kpol 330 s−1) but also dissociates from DNA rapidly (koff ∼150 s−1), which explains the low processivity of PolC in the absence of sliding clamp processivity factor. Although Sau-PolC-ΔNΔExo follows the overall enzymatic pathway defined for other polymerases, some significant differences exist. The most striking feature is that the nucleotidyl transfer reaction for Sau-PolC-ΔNΔExo is reversible and is in equilibrium with dNTP binding. Simulation of the reaction pathway suggests that rate of pyrophosphate release, or a conformational change required for pyrophosphate release, is much slower than rate of bond formation. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of previous data showing that binding of the β-clamp processivity factor stimulates the intrinsic nucleotide incorporation rate of the C-family polymerases, in addition to increasing processivity."
https://openalex.org/W2111410460,"Tetrahedral (TET) aminopeptidases are large polypeptide destruction machines present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, the rules governing their assembly into hollow 12-subunit tetrahedrons are addressed by using TET2 from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhTET2) as a model. Point mutations allowed the capture of a stable, catalytically active precursor. Small angle x-ray scattering revealed that it is a dimer whose architecture in solution is identical to that determined by x-ray crystallography within the fully assembled TET particle. Small angle x-ray scattering also showed that the reconstituted PhTET2 dodecameric particle displayed the same quaternary structure and thermal stability as the wild-type complex. The PhTET2 assembly intermediates were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation, native gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. They revealed that PhTET2 assembling is a highly ordered process in which hexamers represent the main intermediate. Peptide degradation assays demonstrated that oligomerization triggers the activity of the TET enzyme toward large polypeptidic substrates. Fractionation experiments in Pyrococcus and Halobacterium cells revealed that, in vivo, the dimeric precursor co-exists together with assembled TET complexes. Taken together, our observations explain the biological significance of TET oligomerization and suggest the existence of a functional regulation of the dimer-dodecamer equilibrium in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2025897809,"Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its efficacy is currently being tested in mild-to-moderate AD. Earlier studies reported the presence of anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) antibodies in IVIG. These observations led to clinical studies investigating the potential role of IVIG as a therapeutic agent in AD. Also, IVIG is known to mediate beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions by interfering with various pathological processes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IVIG and purified polyclonal Aβ-specific antibodies (pAbs-Aβ) on aggregation, toxicity and phagocytosis of Aβ in vitro, thus elucidating some of the potential mechanisms of action of IVIG in AD patients. We report that both IVIG and pAbs-Aβ specifically bound to Aβ and inhibited its aggregation in a dose-dependent manner as measured by Thioflavin T assay. Additionally, IVIG and the purified pAbs-Aβ inhibited Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line and prevented Aβ binding to rat primary cortical neurons. Interestingly, IVIG and pAbs-Aβ also increased the number of phagocytosing cells as well as the amount of phagocytosed fibrillar Aβ by BV-2 microglia. Phagocytosis of Aβ depended on receptor-mediated endocytosis and was accompanied by upregulation of CD11b expression. Importantly, we could also show that Privigen dose-dependently reversed Aβ-mediated LTP inhibition in mouse hippocampal slices. Therefore, our in vitro results suggest that IVIG may have an impact on different processes involved in AD pathogenesis, thereby promoting further understanding of the effects of IVIG observed in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1964547150,"Background Cytoglobin (Cygb) was discovered a decade ago as the fourth vertebrate heme-globin. The function of Cygb is still unknown, but accumulating evidence from in vitro studies point to a putative role in scavenging of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide metabolism and in vivo studies have shown Cygb to be up regulated by hypoxic stress. This study addresses three main questions related to Cygb expression in the hippocampus: 1) Is the rat hippocampus a valid neuroanatomical model for the human hippocampus; 2) What is the degree of co-expression of Cygb and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the rat hippocampus; 3) The effect of chronic restraint stress (CRS) on Cygb and nNOS expression. Methods Immunohistochemistry was used to compare Cygb expression in the human and rat hippocampi as well as Cygb and nNOS co-expression in the rat hippocampus. Transcription and translation of Cygb and nNOS were investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) and Western blotting on hippocampi from Flinders (FSL/FRL) rats exposed to CRS. Principal Findings Cygb expression pattern in the human and rat hippocampus was found to be similar. A high degree of Cygb and nNOS co-expression was observed in the rat hippocampus. The protein levels of nNOS and Cygb were significantly up-regulated in FSL animals in the dorsal hippocampus. In the ventral hippocampus Cygb protein levels were significantly up-regulated in the FSL compared to the FRL, following CRS. Significance The rodent hippocampus can be used to probe questions related to Cygb protein localization in human hippocampus. The high degree of Cygb and nNOS co-expression gives support for Cygb involvement in nitric oxide metabolism. CRS induced Cygb and nNOS expression indicating that Cygb expression is stress responsive. Cygb and nNOS may be important in physiological response to stress."

https://openalex.org/W1988230280,"Fucosylated glycans of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni play key roles in its development and immunobiology. In the present study we used a genome-wide homology-based bioinformatics approach to search for genes that contribute to fucosylated glycan expression in S. mansoni, specifically the α2-, α3-, and α6-fucosyltransferases (FucTs), which transfer L-fucose from a GDP-L-fucose donor to an oligosaccharide acceptor. We identified and in silico characterized several novel schistosome FucT homologs, including six α3-FucTs and six α6-FucTs, as well as two protein O-FucTs that catalyze the unrelated transfer of L-fucose to serine and threonine residues of epidermal growth factor- and thrombospondin-type repeats. No α2-FucTs were observed. Primary sequence analyses identified key conserved FucT motifs as well as characteristic transmembrane domains, consistent with their putative roles as fucosyltransferases. Most genes exhibit alternative splicing, with multiple transcript variants generated. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that schistosome α3- and α6-FucTs form monophyletic clades within their respective gene families, suggesting multiple gene duplications following the separation of the schistosome lineage from the main evolutionary tree. Quantitative decreases in steady-state transcript levels of some FucTs during early larval development suggest a possible mechanism for differential expression of fucosylated glycans in schistosomes. This study systematically identifies the complete repertoire of FucT homologs in S. mansoni and provides fundamental information regarding their genomic organization, genetic variation, developmental expression, and evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2079917251,"Perceptual learning is an improvement in sensitivity due to practice on a sensory task and is generally specific to the trained stimuli and/or tasks. The present study investigated the effect of stimulus configuration and crowding on perceptual learning in contrast discrimination in peripheral vision, and the effect of perceptual training on crowding in this task. 29 normally-sighted observers were trained to discriminate Gabor stimuli presented at 9° eccentricity with either identical or orthogonally oriented flankers with respect to the target (ISO and CROSS, respectively), or on an isolated target (CONTROL). Contrast discrimination thresholds were measured at various eccentricities and target-flanker separations before and after training in order to determine any learning transfer to untrained stimulus parameters. Perceptual learning was observed in all three training stimuli; however, greater improvement was obtained with training on ISO-oriented stimuli compared to CROSS-oriented and unflanked stimuli. This learning did not transfer to untrained stimulus configurations, eccentricities or target-flanker separations. A characteristic crowding effect was observed increasing with viewing eccentricity and decreasing with target-flanker separation before and after training in both configurations. The magnitude of crowding was reduced only at the trained eccentricity and target-flanker separation; therefore, learning for contrast discrimination and for crowding in the present study was configuration and location specific. Our findings suggest that stimulus configuration plays an important role in the magnitude of perceptual learning in contrast discrimination and suggest context-specificity in learning."
https://openalex.org/W1973448179,"Background Visual to auditory conversion systems have been in existence for several decades. Besides being among the front runners in providing visual capabilities to blind users, the auditory cues generated from image sonification systems are still easier to learn and adapt to compared to other similar techniques. Other advantages include low cost, easy customizability, and universality. However, every system developed so far has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. In order to improve these systems further, we propose an automated and quantitative method to measure the performance of such systems. With these quantitative measurements, it is possible to gauge the relative strengths and weaknesses of different systems and rank the systems accordingly. Methodology Performance is measured by both the interpretability and also the information preservation of visual to auditory conversions. Interpretability is measured by computing the correlation of inter image distance (IID) and inter sound distance (ISD) whereas the information preservation is computed by applying Information Theory to measure the entropy of both visual and corresponding auditory signals. These measurements provide a basis and some insights on how the systems work. Conclusions With an automated interpretability measure as a standard, more image sonification systems can be developed, compared, and then improved. Even though the measure does not test systems as thoroughly as carefully designed psychological experiments, a quantitative measurement like the one proposed here can compare systems to a certain degree without incurring much cost. Underlying this research is the hope that a major breakthrough in image sonification systems will allow blind users to cost effectively regain enough visual functions to allow them to lead secure and productive lives."
https://openalex.org/W1988014833,"As Doppler ultrasound has been proven to be an effective tool to predict and compress the optimal pulsing windows, we evaluated the effective dose and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography (CTA) incorporating Doppler-guided prospective electrocardiograph (ECG) gating, which presets pulsing windows according to Doppler analysis, in patients with a heart rate >65 bpm.119 patients with a heart rate >65 bpm who were scheduled for invasive coronary angiography were prospectively studied, and patients were randomly divided into traditional prospective (n = 61) and Doppler-guided prospective (n = 58) ECG gating groups. The exposure window of traditional prospective ECG gating was set at 30%-80% of the cardiac cycle. For the Doppler group, the length of diastasis was analyzed by Doppler. For lengths greater than 90 ms, the pulsing window was preset during diastole (during 60%-80%); otherwise, the optimal pulsing intervals were moved from diastole to systole (during 30%-50%).The mean heart rates of the traditional ECG and the Doppler-guided group during CT scanning were 75.0±7.7 bpm (range, 66-96 bpm) and 76.5±5.4 bpm (range: 66-105 bpm), respectively. The results indicated that whereas the image quality showed no significant difference between the traditional and Doppler groups (P = 0.42), the radiation dose of the Doppler group was significantly lower than that of the traditional group (5.2±3.4 mSv vs. 9.3±4.5 mSv, P<0.001). The sensitivities of CTA applying traditional and Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating to diagnose stenosis on a segment level were 95.5% and 94.3%, respectively; specificities 98.0% and 97.1%, respectively; positive predictive values 90.7% and 88.2%, respectively; negative predictive values 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in concordance between the traditional and Doppler groups (P = 0.22).Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating represents an improved method in patients with a high heart rate to reduce effective radiation doses, while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2028005583,"Previous research has shown that attention to an object can trigger the retrieval of features of a preceding object. The present study investigates whether such retrieval would occur to a recently inhibited object. In three experiments, participants saw two successively presented stimuli (S1 and S2) that varied in color and orientation. The task was to respond to the color or orientation of S2 in accordance with a task cue at the beginning of each trial. In separate experiments, we manipulated the number of the trials on which the task relevant features of S1 and S2 were matched versus mismatched, and the perceived object continuation between the two stimuli. Evidence for spontaneous feature retrieval was found when S1 and S2 could be seen as different instantiations of the same object but not when they were likely to be perceived as different types of objects. These results suggest that the features of a previously inhibited object can be retrieved spontaneously. However, such retrieval and its effect on a subsequent stimulus depend on the perceived object continuity between the two successive stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2019764780,"Epigenetic inactivation of chromatin plays an important role in determining cell phenotype in both normal and cancer cells, but our knowledge is still incomplete with respect to any potential monoallelic nature of the phenomenon. We have genotyped DNA isolated from chromatin of two colorectal cancer-derived lines and a culture of normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC), which was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to acetylated vs. methylated histone H3K9, and presented the data as B allele frequency differences over multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) moving window averages. [B allele is an arbitrary term defined as one of the two alleles at any given SNP, named A and B]. Three different validation tests confirmed that peaks exhibiting differences represented monoallelic domains. These complementary tests confirmed the following: 1) genes in the regions of high B allele frequency difference were expressed monoallelically; 2) in normal cells all five imprinting control regions which carried heterozygous SNPs were characterized by B allele difference peaks; and 3) the haplotypes in the B allele difference peaks were faithfully maintained in the chromatin immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies. In both samples most of the monoallelic domains were found at the boundaries between regions of open and closed chromatin. With respect to the cancer line, this supports the established concept of conformation spreading, but the results from the normal cells were unexpected. Since these cells were polyclonal, the monoallelic structures were probably not determined by random choice as occurs in X-inactivation, so we propose that epigenetic inactivation in some domains may be heritable and polymorphic in normal human cells."
