https://openalex.org/W2130670745,"Asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids between the inner and outer plasma membrane leaflets is disrupted in various biological processes. We recently identified TMEM16F, an eight-transmembrane protein, as a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase that exposes phosphatidylserine (PS) to the cell surface. In this study, we established a mouse lymphocyte cell line with a floxed allele in the TMEM16F gene. When TMEM16F was deleted, these cells failed to expose PS in response to Ca2+ ionophore, but PS exposure was elicited by Fas ligand treatment. We expressed other TMEM16 proteins in the TMEM16F−/− cells and found that not only TMEM16F, but also 16C, 16D, 16G, and 16J work as lipid scramblases with different preference to lipid substrates. On the other hand, a patch clamp analysis in 293T cells indicated that TMEM16A and 16B, but not other family members, acted as Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels. These results indicated that among 10 TMEM16 family members, 7 members could be divided into two subfamilies, Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels (16A and 16B) and Ca2+-dependent lipid scramblases (16C, 16D, 16F, 16G, and 16J).

Distribution of lipids in plasma membranes is regulated by three types of lipid transporters: flippases, floppases, and scramblases. Flippases, also called ATP-dependent aminophospholipid translocases, transport aminophospholipids from the extracellular leaflet to the cytoplasmic side (1Balasubramanian K. Schroit A. Aminophospholipid asymmetry: a matter of life and death.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 11Leventis P.A. Grinstein S. The distribution and function of phosphatidylserine in cellular membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPase), a subfamily of the P-type ATPase multispan transmembrane proteins, are strong candidates for flippases (12Folmer D.E. Elferink R.P. Paulusma C.C. P4 ATPases: lipid flippases and their role in disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Floppases are transporters that move a wide range of lipids from the cytosolic to the extracellular leaflet in an ATP-dependent manner. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase, particularly ABCA1, has been proposed as a floppase (13Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. ABCA1-mediated transport of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to HDL apolipoproteins.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but ABCA1-deficient cells exhibit no defects in transbilayer phospholipid movement (14Williamson P. Halleck M.S. Malowitz J. Ng S. Fan X. Krahling S. Remaley A.T. Schlegel R.A. Transbilayer phospholipid movements in ABCA1-deficient cells.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), arguing against this role. Once established, the phospholipid distribution between the outer and inner leaflets is not easily disrupted; ATP-dependent translocase inactivation alone does not appear sufficient to cause the rapid PS exposure seen in apoptotic cell death and platelet activation. Thus, a phospholipid scramblase that bidirectionally and nonspecifically transports phospholipids in response to Ca2+ has been proposed (15Bevers E.M. Williamson P.L. Phospholipid scramblase: an update.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2724-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Using a liposome reconstitution system with synthetic phospholipids, Basse et al. (16Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Isolation of an erythrocyte membrane protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent transbilayer movement of phospholipid.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) purified a 37-kDa protein from human erythrocytes and named it phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR). Its cDNA was then isolated (17Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, because the Ca2+-induced PS exposure is normal in PLSCR1−/− cells (18Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Normal hemostasis but defective hematopoietic response to growth factors in mice deficient in phospholipid scramblase 1.Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), PLSCR function as a phospholipid scramblase has been challenged (15Bevers E.M. Williamson P.L. Phospholipid scramblase: an update.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2724-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Sahu S.K. Gummadi S.N. Manoj N. Aradhyam G.K. Phospholipid scramblases: an overview.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By repeatedly selecting cell populations that efficiently exposed PS in response to Ca2+ ionophore, we recently established a subline of mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) that constitutively exposes PS (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The Ba/F3 subline harbors a mutated form of TMEM16F protein, a protein carrying eight transmembrane regions with cytoplasmic N and C termini. Ba/F3 cells carrying the mutated form of TMEM16F constitutively exposed PS and PE and internalized PC and sphingomyelin. We thus proposed TMEM16F as a phospholipid scramblase (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Confirming that TMEM16F is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase, recessive TMEM16F mutations were identified in human patients with Scott syndrome (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 21Castoldi E. Collins P.W. Williamson P.L. Bevers E.M. Compound heterozygosity for 2 novel TMEM16F mutations in a patient with Scott syndrome.Blood. 2011; 117: 4399-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which is known to result from a phospholipid-scrambling defect; these patients suffer from impaired blood clotting. However, it is not clear whether TMEM16F is involved in other processes, such as apoptotic cell death or cell fusion. Two of the 10 TMEM16 family members, TMEM16A and 16B, are Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels (22Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L. TMEM16A, a membrane protein associated with calcium-dependent chloride channel activity.Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 23Schroeder B.C. Cheng T.

Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. TMEM16A confers receptor-activated calcium-dependent chloride conductance.Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar); this raises a question of whether TMEM16F is likewise a Cl− channel and whether any other TMEM16 family members are phospholipid scramblases. In this report, we established an immortalized fetal thymocyte (IFET) cell line from fetal thymus of mice carrying a floxed TMEM16F allele. IFETs express TMEM16F, 16H, and 16K and expose PS in response to a Ca2+ ionophore. Deleting TMEM16F in the IFETs completely abolished their ability to expose PS in response to Ca2+ ionophore. On the other hand, Fas ligand (FasL) treatment efficiently induced PS exposure in the TMEM16F-deficient cells. In the presence of TMEM16C, 16D, 16F, 16G, and 16J, TMEM16F−/− IFETs responded to Ca2+ ionophore by scrambling phospholipids and galactosylceramide, whereas other family members did not. However, two family members, TMEM16A and 16B, but not others showed Ca2+-dependent Cl− channel activity. These results, together with their tissue-specific expression, suggest that the TMEM16 family members have distinct functions in lipid scrambling and Cl− channel functions in various biological processes. Leucine zipper-tagged human FasL was produced in COS-7 cells as described (25Shiraishi T. Suzuyama K. Okamoto H. Mineta T. Tabuchi K. Nakayama K. Shimizu Y. Tohma J. Ogihara T. Naba H. Mochizuki H. Nagata S. Increased cytotoxicity of soluble Fas ligand by fusing isoleucine zipper motif.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One unit of FasL is defined as the activity that kills 1.0 × 105 mouse WR19L cells expressing Fas (W3 cells) in 4 h. A caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-Oph, was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). IFETs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. HEK293T and Plat-E cells (26Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Plat-E: an efficient and stable system for transient packaging of retroviruses.Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Mouse TMEM16F cDNA (NCBI: NM_175344) was described (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Mouse cDNAs for TMEM16A (GenBank BC062959.1), 16B (GenBank BC033409.1), and 16G (GenBank BC116706.1) were from DNAFORM (Yokohama, Japan). Mouse cDNAs for TMEM16C (NCBI NM_ 001128103.1), 16D (Ensemble ENSMUST 00000070175), and 16K (NCBI NM_133979.2) were cloned from brain tissue by RT-PCR, and cDNAs for TMEM16E (NCBI NM_177694.5), 16H (NCBI NM_001164679.1), and 16J (NCBI NM_178381.3) were isolated from the skeletal muscle, thymus, and stomach, respectively. All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. The following primers were used to isolate TMEM16 cDNAs (the extra sequence for the restriction enzyme is underlined): TMEM16A, 5′-ATATGGATCCACCATGAGGGTCCCCGAGAAGTA and 5′-ATATGAATTCCAGCGCGTCCCCATGGTACT; TMEM16B, 5′-ATATGAATTCCGCATGCACTTTCACGACAACCA and 5′- ATATGAATTCTACATTGGTGTGCTGGGACC; TMEM16C, 5′-ATATGGATCCAAAATGGTCCACCACTCAGGCTC and 5′-ATATCAATTGAGGCCATTCATGGTGAATAG; TMEM16D, 5′-ATATAGATCTAAAATGGAGGCCAGCTCTTCTGG and 5′- ATATCAATTGTGGCCACTCATTGTGATGTG; TMEM16E, 5′-ATATGGATCCGAGATGGTGGAGCAGGAAGGCTT and 5′-ATATCAATTGGACTGTAGTTTTAGCCTTCA; TMEM16G, 5′-ATATAGATCTGACATGCTGCGGGGGCAAGCGCG and 5′-ATATGAATTCGCCTCCGGTAACCCCTACTG; TMEM16H, 5′-ATATAGATCTGCCATGGCCGAGGCGGCTTCGGG and 5′-ATATGAATTCAGGCCTGTGACCTGCGTCCT; TMEM16J, 5′-ATATGAATTCAGCATGCAGGATGATGAGAGTTC and 5′-ATATCAATTGTACATCCGTGCTCCTGGAAC; TMEM16K, 5′-ATATGGATCCAAGATGAGAGTGACTTTATCAAC and 5′-ATATCAATTGGGTAGCTTCCTTCCCATCTT. Because the native mouse cDNAs for TMEM16C, 16D, and 16E produced a low level of proteins in mammalian cells, sequences with enhanced mRNA stability and translational efficiency were custom ordered from GENEART (Regensburg, Germany) (supplemental Figs. S1–S3). TMEM16F conditionally targeted mice were generated by UNITECH (Chiba, Japan) as a custom order. In brief, a neo-loxP cassette carrying the PGK promoter-driven neo gene and flanked by FRT sequences was inserted into intron 3 of the TMEM16F gene (Fig. 1A). A 1.0-kb DNA fragment containing exon 2 was replaced with a fragment carrying the corresponding sequence and a loxP sequence. The diphtheria toxin A fragment (DT-A) driven by the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter, was inserted at the 5′ end of the vector. Mouse Bruce-4 ES cells were transfected with the targeting vector by electroporation, and G418-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by PCR. Positive clones were injected into blastocysts to generate TMEM16F+/NeoFRT mice. The TMEM16F+/NeoFRT mice were crossed with CAG-FLPe transgenic mice to remove the Neo cassette (27Kanki H. Suzuki H. Itohara S. High-efficiency CAG-FLPe deleter mice in C57BL/6J background.Exp. Anim. 2006; 55: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Offspring were backcrossed to wild-type C57BL/6 mice to remove the CAG-FLPe transgene, generating TMEM16F+/flox mice. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at Kyoto University, and all animal experiments were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by Kyoto University. IFET cell lines were established as described (28Imao T. Nagata S. Apaf-1- and caspase-8-independent apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, TMEM16F+/flox mice were intercrossed, and fetal thymocytes were obtained at embryonic day 14.5. Thymocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 1× nonessential amino acids, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Retroviruses carrying genes for H-rasV12 and c-myc were produced in Plat-E cells with pCX4 vector (29Akagi T. Sasai K. Hanafusa H. Refractory nature of normal human diploid fibroblasts with respect to oncogene-mediated transformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), concentrated by centrifugation, and attached to RetroNectin-coated plates (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). Thymocytes were attached to the retrovirus-coated plate by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min and cultured in medium containing 5 ng/ml mouse IL-7 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) (30Watson J.D. Morrissey P.J. Namen A.E. Conlon P.J. Widmer M.B. Effect of IL-7 on the growth of fetal thymocytes in culture.J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant IFETs were infected with 1 × 105 pfu/ml Adeno-Cre (Takara Bio) and cloned by limited dilution. Clones carrying the TMEM16F−/− allele were selected by PCR with following primers: wild-type specific sense primer, CTCCAGAGTTTGTAAGTAACACAT; mutant specific sense primer, CAGTCATCGATGAATTCATAACTT; and common antisense primer, AAGACTGATTTCCAAGGTTATCGAA. Mouse TMEM16 cDNAs were inserted into pMXs puro c-FLAG (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) to express proteins tagged with FLAG at the C terminus. Retrovirus was produced in Plat-E cells and used to infect TMEM16F−/− IFETs. Stable transformants were selected in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Mouse Fas cDNA (GenBank NM_007987) was introduced into IFETs by retrovirus-mediated transformation, and its expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with an anti-Fas mAb (Jo2) (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III reverse-transcriptase (Invitrogen) or a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNATM kit (Applied Biosystems). Aliquots of the products were amplified in a reaction mixture containing LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Diagnostics). Primers used for real-time PCR were as follows: TMEM16A, 5′-ACCCCGACGCCGAATGCAAG and 5′-GCTGGTCCTGCCTGACGCTG; 16B, 5′-GAGGCGCACACCTGGGTCAC and 5′-ATGGGGCGTGGATCCGGACA; 16C, 5′-GCCAGCAATTGCCAACCCCG and 5′-GCAGTCCGACTCCTCCAGCTCT; 16D, 5′-ACAGGCATGCTCTTCCCCGC and 5′-GCGATCACTGCTCGGCGTCT; 16E, 5′-AGCAGCTCCAGCTTCGGCCT and 5′-TTCACGCTCTGCAGGGTGGC; 16F, 5′-CCCACCTTTGGATCACTGGA and 5′-TCGTATGCTTGTCTTTTCCT; 16G, 5′-ACATGTGCCCGCTGTGCTCC and 5′-GGGCCGAGGCCTCTCCTCAA; 16H, 5′-TGGAGGAGCCACGTCCCCAG and 5′-GCGGGGCAGACCCTTCACAC; 16J, 5′-GCTGTGGTGGTGACTGGGGC and 5′-CCAGGCGCGTGGATTTCCCA; 16K, 5′-TGGGGGCAGAAGCAGTCGGT and 5′-GGCCTGTGGGTAGCCAGGGAT; β-actin, 5′-TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAG and 5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC. The mRNA was quantified at the point where LightCycler System detected the upstroke of the exponential phase of PCR accumulation with the respective linearized plasmid DNA as reference. Cells were lysed in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (cOmplete, mini, Roche Diagnostics)). After removing debris, cell lysates were mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio Craft, Tokyo, Japan). After proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore), membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and peroxidase activity was detected using a Western Lightning®-ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To prepare rabbit antibody against mouse TMEM16F, the N-terminal region of mouse TMEM16F (amino acids 1–289) was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a pGEX-5X-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli, purified with glutathione-Sepharose, and used to immunize rabbits at Takara Bio as a custom order. Western blotting with the rabbit anti-TMEM16F and HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) was carried out as described above using Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution (Can Get Signal®; Toyobo Life Science, Tokyo, Japan). The Ca2+-induced PS exposure was examined as described (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 cells were stimulated at 20 °C with 3.0 μm A23187 in 500 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 1000-fold-diluted Cy5-labeled annexin V (Bio Vision, Milpitas, CA) and applied to the injection chamber of a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) set at 20 °C. Cells (106) were stimulated at 15 °C with 250 nm A23187 in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 1 mm CaCl2, with a fluorescent probe, 100 nm NBD-PC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), or 250 nm NBD-GalCer) (Avanti Polar Lipids). Aliquots (150 μl) were mixed with 150 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mg/ml fatty-acid free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 nm Sytox Blue (Molecular Probes) and analyzed by FACSAria. Apoptosis was induced with FasL as described (25Shiraishi T. Suzuyama K. Okamoto H. Mineta T. Tabuchi K. Nakayama K. Shimizu Y. Tohma J. Ogihara T. Naba H. Mochizuki H. Nagata S. Increased cytotoxicity of soluble Fas ligand by fusing isoleucine zipper motif.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In brief, IFETs expressing mouse Fas were treated with 60 units/ml FasL at 37 °C for 2 h, and PS exposure was determined by flow cytometry with Cy5-annexin V. To detect activated caspase 3, cells were fixed at 37 °C for 10 min in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 90% methanol at −20 °C, and stained with rabbit mAb against active caspase 3 (Cell Signaling). Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and analyzed by FACSAria. TMEM16 sequences, FLAG-tagged at C terminus, were inserted into pEF-BOS-EX (31Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Myeloid-specific transcriptional activation by murine myeloid zinc finger protein-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells (2.5 × 105) were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of TMEM16 expression vector and 0.1 μg of pMAX-EGFP (Lonza Group, Basel, Switzerland) using FuGENE6 (Promega). At 24 h after transfection, cells were reseeded on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). Within 24 h after reseeding, whole cell recordings of cells expressing EGFP were performed using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Molecular Devices) as described (23Schroeder B.C. Cheng T.

The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). The intracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.12 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). The free Ca2+ concentration (500 nm) was calculated with WEBMAXC software. Ca2+-dependent PS exposure is reduced by knocking down TMEM16F mRNA and accelerated by TMEM16F overexpression, suggesting that TMEM16F is a phospholipid scramblase (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). To demonstrate TMEM16F involvement in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scrambling and to determine whether TMEM16F plays a role in exposing PS to the cell surface during apoptotic cell death, we established from fetal thymus tissue a TMEM16F-deficient mouse cell line that expresses a small number of TMEM16 family members, including TMEM16F (see below). A targeting vector in which exon 2 of TMEM16F gene was flanked by loxP sequences was used to replace the TMEM16F allele in a mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) line from a C57BL/6 background (Fig. 1A). Mice carrying the floxed allele were generated from the ES clone and intercrossed. Embryos were genotyped at embryonic day 14.5, and fetal TMEM16Fflox/flox thymus cells were infected with retroviruses carrying H-rasV12 and c-myc to establish IFET cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that IFETs expressed Thy-1 weakly and CD44 strongly but did not express CD4 or CD8; this indicated that they were derived from a T cell lineage at an early developmental stage. A real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that IFETs expressed TMEM16F, 16H, and 16K (Fig. 1B). Next, IFETs were infected with adenovirus carrying the CRE recombinase gene, and cells missing exon 2 of the TMEM16F gene were cloned (Fig. 1C). Removing exon 2 causes a frameshift and truncates TMEM16F protein at the N-terminal region. Accordingly, Western blotting with an anti-TMEM16F antibody showed broad bands around 120 kDa in TMEM16Fflox/flox but not TMEM16F−/− IFETs (Fig. 1D). An apparent molecular mass of TMEM16F detected by SDS-PAGE is slightly larger than the expected molecular mass for TMEM16F (106 kDa), which may be explained by glycosylation because mouse TMEM16F carry 6 putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). TMEM16Fflox/flox IFETs treated at 20 °C with a Ca2+ ionophore A23187 quickly exposed PS (Fig. 2A); however, this exposure was completely absent in TMEM16−/− IFETs. Similarly, the treatment of TMEM16Fflox/flox but not TMEM16F−/− IFETs with A23187 caused rapid PE exposure, detected by binding of RO09-0198 peptide (20Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We then examined the role of TMEM16F in lipid internalization and found that TMEM16Fflox/flox but not TMEM16−/− IFETs internalized NBD-PC and NBD-GalCer upon Ca2+ ionophore treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicated that TMEM16F is responsible for Ca2+-dependent lipid scrambling in IFETs. In agreement with a previous report showing that Fas is not expressed in T cells at early developmental stages (33Ogasawara J. Suda T. Nagata S. Selective apoptosis of CD4 CD8 thymocytes by the anti-Fas antibody.J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), IFETs do not express Fas (Fig. 2D). When IFETs were transformed with mouse Fas, FasL efficiently activated caspase 3 (Fig. 2E), and the cells quickly responded by exposing PS (Fig. 2F). A TMEM16F-null mutation did not affect either FasL-induced PS exposure or caspase activation (Fig. 2, E and F). In cells undergoing apoptosis, cell size decreases and cellular granularity increases (34Dive C. Gregory C.D. Phipps D.J. Evans D.L. Milner A.E. Wyllie A.H. Analysis and discrimination of necrosis and apoptosis (programmed cell death) by multiparameter flow cytometry.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Treating the TMEM16Fflox/flox and TMEM16F−/− IFETs with FasL decreased the cell size (forward-scattered light) and increased the cellular granularity (side-scattered light) to the same extent (Fig. 2G). Therefore, we concluded that caspase-dependent apoptotic PS exposure and cell shrinkage take place independently of TMEM16F. The 10 TMEM16 family members have similar topologies and 20–60% amino acid sequence identity (35Galietta L. The TMEM16 protein family: a new class of chloride channels?.Biophys.

IL-1β is one of the key proinflammatory cytokines, and thus, its synthesis and secretion are tightly regulated. The NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome complex, assembled in response to microbial components or endogenous danger signals, triggers caspase-1-mediated maturation and secretion of IL-1β. In this study, we explored whether acidic environment is sensed by immune cells as an inflammasome-activating danger signal.Human macrophages were exposed to custom cell culture media at pH 7.5–6.0. Acidic medium triggered pH-dependent secretion of IL-1β and activation of caspase-1 via a mechanism involving potassium efflux from the cells. Acidic extracellular pH caused rapid intracellular acidification, and the IL-1β-inducing effect of acidic medium could be mimicked by acidifying the cytosol with bafilomycin A1, a proton pump inhibitor. Knocking down the mRNA expression of NLRP3 receptor abolished IL-1β secretion at acidic pH. Remarkably, alkaline extracellular pH strongly inhibited the IL-1β response to several known NLRP3 activators, demonstrating bipartite regulatory potential of pH on the activity of this inflammasome. The data suggest that acidic environment represents a novel endogenous danger signal alerting the innate immunity. Low pH may thus contribute to inflammation in acidosis-associated pathologies such as atherosclerosis and post-ischemic inflammatory responses.

Stringent control of both extra- and intracellular pH is essential for maintaining cellular biochemical reactions and tissue homeostasis. Despite the efficient pH control mechanisms evolved in human body, local and even systemic pH fluctuations occur frequently under pathological conditions. For example, ischemia during myocardial infarction and stroke causes a rapid drop in pH to approximately pH 6.5–6.0 in the affected tissue (1Gebert G. Benzing H. Strohm M.

Local acidification may develop also during acute and chronic inflammation. During inflammation, the drop in pH is a result of infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells in the tissue, which leads to increased energy and oxygen demand, accelerated glucose consumption via glycolysis and thus increased lactic acid secretion (7Menkin V.

Activated macrophages secrete a myriad of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, among which IL-1β is one of the most potent in promoting inflammation and disease progression. The maturation and secretion of IL-1β, as well as that of IL-18, is controlled by the inflammasome pathway. Inflammasomes are large intracellular protein complexes that recruit and activate the caspase-1 protease, which in turn cleaves the proforms of IL-1β and IL-18 into their biologically active, secreted forms (24Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. The inflammasome: A molecular platform triggering activation of inflammatory caspases and processing of proIL-β.Mol.

Immunol. 2010; 22: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Inflammasome assembly is initiated by activation and self-oligomerization of certain NLR (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing) or PYHIN (pyrin and HIN200 domain containing) family pattern recognition receptors in the cytoplasm (25Latz E. The inflammasomes: Mechanisms of activation and function.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2010; 22: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).

Rev. 2011; 243: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and cholesterol crystals formed in atherosclerosis (27Rajamäki K. Lappalainen J. Oörni K. Välimäki E. Matikainen S. Kovanen P.T.

NLRP3 inflammasomes are required for atherogenesis and activated by cholesterol crystals.Nature. 2010; 464: 1357-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). Activation of NLRP3 is dependent on intracellular stress signals caused by the activators, but the mechanism remains poorly defined. Thus, lysosomal membrane destabilization, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and potassium efflux from the cells may alone or in combination mediate NLRP3 activation (26Gross O. Thomas C.J. Guarda G. Tschopp J. The inflammasome: An integrated view.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 243: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In addition to potassium efflux, also other changes in intracellular ion homeostasis may be involved in NLRP3 activation, as implied by ion substitution experiments of the extracellular medium (29Perregaux D.G.

We hypothesized that acidic environment, created by actively metabolizing immune cells or hypoxia, may represent an endogenous danger signal for macrophages and trigger inflammasome activation via alterations of the intracellular milieu. To test this, custom-manufactured cell culture media covering the pH range 7.5–6.0 were designed with a single buffer system. Here, we show that extracellular acidosis triggers pH-dependent secretion of mature IL-1β from cultured human macrophages via a mechanism involving cellular potassium depletion and inflammasome activation.

Each experiment with primary human macrophages was performed using macrophages derived from a single donor. The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (catalog no. TIB-202) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (reagents by Lonza). To induce monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, THP-1 cells were cultured for 72 h in culture medium supplemented with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma). To study the effects of acidic pH, we used custom RPMI 1640 media at pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0 (Athena Enzyme Systems) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The RPMI formulation was modified by lowering the NaHCO3 concentration from 24 to 5 mm, and by adding 20 mm PIPES buffer. PIPES at 20–40 mm is well tolerated in cell culture by several mammalian cell lines (33Eagle H. Buffer combinations for mammalian cell culture.Science. 1971; 174: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and displays negligible metal ion binding and surfactant activity (34Vasconcelos M.T.

Cell viability and morphology of differentiated primary and THP-1 macrophages were not altered in custom RPMI, pH 7.5, compared with normal RPMI (supplemental Fig. S1). To study the effects of alkaline pH, a custom bicarbonate-free DMEM (HyClone Laboratories) was buffered to pH of 7.5, 8.0, or 8.5 with 40 mm Tricine and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Tricine is a buffer well tolerated in cell culture at 20–40 mm by several mammalian cell lines (33Eagle H. Buffer combinations for mammalian cell culture.Science. 1971; 174: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The experiments involving alkaline pH were conducted at +37 °C in a non-CO2 incubator to avoid rapid equilibration of alkaline pH toward neutral in 5% CO2 environment. Primary human macrophages were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 4 h (medium, pH 7.5) to induce pro-IL-1β expression. Subsequently, the cells were washed in PBS, followed by exposure to the inflammasome-activating stimuli. Stock solutions of NAC, 4-aminopyridine, and tetraethylammonium chloride were neutralized before use to ensure that they do not change the pH of the culture media during the experiments. Z-YVAD-fmk and CA-074-Me were present both in a 1-h preincubation at pH 7.5 and during the exposure to acidic pH, whereas NAC was present only during a 30-min preincubation at pH 7.5. These inhibitors exert their effects intracellularly, and the preincubation at pH 7.5 ensures efficient loading of the inhibitors into cells before introduction of acidic pH. KCl, CsCl, BaCl2, tetraethylammonium chloride, 4-aminopyridine, bafilomycin A1, and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride were added simultaneously with the pH stimulus. Of these, the simple salts are highly water-soluble and not affected by the moderately acidic pH environment used in the experiments. 4-Aminopyridine (35Howe J.R. Ritchie J.M.

IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-18, and TNF-α were analyzed in neutralized culture medium supernatants by using commercial sandwich ELISA assays (IL-18 assay by Medical & Biological Laboratories; others by R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Medium supernatants from THP-1 macrophages were neutralized and subsequently concentrated at +4 °C using Vivaspin 6 centrifugal concentrators with a 5-kDa cut-off (Sartorius). Cells were lysed with ice cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). Medium samples and cell lysates were run in SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies raised against human IL-1β and caspase-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-7884 and sc-515) and the goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) HRP conjugate was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc..

After transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 6 h in RPMI, pH 7.5 or pH 6.5. Finally, the media were collected for cytokine analysis, and RNA was isolated from the cells for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. THP-1 macrophages were differentiated on 25-mm round coverslips and intracellular pH was measured by using the cell-permeable probe 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes) and the InCytIm2 fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging, Inc.) as described previously (40Nordström T.

To compensate for the weak intrinsic fluorescence present in the medium (at 440 nm), a correction factor was determined using the free acid form of BCECF. Fifty cells per coverslip were manually selected for each analysis. Analysis of intracellular cholesteryl ester content in macrophages was performed by thin layer chromatography as described (27Rajamäki K. Lappalainen J. Oörni K. Välimäki E. Matikainen S.

Statistical analysis was performed using the PASW Statistics software (version 20.0, SPSS, Inc.) and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney's U test. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. Incubation of LPS-primed primary human macrophages, LPS-primed mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, and PMA-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages in low pH custom media induced a pH-dependent secretion of the inflammasome-controlled cytokines IL-1β (Fig. 1, A and B) (supplemental Fig. S2A) and IL-18 (Fig. 1C). Secretion of IL-1β was below the detection limit in nonprimed human and mouse primary macrophages at acidic pH. LPS priming is required in these cells for induction of pro-IL-1β expression via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and nuclear factor-κB, whereas in THP-1 cells, the PMA treatment induces stable expression of pro-IL-1β, and priming with LPS is thus not required (24Martinon F.

Caspase-1 blots from concentrated culture medium supernatants revealed the presence of the 10-kDa active subunit at pH 6.5 and pH 6.0, directly demonstrating acidic pH-induced caspase-1 activation (Fig. 1D, left panel). Moreover, Western blotting confirmed secretion of the 17-kDa mature IL-1β at pH 7.0–6.0, but not at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1D, right panel). Interestingly, also a 20-kDa IL-1β fragment was secreted at pH 6.0. A partially active IL-1β fragment of ∼20 kDa also has been described previously in macrophages (42Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A.

In addition to IL-1β and IL-18, secretion of two inflammasome-independent cytokines, IL-1α and TNF-α, was studied (Fig. 1, E and F). A statistically significant increase in IL-1α secretion was observed at acidic pH, although the amount of cytokine secreted in 6 h was marginal (Fig. 1E). Low pH induced TNF-α secretion in THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 1F) but not in nonprimed primary macrophages (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2017642230,"Cytoplasmic α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates, referred to as Lewy bodies, are pathological hallmarks of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson disease. Activation of macroautophagy is suggested to facilitate degradation of certain proteinaceous inclusions, but it is unclear if this pathway is capable of degrading α-syn aggregates. Here, we examined this issue by utilizing cellular models in which intracellular Lewy body-like α-syn inclusions accumulate after internalization of pre-formed α-syn fibrils into α-syn-expressing HEK293 cells or cultured primary neurons. We demonstrate that α-syn inclusions cannot be effectively degraded, even though they co-localize with essential components of both the autophagic and proteasomal protein degradation pathways. The α-syn aggregates persist even after soluble α-syn levels have been substantially reduced, suggesting that once formed, the α-syn inclusions are refractory to clearance. Importantly, we also find that α-syn aggregates impair overall macroautophagy by reducing autophagosome clearance, which may contribute to the increased cell death that is observed in aggregate-bearing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032314289,"Objectives To determine the duration of protection from hepatitis B vaccine given in infancy and early childhood and asses risk factors for HBV infection and chronic infection. Methods In 1984 infant HBV vaccination was started in two Gambian villages. Cross sectional serological surveys have been undertaken every 4 years to determine vaccine efficacy. In the current survey 84.6% of 1508 eligible participants aged 1–28 years were tested. A spouse study was conducted in females (aged 14 years and above) and their male partners. Results Vaccine efficacy against chronic infection with hepatitis B virus was 95.1% (95% confidence interval 91.5% to 97.1%), which did not vary significantly between age groups or village. Efficacy against infection was 85.4% (82.7% to 87.7%), falling significantly with age. Concentrations of hepatitis B antibody fell exponentially with age varying according to peak response: 20 years after vaccination only 17.8% (95% CI 10.1–25.6) of persons with a low peak response (10–99 mIU/ml) had detectable HBs antibody compared to 27% (21.9% to 32.2%) of those with a high peak response (>999 mIU/ml). Time since vaccination and a low peak response were the strongest risk factors for HBV infections; males were more susceptible, marriage was not a significant risk for females. Hepatitis B DNA was not detected after infection, which tested soley core antibody positive. An undetectable peak antibody response of <10 mIU/ml and a mother who was hepatitis B e antigen positive were powerful risk factors for chronic infection. Conclusions Adolescents and young adults vaccinated in infancy are at increased risk of hepatitis B infection, but not chronic infection. Married women were not at increased risk. There is no compelling evidence for the use of a booster dose of HBV vaccine in The Gambia."
https://openalex.org/W2152449788,"Results of medical research studies are often contradictory or cannot be reproduced. One reason is that there may not be enough patient subjects available for observation for a long enough time period. Another reason is that patient populations may vary considerably with respect to geographic and demographic boundaries thus limiting how broadly the results apply. Even when similar patient populations are pooled together from multiple locations, differences in medical treatment and record systems can limit which outcome measures can be commonly analyzed. In total, these differences in medical research settings can lead to differing conclusions or can even prevent some studies from starting. We thus sought to create a patient research system that could aggregate as many patient observations as possible from a large number of hospitals in a uniform way. We call this system the 'Shared Health Research Information Network', with the following properties: (1) reuse electronic health data from everyday clinical care for research purposes, (2) respect patient privacy and hospital autonomy, (3) aggregate patient populations across many hospitals to achieve statistically significant sample sizes that can be validated independently of a single research setting, (4) harmonize the observation facts recorded at each institution such that queries can be made across many hospitals in parallel, (5) scale to regional and national collaborations. The purpose of this report is to provide open source software for multi-site clinical studies and to report on early uses of this application. At this time SHRINE implementations have been used for multi-site studies of autism co-morbidity, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, colorectal cancer, diabetes, and others. The wide range of study objectives and growing adoption suggest that SHRINE may be applicable beyond the research uses and participating hospitals named in this report."
https://openalex.org/W2099578825,"Recent studies have shown that activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) is required for decidualization, interacting with progesterone receptor (PR) in uterus. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that crosstalk between STAT3 and PR signaling is required for successful implantation. To identify the interaction between STAT3 and PR isoforms, we performed immunoprecipitation following transient cotransfection and found that STAT3 physically interacted with PR-A, which is known to be important for uterine development and function, but not with PR-B. To further investigate the role of Stat3 in uterine function, Stat3 was conditionally ablated only in the PR-positive cells (PR(cre/+) Stat3(f/f); Stat3(d/d)). Our studies revealed that ovarian function and uterine development of Stat3(d/d) mice were normal. However, Stat3(d/d) female mice were infertile due to defective embryo implantation. Unlike Stat3(f/f) mice, Stat3(d/d) mice exhibited an unclosed uterine lumen. Furthermore, uteri of Stat3(d/d) mice were unable to undergo a well-characterized hormonally induced decidual reaction. The expression of stromal PR was decreased during decidualization and preimplantation period in Stat3(d/d) mice, and PR target genes were significantly down-regulated after progesterone induction. Our results suggest that STAT3 and PR crosstalk is required for successful implantation in the mouse uterus."

The glycoside hydrolase family 7 cellobiohydrolase Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei is one of the best studied cellulases with the ability to degrade highly crystalline cellulose. The catalytic domain and the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) are both necessary for full activity on crystalline substrates. Our previous high-speed atomic force microscopy studies showed that mutation of Trp-40 at the entrance of the catalytic tunnel drastically decreases the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose. Here, we examined the activities of the WT enzyme and mutant W40A (with and without the CBD) for various substrates. Evaluation and comparison of the specific activities of the enzymes (WT, W40A, and the corresponding catalytic subunits (WTcat and W40Acat)) adsorbed on crystalline cellulose indicated that Trp-40 is involved in recruiting individual substrate chains into the active site tunnel to initiate processive hydrolysis. This was supported by molecular dynamics simulation study, i.e. the reducing end glucose unit was effectively loaded into the active site of WTcat, but not into that of W40Acat, when the simulation was started from subsite -7. However, when similar simulations were carried out starting from subsite -5, both enzymes held the substrate for 50 ns, indicating that the major difference between WTcat and W40Acat is the length of the free chain end of the substrate required to allow initiation of processive movements; this also reflects the difference between crystalline and amorphous celluloses. The CBD is important for enhancing the enzyme population on crystalline substrate, but it also decreases the specific activity of the adsorbed enzyme, possibly by attaching the enzyme to non-optimal places on the cellulose surface and/or hindering processive hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2124126188,"A physically anchored consensus map is foundational to modern genomics research; however, construction of such a map in oat (Avena sativa L., 2n = 6x = 42) has been hindered by the size and complexity of the genome, the scarcity of robust molecular markers, and the lack of aneuploid stocks. Resources developed in this study include a modified SNP discovery method for complex genomes, a diverse set of oat SNP markers, and a novel chromosome-deficient SNP anchoring strategy. These resources were applied to build the first complete, physically-anchored consensus map of hexaploid oat. Approximately 11,000 high-confidence in silico SNPs were discovered based on nine million inter-varietal sequence reads of genomic and cDNA origin. GoldenGate genotyping of 3,072 SNP assays yielded 1,311 robust markers, of which 985 were mapped in 390 recombinant-inbred lines from six bi-parental mapping populations ranging in size from 49 to 97 progeny. The consensus map included 985 SNPs and 68 previously-published markers, resolving 21 linkage groups with a total map distance of 1,838.8 cM. Consensus linkage groups were assigned to 21 chromosomes using SNP deletion analysis of chromosome-deficient monosomic hybrid stocks. Alignments with sequenced genomes of rice and Brachypodium provide evidence for extensive conservation of genomic regions, and renewed encouragement for orthology-based genomic discovery in this important hexaploid species. These results also provide a framework for high-resolution genetic analysis in oat, and a model for marker development and map construction in other species with complex genomes and limited resources."

They are coexpressed in different tissues, where they are known to associate with each other to form hetero-oligomeric complexes. In this study, we aimed to determine how these two sHSPs interact to form hetero-oligomers in vitro and whether, by doing so, there is an increase in their chaperone activity and stability compared with their homo-oligomeric forms. Our results demonstrate that HSP27 and αB formed polydisperse hetero-oligomers in vitro, which had an average molecular mass that was intermediate of each of the homo-oligomers and which were more thermostable than αB, but less so than HSP27. The hetero-oligomer chaperone function was found to be equivalent to that of αB, with each being significantly better in preventing the amorphous aggregation of α-lactalbumin and the amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein in comparison with HSP27. Using mass spectrometry to monitor subunit exchange over time, we found that HSP27 and αB exchanged subunits 23% faster than the reported rate for HSP27 and αA and almost twice that for αA and αB.

https://openalex.org/W1994990671,"Viral infection causes activation of the transcription factor IRF3, which is critical for production of type I interferons (IFNs) and innate antiviral immune response. How virus-induced type I IFN signaling is controlled is not fully understood. Here we identified the transcription factor FoxO1 as a negative regulator for virus-triggered IFN-β induction. Overexpression of FoxO1 inhibited virus-triggered ISRE activation, IFN-β induction as well as cellular antiviral response, whereas knockdown of FoxO1 had opposite effects. FoxO1 interacted with IRF3 in a viral infection-dependent manner and promoted K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of IRF3 in the cytosol. Furthermore, FoxO1-mediated degradation of IRF3 was independent of the known E3 ubiquitin ligases for IRF3, including RBCK1 and RAUL. Our findings thus suggest that FoxO1 negatively regulates cellular antiviral response by promoting IRF3 ubiquitination and degradation, providing a previously unknown mechanism for control of type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral response."

Briefly, cell growth was measured by plating 10,000 cells/well on standard 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon 353047) and counting cells at the indicated time points in a Coulter counter. For wound healing migration assays, confluent cell monolayers were scratched, and migration was quantitated as the number of cells that entered a 300 × 200-μm area in the center of the wound at 18 h. For some experiments, the PKA modulators 8-Br-cAMP (Calbiochem 203800) or H-89 (Calbiochem 371963) were added immediately after wounding. For Transwell invasion assays, 600,000 cells were added to each chamber of 6-well Transwell membranes with an 8-μm pore size (Transwell-Clear, Costar 3428), incubated for 24 h, released separately from the top and bottom of the membrane, counted in a Coulter Counter, and quantified as the percentage of cells that migrated from the top of the membrane to the bottom of the membrane. To analyze unopposed movement, PdpnKo cell lines were plated on 35-mm culture dishes at 5% confluence and incubated overnight. To analyze the effects of PdpnKo cells on the movement of melanoma cells in coculture, B16F10 melanoma cells were labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate as described (17Alexander D.B.

Medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium before dishes were mounted on an INUBG2A-ZILCS with UNIV-35 stage top incubator (Tokai Hit, Shizuoka, Japan) maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Images of cells were captured with AxioCam MRm camera at 5-min intervals for 18 (unopposed movement) or 36 h (cocultured melanoma cells) with a 5× CP-Achromat objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL inverted microscope or a 10× EC Plan NEOF objective with a Zeiss Axiovert Observer Z1 inverted microscope, respectively. Distance and displacement traveled from the starting point to the end point were measured by tracking the center of the nuclei of motile cells with AxioVision software (version 4.3, Carl Zeiss). The percentage of morphologically intact cells was used to quantitate the survival of cocultured melanoma cells. Experiments were repeated with similar results and means, errors, and unpaired two-tailed t tests were calculated from representative data sets with Prism (version 4, GraphPad Software).

There are 2 conserved serines in the intracellular region of mouse and human PDPN. These serine residues could potentially serve as phosphorylation sites for PKC or PKA. Using a peptide that corresponds to the entire cytoplasmic portion of PDPN, we performed in vitro kinase assays to evaluate the ability of these kinases to phosphorylate these sites. As shown in Fig. 1, PKA catalyzed the time-dependent phosphorylation of the PDPN cytoplasmic peptide. In contrast, PKC did not phosphorylate the peptide to any significant extent (data not shown). We generated homozygous null Pdpn knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PdpnKo cells) to study the effects of PDPN modification on cell behavior. The absence of endogenous PDPN background of these cells facilitated evaluation of how modification of PDPN intracellular serines affected cell growth and motility. These cells were stably transfected with constructs encoding wild type PDPN (PdpnWT), nonphosphorylatable PDPN with both intracellular serines mutated to alanine (PdpnAA), phosphomimetic PDPN with both intracellular serines mutated to aspartate (PdpnDD), or empty vectors (PdpnEF4) as controls. Expression of these transgenes was verified by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 2a. Although PDPN has been shown to promote cell migration, its effects on cell growth and proliferation are less defined (8Wicki A. Christofori G. The potential role of podoplanin in tumour invasion.Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9Raica M. Cimpean A.M. Ribatti D. The role of podoplanin in tumor progression and metastasis.Anticancer Res. 2008; 28: 2997-3006PubMed Google Scholar, 10Astarita J.L. Acton S.E. Turley S.J. Podoplanin: emerging functions in development, the immune system, and cancer.Front Immunol. 2012; 3: 283Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A role for PDPN in cell growth seemed to emerge on the clear background of homozygous null knock-out cells. As shown in Fig. 2b, expression of wild type (PdpnWT) or nonphosphorylatable (PdpnAA) PDPN appeared to decrease cell growth rates by about 50% when compared with control transfectants (PdpnEF4). Interestingly, this effect was not seen in cells transfected with the phosphomimetic PDPN (PdpnDD) construct. As expected, wild type PDPN augmented the migration of PdpnKo cells. PdpnWT cells migrated about 50% more than the control transfectants (PdpnEF4) in wound healing migration assays shown in Fig. 2, c and d. However, although expression of the PdpnAA construct did not exceed that of PdpnWT, PdpnAA cells migrated about 40% more than PdpnWT cells in these assays. These results were confirmed by Transwell invasion assays in which PdpnWT cells moved about 4-fold better through 8-μm pores than PdpnEF4 cells, and PdpnAA cells moved about 50% more than the PdpnWT cells (Fig. 2e). Results from wild type (PdpnWT) and nonphosphorylatable (PdpnAA) constructs suggest that PDPN can be phosphorylated to inhibit cell migration. This hypothesis is supported by results from phosphomimetic (PdpnDD) constructs. In contrast to PdpnWT or PdpnAA constructs, phosphomimetic (PdpnDD) Pdpn did not significantly increase cell motility when compared with PdpnEF4 control cells in wound healing migration (Fig. 2, c and d) or Transwell invasion (Fig. 2e) assays. Interestingly, in contrast to wild type or PdpnAA transfectants, PdpnDD transfection did not significantly decrease cell growth when compared with PdpnEF4 controls (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that PDPN signaling may convert some metabolic energy used for cell proliferation into processes needed for motility. PDPN can promote both collective and individual cell migration in the absence or presence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (7Wicki A. Lehembre F. Wick N. Hantusch B. Kerjaschki D. Christofori G. Tumor invasion in the absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition: podoplanin-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 25Martín-Villar E. Megías D. Castel S. Yurrita M.M. Vilaró S. Quintanilla M. Podoplanin binds ERM proteins to activate RhoA and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4541-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to wound healing and Transwell assays, live cell imaging was used to investigate the effects of PDPN serine modifications on the motility of individual cells in sparse cultures. These assays also allowed direct measurements of total displacement and distance traveled by individual cells over time. As with wound healing and Transwell assays cells, PDPN transfectants moved better than control cells, and nonphosphorylatable PDPN increased the motility of these cells more than wild type PDPN. PdpnKo cells transfected with PdpnEF4, PdpnWT, or PdpnAA moved at an average displacement speed of 1.6, 3.7, or 4.2 μm/h (Fig. 2f and supplemental Fig. 1, a-c) to travel an average distance of 3.4, 6.2, or 11 μm/h, respectively. In contrast, the movement of cells transfected with phosphomimetic PDPN (PdpnDD) was not significantly different from controls (PdpnEF4) when measured by displacement (1.3 μm/h) and significantly less than controls when measured by distance (1.9 μm/h) (Fig. 2f and supplemental Fig. 1d). These data indicate that PDPN can be phosphorylated to decrease both collective and individual cell motility. Results from kinase assays and site mutants suggest that PKA activation inhibits PDPN-mediated cell migration. As shown in Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2, the PKA agonist 8-Br-cAMP significantly decreased the migration of cells transfected with wild type PDPN. Conversely, treatment of these cells with the PKA blocker H-89 significantly increased their migration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PKA phosphorylates PDPN to decrease cell migration. PDPN expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts has been linked to increased tumor invasive and metastatic potential (26Ito S. Ishii G. Hoshino A. Hashimoto H. Neri S. Kuwata T. Higashi M. Nagai K.

Podoplanin-positive fibroblasts enhance lung adenocarcinoma tumor formation: podoplanin in fibroblast functions for tumor progression.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We utilized PdpnKo cells to investigate mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between cancer cells and their neighboring fibroblasts. Melanoma cells that express PDPN as a functionally relevant biomarker and potential chemotherapeutic target were chosen as subjects for this investigation (18Ochoa-Alvarez J.A. Krishnan H. Shen Y. Acharya N.K. Han M. McNulty D.E. Hasegawa H. Hyodo T. Senga T. Geng J.G. Kosciuk M. Shin S.S. Goydos J.S. Temiakov D. Nagele R.G. Goldberg G.S. Plant lectin can target receptors containing sialic acid, exemplified by podoplanin, to inhibit transformed cell growth and migration.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e41845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells migrated an average distance of about 9.2 μm/h when surrounded by other melanoma cells (Fig. 4, a and b, and supplemental Fig. 3a). The migration of melanoma cells when surrounded by fibroblasts expressing (PdpnWT cells) was not significantly different from their migration when surrounded by melanoma cells (Fig. 4, a and b, and supplemental Fig. 3b). However, melanoma cell migration was decreased by over 50%, to an average distance of only 4.2 μm/h, when surrounded by PdpnEF4 control cells (Fig. 4, a and b). Thus, fibroblasts expressing PDPN appeared to facilitate the migration of neighboring tumor cells better than PDPN-deficient fibroblasts. In addition to increasing tumor cell motility, PDPN expression in fibroblasts affected the viability of neighboring melanoma cells. As shown in Fig. 4, a and c, about 70% of melanoma cells cocultured with cells lacking Pdpn (PdpnEF4) went through morphological changes indicative of apoptosis (see supplemental Fig. 3c) when compared with about 20% of melanoma cells cocultured with PdpnWT cells or 10% cocultured with other melanoma cells. Also, as shown in Fig. 4, melanoma cells cocultured with fibroblasts expressing phosphomimetic PDPN behaved similarly to those cultured with control transfectants (see supplemental Fig. 3d). Taken together, these data indicate that PDPN expression levels and phosphorylation status in fibroblasts can affect the motility and viability of neighboring tumor cells. PDPN expression enhances the motility and invasion of several transformed cell types including mammary carcinoma (7Wicki A. Lehembre F. Wick N. Hantusch B. Kerjaschki D. Christofori G.

Christofori G. The potential role of podoplanin in tumour invasion.Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition to tumor cells themselves, PDPN is also located on endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels, which can facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis (32Mumprecht V. Detmar M.

Consistent with these findings, our results indicate that PDPN expression in fibroblasts can facilitate migration and survival of neighboring tumor cells in the microenvironment. Further elucidation of events underlying this relationship should lead to a greater understanding of fundamental mechanisms that guide stroma-tumor interactions and how they may be exploited to combat cancer. Indeed, PDPN presents great potential as a functionally relevant biomarker and chemotherapeutic target (8Wicki A. Christofori G. The potential role of podoplanin in tumour invasion.Br. J.

The effect this protein phosphorylation has on muscle mechanics during a physiological range of shortening velocities, during which the heart generates power and performs work, has not been addressed. We have expressed and phosphorylated recombinant Rattus norvegicus left ventricular RLC. In vitro we have phosphorylated these recombinant species with cardiac myosin light chain kinase and zipper-interacting protein kinase. We compare rat permeabilized cardiac trabeculae, which have undergone exchange with differently phosphorylated RLC species. We were able to enrich trabecular RLC phosphorylation by 40% compared with controls and, in a separate series, lower RLC phosphorylation to 60% of control values. Compared with the trabeculae with a low level of RLC phosphorylation, RLC phosphorylation enrichment increased isometric force by more than 3-fold and peak power output by more than 7-fold and approximately doubled both maximum shortening speed and the shortening velocity that generated peak power. We augmented these measurements by observing increased RLC phosphorylation of human and rat HF samples from endocardial left ventricular homogenate. These results demonstrate the importance of increased RLC phosphorylation in the up-regulation of myocardial performance and suggest that reduced RLC phosphorylation is a key aspect of impaired contractile function in the diseased myocardium.

Interactions between the two contractile proteins actin (thin filament) and myosin (thick filament) drive the contractile machinery of muscle contraction (1Spudich J.A.

These studies elucidated the effect a mutation has on cardiac pathology from model organisms but did not isolate the effect of RLC phosphorylation on muscle mechanics independent of other protein modifications. These studies did not assess mechanics during muscle shortening. In this paper, a Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE method was utilized to observe the changing RLC phosphorylation profile during heart failure progression in human patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA)-classified HF progression and in a rat model of chronic MI, which manifests as early cardiac hypertrophy and eventual heart failure. In addition, we studied and evaluated the mechanical effect of RLC phosphorylation on permeabilized cardiac tissue. We used force-velocity (FV) and power-velocity (PV) relationships to assess the effect a physiological range of RLC phosphorylations had on the contractile characteristics of permeabilized cardiac trabeculae. This was performed during muscle shortening over a set of velocities in which the heart generates power and performs work in the physiological range. All animal surgical procedures and perioperative management were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health under assurance number A5634-01. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) underwent proximal left anterior descending coronary ligation to induce chronic myocardial infarction as described previously (27Lyon A.R. MacLeod K.T.

Age-matched controls were used as a comparison with two MI time points, 4 weeks post-MI and 16 weeks post-MI. Relative hypertrophy was assessed by heart weight to body weight ratio, and ejection fraction was measured by M-mode echocardiography (Vevo 770, Visualsonics) to give a measure of cardiac function (Table 1).TABLE 1Rat model of myocardial infarction shows compensated hypertrophy at 4 weeks with decompensation by 16 weeksEjection fractionHW/BWAMCMIaSignificant main MI treatment effect (p < 0.001).AMCMI4 weeks78.6 ± 3.89 (n = 9)43.3 ± 3.89 (n = 9)3.43 ± 0.17 (n = 9)4.84 ± 0.17bSignificant MI effects, within 4-week pairing (p < 0.001).

Open table in a new tab 10 mg of rat myocardium was removed from the left ventricular endocardial region close to the apex, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. On the day of the experiment, samples were mechanically homogenized using a pestle and mortar cooled with dry ice. Samples were then added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Human tissue samples were also removed from the endocardial layer of the left ventricle and prepared the same way. Porcine hearts were obtained from the Royal Veterinary College. These were rinsed in ice-cold saline and prepared for gel analysis in the same manner as rat and human myofibrils. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min to aid protein denaturation. Gels were subsequently loaded with 10-μl individual samples. Phos-tagTM incorporating 15% SDS-PAGE and PVDF membrane blotting with chemiluminescent antibody detection were used to ascertain quantitative RLC phosphorylation levels. Gels were run for 120 min and blotted for 60 min. Membranes were probed with mouse anti-RLC antibodies (F109.3E1, Alexis Biochemicals, Nottingham, UK). Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked IgG was used with a Bio-Rad electrochemiluminescence kit for band visualization in a Bio-Rad GelDoc imager. ImageJ was used to threshold and measure individual band densities. rRLC was expressed from pET6a vector fused to an N-terminal histidine tag and tobacco etch virus protease site. After expression, cells harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 5000 × g) were lysed by BugBuster MasterMix (71456-4, Novagen) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (11873580001, Roche Applied Science), and the inclusion bodies were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified inclusion bodies were resolubilized in IMAC binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm imidazole) containing 6 m urea for 4 h at 4 °C under vigorous stirring. After removing insoluble components by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of IMAC binding buffer containing 6 m urea, and the protein was eluted with a step gradient of imidazole (50–500 mm, 50 mm increments) in IMAC binding buffer containing 6 m urea. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled, and urea were removed by dialyzing three times against dialysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). To remove the N-terminal histidine tag, tobacco etch virus protease was added in a 1:100 stoichiometry, and the protein was digested overnight at 4 °C. The sodium chloride concentration was adjusted to 500 mm, and tobacco etch virus proteases and remaining impurities were removed by passing through 1-ml HisTrapFF (GE Healthcare) columns. The column flow-through containing the purified rRLC was collected, and the protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml (UFC901024, AMICON spin concentrators). Protein was stored at −80 °C until further use. rRLC phosphorylation species from Rattus norvegicus were created by incubation of rRLC with cardiac myosin light chain kinase donated by Mathias Gautel (King's College London) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (28Chang A.N. Chen G. Gerard R.D. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Cardiac myosin is a substrate for zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK).J. Biol.

Fresh kinase (1 μg/ml of reaction mixture) was added to the reaction mixture every 30 min. Kinases and phosphatases were removed by molecular weight cut-off column filtration. Phosphorylated rRLC was mixed 50:50 with unphosphorylated rRLC to produce control-mimicking in vivo RLC phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated rRLC was produced by incubation with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) (20 units/100 μl of protein) in vitro for 60 min in kinase buffer without ATP. Following expression, the buffer solution (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1) containing recombinant RLC was exchanged to a labeling buffer (0.1 m NaCl and 0.1 m NaH2PO4 at pH 7.2) using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare). Protein was subsequently incubated on ice for 2 h with N-hydroxysuccinimide-rhodamine ester (10 mg/ml in DMSO; Thermo Scientific). Excess dye was removed using ZebaTM desalting spin columns (Thermo Scientific). Absorbance at 555 nm for the protein dye conjugate was used to indicate the labeling ratio of dye to protein. The buffer was changed to 5 mm ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm potassium proprionate, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm trifluoperazine at pH 6.5 (exchange solution) for protein exchange as previously described (29Caorsi V.

Explanted, permeabilized, and T-clipped trabeculae were mounted between two hooks at a sarcomere length of 2.1 μm and cooled in relaxing solution to 0.5 °C. Trabeculae were moved to a stage at 20 °C to be incubated for 45 min in 0.5 mg/ml RLC exchange solution, which incorporated 0.5 mg/ml TnC. TnC was added to all exchange solutions to reintroduce TnC that is lost during exchange so as not to alter contractile characteristics of the preparations. Trabeculae were incubated in three sequential 15-min incubations with fresh 30-μl drops of RLC exchange solution incorporating TnC. The preparation was then washed three times (15 min each, at 0.5 °C) in relaxing solution containing 0.5 mg/ml TnC to remove unbound RLC. Trabeculae were mounted in relaxing solution between hooks attached at one end to a force transducer (AE801, HJK Sensoren + Systeme, Freidburg, Germany) and at the other to a motor (32Bershitsky S.

Trabeculae were taken through a sequence of solution changes using a two-stage quartz-surfaced platform system that was temperature-controlled (2 or 20 °C) and moved horizontally using a stepper motor (33Linari M. Dobbie I. Reconditi M. Koubassova N. Irving M. Piazzesi G. Lombardi V. The stiffness of skeletal muscle in isometric contraction and rigor. The fraction of myosin heads bound to actin.Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2459-2473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Each platform had two pedestals, which carried 30 μl of solution on their surface. The platform was moved so that the trabecular tissue was submerged in these bubbles of solutions in the following order: preactivating (2 °C), activating (2 °C), activating (20 °C), and relaxing (20 °C) representative tension trace shown in Fig. 1A. Trabecular dimensions were recorded by observation with transmitted light with a ×40 objective (0.75 numerical aperture, water; Zeiss). The stage movements and trabecular lengths were controlled using LabView software that also recorded digitized motor and force transducer outputs during experimentation. Upon activation and after peak isometric force was attained, “slack test” measurements on each preparation were carried out. Trabeculae were slackened by rapidly reducing length to between 8 and 12% of the initial muscle length. This was performed three times with each fiber. The time of force deviation from “slack force” was determined by fitting through the initial 100 ms of the tension recovery trace. The time taken for force to rise above the zero-force level was measured in each case by fitting the initial linear phase of tension development post-slack (Fig. 1B, green lines). Vmax was calculated from the slope of the line joining the data points resulting from a plot of step length amplitude versus slack time (34Edman K.A. The velocity of unloaded shortening and its relation to sarcomere length and isometric force in vertebrate muscle fibres.J. Physiol. 1979; 291: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The order in which the slack lengths were applied was randomized. FV measurements incorporated release/ramp protocols (35Curtin N.A. Gardner-Medwin A.R. Woledge R.C. Predictions of the time course of force and power output by dogfish white muscle fibres during brief tetani.J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with ramp velocities between 0.1 and 1.5 muscle lengths/s. The ratio of muscle length in the ramp and in the release is dependent on the velocity of the ramp to achieve an isotonic plateau during the protocol. In our experiments, a rapid release of 8% of initial muscle length was applied (Fig. 1, C and D). The rapid release component effectively slackens the parallel elastic component of the preparation, giving rise to a nearly steady force level during ramp shortening. Force measurements were normalized to trabecular cross-sectional area and reported as kilonewtons/m2. Vmax is reported in muscle lengths/s. For each trabeculum, the relationship between force during shortening and shortening velocity was fit to a hyperbola previously described by Hill (36Hill A.V. The heat of shortening and the dynamic constants of muscle.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1938; 126: 136-195Crossref Google Scholar). The parameters from these fits are presented as means ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance was used to make multiple comparisons between treatment groups in Table 1. For other analyses, one-way analysis of variance was used to test our experimental hypotheses. Appropriate post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons were made using a Bonferroni adjusted t test method with an overall significance of p < 0.05 in all instances. Phos-tagTM gel electrophoresis was used to evaluate RLC phosphorylation levels during progression of a rat heart failure model caused by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. A phosphorylation level of 0.53 ± 0.06 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 12) was observed in tissue from the inner left ventricular wall of the rat, in comparison with the phosphorylation level in non-failing human myocardium (0.41 ± 0.05 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 5)). These values are very similar to that of the pig left ventricular wall at 0.42 ± 0.02 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 2). Left ventricular RLC phosphorylation during the hypertrophic remodeling phase post-MI was 0.72 ± 0.03 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 5) versus healthy rat at 0.53 ± 0.06 mol Pi/mol of RLC (n = 12), and this difference was assessed as the model progressed to chronically dilated and failing phenotype (0.76 ± 0.07 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 4), p < 0.05), showing a significant difference in late stage disease. In addition, the RLC phosphorylation levels during progression of clinical heart failure in human patients as defined by symptomatic classification of severity (the NYHA classification) were evaluated. A similar trend of increased RLC phosphorylation during disease was found when we studied human heart failure tissue during progressive clinically designated disease severity. Those classified NYHA I and II show a similar trend, increasing during disease progression from a control phosphorylation state of 0.47 ± 0.05 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 4) to NYHA III and IV patient tissues, which show a significant increase, 0.6 ± 0.03 mol of Pi/mol of RLC (n = 4) (p < 0.05) in comparison (Fig. 2). In order to study the effect of RLC phosphorylation under more controlled conditions, cardiac RLC was expressed in bacteria. The phosphorylation levels of the RLC were increased by incubation with cardiac myosin light chain kinase and zipper-interacting protein kinase. The Phos-tagTM gels indicated that a total of ∼1 mol of Pi/mol of RLC is incorporated into the RLC by this treatment. Another fraction of the expressed RLC was incubated with the nonspecific phosphatase shrimp alkaline phosphatase to ensure that all RLC species were dephosphorylated. These RLCs could be exchanged into skinned rat"

However, in no system have we yet identified all the RNases involved in this process. Here, we show that four 3'→5'-exoribonucleases, RNases II, R, and PH, and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), participate in maturation of the 3' end of 16S rRNA. In their absence, 16S precursor molecules with 33 extra 3'-nt accumulate; however, the presence of any one of the four RNases is sufficient to allow processing to occur, although with different efficiencies. Additionally, we find that in the absence of 3' maturation, 5' processing proceeds much less efficiently. Moreover, mutant 30S particles, containing immature 16S rRNA, form 70S ribosomes very poorly. These findings, together with the earlier discovery that RNases E and G are the 5'-processing enzymes, completes the catalogue of RNases involved in maturation of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA."

The α1 Na/K-ATPase possesses both pumping and signaling functions. However, it has not been possible to study these functions independently in live cells. We have identified a 20-amino acid peptide (Ser-415 to Gln-434) (NaKtide) from the nucleotide binding domain of α1 Na/K-ATPase that binds and inhibits Src in vitro. The N terminus of NaKtide adapts a helical structure. In vitro kinase assays showed that replacement of residues that contain a bulky side chain in the helical structure of NaKtide by alanine abolished the inhibitory effect of the peptide on Src. Similarly, disruption of helical structure by proline replacement, either single or in combination, reduced the inhibitory potency of NaKtide on Src. To identify mutant α1 that retains normal pumping function but is defective in Src regulation, we transfected Na/K-ATPase α1 knockdown PY-17 cells with expression vectors of wild type or mutant α1 carrying Ala to Pro mutations in the region of NaKtide helical structure and generated several stable cell lines. We found that expression of either A416P or A420P or A425P mutant fully restored the α1 content and consequently the pumping capacity of cells. However, in contrast to A416P, either A420P or A425P mutant was incapable of interacting and regulating cellular Src. Consequently, expression of these two mutants caused significant inhibition of ouabain-activated signal transduction and cell growth. Thus we have identified α1 mutant that has normal pumping function but is defective in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2010625410,"The filamentous fungi in the genus Aspergillus are opportunistic plant and animal pathogens that can adapt to their environment by producing various secondary metabolites, including lovastatin, penicillin, and aflatoxin. The synthesis of these small molecules is dependent on gene clusters that are globally regulated by the LaeA protein. Null mutants of LaeA in all pathogenic fungi examined to date show decreased virulence coupled with reduced secondary metabolism. Although the amino acid sequence of LaeA contains the motifs characteristic of seven-β-strand methyltransferases, a methyl-accepting substrate of LaeA has not been identified. In this work we did not find a methyl-accepting substrate in Aspergillus nidulans with various assays, including in vivo S-adenosyl-[methyl-(3)H]methionine labeling, targeted in vitro methylation experiments using putative protein substrates, or in vitro methylation assays using whole cell extracts grown under different conditions. However, in each experiment LaeA was shown to self-methylate. Amino acid hydrolysis of radioactively labeled LaeA followed by cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography identified methionine as the modified residue. Point mutations show that the major site of modification of LaeA is on methionine 207. However, in vivo complementation showed that methionine 207 is not required for the biological function of LaeA. LaeA is the first protein to exhibit automethylation at a methionine residue. These findings not only indicate LaeA may perform novel chemistry with S-adenosylmethionine but also provide new insights into the physiological function of LaeA."
https://openalex.org/W1992270172,"Atherosclerosis and vasculitis both feature inflammation mediated by neutrophil-endothelial cell (EC) contact. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) can disrupt normal EC function, although the mechanism(s) by which MPO is transferred to ECs are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that close, β2 integrin-dependent neutrophil-EC contact mediates MPO transfer from neutrophils to ECs. We used sensitive MPO assays and flow cytometry to detect MPO in ECs and demonstrate that ECs acquired MPO when contacted by neutrophils directly but not when ECs and neutrophils were separated in Transwells. The transfer was dependent on neutrophil number, exposure time, and incubation temperature. Transfer occurred in several EC types, increased with endotoxin, was not accompanied by MPO release into the medium, and was not abrogated by inhibiting degranulation to secretagogues. Confocal microscopy showed MPO internalization by ECs with cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Neutrophils and ECs formed intimate contact sites demonstrated by electron microscopy. Blocking CD11b or CD18 β2 integrin chains, or using neutrophils from CD11b gene-deleted mice, reduced MPO transfer. EC-acquired MPO was enzymatically active, as demonstrated by its ability to oxidize the fluorescent probe aminophenyl fluorescein in the presence of a hydrogen peroxide source. The data suggest an alternative to EC uptake of soluble MPO, namely the cell contact-dependent, β2 integrin-mediated transfer from neutrophils. The findings could be of therapeutic relevance in atherosclerosis and vasculitis."

Therefore, the association between hepatocyte injury and plasma transaminases is unclear and mechanisms for their increases remain unexplained. We hypothesized that increases in plasma transaminases might not be solely due to hepatocyte injury. To understand the molecular events linking hepatic lipid accumulation to elevations in plasma transaminases, we inhibited MTP using chemical antagonists, identified biochemical changes in plasma and subcellular organelles, and explained molecular events leading to increases in plasma ALT/AST.

Huh-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CellGro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics. In experiments where ALT/AST activities were to be measured, cells were incubated in dye-free DMEM containing 1% serum for 24 h. Plasmids/siRNA were transfected into cells using FuGENE HD (Promega)/RNAi Max (Life Sciences Technologies), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. MTPi, tunicamycin, and staurosporine treatments occurred for 24 h at specified concentrations. Media were harvested; protease inhibitor mixture was added and used to measure ALT/AST.

Huh-7 Cells were grown in 6-well plates and subjected to appropriate treatments. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (100 × g, 10 min), and supernatants were removed. Cell pellets were washed 2 times with PBS by centrifugation and supernatants were discarded. The pellets were resuspended in 70% ethanol and incubated overnight with agitation at −20 °C for fixation. Cells were spun (100 × g, 10 min), washed twice with PBS to remove ethanol, and pellets were stained with 300 μl of DNA staining solution (150 μg/ml of PI, 20 units/ml of RNase A in PBS) for 30 min. After staining, cells were washed 2 times with PBS and finally resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. They were then analyzed by flow cytometry using BD FACScan (BD Biosciences). Cell Quest Pro version 6.0 made histograms and analyses. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and stained with the DNA staining solution (1 ml) as described above for cell pellets. Coverslips were then placed on slides and imaged with the Nikon Eclipse E800 camera and Volocity 5.5.1 software. Total RNA from tissues and cells were isolated using TRIzolTM (Invitrogen). The purity and integrity of RNA were assessed by the A260/A280 ratio and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. RNA preparations with A260/A280 ratios more than 1.7 were used for cDNA synthesis. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using Omniscript RT (Qiagen) kit. Each reaction of quantitative RT-PCR was carried out in a volume of 20 μl, consisting of 5 μl of cDNA sample (1:100 dilution of the first strand cDNA sample) and 15 μl of PCR master mix solution containing 1× PCR buffer (qPCRTM Core Kit for SYBR Green I, Eurogentec). The PCR was carried out by incubating the reaction mixture first for 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15-s incubations at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C in the ABI 7000 SDS PCR machine. Data were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method according to the manufacturer's instruction and presented as arbitrary units. Primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. Data were normalized to ARPp0 mRNA. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance and comparisons between groups were analyzed using the Newman-Keuls post-test (GraphPad Prism 5). Western diet fed (WDF) C57Bl6J mice were utilized because MTP inhibition and gene deletion in chow fed mice did not cause ER stress or increase plasma ALT/AST levels (17Liao W. Hui T.Y. Young S.G.

MTPi in WDF mice significantly reduced hepatic MTP activity (Fig. 1A), increased triglycerides (Fig. 1B) and free cholesterol (Fig. 1C), and had no effect on free fatty acids (Fig. 1D). Increased hepatic triglyceride and free cholesterol is consistent with previous studies (17Liao W. Hui T.Y. Young S.G. Davis R.A.

Increases in hepatic free cholesterol after MTP inhibition occur as accumulation of cholesterol ester inhibits their synthesis and enhances cellular free cholesterol accumulation (20Iqbal J.

MTPi significantly lowered plasma triglycerides (Fig. 1E) and cholesterol (Fig. 1F) in non-HDL apoB-lipoproteins, whereas increasing plasma free fatty acids (Fig. 1G), ALT (Fig. 1H), and AST (Fig. 1I) as compared with controls consistent with other studies (19Samaha F.F.

To determine whether hepatic lipid accumulation contributes to augmentations in plasma transaminases, we studied the effects of pioglitazone, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (12Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H. Yano W. Ogata H. Tokuyama K. Takamoto I. Mineyama T. Ishikawa M. Moroi M. Sugi K. Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Noda T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T.

A new cholesterol-lowering agent.Clin. Pharm. 1988; 7: 21-36PubMed Google Scholar), which reduces hepatic cholesterol. Pioglitazone and lovastatin had no added effect on MTP activity in MTPi-treated animals (Fig. 1A). Although pioglitazone reduced hepatic triglycerides, lovastatin did not (Fig. 1B). Both compounds reduced hepatic free cholesterol (Fig. 1C) in MTPi-treated mice. Histological staining substantiated biochemical studies regarding hepatic triglyceride changes (Fig. 1L). MTPi and MTPi + lovastatin-treated mice had higher lipid staining than control and MTPi + pioglitazone groups. These compounds had no additional effect on plasma non-HDL triglycerides and cholesterol (Fig. 1, E and F), but reduced ALT/AST (Fig. 1, H and I) compared with MTPi-treated animals. These studies showed that reductions in free cholesterol are associated with lower plasma transaminases in WDF MTPi-treated mice. Further correlation analyses demonstrated a highly significant (p < 0.0001) positive correlation between hepatic free cholesterol and ALT/AST (Fig. 1, J and K). We, next, identified sites of free cholesterol accretion in animals treated with MTPi or MTPi + pioglitazone after subcellular fractionation (supplemental Fig. S1). ER and Golgi contained ⅔ and ⅓ of the total MTP activity (Fig. 2A); this activity was reduced after MTPi and MTPi + pioglitazone treatments. Triglycerides were in the cytosol, mitochondria/peroxisomes, and ER of control animals (Fig. 2B). Separation of mitochondria from peroxisomes showed that triglycerides were not with mitochondria (not shown). MTPi increased triglycerides in these fractions but not when pioglitazone was also administered. Free cholesterol was mainly in the plasma membrane, but also in significant quantities in the ER and mitochondria/peroxisomes (Fig. 2C). MTPi increased free cholesterol in the ER and mitochondria/peroxisomes by 3.3- and 2.7-fold, respectively; these increases were less or not seen after pioglitazone treatment. Thus, MTPi enhances free cholesterol in the ER and mitochondria. Intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol elicits different cellular responses. Increases in mitochondrial free cholesterol are associated with oxidative stress (21Marí M. Caballero F. Colell A. Morales A. Caballeria J. Fernandez A. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. García-Ruiz C. Mitochondrial free cholesterol loading sensitizes to TNF- and Fas-mediated steatohepatitis.Cell. Metab. 2006; 4: 185-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured antioxidant levels and found that MTPi-treated (Fig. 2D) animals had lower levels of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) in the mitochondria/peroxisome and cytosol. These changes were avoided by pioglitazone. Excess free cholesterol causes ER stress in macrophages (22Tabas I. Consequences of cellular cholesterol accumulation. Basic concepts and physiological implications.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). To assess whether this occurs in hepatocytes, we measured the protein levels of p-IRE1α, p-PERK, BiP, and p-eIF2α (Fig. 2, E), and mRNA levels of Bip, Ire1α, Perk, and Atf6 (Fig. 2F). MTPi increased the protein and mRNA levels of all the studied ER stress markers and these changes were attenuated in animals co-treated with lovastatin and pioglitazone. These studies suggest that hepatic MTP inhibition elicits oxidative and ER stress that is diminished by pioglitazone. We next aimed to understand mechanisms that increase plasma ALT/AST after MTP inhibition. Because ER and oxidative stress activate inflammatory pathways, we measured plasma cytokines; MTPi did not alter plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Hepatic protein levels of IL-6 and TNFα (Fig. 3, B and C), two cytokines elevated in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (23Vuppalanchi R. Chalasani N. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Selected practical issues in their evaluation and management.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), were not increased in the livers of MTPi-treated mice. Thus, MTP inhibition does not affect cytokine levels. Because, persistent ER and oxidative stresses induce cell death (21Marí M. Caballero F. Colell A. Morales A. Caballeria J. Fernandez A. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. García-Ruiz C. Mitochondrial free cholesterol loading sensitizes to TNF- and Fas-mediated steatohepatitis.Cell. Metab. 2006; 4: 185-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 22Tabas I. Consequences of cellular cholesterol accumulation. Basic concepts and physiological implications.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that MTP inhibition might increase cell death culminating in ALT/AST release. Cell death was measured using three independent approaches. First, lactate dehydrogenase levels, generally used as a marker of cell death, were not different in control, MTPi, and MTPi + pioglitazone-treated animals (Fig. 3D). Second, caspase activities that are increased during apoptosis were similar in these animals (Fig. 3E). As a positive control, tunicamycin-treated mice showed significantly elevated caspase activities (Fig. 3F). These studies suggest that MTPi may not cause cell death. Third, we treated Huh-7 cells with MTPi or staurosporine, an inducer of apoptosis. MTPi did not increase cell death as compared with control, but staurosporine did as evidenced by enhanced propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3G). Cell sorting revealed that <10% of Huh-7 cells were non-viable in control and MTPi-treated cultures (Fig. 3, J and K). However, staurosporine treatment caused a ∼30–50% increase in dead cells (Fig. 3, J and K). MTPi and staurosporine both significantly increased media ALT/AST in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, H and I), however, elevations were higher in staurosporine-treated cells. These results suggest that MTPi increases ALT/AST without causing cell death. Next, we considered other mechanisms that might contribute to ALT/AST release. These enzymes have two isoforms; the cytosolic isoforms are ALT1/AST1 (encoded by GPT/GOT1) and the mitochondrial isoforms are ALT2/AST2 (encoded by GPT2/GOT2). MTPi enhanced GPT and GOT1, but not GPT2 and GOT2, mRNA in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 4A). To ascertain whether mRNA decay contributes to increases in mRNA, MTPi-treated cells were exposed to actinomycin D to block gene transcription. The decay rates of GPT/GOT1 mRNA were similar in MTPi-treated and control cells (Fig. 4, B and C) eliminating post-transcriptional mechanisms. In contrast, MTPi enhanced luciferase activity when expressed under the control of GOT1 and GPT promoters indicating transcriptional up-regulation (Fig. 4D). Next, we tested whether tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, also up-regulates these enzymes and found that it also increased luciferase activity. These findings suggest that MTPi enhances ALT/AST through transcriptional up-regulation. We also expressed GPT and GOT1 under a cytomegalovirus promoter leading to enhanced ALT1 and AST1 levels in cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) and media (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D); these levels were unaffected by MTPi. Next, we determined the relative distribution of ALT/AST in cells and media and found that ∼4–7% of the cellular ALT/AST was in the media under different conditions (supplemental Fig. S2, E and F). These studies suggest that GPT/GOT1 promoters are needed for MTPi to increase ALT1/AST1. Furthermore, it appears that a constant proportion of cellular ALT/AST is present in the media. Next, we studied protein synthesis. Continuous pulse labeling demonstrated increased amounts of ALT1/AST1 in MTPi-treated cell lysates and media compared with control cells (Fig. 5, A–G). At 4 h, MTPi-treated cells and media contained ∼2–4-fold higher amounts of ALT1/AST1. Conversely, MTPi had no effect on cellular and media albumin (Fig. 5, A, F, and G). These data suggest that MTPi increases synthesis and release of ALT1/AST1. To investigate the contribution of post-translational processing to media AST/ALT, we performed pulse-chase studies (Fig. 4, H–P). As expected from Fig. 5A, at the end of the pulse there were higher amounts of ALT1/AST1 proteins in MTPi-treated cells (Fig. 5H, 0 h). After normalizing the amounts at time 0 to 100%, we observed that their rates of intracellular disappearance and appearance in the media (Fig. 5, H and I–L) were similar in control and MTPi-treated cells. Approximately, ∼3–4% of the labeled proteins were secreted to media (Fig. 5, H, J, and L). MTPi significantly inhibited apoB synthesis/secretion with no effect on albumin (Fig. 5, H and M–P). These studies indicate that MTPi does not affect post-translational processing of ALT/AST. The data presented thus far indicates that MTPi induces ER stress and ALT1/AST1 transcription leading to increased protein synthesis and release from cells. To identify the transducer(s) responsible for increases in media AST/ALT, we introduced different siRNAs targeting IRE1α, PERK, or ATF6 into Huh-7 cells and treated them with or without MTPi (Fig. 6A). Individual siRNAs reduced the respective ER stress transducers with no effects on others suggesting specific gene knockdown. For example, siIRE1α reduced its mRNA levels without affecting PERK, ATF-6, GPT, and GOT1. MTPi increased GPT/GOT1 mRNA in siControl, siPERK,"

The cleaving activities of culture supernatants from several GAS isolates were correlated with the amount of active SpeB, whereas culture supernatants from an speB mutant showed no such activities.

Serious postinfectious immune sequelae such as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis occasionally develop following repeated GAS exposure. Despite the availability of sequence information for several GAS genomes and detailed characterization of their virulence factors, a safe and effective commercial GAS vaccine has yet to be developed (3Cole J.N.

The pharynx and skin are thought to be the primary sites of GAS infection. Pharyngeal epithelia and keratinocytes are highly specialized physical barriers apposed tightly by tight junctions (TJs) and adherence junctions (AJs), which protect underlying sterile tissues from the external environment. Loss of cell-cell adhesion caused by bacteria has been reported to be associated with several clinical manifestations. Desmoglein 1, which plays a key role in maintaining the structure and barrier function of the epidermis, is targeted by exfoliative toxins released by Staphylococcus aureus in infectious skin diseases such as bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (4Amagai M. Desmoglein as a target in autoimmunity and infection.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2003; 48: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Development of GAS skin infections with bullous lesions also seems to be related to loss of cell-cell adhesion and inoculation of GAS into intradermal space (5Ferrieri P. Dajani A.S. Wannamaker L.W.

Invest. 1972; 51: 2851-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Invasive GAS disease requires successful colonization in the pharynx or skin, followed by overcoming the host epithelial barrier together with evasion of host defense mechanisms. Multiple in vitro studies have demonstrated that GAS isolates associated with invasive diseases efficiently invade epithelial cells (6Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I.

Although programmed cell death is an essential part of host defense against pathogens, it is considered that internalized GAS exploits this process to access the underlying sterile tissues (8Nakagawa I.

Meanwhile, some studies that investigated the direct interactions of bacteria with epithelial junctions also elucidated the underlying mechanisms of GAS pathogenesis, with interaction of the hyaluronic acid capsule with CD44 implicated in this process (10Cywes C. Wessels M.R. Group A Streptococcus tissue invasion by CD44-mediated cell signaling.Nature. 2001; 414: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent study identified streptolysin S (SLS) as a novel factor that facilitates GAS translocation via degradation of intercellular junctions in concert with the host cysteine protease calpain (11Sumitomo T. Nakata M. Higashino M. Jin Y. Terao Y. Fujinaga Y. Kawabata S. Streptolysin S contributes to group A streptococcal translocation across an epithelial barrier.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2750-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which GAS disrupts the epithelial barrier has yet to be completely elucidated. During infection, GAS produces numerous secreted and cell-associated proteins, including toxins, superantigens, and proteases (12Cunningham M.W. Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 13Olsen R.J. Shelburne S.A. Musser J.M. Molecular mechanisms underlying group A streptococcal pathogenesis.Cell. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although extracellular proteins from GAS have been extensively investigated and shown to be important for pathogenesis, its participation in epithelial barrier dysfunction is as yet unproven. Herein, we provide the first direct evidence that SpeB (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B), a broad spectrum secreted cysteine protease, effectively cleaves transmembrane proteins associated with the epithelial barrier to permit bacterial penetration. Our results reveal a new mechanism to explain how GAS directly disrupts the epithelial barrier. Invasive GAS clinical isolates, strains NIH35 (serotype M28), SSI-1 (serotype 3), SSI-9 (serotype M1), and #30 (serotype M12), were isolated from patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

All protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For infection assays, epithelial cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well (35-mm diameter; Corning), cultured for 3 days, and then infected with GAS strains at an MOI of 10. At the end of the infection period, the infected cells were lysed with Laemmli gel loading buffer containing 6% 2-mercaptoethanol. Cleavage of intercellular junctions was detected by Western blot analysis (11Sumitomo T. Nakata M. Higashino M. Jin Y. Terao Y. Fujinaga Y. Kawabata S. Streptolysin S contributes to group A streptococcal translocation across an epithelial barrier.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2750-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Western blot signals were quantified using Scion Image 4.0.3.2 software (Scion). For identification of the cleavage site in E-cadherin, E-cadherin was incubated with DTT-activated recombinant SpeB (200 nm) for 6 h at 37 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using the Edman degradation method with an ABI protein sequencer model 491HT (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative assays of SpeB activity, casein hydrolysis was analyzed using FITC-labeled casein (18Hauser A.R. Schlievert P.M. Nucleotide sequence of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type B gene and relationship between the toxin and the streptococcal proteinase precursor.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4536-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Filter-sterilized supernatants from overnight GAS cultures or recombinant SpeB were activated in assay buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 0.01 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 mm DTT and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The activated supernatants were added to an equal volume of FITC-labeled casein (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared with or without 10 μm E-64. At 6 h after incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 5% trichloroacetic acid, and then the mixtures were stored overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (15,000 × g for 5 min), the resultant supernatants were diluted with 0.5 m Tris buffer (pH 8.5), and fluorescence intensity was measured using a Wallac 1420 ARVOsx fluorometer (excitation wavelength, 485 nm; emission wavelength, 535 nm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. A confidence interval with a p value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Culture supernatants from several serotypes of GAS strains recovered from invasive (strains SSI-9, SSI-1, #30, and NIH35) and noninvasive (strains SF370, TW3358, TW3337, TW3339, NZ131, and 591) diseases were incubated with the extracellular domain of human E-cadherin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, after which cleavage was analyzed using Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Utilizing an antibody against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, the intact protein was detected as an ∼120-kDa band under a reducing condition. Loss of the 120-kDa band and appearance of cleavage products with apparent molecular masses of 60–100 kDa were detected in culture supernatant samples obtained from SF370, SSI-1, TW3358, #30, TW3337, NIH35, TW3339, and 591. Interestingly, cleavage was completely abrogated by pretreatment with a protease inhibitor mixture (data not shown). On the other hand, neither the culture supernatant from strain SSI-9 nor that from strain NZ131 was capable of cleaving the E-cadherin fragment. These results indicate that the culture supernatants from strains SF370, SSI-1, TW3358, #30, TW3337, NIH35, TW3339 and 591 include proteases that cleave the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. We also noted that the ability of GAS culture supernatants to cleave E-cadherin was not related to disease severity, i.e., strains from invasive as compared with those from noninvasive diseases. To search for bacterial proteases that contribute to the cleavage of E-cadherin, the culture supernatant of strain NIH35, a prominent degrader, was pretreated with several types of protease inhibitors before co-incubation with recombinant E-cadherin protein (Fig. 2). The cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, E-64, and chymostatin completely inhibited cleavage of E-cadherin, whereas protease activity partially remained in the leupeptin-treated GAS supernatant. In contrast, protease inhibitors that target serine protease, aspartate protease, and metalloprotease had no detectable effect on E-cadherin cleavage, whereas EDTA did have an acceleratory effect. This result may reflect a chelating effect of EDTA on stabilization of the E-cadherin structure, because E-cadherin forms a homodimer in the extracellular domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In experiments with strain SSI-1, even though the degradation pattern of E-cadherin was slightly different from that observed with other strains (Fig. 1), the appearance of cleavage products was completely inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors (data not shown). It has been reported that GAS secretes two major cysteine proteases, SpeB and immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of S. pyogenes (IdeS or Mac-1). E-64, a cysteine protease, specifically inhibits the proteolytic activity of SpeB, but not that of IdeS (19von Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Björck L. IdeS, a novel streptococcal cysteine proteinase with unique specificity for immunoglobulin G.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the present study, supernatant-induced cleavage of E-cadherin was completely inhibited by E-64 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that SpeB is a proteolytic factor for cleavage of E-cadherin. Moreover, restoration of the full-length band was observed in a leupeptin concentration-dependent manner, whereas the cleavage product did not disappear even in the presence of leupeptin at 500 μm (supplemental Fig. S1). Leupeptin is an arginine-dependent protease inhibitor. Because Cys at position 192, His at position 340, and Trp at position 357 play critical roles in the enzymatic activity of SpeB (20Carroll R.K. Musser J.M. From transcription to activation. How group A streptococcus, the flesh-eating pathogen, regulates SpeB cysteine protease production.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 81: 588-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), leupeptin might be less effective for inhibition of SpeB activity as compared with those other cysteine proteases. Consequently, we investigated whether SpeB is involved in cleavage of E-cadherin. To examine whether SpeB is responsible for GAS supernatant-induced cleavage of intercellular junctions, an in-frame speB deletion mutant and its complemented strain were constructed. Equivalent growth rates of wild type and mutant strains were observed in conventional liquid medium (data not shown). GAS culture supernatant-induced cleavage of E-cadherin was nearly abolished by mutagenesis of the speB gene, whereas it was completely restored by the complementation (Fig. 3A). A similar phenomenon was observed with strains #30, TW3337, and TW3339 (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that SpeB-dependent protease activity toward E-cadherin is conserved among clinical isolates with no relation to disease severity. These observations prompted us to compare the SpeB-specific protease activities in the culture supernatants of the previously examined GAS strains (Fig. 3B). High caseinolytic activities were detected in culture supernatants from strains #30, TW3337, NIH35, TW3339, and 591, which are findings consistent with its ability to cleave recombinant E-cadherin (Fig. 1). In contrast, lower levels of SpeB activity were observed in supernatants from strains SSI-9, SF370, SSI-1, TW3358, and NZ131. Together, these results indicate that SpeB-associated cysteine protease activity is correlated with the cleavage of intercellular junctions. SpeB is secreted as a 42-kDa zymogen and autocatalyzed into an active 28-kDa cysteine protease (18Hauser A.R. Schlievert P.M.

In addition to its ability to cleave host proteins, SpeB exerts proteolytic activity toward streptococcal surface proteins (25Berge A. Björck L.

Numerous investigations have reported that this proteolytic activity contributes to bacterial evasion from the host defense system and systemic dissemination (reviewed in Refs. 28Chiang-Ni C. Wu J.J.

Chem. 2011; 392: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that SpeB directly cleaves intercellular junctional proteins, and GAS translocates through the opening of paracellular junctions. To examine whether SpeB directly cleaves transmembrane junctions, recombinant E-cadherin was treated with various concentrations of recombinant SpeB (Fig. 3C). An SpeB-dependent loss of the full-length band and appearance of several cleaved products, which reacted with an antibody against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, were detected. Thus, five N-terminal residues in the cleavage products of E-cadherin in the presence of 200 nm SpeB were determined by peptide sequence analysis, which identified the N-terminal sequence of fragments with molecular masses of ∼80 and 65 kDa as DWVIP, which is identical to the N terminus of the EC1 domain, i.e., the N terminus of the recombinant protein. SpeB has been reported to cleave IgG in the hinge region (23Collin M. Olsén A. Effect of SpeB and EndoS from Streptococcus pyogenes on human immunoglobulins.Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7187-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because recombinant E-cadherin is the extracellular domain fused to the IgG Fc region at the C terminus, it is likely that an 80-kDa band represents a fragment with intact extracellular E-cadherin and a truncated Fc fragment. Deduced from this size, the 65-kDa band represents a fragment cleaved within the EC domains, possibly between EC4 and EC5. Meanwhile, the sequence of cleavage fragments with molecular masses of ∼55 and 35 kDa revealed VTDTN, which corresponds to the neighboring sequence of the calcium-binding site between the EC2 and EC3 domains. Speculating from these sizes, the C terminus of the 55- and 35-kDa fragments would be within the Fc region and within the region between EC4 and EC5, respectively. Because each EC domain of E-cadherin contains DXD or DXNDN motifs responsible for mediating calcium-dependent adhesion, SpeB may cleave the regions neighboring these motifs between each EC domain. Furthermore, SpeB-mediated cleavage of occludin, the most prominent member of TJ, was examined using an antibody against the C terminus of occludin (Fig. 3D). Cleavage of the full-length form of occludin, which was recognized as an 85-kDa band, and distinct cleavage products were detected in an SpeB concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that SpeB directly cleaves occludin at several sites. To investigate destabilization of the intercellular junctions in GAS-infected epithelial Caco-2 cells, a typical epithelial in vitro model, cells were infected with GAS strains, and the cleavage of junctional proteins was detected using Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Marked cleavage of E-cadherin and occludin was detected in Caco-2 cells infected with the wild type strain, whereas that was significantly repressed by mutagenesis of the speB gene and restored by complementation. Similar results were observed in keratinocyte HaCaT and pharyngeal epithelial Detroit 562 cells, which are human cell lines derived from primary anatomical sites of GAS infection. On the other hand, the cleavage of JAM-1, a member of the group of TJ proteins, was not detected in cells infected with any of the strains. These findings indicate that SpeB"
https://openalex.org/W1973067185,"We report a highly conserved motif in the E-cadherin juxtamembrane domain that determines apical-lateral polarity by conferring both restricted mobility at the lateral membrane and transcytosis of apically mis-sorted protein to the lateral membrane. Mutations causing either increased lateral membrane mobility or loss of apical-lateral transcytosis result in partial mis-sorting of E-cadherin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. However, loss of both activities results in complete loss of polarity. We present evidence that residues required for restricted mobility mediate retention at the lateral membrane through interaction with ankyrin-G, whereas dileucine residues conferring apical-lateral transcytosis act through a clathrin-dependent process and function in an editing pathway. Ankyrin-G interaction with E-cadherin is abolished by the same mutations resulting in increased E-cadherin mobility. Clathrin heavy chain knockdown and dileucine mutation of E-cadherin both cause the same partial loss of polarity of E-cadherin. Moreover, clathrin knockdown causes no further change in polarity of E-cadherin with dileucine mutation but does completely randomize E-cadherin mutants lacking ankyrin-binding. Dileucine mutation, but not loss of ankyrin binding, prevented transcytosis of apically mis-sorted E-cadherin to the lateral membrane. Finally, neurofascin, which binds ankyrin but lacks dileucine residues, exhibited partial apical-lateral polarity that was abolished by mutation of its ankyrin-binding site but was not affected by clathrin knockdown. The polarity motif thus integrates complementary activities of lateral membrane retention through ankyrin-G and apical-lateral transcytosis of mis-localized protein through clathrin.

Epithelial cells provide the interface between our bodies and the external environment and are critical for ion homeostasis, prevention of microbial invasion, and absorption and excretion of molecules and water. Most epithelial cells are organized in polarized monolayers with apical surfaces directed toward a lumen, lateral membrane domains engaged in cell-cell contact, and basal surfaces associated with extracellular matrix components. Monolayer organization is disrupted during physiological events including wound healing as well as in pathological conditions such as malignant transformation. Given the central role of epithelial tissues in human physiology and disease, it is not surprising that epithelial cell polarity has been the focus of vigorous research over the last three decades (1Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Coordinated protein sorting, targeting and distribution in polarized cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). An important clue to the molecular basis for epithelial cell polarity came with discovery of basolateral targeting motifs in cytoplasmic domains of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptors and LDL receptors (2Casanova J.E.

Targeting motifs have subsequently been identified in cytoplasmic domains of many membrane proteins (5Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Basolateral targeting signals have been proposed to function through interaction with clathrin adaptors based on similarities with endocytosis signals (3Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

Many of the studies on the role of clathrin and its adaptors have utilized proteins such as the LDL receptor and transferrin receptor that experience endocytosis as an essential aspect of their biological function (8Deborde S. Perret E. Gravotta D. Deora A. Salvarezza S. Schreiner R. Rodriguez-Boulan E.

The VSV-G viral coat protein also has frequently been used as a model to study polarity (12Rodriguez Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. Asymmetric budding of viruses in epithelial monolayers. A model system for study of epithelial polarity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 5071-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the clathrin system contributes to polarity of native proteins that primarily reside in the lateral membrane. For example, nearly complete loss of clathrin results in either partial mislocalization of E-cadherin or no detectable effect on the Na/K-ATPase in MDCK cells (8Deborde S. Perret E. Gravotta D. Deora A. Salvarezza S. Schreiner R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Clathrin is a key regulator of basolateral polarity.Nature. 2008; 452: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, E-cadherin and Na/K-ATPase both sort to the lateral membranes of LLC-PK cells lacking AP1B, suggesting the existence of an AP1B-independent mechanism (13Duffield A. Fölsch H. Mellman I.

However, the lack of effect on Na/K-ATPase and modest effect on E-cadherin localization demonstrated in clathrin heavy chain knockdown cells (8Deborde S. Perret E. Gravotta D. Deora A. Salvarezza S.

Clathrin is a key regulator of basolateral polarity.Nature. 2008; 452: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggests a role for clathrin-independent mechanisms of lateral membrane localization. Furthermore, in addition, knock-out of either the μ1B subunit or Rab8, which regulates AP1B-dependent basolateral transport, does not affect epithelial morphology in mouse tissues (15Sato T.

Finally, the Na/K-ATPase segregates into distinct post-Golgi transport intermediates from the AP1B-dependent viral VSV-G protein and does not appear in the recycling compartment (17Farr G.A. Hull M.

E-cadherin contains an atypical dileucine motif in a juxtamembrane sequence that mediates clathrin-dependent endocytosis (14Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S.

The absence of lateral membrane in ankyrin-G- and β2 spectrin-depleted cells complicates interpretation of functions of these proteins in the cellular localization of E-cadherin. We have critically addressed the roles of ankyrin-G and clathrin heavy chain in localization of E-cadherin to the lateral membrane of epithelial cells and observed that E-cadherin retains at least partial polarity after depletion of either ankyrin-G or clathrin heavy chain alone. We find that optimal E-cadherin apical-basal polarity requires both ankyrin-G- and clathrin-based pathways and that these interactions are coordinated by the same highly conserved juxtamembrane motif in the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain.

A conditional knock-out mouse was made to delete the Ank3 gene in a tissue-specific manner using the Cre/Lox system. Exons 22 and 23, which are just upstream of the spectrin binding domain, were flanked by LoxP sites. A neomycin resistance cassette, driven by the phosphoglycerate promoter (PGK-neo) and flanked by FRT sites, was inserted between Exon 23 and the 3′ LoxP site. The linearized construct was introduced into 129X1/SvJ ES cells by electroporation, and G418-resistant clones were screened using Southern blot analysis. ES cells bearing the modified Ank3 gene were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. High percentage chimeric animals were obtained and bred to C57BL/6 mice to produce heterozygous animals.

Final paraffin embedding was completed the following day. Paraffin sections were cut at 7 μm using a Leica RM2155 microtome. To ensure identical sample location between mice, kidney sections were taken sagitally at the kidney midline, and trachea sections were taken immediately before the trachea bifurcation into two bronchi.

Sections were then processed for antigen retrieval using 10 mm sodium citrate in the microwave for 20 min. Sections were allowed to cool, washed in PBS, and blocked using the Vector MOM kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (3% fish oil, 10% horse serum, 0.1% Tween in PBS). After extensive PBS washing, slides were incubated in blocking buffer with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen).

https://openalex.org/W1985366273,"Recent studies indicate that relatively few genomic regions are repeatedly involved in the evolution of Heliconius butterfly wing patterns. Although this work demonstrates a number of cases where homologous loci underlie both convergent and divergent wing pattern change among different Heliconius species, it is still unclear exactly how many loci underlie pattern variation across the genus. To address this question for Heliconius erato, we created fifteen independent crosses utilizing the four most distinct color pattern races and analyzed color pattern segregation across a total of 1271 F2 and backcross offspring. Additionally, we used the most variable brood, an F2 cross between H. himera and the east Ecuadorian H. erato notabilis, to perform a quantitative genetic analysis of color pattern variation and produce a detailed map of the loci likely involved in the H. erato color pattern radiation. Using AFLP and gene based markers, we show that fewer major genes than previously envisioned control the color pattern variation in H. erato. We describe for the first time the genetic architecture of H. erato wing color pattern by assessing quantitative variation in addition to traditional linkage mapping. In particular, our data suggest three genomic intervals modulate the bulk of the observed variation in color. Furthermore, we also identify several modifier loci of moderate effect size that contribute to the quantitative wing pattern variation. Our results are consistent with the two-step model for the evolution of mimetic wing patterns in Heliconius and support a growing body of empirical data demonstrating the importance of major effect loci in adaptive change."
https://openalex.org/W2010387534,"Fn14 is a therapeutic target in various diseases.Anti-Fn14 antibodies activate the alternative NFκB pathway but not other Fn14-related activities induced by soluble or membrane-bound TWEAK. FcγR-bound anti-Fn14 antibodies, however, activate the full spectrum of Fn14-associated activities.Anti-Fn14 antibodies elicit agonistic activities differing from those of the natural Fn14 ligand TWEAK.These findings influence the rationale of designing Fn14-targeted therapies. The Fn14-specific monoclonal antibodies PDL192 and P4A8, which are under consideration in clinical trials, showed no agonistic activity with respect to IL8 production and cell death induction. However, oligomerization with protein G or binding to Fcγ receptors converted both anti-Fn14 antibodies into potent agonists. TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), the ligand of Fn14, occurs naturally in two forms with partly different signaling capabilities, as a membrane-bound ligand and as a soluble trimeric molecule. Although membrane TWEAK strongly triggers all Fn14-associated pathways, soluble TWEAK predominately triggers the alternative nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway and enhances TNF-induced cell death but has only a poor effect on the classical NFκB pathway and chemokine production. Thus, the oligomerized and FcγR-bound anti-Fn14 mAbs mimicked the activity of membrane TWEAK. Notably, both anti-Fn14 antibodies significantly triggered p100 processing, the hallmark of the alternative NFκB pathway, and therefore resembled soluble TWEAK. In contrast to the latter, however, the anti-Fn14s showed no effect on TNF receptor 1-induced cell death and P4A8 even blocked the corresponding TWEAK response. Thus, we showed that Fn14 antibodies display an alternative NFκB pathway-specific agonistic activity but fail to phenocopy other activities of soluble TWEAK, whereas oligomerized or FcγR-bound Fn14 antibodies fully mimic the activity of membrane TWEAK. In view of the trivalent nature of the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction, this suggests that the alternative NFκB pathway is uniquely responsive already to Fn14 dimerization enabling antibodies to elicit an unnatural response pattern distinct from that of the naturally occurring Fn14 ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2023527025,"FliY is a flagellar rotor protein of the CheC phosphatase family.The FliY structure resembles that of the rotor protein FliM but contains two active centers for CheY dephosphorylation.FliY incorporates properties of the FliM/FliN rotor proteins and the CheC/CheX phosphatases to serve multiple functions in the flagellar switch.FliY distinguishes flagellar architecture and function in different types of bacteria. Rotating flagella propel bacteria toward favorable environments. Sense of rotation is determined by the intracellular response regulator CheY, which when phosphorylated (CheY-P) interacts directly with the flagellar motor. In many different types of bacteria, the CheC/CheX/FliY (CXY) family of phosphatases terminates the CheY-P signal. Unlike CheC and CheX, FliY is localized in the flagellar switch complex, which also contains the stator-coupling protein FliG and the target of CheY-P, FliM. The 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the FliY catalytic domain from Thermotoga maritima bears strong resemblance to the middle domain of FliM. Regions of FliM that mediate contacts within the rotor compose the phosphatase active sites in FliY. Despite the similarity between FliY and FliM, FliY does not bind FliG and thus is unlikely to be a substitute for FliM in the center of the switch complex. Solution studies indicate that FliY dimerizes through its C-terminal domains, which resemble the Escherichia coli switch complex component FliN. FliY differs topologically from the E. coli chemotaxis phosphatase CheZ but appears to utilize similar structural motifs for CheY dephosphorylation in close analogy to CheX. Recognition properties and phosphatase activities of site-directed mutants identify two pseudosymmetric active sites in FliY (Glu(35)/Asn(38) and Glu(132)/Asn(135)), with the second site (Glu(132)/Asn(135)) being more active. A putative N-terminal CheY binding domain conserved with FliM is not required for binding CheY-P or phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2015385871,"Background This study aimed to determine the prevalence of genetic and environmental vascular risk factors in non diabetic patients with premature peripheral arterial disease, either peripheral arterial occlusive disease or thromboangiitis obliterans, the two main entities of peripheral arterial disease, and to established whether some of them are specifically associated with one or another of the premature peripheral arterial disease subgroups. Methods and Results This study included 113 non diabetic patients with premature peripheral arterial disease (diagnosis <45-year old) presenting either a peripheral arterial occlusive disease (N = 64) or a thromboangiitis obliterans (N = 49), and 241 controls matched for age and gender. Both patient groups demonstrated common traits including cigarette smoking, low physical activity, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A–I, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (active form of B6 vitamin) and zinc. Premature peripheral arterial occlusive disease was characterized by the presence of a family history of peripheral arterial and carotid artery diseases (OR 2.3 and 5.8 respectively, 95% CI), high lipoprotein (a) levels above 300 mg/L (OR 2.3, 95% CI), the presence of the factor V Leiden (OR 5.1, 95% CI) and the glycoprotein Ia807T,837T,873A allele (OR 2.3, 95% CI). In thromboangiitis obliterans group, more patients were regular consumers of cannabis (OR 3.5, 95% CI) and higher levels in plasma copper has been shown (OR 6.5, 95% CI). Conclusions According to our results from a non exhaustive list of study parameters, we might hypothesize for 1) a genetic basis for premature peripheral arterial occlusive disease development and 2) the prevalence of environmental factors in the development of thromboangiitis obliterans (tobacco and cannabis). Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that the 807T/837T/873A allele of platelet glycoprotein Ia may confer an additional risk for development of peripheral atherosclerosis in premature peripheral arterial occlusive disease."

Foliar spray with AsES provided a total systemic protection against anthracnose disease in strawberry, accompanied by the expression of defense-related genes (i.e. PR1 and Chi2-1). Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2O2 and O2(˙)) and callose was also observed in Arabidopsis. By using degenerate primers designed from the partial amino acid sequences and rapid amplification reactions of cDNA ends, the complete AsES-coding cDNA of 1167 nucleotides was obtained. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant identity with fungal serine proteinases of the subtilisin family, indicating that AsES is synthesized as a larger precursor containing a 15-residue secretory signal peptide and a 90-residue peptidase inhibitor I9 domain in addition to the 283-residue mature protein. AsES exhibited proteolytic activity in vitro, and its resistance eliciting activity was eliminated when inhibited with PMSF, suggesting that its proteolytic activity is required to induce the defense response. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a fungal subtilisin that shows eliciting activity in plants. This finding could contribute to develop disease biocontrol strategies in plants by activating its innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2045620441,"Chordomas are rare mesenchymal tumors occurring exclusively in the midline from clivus to sacrum. Early tumor detection is extremely important as these tumors are resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation. Despite continuous research efforts surgical excision remains the main treatment option. Because of the often challenging anatomic location early detection is important to enable complete tumor resection and to reduce the high incidence of local recurrences. The aim of this study was to explore whether DNA methylation, a well known epigenetic marker, may play a role in chordoma development and if hypermethylation of specific CpG islands may serve as potential biomarkers correlated with SNP analyses in chordoma. The study was performed on tumor samples from ten chordoma patients. We found significant genomic instability by Affymetrix 6.0. It was interesting to see that all chordomas showed a loss of 3q26.32 (PIK 3CA) and 3q27.3 (BCL6) thus underlining the potential importance of the PI3K pathway in chordoma development. By using the AITCpG360 methylation assay we elucidated 20 genes which were hyper/hypomethylated compared to normal blood. The most promising candidates were nine hyper/hypomethylated genes C3, XIST, TACSTD2, FMR1, HIC1, RARB, DLEC1, KL, and RASSF1. In summary, we have shown that chordomas are characterized by a significant genomic instability and furthermore we demonstrated a characteristic DNA methylation pattern. These findings add new insights into chordoma development, diagnosis and potential new treatment options."

It is assumed that free stream is moving. The governing boundary layer equations are non-dimensionalized and transformed into a system of nonlinear, coupled similarity equations. The effects of the controlling parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature, solute and nanofluid concentration as well as on the reduced Nusselt number, reduced Sherwood number and the reduced nanoparticle Sherwood number are investigated and presented graphically. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of hydrodynamic and thermal slip boundary conditions have not been investigated yet. It is found that the reduced local Nusselt, local solute and the local nanofluid Sherwood numbers increase with hydrodynamic slip and decrease with thermal slip parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2055601598,"Serine protease inhibitors act as modulators of serine proteases, playing important roles in protecting animal toxin peptides from degradation. However, all known serine protease inhibitors discovered thus far from animal venom belong to the Kunitz-type subfamily, and whether there are other novel types of protease inhibitors in animal venom remains unclear.Here, by screening scorpion venom gland cDNA libraries, we identified the first Ascaris-type animal toxin family, which contains four members: Scorpiops jendeki Ascaris-type protease inhibitor (SjAPI), Scorpiops jendeki Ascaris-type protease inhibitor 2 (SjAPI-2), Chaerilus tricostatus Ascaris-type protease inhibitor (CtAPI), and Buthus martensii Ascaris-type protease inhibitor (BmAPI). The detailed characterization of Ascaris-type peptide SjAPI from the venom gland of scorpion Scorpiops jendeki was carried out. The mature peptide of SjAPI contains 64 residues and possesses a classical Ascaris-type cysteine framework reticulated by five disulfide bridges, different from all known protease inhibitors from venomous animals. Enzyme and inhibitor reaction kinetics experiments showed that recombinant SjAPI was a dual function peptide with α-chymotrypsin- and elastase-inhibiting properties. Recombinant SjAPI inhibited α-chymotrypsin with a Ki of 97.1 nM and elastase with a Ki of 3.7 μM, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses and chimera experiments indicated that SjAPI contained the unique short side chain functional residues ""AAV"" and might be a useful template to produce new serine protease inhibitors.To our knowledge, SjAPI is the first functionally characterized animal toxin peptide with an Ascaris-type fold. The structural and functional diversity of animal toxins with protease-inhibiting properties suggested that bioactive peptides from animal venom glands might be a new source of protease inhibitors, which will accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents for human diseases that target diverse proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2074210790,"Influenza-induced lung edema and inflammation are exacerbated by a positive feedback loop of cytokine and chemokine production termed a 'cytokine storm', a hallmark of increased influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Upon infection, an immune response is rapidly initiated in the lungs and draining lymph node, leading to expansion of virus-specific effector cells. Using two-photon microscopy, we imaged the dynamics of dendritic cells (DC) and virus-specific eGFP(+)CD8(+) T cells in the lungs and draining mediastinal lymph nodes during the first two weeks following influenza infection. Three distinct phases of T cell and CD11c(+) DC behavior were revealed: 1) Priming, facilitated by the arrival of lung DCs in the lymph node and characterized by antigen recognition and expansion of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells; asymmetric T cell division in contact with DCs was frequently observed. 2) Clearance, during which DCs re-populate the lung and T cells leave the draining lymph node and re-enter the lung tissue where enlarged, motile T cells come into contact with DCs and form long-lived interactions. 3) Maintenance, characterized by T-cell scanning of the lung tissue and dissociation from local antigen presenting cells; the T cells spend less time in association with DCs and migrate rapidly on collagen. A single dose of a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist, AAL-R, sufficient to suppress influenza-induced cytokine-storm, altered T cell and DC behavior during influenza clearance, delaying T cell division, cellular infiltration in the lung, and suppressing T-DC interactions in the lung. Our results provide a detailed description of T cell and DC choreography and dynamics in the lymph node and the lung during influenza infection. In addition, we suggest that phase lags in T cell and DC dynamics induced by targeting S1P receptors in vivo may attenuate the intensity of the immune response and can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2148543906,"Missense mutations in AHI1 result in the neurodevelopmental ciliopathy called Joubert syndrome.Mutations in AHI1 decrease cilia formation, alter its localization and stability, and change its binding to HAP1 and NPHP1.Mutations in AHI1 affect ciliogenesis, AHI1 protein localization, and AHI1-protein interactions.This study begins to describe how missense mutations in AHI1 can cause Joubert syndrome. Mutations in AHI1 cause Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental ciliopathy, characterized by midbrain-hindbrain malformations and motor/cognitive deficits. Here, we show that primary cilia (PC) formation is decreased in fibroblasts from individuals with JBTS and AHI1 mutations. Most missense mutations in AHI1, causing JBTS, occur in known protein domains, however, a common V443D mutation in AHI1 is found in a region with no known protein motifs. We show that cells transfected with AHI1-V443D, or a new JBTS-causing mutation, AHI1-R351L, have aberrant localization of AHI1 at the basal bodies of PC and at cell-cell junctions, likely through decreased binding of mutant AHI1 to NPHP1 (another JBTS-causing protein). The AHI1-V443D mutation causes decreased AHI1 stability because there is a 50% reduction in AHI1-V443D protein levels compared with wild type AHI1. Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (Hap1) is a regulatory protein that binds Ahi1, and Hap1 knock-out mice have been reported to have JBTS-like phenotypes, suggesting a role for Hap1 in ciliogenesis. Fibroblasts and neurons with Hap1 deficiency form PC with normal growth factor-induced ciliary signaling, indicating that the Hap1 JBTS phenotype is likely not through effects at PC. These results also suggest that the binding of Ahi1 and Hap1 may not be critical for ciliary function. However, we show that HAP1 has decreased binding to AHI1-V443D indicating that this altered binding could be responsible for the JBTS-like phenotype through an unknown pathway. Thus, these JBTS-associated missense mutations alter their subcellular distribution and protein interactions, compromising functions of AHI1 in cell polarity and cilium-mediated signaling, thereby contributing to JBTS."
https://openalex.org/W2019702808,"The origin of eukaryotic histone modification enzymes still remains obscure.Prototypic KMT4/Dot1 from Archaea targets chromatin proteins (Sul7d and Cren7) and shows increased activity on Sul7d, but not Cren7, in the presence of DNA.Promiscuous aKMT4 could be regulated by chromatin environment.This study supports the prokaryotic origin model of eukaryotic histone methyltransferases and sheds light on chromatin dynamics in Archaea. Histone methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications even in early diverging unicellular eukaryotes. We show that a widespread lysine methyltransferase from Archaea (aKMT4), bears striking structural and functional resemblance to the core of distantly related eukaryotic KMT4/Dot1. aKMT4 methylates a set of various proteins, including the chromatin proteins Sul7d and Cren7, and RNA exosome components. Csl4- and Rrp4-exosome complexes are methylated in different patterns. aKMT4 can self-methylate intramolecularly and compete with other proteins for the methyl group. Automethylation is inhibited by suitable substrates or DNA in a concentration-dependent manner. The automethylated enzyme shows relatively compromised activity. aKMT4-8A mutant with abrogated automethylation shows a more than 150% increase in methylation of substrates, suggesting a possible mechanism to regulate methyltransferase activity. More interestingly, methylation of Sul7d, but not Cren7, by aKMT4 is significantly enhanced by DNA. MS/MS and kinetic analysis further suggest that aKMT4 methylates Sul7d in the chromatin context. These data provide a clue to the possible regulation of aKMT4 activity by the local chromatin environment, albeit as a promiscuous enzyme required for extensive and variegated lysine methylation in Sulfolobus. This study supports the prokaryotic origin model of eukaryotic histone modification enzymes and sheds light on regulation of archaeal chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2023399433,"Phospholemman regulates the plasmalemmal sodium pump in excitable tissues.In cardiac muscle, a subpopulation of phospholemman with a unique phosphorylation signature associates with other phospholemman molecules but not with the pump.Phospholemman oligomers exist in cardiac muscle.Much like phospholamban regulation of SERCA, phospholemman exists as both a sodium pump inhibiting monomer and an unassociated oligomer. Phospholemman (PLM), the principal quantitative sarcolemmal substrate for protein kinases A and C in the heart, regulates the cardiac sodium pump. Much like phospholamban, which regulates the related ATPase SERCA, PLM is reported to oligomerize. We investigated subpopulations of PLM in adult rat ventricular myocytes based on phosphorylation status. Co-immunoprecipitation identified two pools of PLM: one not associated with the sodium pump phosphorylated at Ser(63) and one associated with the pump, both phosphorylated at Ser(68) and unphosphorylated. Phosphorylation of PLM at Ser(63) following activation of PKC did not abrogate association of PLM with the pump, so its failure to associate with the pump was not due to phosphorylation at this site. All pools of PLM co-localized to cell surface caveolin-enriched microdomains with sodium pump α subunits, despite the lack of caveolin-binding motif in PLM. Mass spectrometry analysis of phosphospecific immunoprecipitation reactions revealed no unique protein interactions for Ser(63)-phosphorylated PLM, and cross-linking reagents also failed to identify any partner proteins for this pool. In lysates from hearts of heterozygous transgenic animals expressing wild type and unphosphorylatable PLM, Ser(63)-phosphorylated PLM co-immunoprecipitated unphosphorylatable PLM, confirming the existence of PLM multimers. Dephosphorylation of the PLM multimer does not change sodium pump activity. Hence like phospholamban, PLM exists as a pump-inhibiting monomer and an unassociated oligomer. The distribution of different PLM phosphorylation states to different pools may be explained by their differential proximity to protein phosphatases rather than a direct effect of phosphorylation on PLM association with the pump."
https://openalex.org/W2081206136,"The vascular protective effect of grape-derived polyphenols has been attributable, in part, to their direct action on blood vessels by stimulating the endothelial formation of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine whether Concord grape juice (CGJ), which contains high levels of polyphenols, stimulates the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in porcine coronary artery endothelial cells and, if so, to determine the signaling pathway involved. CGJ dose- and time-dependently increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels and this effect is associated with an increased formation of NO in endothelial cells. The stimulatory effect of CGJ on eNOS mRNA is not associated with an increased eNOS mRNA stability and inhibited by antioxidants such as MnTMPyP, PEG-catalase, and catalase, and by wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3-kinase), SB 203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK), and SP 600125 (an inhibitor of JNK). Moreover, CGJ induced the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial cells and this effect is inhibited by MnTMPyP, PEG-catalase, and catalase. The CGJ-induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK kinases is abolished by MnTMPyP. CGJ induced phosphorylation of transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a, which regulate negatively eNOS expression, and this effect is prevented by MnTMPyP, PEG-catalase, wortmannin, SB203580 and SP600125. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the FoxO3a protein is associated with the eNOS promoter in control cells and that CGJ induced its dissociation. Thus, the present study indicates that CGJ up-regulates the expression of eNOS mRNA and protein leading to an increased formation of NO in endothelial cells. The stimulatory effect of CGJ is a redox-sensitive event involving PI3-kinase/Akt, p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, and the inactivation of the FoxO transcription factors, FoxO1 and FoxO3a, thereby preventing their repression of the eNOS gene."
https://openalex.org/W2065622516,"Background The phosphatase PTEN represents an important physiological inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signalling, however, the functional role of PTEN in the initial phase of angioplasty-induced vascular injury remains elusive. In the present study we sought to determine PTEN's effect on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis following acute injury in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Results Immunohistochemistry indicated a faint basal expression and equal distribution of PTEN in uninjured rat carotid arteries. 12 h following balloon-injury, PTEN expression was strongly increased in apoptotic (TUNEL+) VSMC. In vitro, stimulation with serum or different growth factors or subjecting VSMC to cyclic stretch had no effect on PTEN expression, whereas stimulation with H2O2 robustly increased PTEN expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. To evaluate the functional role of PTEN expression, human VSMC were transduced with WT-PTEN. Overexpression of PTEN increased the number of apoptotic VSMC (19.8%±4.4 vs. 5.6%±2.3; P<0.001) as determined by TUNEL assay. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knock-down of PTEN attenuated the basal as well as H2O2-induced apoptosis of VSMC. Mechanistically, overexpression of PTEN prevented serum-induced Akt-phosphorylation, whereas siRNA-mediated knock down of PTEN augmented Akt-activation. Moreover, co-transfection of PTEN and a constitutive active Akt mutant prevented PTEN-dependent augmentation of VSMC apoptosis, indicating, that PTEN regulates VSMC apoptosis by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation/activation. Conclusion By interfering with the PI3-K/Akt-dependent survival signalling, the oxidative stress-induced up regulation of PTEN in VSMC of injured arteries augments the sensitivity of VSMC to apoptotic stimuli in the early phase following vascular injury, augmenting the initial injury and cell loss of the injured vessel wall. Thus, these data add to our understanding of PTEN's role during vascular remodelling."

While most available animal-models require immunosuppressive-therapy when applying human cells, the fetal-sheep being pre-immune until day 75 of gestation has been proposed for the in-vivo tracking of human cells after intra-peritoneal transplantation. We introduce a novel intra-uterine myocardial-infarction model to track human mesenchymal stem cells after direct intra-myocardial transplantation into the pre-immune fetal-sheep. Thirteen fetal-sheep (gestation age: 70-75 days) were included. Ten animals either received an intra-uterine induction of MI only (n = 4) or MI+intra-myocardial injection (IMI;n = 6) using micron-sized, iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human mesenchymal stem cells either derived from the adipose-tissue (ATMSCs;n = 3) or the bone-marrow (BMMSCs;n = 3). Three animals received an intra-peritoneal injection (IPI;n = 3; ATMSCs;n = 2/BMMSCs;n = 1). All procedures were performed successfully and follow-up was 7-9 days. To assess human cell-fate, multimodal cell-tracking was performed via MRI and/or Micro-CT, Flow-Cytometry, PCR and immunohistochemistry. After IMI, MRI displayed an estimated amount of 1×10(5)-5×10(5) human cells within ventricular-wall corresponding to the injection-sites which was further confirmed on Micro-CT. PCR and IHC verified intra-myocardial presence via detection of human-specific β-2-microglobulin, MHC-1, ALU-Sequence and anti-FITC targeting the fluorochrome-labeled part of the MPIOs. The cells appeared viable, integrated and were found in clusters or in the interstitial-spaces. Flow-Cytometry confirmed intra-myocardial presence, and showed further distribution within the spleen, lungs, kidneys and brain. Following IPI, MRI indicated the cells within the intra-peritoneal-cavity involving the liver and kidneys. Flow-Cytometry detected the cells within spleen, lungs, kidneys, thymus, bone-marrow and intra-peritoneal lavage, but not within the heart. For the first time we demonstrate the feasibility of intra-uterine, intra-myocardial stem-cell transplantation into the pre-immune fetal-sheep after MI. Utilizing cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging-technologies and in-vitro tracking-tools, this novel model may serve as a unique platform to assess human cell-fate after intra-myocardial transplantation without the necessity of immunosuppressive-therapy."

Sixty nine different denaturation treatments were tested and the 3 most discriminating ones were selected (TRIDENT analysis) and applied to human sera, showing a significant improvement of serum protein discrimination as confirmed by MALDI-TOF/MS and LC-MS/MS identification, depending on the type of denaturation applied. Thereafter sera from mice and patients carrying cutaneous melanoma were analyzed through TRIDENT. Nine and 8 protein bands were found differentially expressed in mice and human melanoma sera, compared to healthy controls (p<0.05); three of them were found, for the first time, significantly modulated: α2macroglobulin (down-regulated in melanoma, p<0.001), Apolipoprotein-E and Apolipoprotein-A1 (both up-regulated in melanoma, p<0.04), both in mice and humans. The modulation was confirmed by immunological methods. Other less abundant proteins (e.g. gelsolin) were found significantly modulated (p<0.05).i) serum proteome contains a large amount of information, still neglected, related to proteins folding; ii) a careful serum denaturation may significantly improve analytical procedures involving complex protein mixtures; iii) serum differential denaturation protocol highlights interesting proteomic differences between cancer and healthy sera."
https://openalex.org/W1974774503,"When vein segments are implanted into the arterial system for use in arterial bypass grafting, adaptation to the higher pressure and flow of the arterial system is accomplished thorough wall thickening and expansion. These early remodeling events have been found to be closely coupled to the local hemodynamic forces, such as shear stress and wall tension, and are believed to be the foundation for later vein graft failure. To further our mechanistic understanding of the cellular and extracellular interactions that lead to global changes in tissue architecture, a rule-based modeling method is developed through the application of basic rules of behaviors for these molecular and cellular activities. In the current method, smooth muscle cell (SMC), extracellular matrix (ECM), and monocytes are selected as the three components that occupy the elements of a grid system that comprise the developing vein graft intima. The probabilities of the cellular behaviors are developed based on data extracted from in vivo experiments. At each time step, the various probabilities are computed and applied to the SMC and ECM elements to determine their next physical state and behavior. One- and two-dimensional models are developed to test and validate the computational approach. The importance of monocyte infiltration, and the associated effect in augmenting extracellular matrix deposition, was evaluated and found to be an important component in model development. Final model validation is performed using an independent set of experiments, where model predictions of intimal growth are evaluated against experimental data obtained from the complex geometry and shear stress patterns offered by a mid-graft focal stenosis, where simulation results show good agreements with the experimental data."

In this context, it is important to note that the nascent chain can adopt a stable secondary structure already in the ribosomal exit tunnel (20Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G.

Furthermore, it has been shown previously that polypeptide structure within the ribosomal exit tunnel can modulate translocation of distal parts of the nascent chain (26Daniel C.J. Conti B.

The absence of a stable secondary structure does not necessarily imply a non-functional state of a protein. Instead, it became evident that IDPs and intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs) exert defined physiological activities and play a major role in several protein classes, including transcription factors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 27Tompa P.

In this study, we analyzed the biogenesis of three neuropeptide hormones that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Interestingly, these neuropeptide hormones are synthesized as larger precursors containing a prodomain in addition to an N-terminal ER signal peptide. Our analysis revealed that the prodomains have a vital function in hormone biogenesis by promoting import of the precursor into the ER lumen. This activity is linked to the propensity of the prodomain to adopt an α-helical structure. The full-length cDNA clones of human somatostatin (Som) (GenBankTM accession number BC032625), human thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (GenBank accession number BC074889), and human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (GenBank accession number BC126463) were ordered from Imagenes. All mutants used in this study were generated by standard PCR cloning techniques. GnRHΔpro and GnRHΔhor were created by deletion of amino acids (aa) 37–92 or aa 24–33, respectively. Somatostatin lacking the prodomain was generated by deletion of aa 25–88. In the case of somatostatin lacking the hormone domain, aa 89–116 were deleted. SomΔpro→helix-syn was created by an exchange of aa 25–88 for a synthetic peptide consisting of 10 EAAAK repeats that form a standard α-helix (25Bhushan S. Gartmann M. Halic M. Armache J.P. Jarasch A. Mielke T. Berninghausen O. Wilson D.N. Beckmann R. α-Helical nascent polypeptide chains visualized within distinct regions of the ribosomal exit tunnel.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the case of SomΔpro-helix-PrP and SomΔpro-IDD-Sho, aa 130–230 of the mouse prion protein (PrP; NCBI Reference Sequence NP_035300.1) or aa 25–124 of human shadoo (Sho; NCBI Reference Sequence NP_001012526.2) were fused to SomΔpro. TRHΔpro and TRHΔhor were generated by deletion of aa 26–62 or deletion of aa 63–99, respectively. In the case of TRHΔpro→proSom and TRHΔpro→helix-PrP, aa 26–62 were replaced by the prodomain (aa 25–88) of somatostatin or aa 173–219 of mouse PrP, respectively. For TRHΔpro→helix-PrP, amino acid Asn at position 196 of the PrP domain was replaced by Gln to delete the second glycosylation site. TRHΔpro→IDD-PrP was created by substituting aa 26–62 of TRH with the defined unstructured domain of mouse PrP (aa 23–115). In this construct, the amino acids Trp and Asn at positions 31/32 were replaced by Asn and Phe to generate a glycosylation acceptor site (NFT). GnRHΔpro→helix-PrP aa 37–92 of GnRH were replaced by aa 173–219 of mouse PrP. GnRHΔpro→IDD-Sho was generated by an exchange of aa 37–92 of GnRH for aa 69–124 of human Sho. ΔSP mutants were generated by deleting the ER signal peptide except for the first methionine of the respective protein. For detection, all constructs were equipped with a V5 tag (5′-ggt aaa ccg ata ccg aac cct ctg ctc ggt ctg gat agc acg-3′) at the C-terminal end. All constructs were inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) vector for mammalian expression. Mouse N2a (ATCC number Ccl 131) cells were cultivated in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PAA Laboratories) and 2 mm l-glutamine (PAA Laboratories). Cells were transfected 24 h after plating by a liposome-mediated method using Lipofectamine with PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine secretion of proteins into the cell culture supernatant, cells were cultivated in cell culture medium without supplements for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected, and proteins were precipitated with TCA and analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold detergent buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (1:500; Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min before addition of Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (140 mm). Protein concentrations in the cell lysates were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked by incubation in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS-T overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and finally washed with PBS-T. Protein signals were visualized using Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and Fuji film (Super RX). Signals were quantified using Image Quant TL software. Transfected cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and subsequently pulse-labeled for 15 min with 300 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytics; >37 TBq/mmol) in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium. After labeling, the cells were washed twice and either harvested immediately (pulse) or after a further incubation in complete medium for 1 h (chase). Cells were harvested and lysed as described under “Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis,” and transfected constructs in the lysate or medium fraction were immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Immunopellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA as a template, and l-[35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytics; >37 TBq/mmol) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega). Following translation, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g. Pellet fractions were resuspended in microsomal resuspension buffer (0.1 m KOAc, 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgOAc, and 0.25 m sucrose) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. If indicated, proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) was added to the microsomal resuspension buffer, and samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. Proteinase K digestion was stopped by the addition of 3 mm PMSF (Sigma). All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Signals were quantified using a phosphorimaging system (Typhoon) and the quantification software Image Quant TL. Truncated constructs lacking a stop codon were generated by PCR with full-length or mutant cDNA as template and extended primers. The 5′-primer added a T7 site followed by a high initiation efficiency 5′-untranslated region and an optimized AUG context (5′-taa tac gac tca cta tag gg acc aaa caa aac aaa taa aac aaa gcc acc atg-3′) as described previously (33Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Architecture of the protein-conducting channel associated with the translating 80S ribosome.Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The 3′-primer determined the length of the particular nascent chain. In vitro transcription was performed using the AmpliScribe T7 High Yield Transcription kit. After transcription, mRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). In vitro translation and targeting of truncated mRNA were carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (RM; Promega), and l-[35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytics; >37 TBq/mmol) as described (34Rutkowski D.T. Ott C.M. Polansky J.R. Lingappa V.R. Signal sequences initiate the pathway of maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30365-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For each 25-μl translation reaction, 1 μg of RNA was added. Truncated constructs were translated for 30 min at 32 °C (TRH) or 20 min at 26 °C (Som). For targeting analysis, translation reactions containing RM were centrifuged for 3 min at 46,000 rpm and 4 °C in a TLA55 rotor over a 50-μl sucrose cushion of 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 mm KOAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgOAc. Sedimented RM were washed by adding 50 μl of sucrose cushion and repeating the centrifugation step. Targeted nascent chains were resuspended in microsomal resuspension buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For all experiments, translation reactions without RM were used as internal sedimentation controls and treated equally as samples containing RM. As quantification controls, polysomes were sedimented for 30 min at 46,000 rpm and 4 °C over a 100-μl sucrose cushion (total). Signals were visualized by autoradiography. For quantification, signals were visualized using a phosphorimaging system (Typhoon) and quantified using the quantification software Image Quant TL. cDNA encoding amino acid residues 25–88 of the human somatostatin protein were inserted into a pTXB1 vector (New England Biolabs) modified with a His6 tag introduced into the AgeI site and expressed in Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6 for 3 h. Following induction, cells were lysed by sonification in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, lysozyme (1 mg/ml), and 5 μg/ml DNase, pH 8.0) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (1:500; Roche Applied Science). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, subjected to Ni2+ affinity beads (Qiagen), and agitated overnight at 4 °C. Washing and elution steps were performed on a column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted protein fraction was equilibrated with cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) using a Vivaspin 6 Centricon (Amicon; 5-kDa cutoff). The intein tag cleavage reaction was performed overnight at room temperature by addition of 30 mm DTT. The cleaved protein fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulfate for 1 h on ice, sedimented by centrifugation in a Ti50 rotor for 30 min at 31,100 rpm and 4 °C, and resuspended in NPI buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 5% glycerol. In the next step, the protein sample was again subjected to Ni2+ affinity chromatography to clear the cleaved prodomain from the remaining intein tag. The binding step of protein to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads was conducted for 20 min at 4 °C. The flow-through was collected, concentrated, and equilibrated in NPI buffer without glycerol. The sample was again precipitated with ammonium sulfate for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation in a Ti50 rotor for 30 min at 31,100 rpm and 4 °C the pellet was resuspended in CD buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2 and 100 mm KCl) containing 5% glycerol. Protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The purified protein band was excised from the gel and verified by mass spectrometry using Sequest. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of the recombinant somatostatin prodomain (125 μg/ml) in CD buffer containing 5% glycerol were recorded in 50% trifluoroethanol as solvent that approximates the hydrophobic surroundings of the protein interior of the isolated peptide (35Tsai F.C.

Commun. 1993; 196: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Data were collected at 26 °C using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The spectrum was obtained using a 2-mm path length, and data were collected at 1-nm intervals from 260 to 190 nm. Digitonin was used to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of cells, leaving the organelle membranes intact (37Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected N2a cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plate, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 0.5 mm EGTA) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (1:500; Roche Applied Science), and the plasma membrane was permeabilized by adding 0.004% digitonin for 5 min on ice. After permeabilization, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (cytosolic) and pellet (membrane) fraction were harvested. The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% Tx/DOC (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS) and proteinase inhibitor (1:500). For total lysates as control, cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Tx/DOC supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (1:500). Equal volumes of the supernatant, pellet, and total lysate fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Transiently transfected cells were grown on glass coverslips. To analyze mitochondrial morphology and function, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (50 nm) 30 min prior to fixation. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, washed again with PBS, and incubated with a fluorescently labeled secondary Alexa Fluor antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were mounted onto glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. For the prediction of disordered secretory proteins, SignalP 3.0 was used as a classifier for the prediction of signal peptides in proteins (38Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. Improved prediction of signal peptides: SignalP 3.0.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar). SignalP 3.0 was designed by two different methods, namely hidden Markov models and neural networks. In our analysis, we considered the presence of a signal peptide in a protein if both methods predicted a signal peptide. Mostly disordered proteins (>70% of the amino acid sequence) were identified by the disorder prediction program POODLE-W (39Shimizu K. Muraoka Y. Hirose S. Tomii K. Noguchi T.

In total, 20,331 human protein sequences listed in the Swiss-Prot database (release August 2009) were analyzed. Secondary structure prediction of the prodomains was performed using the prediction servers JPred 3 (42Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. p values are as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005. Previous studies on the biogenesis of pathogenic mutants of the prion protein and model substrates revealed that IDPs equipped with an N-terminal signal peptide are inefficiently imported into the ER (18Heske J.

https://openalex.org/W2024812469,"CpG-ODN stimulates dendritic cells (DCs) to produce cytokines, which are important for pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders and vaccine strategy for cancer. CpG-ODN activates the TLR9/MyD88/TRAF6 cascade leading to activation of IKK-NF-κB and JNK, which are critical for production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, whether other molecules are involved in activation of CpG-ODN signaling is still not clear. Here we report that the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is involved in this activation process. DNA-PKcs-deficient DCs exhibited a defect in the IL-6 and IL-12 response to CpG-ODN in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Loss of DNA-PKcs impaired phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, NF-κB and JNK in response to CpG-ODN. Interestingly, CpG-ODN was able to bind DNA-PKcs and induce its association and co-localization with TRAF6 in the absence of TLR9. Our data suggest that DNA-PKcs is a player in CpG-ODN signaling and may explain why DNA-PKcs is implicated in the pathogenic process of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970740119,"The adenovirus E4orf4 protein must bind protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) for its functions.The E4orf4 binding site in PP2A was mapped to the α1,α2 helices of the B55α subunit.The E4orf4 binding site in PP2A-B55α lies above the substrate binding site and does not overlap it.A novel functional significance was assigned to the α1,α2 helices of the PP2A-B55α subunit. The adenovirus E4orf4 protein regulates the progression of viral infection and when expressed outside the context of the virus it induces nonclassical, cancer cell-specific apoptosis. All E4orf4 functions known to date require an interaction between E4orf4 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is mediated through PP2A regulatory B subunits. Specifically, an interaction with the B55α subunit is required for induction of cell death by E4orf4. To gain a better insight into the E4orf4-PP2A interaction, mapping of the E4orf4 interaction site in PP2A-B55α has been undertaken. To this end we used a combination of bioinformatics analyses of PP2A-B55α and of E4orf4, which led to the prediction of E4orf4 binding sites on the surface of PP2A-B55α. Mutation analysis, immunoprecipitation, and GST pulldown assays based on the theoretical predictions revealed that the E4orf4 binding site included the α1 and α2 helices described in the B55α structure and involved at least three residues located in these helices facing each other. Loss of E4orf4 binding was accompanied by reduced contribution of the B55α mutants to E4orf4-induced cell death. The identified E4orf4 binding domain lies above the previously described substrate binding site and does not overlap it, although its location could be consistent with direct or indirect effects on substrate binding. This work assigns for the first time a functional significance to the α1,α2 helices of B55α, and we suggest that the binding site defined by these helices could also contribute to interactions between PP2A and some of its cellular regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2163402349,"In Western countries, invasive infections caused by M1T1 serotype group A Streptococcus (GAS) are epidemiologically linked to mutations in the control of virulence regulatory 2-component operon (covRS). In indigenous communities and developing countries, severe GAS disease is associated with genetically diverse non-M1T1 GAS serotypes. Hypervirulent M1T1 covRS mutant strains arise through selection by human polymorphonuclear cells for increased expression of GAS virulence factors such as the DNase Sda1, which promotes neutrophil resistance. The GAS bacteremia isolate NS88.2 (emm 98.1) is a covS mutant that exhibits a hypervirulent phenotype and neutrophil resistance yet lacks the phage-encoded Sda1. Here, we have employed a comprehensive systems biology (genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic) approach to identify NS88.2 virulence determinants that enhance neutrophil resistance in the non-M1T1 GAS genetic background. Using this approach, we have identified streptococcal collagen-like protein A and general stress protein 24 proteins as NS88.2 determinants that contribute to survival in whole blood and neutrophil resistance in non-M1T1 GAS. This study has revealed new factors that contribute to GAS pathogenicity that may play important roles in resisting innate immune defenses and the development of human invasive infections."
https://openalex.org/W2079889764,"The small subunit (β2) of class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) houses a diferric tyrosyl cofactor (Fe2(III)-Y(•)) that initiates nucleotide reduction in the large subunit (α2) via a long range radical transfer (RT) pathway in the holo-(α2)m(β2)n complex. The C-terminal tails of β2 are predominantly responsible for interaction with α2, with a conserved tyrosine residue in the tail (Tyr(356) in Escherichia coli NrdB) proposed to participate in cofactor assembly/maintenance and in RT. In the absence of structure of any holo-RNR, the role of the β tail in cluster assembly/maintenance and its predisposition within the holo-complex have remained unknown. In this study, we have taken advantage of the unusual heterodimeric nature of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNR small subunit (ββ'), of which only β contains a cofactor, to address both of these issues. We demonstrate that neither β-Tyr(376) nor β'-Tyr(323) (Tyr(356) equivalent in NrdB) is required for cofactor assembly in vivo, in contrast to the previously proposed mechanism for E. coli cofactor maintenance and assembly in vitro. Furthermore, studies with reconstituted-ββ' and an in vivo viability assay show that β-Tyr(376) is essential for RT, whereas Tyr(323) in β' is not. Although the C-terminal tail of β' is dispensable for cofactor formation and RT, it is essential for interactions with β and α to form the active holo-RNR. Together the results provide the first evidence of a directed orientation of the β and β' C-terminal tails relative to α within the holoenzyme consistent with a docking model of the two subunits and argue against RT across the β β' interface."
https://openalex.org/W2159531895,"Disulfide bridges strongly constrain the native structure of many proteins and predicting their formation is therefore a key sub-problem of protein structure and function inference. Most recently proposed approaches for this prediction problem adopt the following pipeline: first they enrich the primary sequence with structural annotations, second they apply a binary classifier to each candidate pair of cysteines to predict disulfide bonding probabilities and finally, they use a maximum weight graph matching algorithm to derive the predicted disulfide connectivity pattern of a protein. In this paper, we adopt this three step pipeline and propose an extensive study of the relevance of various structural annotations and feature encodings. In particular, we consider five kinds of structural annotations, among which three are novel in the context of disulfide bridge prediction. So as to be usable by machine learning algorithms, these annotations must be encoded into features. For this purpose, we propose four different feature encodings based on local windows and on different kinds of histograms. The combination of structural annotations with these possible encodings leads to a large number of possible feature functions. In order to identify a minimal subset of relevant feature functions among those, we propose an efficient and interpretable feature function selection scheme, designed so as to avoid any form of overfitting. We apply this scheme on top of three supervised learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and extremely randomized trees. Our results indicate that the use of only the PSSM (position-specific scoring matrix) together with the CSP (cysteine separation profile) are sufficient to construct a high performance disulfide pattern predictor and that extremely randomized trees reach a disulfide pattern prediction accuracy of on the benchmark dataset SPX, which corresponds to improvement over the state of the art.

The first steps of the formation of these granules at the trans-Golgi network specifically require VWF aggregation and an external scaffolding complex that contains the adaptator protein complex 1 (AP-1) and clathrin. Discs large 1 (Dlg1) is generally considered to be a modular scaffolding protein implicated in the control of cell polarity in a large variety of cells by specific recruiting of receptors, channels, or signaling proteins to specialized zones of the plasma membrane. We propose here that in endothelial cells, Dlg1, in a complex with AP-1 and clathrin, participates in the biogenesis of WPBs. Supporting data show that Dlg1 colocalizes with microtubules, intermediate filaments, and Golgi markers. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments led to the identification of clathrin as an Dlg1-interacting partner. Interaction was confirmed by in situ proximity ligation assays. Furthermore, AP-1 and VWF immunoprecipitate and colocalize with Dlg1 in the juxtanuclear zone. Finally, Dlg1 depletion by siRNA duplexes disrupts trans-Golgi network morphology and WPB formation. Our results provide the first evidence for an unexpected role of Dlg1 in controlling the formation of specific secretory granules involved in VWF exocytosis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050475574,"Background The World Health Organization reported in 2011that irrational use of medicines was a serious global problem that is wasteful and harmful. The worst is use of ineffective or harmful interventions which should not be used at all. However, little is known about the changes that 20 years of evidence-based medicine has made particularly in reducing use of ineffective interventions. We surveyed clinicians in China to show how often ineffective interventions were still used in practice. Methods 3,246 clinicians from 24 tertiary hospitals were surveyed in person and another 3,063 through an online survey between 2006–2007. The main outcomes are prescription by a clinician, and use in a patient of, an ineffective intervention and of a matched effective intervention in patients with the same disease. 129 ineffective interventions for 68 diseases were identified from the BMJ Clinical Evidence and included in the survey. One effective intervention was identified for each disease and a total of 68 effective interventions were thus also included. The frequency of use of effective interventions was used as a reference for that of ineffective intervention. Results The mean prescription rate by clinicians is 59.0% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 58.6% to 59.4%) and 81.0% (95% CI: 80.6% to 81.4%) respectively for ineffective and effective interventions. The mean frequency of use in patients is 31.2% (95% CI: 30.8% to 31.6%) and 56.4% (95% CI: 56.0% to 56.8%) for ineffective and effective interventions respectively. The relative reduction in use of ineffective interventions as compared with that of matched effective interventions is 27.2% (95% CI: 27.0% to 27.4%) and 44.7% (95% CI: 44.3% to 45.1%) for clinician's prescription and use in patients respectively. 8.6% ineffective interventions were still routinely used in practice. Conclusions Ineffective interventions were still commonly used. Efforts are necessary to further reduce and eventually eliminate ineffective interventions from practice."
https://openalex.org/W2090245934,"The two plasma inhibitors, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), effectively inhibit the activity of activated factor X (FXa); however, neither inhibitor exhibits any reactivity with the homologous protease activated factor IX (FIXa). In this study, we investigated the molecular basis for the lack of reactivity of FIXa with these plasma inhibitors and discovered that unique structural features within residues of the 39-loop are responsible for restricting the inhibitor specificity of FIXa. This loop in FXa is highly acidic and contains three Glu residues at positions 36, 37, and 39. On the other hand, the loop is shorter by one residue in FIXa (residue 37 is missing), and it contains a Lys and an Asp at positions 36 and 39, respectively. We discovered that replacing residues of the 39-loop (residues 31–41) of FIXa with corresponding residues of FXa renders the FIXa chimera susceptible to inactivation by both ZPI and TFPI. Thus, the inactivation rate of the FIXa chimera by ZPI in the presence of protein Z (PZ), negatively charged membrane vesicles, and calcium ions approached the same diffusion-limited rate (>107 m−1 s−1) that has been observed for the PZ-dependent inhibition of FXa by ZPI. Interestingly, sequence alignments indicated that, similar to FXa, residue 36 is a Glu in both mouse and bovine FIXa and that both proteases are also susceptible to inhibition by the PZ-ZPI complex. These results suggest that structural features within residues of the 39-loop contribute to the resistance of FIXa to inhibition by plasma inhibitors ZPI and TFPI.

The coordinated catalytic function of a series of trypsin-like serine proteases of the clotting cascade is responsible for thrombin generation in plasma during vascular injury (1Furie B. Furie B.C.

This proteolytic cascade has been conventionally divided into two phases: initiation and amplification (3Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K. The dynamics of thrombin formation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The high affinity binding of the first protease of the clotting cascade, factor VIIa (FVIIa), to exposed TF leads to the activation of homologous vitamin K-dependent zymogens factors IX and X to their activated forms (FIXa and FXa). Subsequent to activation of FX to FXa, the protease generates a small amount of thrombin through the activation of prothrombin, which is followed by thrombin amplifying its own generation by rapidly activating the homologous procoagulant cofactors V and VIII to their activated forms (FVa and FVIIIa). The complex formations of FVa with FXa and FVIIIa with FIXa on negatively charged membrane phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+ dramatically enhance the catalytic activity of these proteases toward their natural substrates, prothrombin and FX, respectively, thereby leading to generation of physiological levels of thrombin during the amplification phase of the clotting cascade (1Furie B.

Following zymogen activation and the formation of clots at injury sites, several plasma inhibitors must inhibit the proteolytic activities of coagulation proteases in both initiation and amplification phases of the cascade to prevent excessive clotting. The initiation phase of the cascade is regulated by the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (3Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K. The dynamics of thrombin formation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 4Broze Jr., G.J. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor.Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). TFPI is a multidomain Kunitz-type inhibitor that rapidly neutralizes the proteolytic activities of both FVIIa-TF and FXa by binding initially to the active site of FXa via its second Kunitz domain and thereafter by binding tightly to the active site of the FVIIa-TF complex via its first Kunitz domain, thereby trapping both proteases in inactive forms in a quaternary complex (4Broze Jr., G.J. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor.Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The amplification phase of the clotting cascade is primarily regulated by antithrombin (AT). AT is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that regulates the proteolytic activity of all coagulation proteases of the clotting cascade. It binds to the active site of its target protease through an exposed reactive center loop followed by undergoing a conformational change that leads to entrapment of the protease in the form of an inactive covalent serpin-protease complex (5Gettins P.G. Serpins structure, mechanism, and function.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 6Olson S.T. Björk I.

Huntington J.A. Church F.C. Serpins in thrombosis, hemostasis and fibrinolysis.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Another serpin that contributes to regulation of the clotting cascade is protein Z (PZ)-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) (8Broze Jr., G.J. Protein Z-dependent regulation of coagulation.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to AT, ZPI has narrower protease specificity and thus is capable of only inhibiting FXa and factor XIa (FXIa) but not other coagulation proteases (8Broze Jr., G.J. Protein Z-dependent regulation of coagulation.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The optimal inhibitory activity of ZPI toward FXa requires the cofactor function of PZ, which promotes the reactivity of the serpin with the protease by more than 3 orders of magnitude on the surface of negatively charged membrane phospholipids in the presence of calcium (9Huang X. Swanson R. Broze Jr., G.J. Olson S.T. Kinetic characterization of the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor reaction with blood coagulation factor Xa.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29770-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although structurally homologous to FXa, neither TFPI nor ZPI exhibit inhibitory activities toward FIXa. AT is the only known physiological inhibitor in plasma, which can inhibit FIXa, although with ∼40-fold lower reactivity when compared with FXa (10Yang L. Manithody C. Qureshi S.H. Rezaie A.R.

Chem. 2010; 285: 28488-28495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the resistance of FIXa to inhibition by either ZPI or TFPI is not known. However, it is known that several surface loops surrounding the active site pockets have variant residues in FIXa and FXa that play critical roles in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of coagulation proteases. One of these surface loops, known as the variable region 1 or 39-loop (also referred to as the 37-loop), is known to participate in restricting the substrate and inhibitor specificity of all coagulation proteases (11Furie B.

In a recent study, we prepared a FIXa mutant in which the residues of this loop (residues 31–41) were replaced with the corresponding residues of FX (FIXa-FX39-loop), and then we demonstrated that this loop plays a critical role in the reactivity of FIXa with AT and its catalytic activity in intrinsic tenase (10Yang L. Manithody C. Qureshi S.H. Rezaie A.R. Role of the residues of the 39-loop in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of factor IXa.J. Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate that the 39-loop of FIXa also plays a critical role in restricting the ZPI and TFPI specificity of the protease. Thus, we discovered that the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera reacts with the ZPI-PZ complex with essentially the same rate as does FXa on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles in the presence of calcium. Interestingly, sequence alignments suggested that unlike human FIXa, residue 36 of both mouse and bovine FIXa is a Glu and that both of these proteases are also susceptible to inhibition by the ZPI-PZ complex. These results suggest that the residues of the 39-loop contribute to the lack of reactivity of human FIXa with the ZPI-PZ complex.

Mouse and bovine plasma-derived FIXa and the FX-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom were purchased from (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (17Qureshi S.H. Yang L. Yegneswaran S. Rezaie A.R.

TFPI was from Monsanto Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The chromogenic substrates, Spectrozyme FXa was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and the FIXa-specific chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 (LGR-pNA) was purchased from Midwest Bio-Tech, Inc. (Fishers, IN). A discontinuous assay method was used to monitor the time course of inhibition and to measure the second order association rate constants (k2) for the ZPI inhibition of wild-type FIXa and the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera under pseudo-first order conditions both in the absence and presence of PZ as described (16Rezaie A.R.

Briefly, FIXa (5–10 nm) was incubated with increasing concentration of ZPI (100–1000 nm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% PEG 8000 at room temperature for 0.5–2 h. In the presence of PZ (5–160 nm), the inhibition of the FIXa derivatives (3–5 nm) by ZPI (200 nm) was monitored for 0.5–5 min on 50 μm PC/PS vesicles in the same TBS buffer system. All of the reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes in 96-well plates and at different time points, 50 μl of the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 in TBS was added to each reaction, and the remaining enzyme activity was measured at 405 nm using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) as described (10Yang L.

All of the values are presented as the average of at least three independent measurements ± S.D. The SI value for the ZPI-PZ inhibition of the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera was determined by titration of 200 nm protease with increasing concentrations of the serpin-cofactor complex corresponding to serpin/protease molar ratios of 0–5 and a PZ concentration equal to or 2-fold in molar excess of ZPI. The reaction was carried out in TBS/Ca2+ containing 50 μm PC/PS, and the residual amidolytic activity of the FIXa chimera was monitored for up to 30 min at room temperature from the hydrolysis of CBS 31.39 (1 mm) as described above. After completion of the inhibition reaction, the serpin/protease ratios were plotted versus the residual activity of the protease, and the SI value was determined from the x intercept of the linear regression fit of the inhibition data as described (15Yang L.

Complex formation of the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera with ZPI was monitored by SDS-PAGE as described (9Huang X. Swanson R. Broze Jr., G.J. Olson S.T.

The reaction was carried out in 20 μl of volume using 2 μm protease and 4 μm ZPI in complex with 4 μm PZ in TBS/Ca2+ containing 50 μm PC/PS. Following 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 5 μl of 5× nonreducing SDS sample buffer was added, and the sample was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The ability of the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera to interact with TFPI was evaluated by incubating the protease (5 nm) with different concentrations of TFPI (12.5–200 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ in 50-ml volumes in a 96-well assay plate as described (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Conversion of glutamic acid 192 to glutamine in activated protein C changes the substrate specificity and increases reactivity toward macromolecular inhibitors.J. Biol.

Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 50 ml of CBS 31.39 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the inhibition constant, Ki, was estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of data using an equation expressing the interaction of reversible inhibitors with proteases at equilibrium as described (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Conversion of glutamic acid 192 to glutamine in activated protein C changes the substrate specificity and increases reactivity toward macromolecular inhibitors.J. Biol.

Vs=Vo/([I]/(Ki(1+[S]/Km))+1)(Eq. 1) In this equation, Vs and Vo are steady-state velocities of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis in the presence and absence of TFPI, respectively, [S] is the concentration of the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for CBS 31.39 (∼1 mm for both wild-type and FIXa chimera), and [I] is the TFPI concentration. We have already characterized the amidolytic and proteolytic activities of the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera in a previous study and noted that the mutant exhibits a normal amidolytic activity toward the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39, yielding Km and kcat values similar to those observed for the wild-type FIXa (10Yang L. Manithody C. Qureshi S.H. Rezaie A.R. Role of the residues of the 39-loop in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of factor IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28488-28495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, although the FIXa mutant exhibited a normal affinity for FVIIIa, its catalytic activity (kcat) toward the natural substrate FX in the presence of FVIIIa was decreased ∼4-fold, suggesting that residues of the 39-loop contribute to the recognition specificity of the substrate in the intrinsic tenase complex (10Yang L. Manithody C. Qureshi S.H. Rezaie A.R. Role of the residues of the 39-loop in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of factor IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28488-28495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that the reactivity of the FIXa mutant with AT has been improved ∼5-fold specifically in the absence of pentasaccharide, suggesting that the 39-loop of FIXa contributes to the slower reactivity of the protease with the serpin in the absence of a heparin cofactor (10Yang L. Manithody C. Qureshi S.H. Rezaie A.R. Role of the residues of the 39-loop in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of factor IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28488-28495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In light of the latter observation that the 39-loop of FXa improves the recognition specificity of the FIXa chimera with the circulating native conformer of AT, we wondered whether the 39-loop of FIXa plays any role in rendering FIXa resistant to inhibition by other plasma inhibitors, which readily inhibit FXa in circulation. Thus, we evaluated the reactivity of the FIXa-FX39-loop chimera with the two specific inhibitors of FXa: ZPI and TFPI, which are known to participate in the physiological regulation of FXa during both the initiation and amplification phases of the clotting cascade. In agreement with previous results, no decline in the amidolytic activity of the wild-type FIXa was observed upon its incubation with a high concentration of ZPI (0.5 μm) over a period of 1 h in TBS/Ca2+ in either the absence or presence of PZ and PC/PS vesicles (data not presented) (9Huang X. Swanson R. Broze Jr., G.J. Olson S.T. Kinetic characterization of the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor reaction with blood coagulation factor Xa.J. Biol.

However, the FIXa chimera exhibited a moderate reactivity with ZPI in TBS/Ca2+, thus yielding a second order association rate constant (k2) of 1.2 × 102 m−1 s−1 for interaction with the serpin in the absence of any added cofactor. The rate of ZPI inhibition of the FIXa chimera was ∼83-fold slower than the serpin inhibition of FXa under similar conditions (Table 1). Interestingly, however, the reactivity of ZPI with the FIXa chimera was dramatically enhanced if the reaction was monitored in TBS/Ca2+ in the presence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles. Thus, time course analysis of the ZPI (200 nm) inhibition of the FIXa chimera in the presence of PZ (20 nm) on PC/PS vesicles indicated that the reaction is rapid and reaches near completion in less than 40s (Fig. 1A). Nonlinear regression analysis of these data by a single exponential decay function with non-zero end point yielded a pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) of 0.129 ± 0.008 s−1 for the ZPI-PZ inhibition of the FIXa chimera (Fig. 1A). Noting the relatively slower rate in the absence of the cofactor, the serpin reactivity was monitored with a fixed concentration of ZPI (200 nm) as a function of increasing concentrations of PZ for 20s on PC/PS vesicles. The kobs values for the ZPI-PZ inhibition of the FIXa chimera exhibited a saturable dependence on the concentration of the inhibitor-cofactor complex (Fig. 1B). Analysis of kobs values according to a hyperbolic equation yielded Kd(app) and k values of 10.2 nm and 0.189 s−1, respectively, and a k2 of 1.85 × 107 m−1 s−1 (k2 = k/Kd(app)) for the inhibition reaction, suggesting that PZ promotes the reaction rate by approximately 5 orders of magnitude, exceeding the rate accelerating effect that has been observed for the PZ-mediated inhibition of FXa by ZPI on PC/PS vesicles (9Huang X.

These results clearly suggest that the residues of the 39-loop are primarily responsible for the lack of reactivity of FIXa with the PZ-ZPI complex on negatively charged phospholipid surfaces.TABLE 1Inhibition constants for TFPI and second order association rate constants for the ZPI inhibition of FXa and FIXa-FX39-loop in the absence and presence of PZ and PC/PS vesiclesTFPI (Ki)ZPI (k2)−PZ+PZnmm−1 s−1FXa0.23 ± 0.03aThe Ki value for the TFPI inhibition of FXa is derived from Ref. 20.1.0 ± 0.1 × 104bThe k2 values for the ZPI inhibition of FXa in the absence and presence of PZ and PC/PS are derived from Ref. 9.2.3 ± 0.5 × 107bThe k2 values for the ZPI inhibition of FXa in the absence and presence of PZ and PC/PS are derived from Ref. 9.FIXa-FX39-loop48.3 ± 5.11.2 ± 0.2 × 1021.8 ± 0.2 × 107a The Ki value for the TFPI inhibition of FXa is derived from Ref. 20Rezaie A.R.

Open table in a new tab To directly monitor the extent of complex formation between the FIXa chimera and ZPI, SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out following incubation of the protease mutant (2 μm) with a 2 m excess of ZPI in the presence of PZ for 10 min at room temperature. As presented in Fig. 2 (top panel), the FIXa chimera formed a stable covalent complex with ZPI as evidenced by the appearance of a high molecular mass band migrating at ∼95 kDa, which represents the combination of the molecular masses of ZPI plus the protease mutant (lane 4). The protease mutant migrated a"
