https://openalex.org/W2083725367,"Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled µ-opioid receptor (µ-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the mouse µ-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the µ-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2014055152,"Opioid receptors mediate the actions of endogenous and exogenous opioids on many physiological processes, including the regulation of pain, respiratory drive, mood, and--in the case of κ-opioid receptor (κ-OR)--dysphoria and psychotomimesis. Here we report the crystal structure of the human κ-OR in complex with the selective antagonist JDTic, arranged in parallel dimers, at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure reveals important features of the ligand-binding pocket that contribute to the high affinity and subtype selectivity of JDTic for the human κ-OR. Modelling of other important κ-OR-selective ligands, including the morphinan-derived antagonists norbinaltorphimine and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole, and the diterpene agonist salvinorin A analogue RB-64, reveals both common and distinct features for binding these diverse chemotypes. Analysis of site-directed mutagenesis and ligand structure-activity relationships confirms the interactions observed in the crystal structure, thereby providing a molecular explanation for κ-OR subtype selectivity, and essential insights for the design of compounds with new pharmacological properties targeting the human κ-OR."
https://openalex.org/W2072753654,"Plant growth and development are strongly affected by small differences in temperature. Current climate change has already altered global plant phenology and distribution, and projected increases in temperature pose a significant challenge to agriculture. Despite the important role of temperature on plant development, the underlying pathways are unknown. It has previously been shown that thermal acceleration of flowering is dependent on the florigen, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). How this occurs is, however, not understood, because the major pathway known to upregulate FT, the photoperiod pathway, is not required for thermal acceleration of flowering. Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism by which increasing temperature causes the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) to activate FT. Our findings provide a new understanding of how plants control their timing of reproduction in response to temperature. Flowering time is an important trait in crops as well as affecting the life cycles of pollinator species. A molecular understanding of how temperature affects flowering will be important for mitigating the effects of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2005751229,"Emergent collective behaviour is observed in dynein-driven microtubules and modelled by taking into account only local interactions and the reptation-like motion of individual microtubules. Spontaneous collective motion is of interest in many scientific fields, from animal behaviour to cell dynamics. Motility assays provide a system in which the underlying physical principles can be studied, using protein filaments driven by molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of ATP. Here, Sumino et al. report on experiments in which microtubules are propelled by surface-bound dyneins, and are seen to self-organize into large-scale vortices. This process can be explained by a surprisingly simple mathematical model, based on only the smooth motion of single microtubules and their local interaction (they align with high probability on collision). As well as potentially being relevant to biological systems, the study hints at the existence of a new universality class of collective-motion or active-matter phenomena. Spontaneous collective motion, as in some flocks of bird and schools of fish, is an example of an emergent phenomenon. Such phenomena are at present of great interest1,2,3,4,5 and physicists have put forward a number of theoretical results that so far lack experimental verification6,7,8. In animal behaviour studies, large-scale data collection is now technologically possible, but data are still scarce and arise from observations rather than controlled experiments. Multicellular biological systems, such as bacterial colonies or tissues9,10, allow more control, but may have many hidden variables and interactions, hindering proper tests of theoretical ideas. However, in systems on the subcellular scale such tests may be possible, particularly in in vitro experiments with only few purified components11,12,13. Motility assays, in which protein filaments are driven by molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of ATP, can show collective motion for high densities of motors and attached filaments. This was demonstrated recently for the actomyosin system14,15, but a complete understanding of the mechanisms at work is still lacking. Here we report experiments in which microtubules are propelled by surface-bound dyneins. In this system it is possible to study the local interaction: we find that colliding microtubules align with each other with high probability. At high densities, this alignment results in self-organization of the microtubules, which are on average 15 µm long, into vortices with diameters of around 400 µm. Inside the vortices, the microtubules circulate both clockwise and anticlockwise. On longer timescales, the vortices form a lattice structure. The emergence of these structures, as verified by a mathematical model, is the result of the smooth, reptation-like motion of single microtubules in combination with local interactions (the nematic alignment due to collisions)—there is no need for long-range interactions. Apart from its potential relevance to cortical arrays in plant cells16,17 and other biological situations, our study provides evidence for the existence of previously unsuspected universality classes of collective motion phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2028160465,"An electron tomography method is demonstrated that can determine the three-dimensional structure of a gold nanoparticle at 2.4 Å resolution, including the locations of some of the individual atoms within the sample. Electron tomography, an extension of transmission electron microscopy that was developed in the late 1960s, is widely used to obtain three-dimensional images of samples in the biological and materials sciences. Advances in recent years mean that the method can be used to determine the internal structure of nanomaterials at atomic resolutions, as long as certain assumptions are made concerning the sample structure. Scott et al. now demonstrate an electron-tomography method that bypasses the need for such assumptions, enabling the authors to determine the three-dimensional structure of a gold nanoparticle at 2.4-ångström resolution, including the locations of some of the individual atoms in the sample. Transmission electron microscopy is a powerful imaging tool that has found broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology1,2,3. With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial resolution and the image quality in transmission electron microscopy have been significantly improved4,5 and resolution below 0.5 ångströms has been demonstrated6. To reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice7,8,9,10,11, with cubic-nanometre resolution currently achievable10,11. Discrete tomography has recently been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver nanoparticle two to three nanometres in diameter12, but this statistical method assumes prior knowledge of the particle’s lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit rigidly on that lattice. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a general electron tomography method that achieves atomic-scale resolution without initial assumptions about the sample structure. By combining a novel projection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of an approximately ten-nanometre gold nanoparticle at 2.4-ångström resolution. Although we cannot definitively locate all of the atoms inside the nanoparticle, individual atoms are observed in some regions of the particle and several grains are identified in three dimensions. The 3D surface morphology and internal lattice structure revealed are consistent with a distorted icosahedral multiply twinned particle. We anticipate that this general method can be applied not only to determine the 3D structure of nanomaterials at atomic-scale resolution13,14,15, but also to improve the spatial resolution and image quality in other tomography fields7,9,16,17,18,19,20."

https://openalex.org/W2087013004,"Excitons, bound pairs of electrons and holes, form a model system to explore the quantum physics of cold bosons in solids. Cold exciton gases can be realized in a system of indirect excitons, which can cool down below the temperature of quantum degeneracy due to their long lifetimes. Here, we report on the measurement of spontaneous coherence in a gas of indirect excitons. We found that extended spontaneous coherence of excitons emerges in the region of the macroscopically ordered exciton state and in the region of vortices of linear polarization. The coherence length in these regions is much larger than in a classical gas, indicating a coherent state with a much narrower than classical exciton distribution in momentum space, characteristic of a condensate. We also observed phase singularities in the coherent exciton gas. Extended spontaneous coherence and phase singularities emerge when the exciton gas is cooled below a few Kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W2020498762,"Wnt signaling plays critical roles during synaptic development and plasticity. However, the mechanisms by which Wnts are released and travel to target cells are unresolved. During synaptic development, the secretion of Drosophila Wnt1, Wingless, requires the function of Evenness Interrupted (Evi)/Wls, a Wingless-binding protein that is secreted along with Wingless at the neuromuscular junction. Given that Evi is a transmembrane protein, these studies suggested the presence of a novel vesicular mechanism of trans-synaptic communication, potentially in the form of exosomes. To establish the mechanisms for the release of Evi vesicles, we used a dsRNA assay in cultured cells to screen for genes that when down-regulated prevent the release of Evi vesicles. We identified two proteins, Rab11 and Syntaxin 1A (Syx1A), that were required for Evi vesicle release. To determine whether the same mechanisms were used in vivo at the neuromuscular junction, we altered the activity of Rab11 and Syx1A in motoneurons and determined the impact on Evi release. We found that Syx1A, Rab11, and its effector Myosin5 were required for proper Evi vesicle release. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons demonstrated the presence of multivesicular bodies, organelles involved in the production and release of exosomes, and these multivesicular bodies contained Evi. We also used mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques to characterize the exosome fraction from cultured cells. Our studies revealed that secreted Evi vesicles show remarkable conservation with exosomes in other systems. In summary, our observations unravel some of the in vivo mechanisms required for Evi vesicle release."
https://openalex.org/W2169976205,"The multifunctional HIV-1 enzyme integrase interacts with viral DNA and its key cellular cofactor LEDGF to effectively integrate the reverse transcript into a host cell chromosome. These interactions are crucial for HIV-1 replication and present attractive targets for antiviral therapy. Recently, 2-(quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid derivatives were reported to selectively inhibit the integrase-LEDGF interaction in vitro and impair HIV-1 replication in infected cells. Here, we show that this class of compounds impairs both integrase-LEDGF binding and LEDGF-independent integrase catalytic activities with similar IC(50) values, defining them as bona fide allosteric inhibitors of integrase function. Furthermore, we show that 2-(quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid derivatives block the formation of the stable synaptic complex between integrase and viral DNA by allosterically stabilizing an inactive multimeric form of integrase. In addition, these compounds inhibit LEDGF binding to the stable synaptic complex. This multimode mechanism of action concordantly results in cooperative inhibition of the concerted integration of viral DNA ends in vitro and HIV-1 replication in cell culture. Our findings, coupled with the fact that high cooperativity of antiviral inhibitors correlates with their increased instantaneous inhibitory potential, an important clinical parameter, argue strongly that improved 2-(quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid derivatives could exhibit desirable clinical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2019329658,"Ribosomal protein RPL26 enhances p53 translation after DNA damage, and this regulation depends upon interactions between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of human p53 mRNA (Takagi, M., Absalon, M. J., McLure, K. G., and Kastan, M. B. (2005) Cell 123, 49–63; Chen, J., and Kastan, M. B. (2010) Genes Dev. 24, 2146–2156). In contrast, nucleolin (NCL) suppresses the translation of p53 mRNA and its induction after DNA damage. We confirmed reports that RPL26 and NCL interact with each other and then explored the potential role of this interaction in the translational control of p53 after stress. NCL repression of p53 translation utilizes both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of p53 mRNA, and NCL binds to the same 5′-3′-UTR interaction region that is critical for the recruitment of RPL26 to p53 mRNA after DNA damage. We also found that NCL is able to oligomerize, consistent with a model in which NCL stabilizes this double-stranded RNA structure. We found that the RNA-binding domain of NCL participates in binding to p53 mRNA, is required for both NCL dimerization and NCL-mediated translational repression, and is the domain of NCL that interacts with RPL26. Excessive RPL26 disrupts NCL dimerization, and point mutations in the NCL-interacting region of RPL26 reduce NCL-RPL26 interactions and attenuate both RPL26 binding to human p53 mRNA and p53 induction by RPL26. These observations suggest a model in which the base pairings in the p53 UTR interaction regions are critical for both translational repression and stress induction of p53 by NCL and RPL26, respectively, and that disruption of a NCL-NCL homodimer by RPL26 may be the switch between translational repression and activation after stress. Ribosomal protein RPL26 enhances p53 translation after DNA damage, and this regulation depends upon interactions between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of human p53 mRNA (Takagi, M., Absalon, M. J., McLure, K.

Disruption of the base pairing within this region abrogates the ability of RPL26 both to bind p53 mRNA and to stimulate p53 translation.

However, the mechanisms by which nucleolin represses p53 translation and its relationship to RPL26 in this regulation were not elucidated. Nucleolin is a highly conserved, multifunctional protein implicated in transcription, translation, DNA replication, recombination, and repair (12.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P.

Nucleolin: a multiFACeTed protein.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 80-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As the most abundant non-ribosomal protein in the nucleolus, nucleolin affects rRNA synthesis, processing, and transportation (12.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. Structure and functions of nucleolin.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among its activities, nucleolin binds a consensus “nucleolin-responsive element” in pre-rRNA and stabilizes a stem-loop structure of this sequence (14.Bouvet P. Allain F.H. Finger L.D. Dieckmann T.

We report here that repression of the translation of p53 mRNA by nucleolin depends on both 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences.

The RNA-binding domain (RBD) of nucleolin is indispensible for NCL binding to p53 mRNA, NCL self-interaction, NCL-RPL26 interaction, and NCL-dependent translational repression. Disruption of the NCL-RPL26 interaction attenuates both RPL26 binding to human p53 mRNA and p53 induction by RPL26. These observations provide new insights about the mechanisms of translational control of human p53 and suggest a collaborative relationship between NCL and RPL26 in this translational regulation. nucleolin RNA-binding domain. MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS. MCF-7 cell lines stably expressing luciferase reporters were infected with a pBABE-based retrovirus carrying luciferase coding sequence, luciferase coding sequence after 145 nucleotides of the human p53 5′-UTR, or luciferase coding sequence flanked by 145 nucleotides of the human p53 5′-UTR and the full-length 3′-UTR, and the infected cells were selected and maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin. Plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and nucleolin siRNA duplex (Invitrogen) was introduced using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The plasmids used in this study include pCMV3-FLAG-nucleolin, pEGFP-C3-nucleolin, pCMV-FLAG-RPL26, and pLPCXp53mRNA (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B.

NCL, RPL26, and their deletion mutants were constructed in the pEGFP-C3 or pCMV-FLAG vector. The oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized at the Hartwell Center of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Native nucleolin protein was purchased from Vaxron Corp. (Rockaway, NJ). Capped p53 mRNA was transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion), followed by a poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion) to add a poly(A) tail modification. The synthesized mRNA was further purified with a MEGAclear column (Ambion) and quantified using NanoDrop spectrometer. RNA without modification was synthesized using a MEGAscript high yield transcription kit (Ambion). All synthesized RNA was purified using a MEGAclear kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The in vitro transcription/translation reactions were performed using a TnT T7 Quick for PCR DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, PCR primers for p53 were designed according to the manual and used to amplify the desired gene. Appropriate amounts of PCR products (usually a total of 400 ng of input PCR products/25-μl reaction) were then further used for in vitro transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates provided with the kit at 30 °C for 90 min. 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each reaction to label newly synthesized protein. After the reaction, 3 μl of reaction mixture was separated on precast 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. The primers used in this study for in vitro transcription/translation reactions were as follows: human NCL, GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGCCATCATGGTGAAGCTCGCGAAGGCAGG (forward) and CTATTCAAACTTCGTCTTCTTTCCTTGTGGCTT (reverse); and luciferase, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGC (forward) and GATATAGGCGCCAGCAACCGCAC (reverse), with the T7 luciferase plasmid as a template. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manual provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of the indicated protein constructs, 100 ng of −145pGl3ctrl+3′-UTR (145 bases of the 5′-UTR, coding sequence, and the full-length 3′-UTR of human p53 mRNA), and 27 ng of pRL-TK. 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to the reporter assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing once, followed by incubation in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 30 min on ice, and supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. For immunoblot analysis, 20-μg protein samples were denatured in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer, separated on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with primary antibody against p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), nucleolin (MS-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GFP (FL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (M2; Sigma or Cell Signaling), RPL26 (Bethyl Laboratories), or actin (Sigma). Primary antibody binding was detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody and visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of whole cell extract in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B.

Precleared lysates were incubated overnight with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam), anti-FLAG antibody M2, anti-p53 antibody (FL393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RPL26 antibody, or anti-nucleolin antibody (H250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed extensively with lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in TGN buffer (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B.

For immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR, immunoprecipitated protein complexes were split in half: one half was used for immunoblot analysis, and the other half was used for real-time RT-PCR as described previously (1.Takagi M.

Briefly, GFP or GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from H1299 cells as described above, separated on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was then renatured in RNA binding buffer and hybridized to a 5′-end-labeled RNA probe (∼106 cpm/5 ml of hybridization buffer) overnight at ambient temperature. RNA probes were first synthesized using the MEGAscript high yield transcription kit, labeled at the 5′-end using a KinaseMaxTM 5′-end labeling kit (Ambion), and later purified using the MEGAclear kit. After extensive washing with wash buffer at room temperature, the membrane was air-dried for autoradiography at −80 °C. 1 μg of total RNA prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed with a SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer using the random hexamer primer provided in the kit. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system and an ABI TaqMan One-Step PCR Master Mix Reagents kit. The primer/TaqMan probe set for human p53 was Hs00153340_m1 (20× mixture; Applied Biosystems). Human 18 S rRNA (20×; Applied Biosystems) was used as an internal control. Total RNA extracted from MCF-7 cells was used for a standard curve. The reaction was performed with 20 ng of total RNA in triplicate reactions in a 30-μl volume containing 2× p53 primer/probe and 1× 18 S rRNA primer/probe. Cycling conditions were 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for amplification. The results were analyzed using SDS 2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). For comparison of total human endogenous p53 mRNA levels in cells, the p53 mRNA level was normalized to the internal 18 S rRNA level. For immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR, the absolute human p53 mRNA level was used for analysis. Although nucleolin binds to p53 mRNA and represses its translation (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Regulation of p53 translation and induction after DNA damage by ribosomal protein L26 and nucleolin.Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which nucleolin affects p53 translation have not extensively characterized. We explored the mechanisms of p53 translational repression by NCL in both an in vitro translation system and a cell-based reporter system. A series of constructs were generated that contained various lengths of p53 mRNA 5′- and 3′-UTRs, and the ability of nucleolin to repress translation of these constructs was examined in an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte translation system. As noted previously both in cells and in vitro (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Regulation of p53 translation and induction after DNA damage by ribosomal protein L26 and nucleolin.Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), adding a 75-base 5′-UTR sequence enhanced basal translation of p53, but UTR sequences longer than 75 bases then began to reduce basal p53 translation (Fig. 1A), suggesting the presence of basal inhibitory sequences in this 5′-region of p53 mRNA. Nucleolin failed to repress p53 translation in the absence of a 5′-UTR (Fig. 1A, right panel), but nucleolin repressed p53 translation of mRNAs containing 5′-UTR sequences of 75 bases or more, regardless of the basal level of translation (left and right panels). These effects were also seen when purified nucleolin protein was directly added to the system (supplemental Fig. S1A) and were not attributable to nonspecific inhibition of protein translation in this system (supplemental Fig. S1B) or changes in p53 RNA levels (data not shown). Furthermore, they were not altered in the presence of a 5′-m7GpppN cap or 3′-poly(A) tail structure (supplemental Fig. S1C). Translational repression was also evident in a cell-based system using a chimeric construct containing the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of p53 mRNA surrounding the luciferase coding sequence instead of the p53 coding sequence (data not shown). Thus, similar to the requirements of RPL26 to stimulate p53 translation, nucleolin repression of p53 translation requires the 5′-UTR, but not the p53 coding sequence, 5′-m7GpppN cap structure, or 3′-poly(A) tail. Deletion of the 3′-UTR of p53 decreased the basal level of p53 translation and unexpectedly also abrogated the ability of nucleolin to repress p53 translation in vitro (Fig. 1B). Serial deletion of the 3′-UTR region demonstrated that the first 355 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR were sufficient to mediate translational repression of p53 mRNA by nucleolin (Fig. 1C). Thus, nucleolin repression appears to require both the 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences of p53 mRNA. Similar results were obtained in the cell-based reporter system. Overexpression (Fig. 2A) or knockdown (Fig. 2B) of NCL affected luciferase reporter activity if the 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences of p53 mRNA were both present, but not if the reporter with the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2, A and B) or 3′-UTR (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) was present alone. Because complete knockdown of NCL is detrimental to the cells, we chose a condition under which nucleolin is only partially depleted (Fig. 2B, right panels). Manipulation of NCL levels in these stable reporter lines did not affect the mRNA level of the luciferase reporter genes (supplemental Fig. S3). Nucleolin has been reported to bind ribosomal RNA in a sequence- and structure-specific manner, and its RBD has been characterized (14.Bouvet P. Allain F.H. Finger L.D. Dieckmann T. Feigon J. Recognition of preformed and flexible elements of an RNA stem-loop by nucleolin.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Hall K.B. RNA-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20.Allain F.H. Bouvet P. Dieckmann T. Feigon J.

Erard M. RNA recognition by the joint action of two nucleolin RNA-binding domains: genetic analysis and structural modeling.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We initially identified nucleolin in a screen for proteins binding to the 5′-UTR of p53 mRNA (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Regulation of p53 translation and induction after DNA damage by ribosomal protein L26 and nucleolin.Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), but had not demonstrated whether this was a direct interaction. Immunoprecipitation of nucleolin from cells brings down p53 mRNA in an immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR assay (1.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Regulation of p53 translation and induction after DNA damage by ribosomal protein L26 and nucleolin.Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), but to explore whether nucleolin directly interacts with p53 mRNA, we made a series of epitope-tagged expression constructs coding for various domains of nucleolin protein (Fig. 3A). Using Northwestern blot analysis, we found that full-length nucleolin was able to directly and independently bind both the 5′-UTR sequence (−75 to +1) (Fig. 3B, left panel, lane 2) and the 3′-UTR sequence (first 355 bases) (middle panel, lane 2). Similar results were obtained with immunoprecipitated endogenous nucleolin (data not shown). Domain mapping revealed that the N terminus of nucleolin did not directly bind either of the UTR probes in vitro (Fig. 3B, lane 3) or p53 mRNA in vivo (supplemental Fig. S4, lane 5), and deletion of the N terminus did not affect the ability of nucleolin to bind these sequences (Fig. 3B, lane 8, and supplemental Fig. S4, lane 10). In contrast, the RBD was sufficient for the binding of p53 mRNA in vivo (supplemental Fig. S4, lane 9) and both the 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences in vitro (Fig. 3B, lane 7). Deletion of the RBD abrogated the binding of nucleolin to both sequences (Fig. 3B, lane 6, and supplemental Fig. S4, lane 8). We noted that a construct containing the N terminus plus the first half of the RBD appeared to weakly bind to the 5′-UTR sequence, but did not bind the 3′-UTR sequence (Fig. 3B, lane 4). These interactions were specific to these particular RNA sequences because full-length nucleolin failed to bind a control RNA sequence from the p53 coding sequence region (data not shown). We recently demonstrated that a region of double-stranded RNA containing complementary sequences from the 5′- and 3′-UTRs is critical for translational regulation of human p53 mRNA by RPL26 after stress (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate if NCL utilizes the same region for regulation, we performed Northwestern blotting with immunoprecipitated nucleolin and probed with labeled oligonucleotides representing the 21-base region of either the 5′- or 3′-UTR strands of the complementary region. Both the 5′- and 3′-UTR probes bound to the immunoprecipitated nucleolin protein (data not shown). One of the reported properties of nucleolin protein is that it binds both single- and double-stranded RNAs or DNAs and promotes base pairing of homologous or complementary nucleic acids (22.Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nucleolin is a matrix attachment region DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes a region with high base-unpairing potential.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23.Thyagarajan B. Lundberg R. Rafferty M. Campbell C. Nucleolin promotes homologous DNA pairing in vitro.Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24.Hanakahi L.A. Bu Z. Maizels N. The C-terminal domain of nucleolin accelerates nucleic acid annealing.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15493-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the 21-nucleotide regions of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs form a double-stranded RNA structure (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and because nucleolin appeared to bind independently to each of the sequences involved in forming this double-stranded region, we speculated that the binding of NCL to these sequences secures/enhances the interaction between UTRs in this region. To investigate whether the UTR base pairs participate in the translational repression of human p53 mRNA by NCL, we introduced point mutations to disrupt the last 3 bp (5M/3M) (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or the internal 3 bp (5IM/3W) of the UTR interaction region or to restore the last 3-bp interaction (5M/3C) (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As long as the UTR interaction remained intact (5W/3W and 5M/3C), the reporter responded to NCL repression (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the point mutations (5M/3M and 5IM/3W) that would partially disrupt the double-stranded structure in the UTR interaction region enhanced basal reporter expression levels, suggesting that the base pairs between UTRs are involved in regulating basal translation of human p53 mRNA. No alterations of reporter mRNA levels were detected in any samples (supplemental Fig. S5). We noted that nucleolin protein appeared to be able to form a homodimer (or homo-oligomer) (Fig. 4A). This dimerization did not require p53 mRNA because it was observed in H1299 cells, which lack p53 genes, and because the NCL interaction was stable in the presence of nucleases that digest both DNA and RNA (data not shown). Domain mapping of nucleolin protein demonstrated that the RBD was sufficient for this self-interaction (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the N terminus of nucleolin did not interact with the RBD, but its presence blunted nucleolin dimerization (Fig. 4B, middle and right panels). The C terminus of nucleolin did not appear to be involved in these interactions. We then investigated whether NCL dimerization/oligomerization is required for its repression of p53 translation. Both full-length NCL and its RBD were able to repress the expression of a luciferase reporter containing both p53 5′-UTR (145 nucleotides) and 3′-UTR (full-length) sequences, whereas NCL deletion mutants (N-terminal domain plus the first half of or full-length RBD) that failed to self-interact were unable to repress the reporter (Fig. 5). No alterations of luciferase reporter mRNA levels were observed (supplemental Fig. S6). In both cases (self-interaction and repression), the nucleolin N-terminal domain seemed to counter the function of its RBD, and we speculate that this could be due to either the highly negatively charged nature of the N-terminal domain in cells or the conformational change in the protein when the N-terminal domain is included. On the basis of reported observations that nucleolin can facilitate annealing of single-stranded nucleic acids (23.Thyagarajan B. Lundberg R. Rafferty M. Campbell C. Nucleolin promotes homologous DNA pairing in vitro.Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24.Hanakahi L.A. Bu Z. Maizels N. The C-terminal domain of nucleolin accelerates nucleic acid annealing.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15493-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and our observations that nucleolin independently bound to each component of the UTR interaction regions (Fig. 3B) and that nucleolin could form a homodimer (Fig. 4), a property associated with translational repression of p53 mRNA (Fig. 5), we hypothesized that nucleolin homodimers facilitate the formation or stability of a repressive double-stranded RNA structure. Because nucleolin directly binds to the same interacting 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences (Fig. 3B) that are critical for RPL26 recruitment to p53 mRNA after damage (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we explored the potential cooperation between nucleolin and RPL26 proteins in these interactions. Consistent with previous findings (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Isolation and proteomic characterization of the major proteins of the nucleolin-binding ribonucleoprotein complexes.Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we found that endogenous nucleolin and RPL26 proteins interacted with each other (Fig. 6A) and that RPL26 interacted with the RBD of nucleolin (Fig. 6B, left panel), the same domain involved in nucleolin homodimerization (Fig. 4B) and repression (Fig. 5). The N-terminal domain of nucleolin had no obvious effect on this interaction (Fig. 6B, right panel). The results of domain mapping experiments are summarized in Fig. 6C. Because RPL26 bound to the same domain of nucleolin protein as that involved in nucleolin homodimerization, we investigated if RPL26 could affect nucleolin homodimerization. RPL26 protein was able to compete with both full-length cotransfected GFP-nucleolin and endogenous nucleolin for binding to a FLAG-tagged RBD fragment (Fig. 6D), suggesting that RPL26 can inhibit nucleolin homodimerization. Finally, we explored the functional consequences of the interaction between RPL26 and nucleolin. Deletion analysis of RPL26 narrowed down the interaction region to 26 amino acids (positions 63–88) (Fig. 7A, left panels). These amino acids were also indispensible for p53 induction by RPL26 (Fig. 7A, right panels). Replacing amino acids 80–88 (the last 9 amino acids of the 26 amino acids) with alanine was sufficient to inhibit RPL26 and NCL interaction (Fig. 7B). This multiple-point mutant of RPL26 also reduced the ability to induce p53 protein when overexpressed (Fig. 7C) and the ability to bind endogenous p53 mRNA (Fig. 7D). We also observed that knocking down NCL attenuated the binding of nuclear RPL26 to biotin-labeled p53 mRNA in an in vitro RNA pulldown assay. 4J. Chen and M. B. Kastan, unpublished data. These data suggest that nucleolin-RPL26 interaction at least partially contributes to the binding of RPL26 to p53 mRNA and its regulation of the translation of the message. Expression of eukaryotic genes is tightly regulated at multiple levels, especially under stress conditions. Diverse RNA-binding proteins participate in the regulation of almost every aspect of the mRNA life cycle by binding to unique structures or sequences of the target RNA (15.Hall K.B. RNA-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Kishore S. Luber S. Zavolan M. Deciphering the role of RNA-binding proteins in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression.Brief. Funct. Genomics. 2010; 9: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions mediated by specific domains in the RNA-binding proteins increase the complexity of the regulation of gene expression. Here, we have presented evidence for both positive and negative translational control of human p53 mRNA by the multifunctional RNA-binding protein NCL and ribosomal protein L26. We proposed a model (supplemental Fig. S7) in which NCL binds to an intrinsic double-stranded RNA region formed by base pairing between the UTRs of human p53 mRNA in unstressed cells, and based on the reported ability of NCL to stabilize nucleic acid hybrids, dimerization/oligomerization of NCL facilitates the formation/stability of the above repressive double-stranded RNA structure. Stress stimulation results in recruitment of RPL26 to this double-stranded RNA structure occupied by NCL, which disrupts the NCL homodimer by forming NCL-RPL26 heterodimers and facilitates the translation of p53 mRNA. We suggest that this transition from NCL-NCL homodimer to NCL-RPL26 heterodimer occurs in the nucleus and represents an extraribosomal function of RPL26. At least two pieces of evidence support this suggestion. First, in vitro synthesized human p53 mRNA is able to bind RPL26 in nuclei in the absence of mature ribosomes, and this binding enrichment is enhanced by ionizing irradiation.4 Second, RPL26 is able to pull down endogenous human p53 mRNA from nuclear fractions, and the binding is increased in IR-treated cells (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because enhanced binding of RPL26 to p53 mRNA is a critical step for RPL26-dependent p53 induction and because it can occur in the nucleus after stress, RPL26 likely interacts with NCL and binds to p53 mRNA in the nucleus. p53 induction acts as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, elevated p53 protein levels initiate apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or senescence to restrain development of tumor cells. On the other hand, in certain settings, p53 induction is detrimental to normal tissue (27.Westphal C.H. Hoyes K.P. Canman C.E. Huang X. Kastan M.B. Hendry J.H. Leder P. Loss of atm radiosensitizes multiple p53 null tissues.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5637-5639PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, transiently blunting the potential detrimental effects of p53 induction could be beneficial in reducing p53-mediated cell death and tissue toxicity in settings of DNA damage or other stresses. Our study and previous investigations have demonstrated that translational regulation of p53 mRNA is a critical step in p53 induction under stress conditions. Several different aspects of this translational regulation could be potential targets for small molecule/drug interventions. The first is the UTR base pairing of p53 mRNA itself, which not only forms a closed structure to facilitate the repression of its own translation by nucleolin under unstressed conditions but also attracts RPL26 recruitment after stress stimuli. We have successfully designed targeting oligonucleotides to disrupt the UTR interaction region of human p53 mRNA, and these oligonucleotides blunt p53 induction and enhance cell survival after various stress stimuli by inhibiting RPL26 binding to p53 mRNA (2.Chen J. Kastan M.B. 5′-3′-UTR interactions regulate p53 mRNA translation and provide a target for modulating p53 induction after DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results reported here now support additional aspects of this regulatory mechanism that are potential targets for modulation of this response, including NCL-NCL, NCL-RPL26, and RPL26-p53 mRNA interactions. Although protein-protein interaction as a potential intervention point has been challenging due to large, featureless, or sporadic interaction surfaces, small molecules, peptides, or mimetics of protein structure have been developed as effective therapeutic reagents (28.Morelli X. Bourgeas R. Roche P. Chemical and structural lessons from recent successes in protein-protein interaction inhibition (2P2I).Curr. Opin. Chem.

Des. 2011; 17: 3713-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have narrowed down the region of RPL26 that interacts with NCL to 9 continuous amino acids, and mutation of these amino acids interferes with the binding of RPL26 to p53 mRNA as well as p53 induction (Fig. 7). Detailed structural studies of the interaction between these two proteins and with p53 mRNA could help in the design of inhibitors for this interaction. We thank Drs.

Therefore, a cascade of Rab function involving Rab11 and Rab8 is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic cells (14Das A. Guo W.

The targeting of secretory vesicles to specific domains of the plasma membrane is mediated by the exocyst, an octameric protein complex consisting of Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 (20Guo W.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the exocyst component Sec15p associates with secretory vesicles and interacts with the Rab GTPase Sec4p in its GTP-bound form (25Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. The exocyst is an effector for Sec4p, targeting secretory vesicles to sites of exocytosis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes, as Rab8, the homolog of Sec4p, was shown to interact directly with Sec15 (26Wu S. Mehta S.Q. Pichaud F. Bellen H.J. Quiocho F.A. Sec15 interacts with Rab11 via a novel domain and affects Rab11 localization in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the exocyst has been implicated in epithelial cystogenesis under the control of Rab8 (27Bryant D.M. Datta A. Rodríguez-Fraticelli A.E. Peränen J. Martín-Belmonte F. Mostov K.E. A molecular network for de novo generation of the apical surface and lumen.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, the exocyst functions together with Rab proteins to mediate vesicle docking and fusion at the plasma membrane. Recent studies have implicated the exocyst in primary cilium formation. It was shown that the exocyst component Sec8 localizes at the base of the primary cilium in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (28Rogers K.K. Wilson P.D. Snyder R.W. Zhang X. Guo W. Burrow C.R. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst localizes to the primary cilium in MDCK cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, another exocyst component, Sec10, led to longer primary cilia (29Zuo X. Guo W. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst protein Sec10 is necessary for primary ciliogenesis and cystogenesis in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2522-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The exocyst was also implicated in the deciliation-associated process (30Overgaard C.E. Sanzone K.M. Spiczka K.S. Sheff D.R. Sandra A. Yeaman C. Deciliation is associated with dramatic remodeling of epithelial cell junctions and surface domains.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, how the exocyst and the Rab proteins are coordinated during ciliogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate Rabin8 activity and interactions. We demonstrate that Rabin8 activation involves the relief of its autoinhibitory conformation. We further show that the exocyst component Sec15 directly interacts with Rabin8 in its activated conformation. A molecular network containing both the GEF (Rabin8) and effector (Sec15) of Rab8 plays important roles during primary ciliogenesis. hTERT-RPE1 cells were grown in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% FBS. For analysis of ciliogenesis, hTERT-RPE1 cells were grown overnight in medium containing 10% FBS and then starved for 48 h in Opti-MEM to induce cilium formation. Cilium length was measured and statistically analyzed using Student's t test. For transfection, the genes of interest (SEC15, SEC10NT, or RAB8A) were cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 or pJ3EGFP vector. 3Details of the constructs are available upon request. Plasmids were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The sequences used for the knockdown of SEC15 isoforms are 5′-AACAAGTGACGGATACTAATA-3′ and 5′-AAAGATATCATTCGATGTAGA-3′. The control luciferase siRNA target sequence is 5′-AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′. For siRNA treatment, cells were grown in DMEM and 10% FBS on coverslips. siRNA transfection was carried out in Opti-MEM with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells on coverslips were fixed 48–72 h after transfection. The remaining cells on plates were lysed for Western blot analysis. Mouse anti-His6 antibody was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Rabbit anti-Rab11 antibody was from US Biological (Swampscott, MA). Mouse anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 and rabbit anti-transferrin receptor antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-acetylated α-tubulin monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-γ-tubulin polyclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-Glu-tubulin antibody was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 for immunofluorescence were purchased from Invitrogen. The NusA-His6-Rab8a fusion protein was expressed in the pET43 vector as described previously (31Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peränen J.

Peränen J. Purification and functional properties of a Rab8-specific GEF (Rabin3) in action remodeling and polarized transport.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The NusA-His6-Rab8a fusion protein was purified from bacteria with TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). The generation of Rabin8 fusion proteins was as described previously (10Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in pGEX vectors in bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The beads were then washed four times with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) and used directly for in vitro binding assays. Sec15 was expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine using a TnT Quick kit (Promega). The translation products were then incubated with protein-coupled glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing four times with binding buffer, the bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and the protein bands were visualized by phosphorimaging. To examine the interaction between Rabin8 and Rab11, His6-Rab11a was expressed in pET32a. The purified proteins were dialyzed overnight with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Purified Rab11a was incubated with GST-Rabin8 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in binding buffer containing GTPγS for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After four washes with binding buffer, bound Rab11 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against the His6 epitope. The binding of GST-Rab8 fusion proteins to in vitro translated Rabin8 or Rabin8Δ(300–305) was carried out under the same conditions as described above except that Rab8 was preloaded with 50 μm GDPβS. Rab8 was cleaved from the NusA-His6-Rab8a fusion protein using thrombin. GST-Rabin8 and GST-Rabin8Δ(300–305) were expressed and purified as described above, and GST was removed using thrombin. The GEF activity of Rabin8 or Rabin8Δ(300–305) toward Rab8 was determined as previously described (10Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Data were statistically analyzed using Student's t test (n = 3). For Sec15, Rab11, and transferrin receptor staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. For cilium staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, followed by fixation with ice-cold methanol for 3 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked in PBS with 3% BSA, and incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies. In yeast, Sec15p was shown to interact with Sec2p, the GEF for the Rab protein Sec4p involved in exocytosis (33Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. Sec2p mediates nucleotide exchange on Sec4p and is involved in polarized delivery of post-Golgi vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the interaction between human Sec15 and Rabin8. GST-Rabin8 fusions with serial deletions at the C terminus were constructed (Fig. 1A). These Rabin8 fusion proteins were conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and used to perform binding assays with in vitro translated [35S]-methionine-labeled Sec15 or NusA-His6-tagged Rab11a. Sec15 interacted with a Rabin8 fragment lacking the C-terminal 130 amino acids; full-length Rabin8 (amino acids 1–460) and Rabin8 (amino acids 1–400) had much weaker interactions with Sec15 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the region of Rabin8 containing amino acids 262–331 was sufficient to bind Sec15 (supplemental Fig. S1). This region is adjacent to the coiled-coil domain (amino acids 84–255) of Rabin8, which mediates guanine nucleotide exchange of Rab8 (the GEF domain) (34Dong G. Medkova M. Novick P. Reinisch K.M. A catalytic coiled coil: structural insights into the activation of the Rab GTPase Sec4p by Sec2p.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 455-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Sato Y. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Crystal structure of the Sec4p-Sec2p complex in the nucleotide-exchanging intermediate state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The same region of Rabin8 that mediates Sec15 binding was also critical for the interaction with the GTP-bound form of Rab11 (Fig. 1B) (10Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, Rab11a bound to full-length Rabin8, whereas Sec15 interacted better with the C-terminally truncated form of Rabin8. Therefore, the C terminus of Rabin8 probably blocks its interaction with Sec15. To understand the mechanisms of Rabin8 activation, we first sought to identify the key residues in Rabin8 that are needed for its interaction with Rab11. Because Rabin8 and yeast Sec2p both interact with the upstream Rab proteins (i.e. Rab11 and Ypt32p) through their C-terminal halves, we compared the sequences of Rabin8 and Sec2p located C-terminal to their GEF domains (Fig. 2A). The overall sequence conservation is very low, and secondary structure prediction suggested that this region is mostly unstructured. However, a small region of six amino acids (SLYNEF) is identical between Rabin8 and Sec2p. Moreover, this stretch is predicted to form part of an α-helix. In many cases, α-helix structures have been found to constitute part of the Rab interaction site for Rab effector proteins. Thus, we made a deletion mutant of Rabin8, Rabin8Δ(300–305), and tested its protein interactions. As shown in Fig. 2B, Rabin8Δ(300–305) indeed had much reduced binding to Rab11. However, it had a stronger interaction with Sec15 compared with wild-type Rabin8 (Fig. 2B). The dose-dependent binding of Sec15 to Rabin8Δ(300–305) is shown in Fig. 2C. Quantification of wild-type Rabin8 binding to activated Rab11 (Rab11(Q70L)) is shown in Fig. 2D. The Kd for binding was ∼54 μm. Because Rabin8 is the GEF protein that interacts with the GDP-bound form of Rab8, we examined the interaction of Rabin8Δ(300–305) with GDP-loaded Rab8 or the Rab8(T22N) mutant. Compared with wild-type Rabin8, the Rabin8Δ(300–305) mutant had enhanced binding to both forms of Rab8 (Fig. 2E). Next, we examined whether the deletion mutant affects the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab8. Purified Rab8a was preloaded with [3H]GDP, and the nucleotide dissociation was monitored over time (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2F, Rabin8 promoted the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rab8a, consistent with previous reports (10Knödler A. Feng S. Zhang J. Zhang X. Das A. Peränen J. Guo W. Coordination of Rab8 and Rab11 in primary ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 31Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peränen J.

Peränen J. Purification and functional properties of a Rab8-specific GEF (Rabin3) in action remodeling and polarized transport.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The addition of Rabin8Δ(300–305) led to a even faster dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rab8a compared with wild-type Rabin8. This is consistent with the observation that Rabin8Δ(300–305) bound better to Rab8 than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2E). The deletion of amino acids 300–305 may cause conformational changes that relieve the self-inhibition of Rabin8, allowing its subsequent interaction with Rab8 and Sec15. In addition to affecting the GEF activity, the interaction of GTP-bound Rab11a with Rabin8 also mediates the recruitment of Rabin8 to the recycling endosomes (11Westlake C.J. Baye L.M. Nachury M.V. Wright K.J. Ervin K.E. Phu L. Chalouni C. Beck J.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Slusarski D.C. Sheffield V.C. Scheller R.H. Jackson P.K. Primary cilium membrane assembly is initiated by Rab11 and transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) complex-dependent trafficking of Rabin8 to the centrosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the localization of Rabin8Δ(300–305) in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Wild-type Rabin8 co-localized with endogenous Rab11a in the perinuclear region. However, Rabin8Δ(300–305) was mostly diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). The same pattern of localization was observed with the constitutively activated form of Rab11a expressed in the cell (supplemental Fig. S2). This observation suggests that the loss of interaction of Rabin8 with GTP-bound Rab11 results in its dissociation from the membranes, where it is thought to carry out its function in activating Rab8 during exocytosis. We also noticed a slight difference in the distribution of Rab11a in cells expressing Rabin8Δ(300–305), suggesting that this mutant somewhat affected the morphology of the recycling endosomes. Finally, hTERT-RPE1 cells expressing the Rabin8Δ(300–305) mutant had slightly shorter primary cilia compared with cells expressing wild-type Rabin8 (supplemental Fig. S3). It is possible that, although the Rabin8Δ(300–305) protein is more active in vitro, the lack of its localization in the recycling endosomes compromises its function in the cell. Recent studies have demonstrated that both Rab8 and Rabin8 are important regulators of primary ciliogenesis (7Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K.

Egerer J. Fuchs E. Haas A.K. Barr F.A. Functional dissection of Rab GTPases involved in primary cilium formation.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because Sec15 interacts with both Rab8 and Rabin8, we examined whether Sec15 is localized to primary cilia. Using a monoclonal antibody against Sec15, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy in quiescent hTERT-RPE1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, similar to Rab8, Sec15 was localized along the primary cilia. In addition, comparison of Sec15 localization with respect to Glu-tubulin (detyrosinated α-tubulin, a marker of primary cilia) and γ-tubulin (a marker of basal bodies) further confirmed its ciliary localization. To test the possible role of the exocyst in ciliogenesis, we generated siRNA oligonucleotides targeting human SEC15. Human SEC15 has three isoforms, so we used mixed siRNA oligonucleotides targeting all of them. These oligonucleotides knocked down SEC15 in hTERT-RPE1 cells by 55% as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). We then examined the formation of primary cilia in these cells by immunostaining with an antibody against acetylated α-tubulin, a marker for primary cilia. The average length of primary cilia in the luciferase siRNA-treated cells was 3.4 ± 0.4 μm (n = 60). The cilia in cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides against SEC15 were significantly shorter (2.3 ± 0.5 μm, n = 60; p < 0.01). We were not able to perform RNAi rescue experiments because expression of Sec15 in cells had a strong dominant-negative effect as discussed below. To complement the RNAi experiment, we also used a dominant-negative approach to inhibit the function of Sec15. It was shown previously that overexpression of an N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–370) of Sec10 (Sec10NT) blocked the proper assembly of Sec15 to the exocyst complex (37Roth D. Guo W. Novick P. Dominant-negative alleles of SEC10 reveal distinct domains involved in secretion and morphogenesis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1725-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. The exocyst complex associates with microtubules to mediate vesicle targeting and neurite outgrowth.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-Sec10NT was expressed in hTERT-RPE1 cells. We found that cells transfected with GFP-Sec10NT had much shorter primary cilia (0.9 ± 0.4 μm, n = 45) than the untransfected cells (3.5 ± 0.6 μm, n = 60; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, B and C). In some cases, the primary cilia were not even detectable in the Sec10NT-overexpressing cells. In yeast cells, overexpression of the exocyst component Sec15p leads to intracellular accumulation and clustering of secretory vesicles and a block of exocytosis (39Salminen A. Novick P.J. The Sec15 protein responds to the function of the GTP-binding protein Sec4 to control vesicular traffic in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells, overexpression of Sec15 leads to accumulation and clustering of Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, and membrane trafficking from the recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane is blocked (40Zhang X.M. Ellis S. Sriratana A. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Sec15 is an effector for the Rab11 GTPase in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43027-43034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for Sec15-induced vesicle clustering remains elusive, it was speculated that the vesicle docking property of Sec15 led to the clustering of vesicles upon overexpression conditions (39Salminen A. Novick P.J. The Sec15 protein responds to the function of the GTP-binding protein Sec4 to control vesicular traffic in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this observation, we overexpressed GFP-Sec15 in hTERT-RPE1 cells and examined whether ciliogenesis is affected. As shown in Fig. 6A (upper panels), the recycling endosomes, as detected by the staining of endogenous Rab11, were abnormally concentrated in the cytoplasm in Sec15-transfected cells. The labeling of endogenous Rab11 was much brighter compared with untransfected cells in the same field. In addition, GFP-Sec15 co-localized with the transferrin receptor in the cell (Fig. 6A, lower panels), and recycling of the endocytosed transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane was blocked in hTERT-RPE1 cells (supplemental Fig. S4), similar to the observation made by Zhang et al. (40Zhang X.M. Ellis S. Sriratana A. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Sec15 is an effector for the Rab11 GTPase in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43027-43034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells. The cilia in GFP-Sec15-overexpressing cells were much shorter (1.0 ± 0.7 μm, n = 60) than those in the untransfected cells (3.4 ± 0.5 μm, n = 60; p < 0.01) in the same field or in cells transfected with GFP-Sec8 used as a control (3.3 ± 0.8 μm, n = 60, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest that Sec15 overexpression affects vesicular trafficking from the recycling endosomes and blocks the formation of primary cilia. Our work suggests a molecular mechanism for Rabin8 activation. Full-length Rabin8 likely has a self-inhibitory conformation. The conserved sequence SLYNEF functions as a “latch” that keeps Rabin8 in its closed conformation. We speculate that the GTP-bound Rab11 interacts with this region and may remove the latch and thus expose its GEF domain to catalyze the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rab8 and for its subsequent interactions with other proteins such as Sec15. It is unlikely that removal of the C terminus of Rabin8 or deletion of the SLYNEF sequence renders Rabin8 “sticky” because these mutants actually lost their binding to Rab11 but increased their interactions with Sec15 and Rab8. In cells, the Rabin8 mutant with the SLYNEF sequence deleted (Rabin8Δ(300–305), Rab11 binding-deficient) was diffused in the cytoplasm rather than associated with the vesicles, consistent with the role of Rab11 in the recruitment of Rabin8 to the vesicular carriers (11Westlake C.J. Baye L.M. Nachury M.V. Wright K.J. Ervin K.E. Phu L. Chalouni C. Beck J.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Slusarski D.C. Sheffield V.C. Scheller R.H. Jackson P.K. Primary cilium membrane assembly is initiated by Rab11 and transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) complex-dependent trafficking of Rabin8 to the centrosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mislocalization of Rabin8Δ(300–305) in cells also makes functional studies of this “gain-of-function” mutant difficult. A recent study demonstrated that Sec2p interacts with phosphatidylinositides on the membranes of secretory vesicles in addition to its interaction with GTP-Ypt32p; the interactions of Sec2p with both phosphatidylinositides and GTP-Ypt32p mediate the recruitment of Sec2p to the vesicles (13Mizuno-Yamasaki E. Medkova M. Coleman J. Novick P. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate controls both membrane recruitment and a regulatory switch of the Rab GEF Sec2p.Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is possible that the phosphatidylinositide interaction also affects Ypt32p/Rab11 binding to Sec2p/Rabin8. Future crystallization of Rabin8 may provide important structural insights into the molecular details of Rabin8 activation. Activated Rabin8 mediates the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rab8 and subsequent effector recruitment. Pioneering studies by Novick and colleagues delineated a molecular pathway for polarized exocytosis in the budding yeast. In this pathway, the Rab protein Sec4p (Rab8 homolog) is activated by its GEF Sec2p (Rabin8 homolog) (33Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. Sec2p mediates nucleotide exchange on Sec4p and is involved in polarized delivery of post-Golgi vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Sec15p then binds to the GTP-bound form of Sec4p (25Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. The exocyst is an effector for Sec4p, targeting secretory vesicles to sites of exocytosis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Sec15p also binds to Sec2p; a Sec2p truncation mutant missing its C terminus binds more strongly to Sec15p (36Medkova M. France Y.E. Coleman J. Novick P. The Rab exchange factor Sec2p reversibly associates with the exocyst.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2757-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data described above indicate that the region of Rabin8 (amino acids 262–331) adjacent to the GEF domain is responsible for binding to both its upstream activator, Rab11, and Sec15. However, the modes of interaction of these two proteins with Rabin8 are different. Whereas GTP-Rab11 binds to full-length Rabin8, Sec15 binds more strongly to the C-terminally truncated version of Rabin8. It is likely that GTP-Rab11 first binds to and alleviates the autoinhibition of Rabin8, allowing Rabin8 to bind Sec15. Our data suggest that the GEF-Rab-effector interactions are conserved in the mammalian cells for exocytosis. This type of GEF-Rab-effector interaction has also been observed in other stages of membrane trafficking. A well studied example is the Rabaptin-5-Rabex-5 complex, which contains both the GEF and effector of Rab5; the concomitant Rab5 activation and effector function are required for early endosomal docking and fusion (41Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M.

Delayed onset of positive feedback activation of Rab5 by Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 in endocytosis.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Rab5 positive feedback loop may serve to convey sensitivity and precision for the activation of Rab5 on endosomes. Previous studies demonstrated that Sec15 also interacts with Rab11 on the recycling endosomes (26Wu S. Mehta S.Q. Pichaud F. Bellen H.J. Quiocho F.A.

Exocyst requirement for endocytic traffic directed toward the apical and basolateral poles of polarized MDCK cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3978-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although future studied are needed to elucidate the implications of these interactions, we speculate that the binding of Sec15 to both Rab11 and Rab8 serves to coordinate vesicle budding from the recycling endosomes and vesicle tethering at the plasma membrane. Whereas the GEF-Rab8-effector interaction network is important in yeast for polarized daughter cell growth, this network can be utilized in mammalian cells in processes such as primary ciliogenesis. Inhibition of Rab8 and Rabin8 function by RNAi or dominant-negative mutants was shown to block primary ciliogenesis (7Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K.

Here, we have shown that disruption of the proper function of Sec15 leads to a block of endosomal recycling and impaired ciliogenesis. In summary, our study suggests a mechanism of Rabin8 activation and demonstrates a molecular network containing both the GEF and effector of Rab8 that plays important roles in primary ciliogenesis. Future studies will provide more insights into the functions of the exocyst and the Rab proteins in primary ciliogenesis and shed light on the etiologies of ciliopathies. We thank Drs.

Protein inclusions comprised of N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin are a characteristic feature of disease, though are likely to play a protective role rather than a causative one in neurodegeneration. Soluble oligomeric assemblies of huntingtin formed early in the aggregation process are candidate toxic species in HD. In the present study, we established an in vitro system to generate recombinant huntingtin in mammalian cells. Using both denaturing and native gel analysis, we have identified novel oligomeric forms of mammalian-derived expanded huntingtin exon-1 N-terminal fragment. These species are transient and were not previously detected using bacterially expressed exon-1 protein. Importantly, these species are recognized by 3B5H10, an antibody that recognizes a two-stranded hairpin conformation of expanded polyglutamine believed to be associated with a toxic form of huntingtin. Interestingly, comparable oligomeric species were not observed for expanded huntingtin shortstop, a 117-amino acid fragment of huntingtin shown previously in mammalian cell lines and transgenic mice, and here in primary cortical neurons, to be non-toxic. Further, we demonstrate that expanded huntingtin shortstop has a reduced ability to form amyloid-like fibrils characteristic of the aggregation pathway for toxic expanded polyglutamine proteins. Taken together, these data provide a possible candidate toxic species in HD. In addition, these studies demonstrate the fundamental differences in early aggregation events between mutant huntingtin exon-1 and shortstop proteins that may underlie the differences in toxicity.

HD is characterized by the deposition of large intracellular protein aggregates, or inclusion bodies, comprised of N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt. In HD, there is a strong correlation between polyQ repeat length and the threshold for aggregation and disease (4Duyao M. Ambrose C. Myers R. Novelletto A. Persichetti F. Frontali M. Folstein S.

The serendipitous development of an HD transgenic mouse expressing human Htt truncated at amino acid 117 by a stop codon, and referred to as shortstop, provided additional support for these earlier observations. Despite the formation of frequent and widespread inclusions, expanded Htt shortstop transgenic mice displayed no evidence of behavioral abnormalities or neurodegeneration observed for other HD transgenic mouse models (13Slow E.J.

At present, formation of inclusions is thought to represent a cellular protective response to aggregation (15Ross C.A.

These data provide evidence for Htt oligomers in vivo and support the idea that soluble oligomeric forms of expanded Htt could play a role in HD pathogenesis. While expanded Htt exon-1 aggregation has been studied extensively in vitro, previous studies have been carried out with bacterially expressed protein. Aggregation of expanded Htt shortstop has not yet been investigated in vitro. In the present study, we have established an in vitro system to generate recombinant Htt exon-1 and shortstop proteins in mammalian cells. To investigate the biochemistry of early stages of Htt exon-1 and shortstop aggregation in vitro, we have used both SDS-PAGE and Blue native-PAGE, a non-denaturing gel analysis system carried out in the absence of SDS. Using these techniques, we have found differences in SDS-stable and native soluble oligomeric aggregation species detected for toxic expanded Htt exon-1 and non-toxic expanded Htt shortstop. In parallel, we have carried out cell toxicity analysis of Htt exon-1 and shortstop proteins in cultured primary cortical neurons and show that expanded Htt shortstop is not toxic. Taken together, these data confirm that expanded Htt shortstop is not toxic and suggest a possible mechanism via differences in oligomer formation during early aggregation events. To generate Htt exon-1 44Q for expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein in HEK293-FT cells, a cDNA insert was subcloned from pMAL Htt exon-1 44Q bacterial expression construct (22Poirier M.A. Li H.

Htt shortstop 44Q was prepared by cloning a synthetic DNA fragment into the modified pEBG-2T vector using BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Htt exon-1 and shortstop constructs with wild-type (9Q) and expanded (82Q) polyQ regions used for cell toxicity studies and confocal microscopy analysis in primary cortical neurons were prepared as previously described (14Ratovitski T.

Antibodies used for SDS- and Blue native-PAGE include anti-Htt exon-1 (1:2000), MW1 (1:10,000), 3B5H10 (1:2000), anti-Htt amino acid 1–17 (anti-Htt aa 1–17; 1:2500), and anti-Htt amino acid 81–90 (anti-Htt aa 81–90; 1:5000). Anti-Htt exon-1, a goat polyclonal antibody, was generated against an Htt exon-1 internal deletion mutant as previously described (28Peters M.F. Ross C.A.

Anti-goat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare and used at a concentration of 1:5000. For immunocytochemistry studies, a mouse monoclonal IgG generated against Htt amino acids 1–82 (anti-Htt 1–82) was obtained from Millipore and used at a concentration of 1:1500, followed by an anti-mouse-cy3 secondary antibody (1:300). HEK293-FT cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA, Invitrogen), 6 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm MEM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml geneticin. Twenty-four hours prior to tranfection, cells were seeded to obtain a final confluency of 80–90% in medium lacking geneticin. Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using standard manufacturer's protocols, with the exception that cells were transfected in HEK293-FT maintenance medium lacking geneticin, rather than in Opti-Minimal Essential Medium, and that transfection reagent/DNA mixtures were not removed until the cells were harvested 48 h following transfection. HEK293-FT cells transfected with pEBG-2T Htt exon-1 and shortstop plasmids were washed twice with cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1.7 K RPM for 5 min 48 h after transfection. For preparation of GST-Htt fusion proteins under native conditions, cells were resuspended with lysis buffer (1× PBS pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm AEBSF, Complete, mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/17 ml, Roche), and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and clarified by centrifugation at 15K RPM for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble material was added to a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed once with 1 column volume of wash buffer I (1× PBS pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 5 mm ATP, followed by 2 column volumes of wash buffer I without ATP. GST-Htt fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm reduced glutathione, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted GST-Htt exon-1 and shortstop fusion proteins were dialyzed against thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and quantified using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. For preparation of GST-fusion proteins under denaturing conditions, HEK293-FT cell extracts were dialyzed overnight against denaturing equilibration buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine-HCl, pH 7.0). The dialysate was then passed over a talon metal affinity column (Clonetech) and eluted with 45 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 270 mm NaCl, 5.4 m guanidine-HCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Eluted GST-Htt fusion proteins were then dialyzed in a stepwise manner against thrombin cleavage buffer with decreasing amounts of imidazole (5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 m, 1 h per buffer exchange). A final dialysis step in thrombin cleavage buffer (0 mm imidazole) involved two buffer exchanges lasting 2 h each, followed by a final buffer exchange that continued overnight. To remove the GST tag and initiate aggregation of expanded GST-Htt fusion proteins, 0.1 μg/μl of purified fusion protein was incubated at room temperature with thrombin (10 units/50 μg fusion protein). To terminate the cleavage reaction, aliquots were removed over a 10-day period and either flash-frozen in liquid N2 (for transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy), treated with SDS sample buffer (SDS-PAGE), or treated with Blue native sample buffer (Blue native-PAGE). For SDS-PAGE/Western blotting analysis, samples prepared in SDS sample buffer were resolved on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to nitrocellulose using the Bio-Rad Mini Protean system. For Blue native-PAGE/Western blotting analysis, samples prepared in Blue native sample buffer were resolved on a 3–12% (Htt exon-1 44Q) or 4–16% (Htt shortstop 44Q) Bis-Tris gel and transferred to PVDF (Immobilon P, Millipore) using the Invitrogen system. Htt exon-1 and shortstop aggregation reactions were carried out as described above. For each time point analyzed, a 5-μl aliquot was removed, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Prior to imaging, freshly thawed aliquots were diluted to a concentration of 0.01 μg/μl, applied to a 400 mesh carbon and parlodion-coated copper grid (Polysciences), and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate-0.04% tylose. Grids were viewed on a Hitachi H-7600 transmission electron microscope and digitally captured using an Advanced Microscopy Techniques CCD at 1k × 1k resolution. Samples were deposited on freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA). Aliquots of 2.5 μl of Htt exon-1 and shortstop 44Q aggregation time course samples (0 h, 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, and 10 d) were deposited onto the mica surface and left on the substrate for ∼1 min. The substrate was then washed with 200 μl of ultrapure water. To prevent damage to any fragile aggregates, the substrate was tilted ∼45°, and the ultrapure water was applied above the sample, providing a gentle flow over the deposited sample. The sample was dried with a gentle stream of canned compressed gas. Deposited samples were then imaged ex situ with a Nanoscope V MultiMode scanning probe microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a closed-loop vertical engage J-scanner. Images were taken with a diving board-shaped oxide-sharpened silicon cantilever (μmasch, San Jose, CA) with a nominal spring constant of 40 N/m and resonance frequency of 325 kHz. Scan rates were set at 1–2 Hz with cantilever drive frequencies 10% below resonance. AFM images were analyzed using Matlab equipped with the image processing toolbox (Mathworks, Natick, MA) as described (31Burke K.A. Godbey J. Legleiter J. Assessing mutant huntingtin fragment and polyglutamine aggregation by atomic force microscopy.Methods. 2011; 53: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Images were imported into Matlab, and a flattening algorithm was applied to correct for curvature from the imaging process. A binary map of the location of aggregates was created using a height threshold. Discrete aggregates were located by applying pattern recognition algorithms to the binary map and finally physical properties (including height, volume, and average diameter) were measured automatically. Volume measurements were partially corrected for error associated with the finite size of the AFM probe based on geometric models (32Legleiter J. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. In situ AFM studies of astrocyte-secreted apolipoprotein E- and J-containing lipoproteins.J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004; 278: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These corrected volume measurements were used to estimate the molecular weight of observed aggregates based on the average density of proteins (33Squire P.G. Himmel M.E. Hydrodynamics and protein hydration.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Gekko K. Noguchi H. Compressibility of globular proteins in water of 25 °C.J. Phys. Chem. 1979; 83: 2707-2714Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The number of molecules per each oligomer was estimated by dividing the observed corrected volume of each individual aggregate by the estimated volume of a single monomer. This calculation assumes perfect packing of individual monomers within the oligomer and that the density of the proteins is the same in aggregated and non-aggregated forms. Primary cortical neurons isolated from embryonic day 17 mice as previously described (35Poirier M.A. Jiang H. Ross C.A.

After 24, 36, and 48 h, cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After three washes with PBS, cells were treated with 0.8 μg/ml of bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342, Sigma) and stained with anti-Htt 1–82 monoclonal antibody (1:1500), followed by Alexa fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:2000). Cells were automatically analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) and images were digitized from 144 independent fields per well. Transfected cells were visualized by immunostaining with anti-Htt 1–82 antibody and quantified for cell survival using the Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) by automated measurement of the average intensity of Hoechst-stained nuclei of transfected cells. Cells were considered as viable when their intensity was lower than 200% of the control intensity. Data reported are an average (± S.E.) of six independent experiments. For confocal microscopy analysis, primary neurons were transfected with Htt exon-1 and shortstop constructs at DIV6, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stained with anti-Htt 1–82, Alexa fluor 488, and bisbenzimide as described above. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. For these studies, we prepared GST-tagged Htt fusion protein constructs encoding exon-1 (amino acids 1–90) and shortstop (amino acids 1–117) with a pathological length (44Q) polyQ region for expression in HEK293FT cells (Fig. 1A). These constructs were designed with an N-terminal GST tag, which allows for expression and native purification of soluble expanded Htt protein,"
https://openalex.org/W2085493674,"CD44 is a multifunctional cell receptor that conveys a cancer phenotype, regulates macrophage inflammatory gene expression and vascular gene activation in proatherogenic environments, and is also a marker of many cancer stem cells. CD44 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages that produce an intracytoplasmic domain called CD44-ICD. However, the role of CD44-ICD in cell function is unknown. We take a major step toward the elucidation of the CD44-ICD function by using a CD44-ICD-specific antibody, a modification of a ChIP assay to detect small molecules, and extensive computational analysis. We show that CD44-ICD translocates into the nucleus, where it then binds to a novel DNA consensus sequence in the promoter region of the MMP-9 gene to regulate its expression. We also show that the expression of many other genes that contain this novel response element in their promoters is up- or down-regulated by CD44-ICD. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif1α)-responsive genes also have the CD44-ICD consensus sequence and respond to CD44-ICD induction under normoxic conditions and therefore independent of Hif1α expression. Additionally, CD44-ICD early responsive genes encode for critical enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, revealing how CD44 could be a gatekeeper of the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) in cancer cells and possibly cancer stem cells. The link of CD44 to metabolism is novel and opens a new area of research not previously considered, particularly in the study of obesity and cancer. In summary, our results finally give a function to the CD44-ICD and will accelerate the study of the regulation of many CD44-dependent genes."

https://openalex.org/W2138728991,"The white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora delignifies lignocellulose with high selectivity, but until now it has appeared to lack the specialized peroxidases, termed lignin peroxidases (LiPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs), that are generally thought important for ligninolysis. We screened the recently sequenced C. subvermispora genome for genes that encode peroxidases with a potential ligninolytic role. A total of 26 peroxidase genes was apparent after a structural-functional classification based on homology modeling and a search for diagnostic catalytic amino acid residues. In addition to revealing the presence of nine heme-thiolate peroxidase superfamily members and the unexpected absence of the dye-decolorizing peroxidase superfamily, the search showed that the C. subvermispora genome encodes 16 class II enzymes in the plant-fungal-bacterial peroxidase superfamily, where LiPs and VPs are classified. The 16 encoded enzymes include 13 putative manganese peroxidases and one generic peroxidase but most notably two peroxidases containing the catalytic tryptophan characteristic of LiPs and VPs. We expressed these two enzymes in Escherichia coli and determined their substrate specificities on typical LiP/VP substrates, including nonphenolic lignin model monomers and dimers, as well as synthetic lignin. The results show that the two newly discovered C. subvermispora peroxidases are functionally competent LiPs and also suggest that they are phylogenetically and catalytically intermediate between classical LiPs and VPs. These results offer new insight into selective lignin degradation by C. subvermispora."

However, previous data from our laboratory have shown that LRP5 and LRP6 are co-expressed in mammary basal cells and that LRP6 is active, leading us to question why LRP6 is insufficient to mediate canonical signaling in the absence of LRP5. Here, we show that at endogenous levels of LRP5 and LRP6 both receptors are required to signal in response to some Wnt ligands both in vitro (in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells) and in vivo (in mammary outgrowths). This subgroup of canonical ligands includes Wnt1, Wnt9b, and Wnt10b; the latter two are expressed in mammary gland. In contrast, the ligand commonly used experimentally, Wnt3a, prefers LRP6 and requires just one receptor regardless of cellular context. When either LRP5 or LRP6 is overexpressed, signaling remains ligand-dependent, but the requirement for both receptors is abrogated (regardless of ligand type). We have documented an LRP5-6 heteromer using immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST) immunoprecipitation. Together, our data imply that under physiological conditions some Wnt ligands require both receptors to be present to generate a canonical signal. We have designed a model to explain our results based on the resistance of LRP5-6 heteromers to a selective inhibitor of E1/2-binding Wnt-LRP6 interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2011757599,"The Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) plays central roles in cellular chloride homeostasis and in epithelial salt transport, but to date little is known about the mechanism by which the transporter moves ions across the membrane. We examined the functional role of transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) in NKCC1 using cysteine- and tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis and analyzed our results in the context of a structural homology model based on an alignment of NKCC1 with other amino acid polyamine organocation superfamily members, AdiC and ApcT. Mutations of residues along one face of TM3 (Tyr-383, Met-382, Ala-379, Asn-376, Ala-375, Phe-372, Gly-369, and Ile-368) had large effects on translocation rate, apparent ion affinities, and loop diuretic affinity, consistent with a proposed role of TM3 in the translocation pathway. The prediction that Met-382 is part of an extracellular gate that closes to form an occluded state is strongly supported by conformational sensitivity of this residue to 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate, and the bumetanide insensitivity of M382W is consistent with tryptophan blocking entry of bumetanide into the cavity. Substitution effects on residues at the intracellular end of TM3 suggest that this region is also involved in ion coordination and may be part of the translocation pathway in an inward-open conformation. Mutations of predicted pore residues had large effects on binding of bumetanide and furosemide, consistent with the hypothesis that loop diuretic drugs bind within the translocation cavity. The results presented here strongly support predictions of homology models of NKCC1 and demonstrate important roles for TM3 residues in ion translocation and loop diuretic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1984281474,"Vacuolar protein sorting 30 (Vps30)/autophagy-related protein 6 (Atg6) is a common component of two distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes. In complex I, Atg14 links Vps30 to Vps34 lipid kinase and exerts its specific role in autophagy, whereas in complex II, Vps38 links Vps30 to Vps34 and plays a crucial role in vacuolar protein sorting. However, the molecular role of Vps30 in each pathway remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of Vps30. The structure is a novel globular fold comprised of three β-sheet-α-helix repeats. Truncation analyses showed that the domain is dispensable for the construction of both complexes, but is specifically required for autophagy through the targeting of complex I to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Thus, the domain is named the β-α repeated, autophagy-specific (BARA) domain. On the other hand, the N-terminal region of Vps30 was shown to be specifically required for vacuolar protein sorting. These structural and functional investigations of Vps30 domains, which are also conserved in the mammalian ortholog, Beclin 1, will form the basis for studying the molecular functions of this protein family in various biological processes."

Although conformational activation of the ERM protein is mediated by the membrane PIP2, the known properties of the two described PIP2-binding sites do not explain activation. To elucidate the structural basis of possible mechanisms, we generated informative moesin mutations and tested three attributes: membrane localization of the expressed moesin, moesin binding to PIP2, and PIP2-induced release of moesin autoinhibition. The results demonstrate for the first time that the POCKET containing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate on crystal structure (the “POCKET” Lys-63, Lys-278 residues) mediates all three functions. Furthermore the second described PIP2-binding site (the “PATCH,” Lys-253/Lys-254, Lys-262/Lys-263) is also essential for all three functions. In native autoinhibited ERM proteins, the POCKET is a cavity masked by an acidic linker, which we designate the “FLAP.” Analysis of three mutant moesin constructs predicted to influence FLAP function demonstrated that the FLAP is a functional autoinhibitory region. Moreover, analysis of the cooperativity and stoichiometry demonstrate that the PATCH and POCKET do not bind PIP2 simultaneously. Based on our data and supporting published data, we propose a model of progressive activation of autoinhibited moesin by a single PIP2 molecule in the membrane.

The structure of the ERM protein consists of three functional regions: 1) a ∼300 amino acid N-terminal compound FERM domain (consisting of lobes A, B, and C); 2) a ∼200 amino acid linker region that is mostly α-helical; and 3) a ∼70 amino acid C-terminal tail (Fig. 1A). ERM proteins undergo conformational inter-conversion between an active conformation and an inactive conformation. In the active conformation (Fig. 1B) the ERM protein is located at the membrane where the FERM domain binds to multiple ligands, the linker region is an extended helix, and the C-terminal tail binds to actin cytoskeleton. FERM binding to protein ligands occurs via two binding sites: a “hydrophobic groove,” which binds to tails of transmembrane proteins, such as CD44 (5.Mori T. Kitano K. Terawaki S. Maesaki R.

Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A major challenge is to understand the mechanism(s) that mediates conformational activation of the ERM protein. Binding to membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is understood to be the dominant mode of activation of ERM. Tsukita and colleagues (12.Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M.

To test whether PIP2 was able to activate the ERM protein they tested whether PIP2 influenced binding of the ERM protein to CD44. They showed that PIP2 induces conformational activation of ERM proteins, which enables them to bind to CD44. PIP2 binding to ERM proteins and their activation is critical to their localization and function at the membrane. This was first proven by studies showing impaired ERM localization at the membrane caused by microinjection of the polyphosphoinositide-binding agent neomycin (13.Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Rho-dependent and -independent activation mechanisms of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins. An essential role for polyphosphoinositides in vivo.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2569-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later confirmed by acute reduction of membrane PIP2 (14.Hao J.J. Liu Y. Kruhlak M. Debell K.E. Rellahan B.L. Shaw S. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 releases ERM proteins from lymphocyte membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to activation by PIP2, phosphorylation of a conserved threonine on the C-terminal tail also contributes to activation. However, this phosphorylation is believed to stabilize the active state after PIP2 rather than to initiate activation (15.Fievet B.T. Gautreau A. Roy C. Del Maestro L. Mangeat P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Phosphoinositide binding and phosphorylation act sequentially in the activation mechanism of ezrin.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). What is the molecular mechanism by which PIP2 mediates conformational activation of the ERM proteins? Current understanding is incomplete and complicated by evidence of two binding sites. One site, the “PIP2-binding POCKET” (the POCKET), was clearly identified in a crystal structure of the radixin FERM domain in complex with IP3 (16.Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. Structural basis of the membrane-targeting and unmasking mechanisms of the radixin FERM domain.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is located in a cleft between lobe A and lobe C in the FERM domain (Fig. 1B, POCKET). The authors proposed that PIP2 binding to this site caused long range conformational changes of the FERM domain that promotes release of the ERM C terminus. Independently a distinct PIP2-binding site on the surface of lobe C (the PATCH) was described by Niggli and colleagues (17.Barret C. Roy C. Montcourrier P. Mangeat P. Niggli V. Mutagenesis of the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding site in the NH2-terminal domain of ezrin correlates with its altered cellular distribution.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) based on its functional importance in mediating binding to PIP2 and membrane localization of the cellular ERM protein. They predicted that primary sequence motifs with adjacent lysines could mediate PIP2 binding and identified two candidate pairs of lysines on the surface of lobe C (Lys-253/Lys-254 and Lys-262/Lys-263) (Fig. 1B, the PATCH). Combined mutation of all four residues to asparagines (“the 4N mutant”) virtually destroyed FERM domain binding to PIP2. Their role in binding PIP2 has been established for the FERM domain (17.Barret C. Roy C. Montcourrier P. Mangeat P. Niggli V.

PH-like domains have a conserved composite-fold consisting of two β sheets packed against each other with a single helix capping the orifice of the resultant partially open barrel (18.Ingley E. Hemmings B.A. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in signal transduction.J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19.Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

This conserved scaffold has been widely utilized in diverse proteins to perform a range of biochemical functions because the overall β-barrel-fold provides several distinct niches for potential interactions with substrates. PH domains are particularly known for their capacity to bind membrane phospholipids (especially PIP2) via conserved lysine or arginine residues in a positively charged pocket formed at the opening of the β barrel (20.Cozier G.E.

However, that POCKET in lobe C is unavailable for PIP2 binding because it is a hydrophobic pocket used for binding the extreme C-terminal helix of ERM protein (Fig. 1B, C site 4). Instead the lysine pairs in the PATCH are on loops of a β sheet (β5/β6/β7) approximately where Pearson noted a patch of positive electrostatic charge that he proposed might be a PIP2-binding site (8.Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Structure of the ERM protein moesin reveals the FERM domain fold masked by an extended actin binding tail domain.Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This proposed location for PIP2 binding has not been observed in solved structures of PIP2 binding PH domains. There are major missing pieces in our understanding of the two PIP2-binding sites and in understanding the functional relationship between them. Regarding the POCKET there are two key issues. First, its functional relevance is largely untested experimentally. Second, the recently solved structure of full-length autoinhibited ERM raises a new conceptual problem by showing that the POCKET is masked by a linker region (Figs. 1C and 7A) “hindering PIP2 and membrane interactions” (7.Li Q. Nance M.R. Kulikauskas R. Nyberg K. Fehon R. Karplus P.A. Bretscher A. Tesmer J.J. Self-masking in an intact ERM-merlin protein. An active role for the central α-helical domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1446-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is problematic to propose that this site mediates the initial PIP2 binding. Regarding the PATCH it is not clear whether it simply mediates PIP2 binding or also mediates release of autoinhibition. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic study of the structural basis of PIP2 binding to develop a model of the sequence of events in moesin activation by binding to PIP2. Our evidence indicates that the PATCH mediates not only the initial binding to PIP2, but more importantly results in the PIP2-induced conformational activation of ERM protein. That activation involves release of an autoinhibitory “FLAP,” which we characterize. All lipids were synthetic, unless otherwise indicated.

Cholesterol (purified from sheep wool grease) was purchased from Sigma. Dansyl-PE (N-[5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl]-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Anti-His antibody was purchased from Abcam. Jurkat WT cells (from ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES, with 10% FBS (HyClone). The GFP-tagged construct of full-length human moesin was prepared in pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) as described previously (14.Hao J.J. Liu Y. Kruhlak M. Debell K.E. Rellahan B.L. Shaw S. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 releases ERM proteins from lymphocyte membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Moesin tagged with Myc-His6 at its C terminus were prepared by cloning the coding DNA into XhoI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pBAD-Myc-His (Invitrogen). Similar techniques were used to add a linker of two glycines and a cysteine after the C terminus of moesin in those constructs for the purpose of fluorescent labeling. All constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The GST-tagged proteins (CD44 tail (residues 291–361), NHERF1 tail (residue 347–358), and NHERF1 full-length) were generated by producing DNA fragments by reverse transcription-PCR with primers encoding the corresponding region, using total mRNA isolated from human peripheral blood T-cells and subcloned into BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare). Cells were transfected with 10 μg of each plasmid in a BTX ECM 830 electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, 300 V for 10 ms). After incubation at 37 °C for 16 to 24 h the cells were adjusted to 107 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.3% BSA, 200 μl were added onto poly-d-lysine-precoated glass bottom of 35-mm culture dishes (MatTek). The cells were allowed to settle for 10 min at 37 °C, then fixed by the addition of 1.0 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution. After 10 min at room temperature, the cells were washed four times with PBS and examined using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope using a ×63 (N.A. 1.4) or ×100 (N.A 1.4) plan-apochromat oil immersion objective lens (Carl Zeiss). Quantitative analysis was performed using the Imaging Examiner software (LSM, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and for display purposes the contrast for the GFP fluorescence images was inverted using Adobe photoshop software. For each cell analyzed, a line was drawn manually at the plasma membrane, and another line was drawn just inside the plasma membrane in the cytosol as described previously (14.Hao J.J. Liu Y. Kruhlak M. Debell K.E. Rellahan B.L. Shaw S. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 releases ERM proteins from lymphocyte membrane.J.

The average fluorescence intensity was determined for the set of pixels of the plasma membrane line (plasma membrane mean intensity) and for the set of pixels at a cytosol line (cytosol mean intensity). Membrane enrichment for each cell was calculated as the (plasma membrane mean intensity)/(cytosol mean intensity) and expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least 10 representative cells from three independent experiments. Recombinant proteins were produced in bacteria and purified using GST or His tags as previously described (14.Hao J.J. Liu Y. Kruhlak M. Debell K.E. Rellahan B.L. Shaw S. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 releases ERM proteins from lymphocyte membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Pulldown assays were performed with His-tagged moesin constructs and GST-tagged NHERF1 or CD44 constructs as described previously (14.Hao J.J. Liu Y. Kruhlak M. Debell K.E. Rellahan B.L. Shaw S. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 releases ERM proteins from lymphocyte membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In brief, for each reaction 1 μm of the indicated purified His-protein was mixed with 5 μm of the indicated GST proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Each reaction was done in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml of PIP2 or PS phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Tween 20). The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C under constant rotation. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 3 min, the pellet was washed three times with buffer A, and diluted in SDS buffer twice. Samples from each reaction were run into two NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen). One gel was transferred into PVDF membrane and the bound His protein was revealed by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody (Abcam). The other gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading of GST proteins. All results shown are representative of at least 3 pulldown experiments. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared as described previously (25.Blin G. Margeat E. Carvalho K. Royer C.A. Roy C. Picart C. Quantitative analysis of the binding of ezrin to large unilamellar vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, mixtures of lipids PC/PIP2 (95/5% unless otherwise indicated) or PC/PS (80/20%) were prepared, dehydrated under a stream of nitrogen, and dried further overnight in a SpeedVac. Dried lipid films were hydrated in a HEPES buffer containing: 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C accompanied by rigorous vortexing each 15 min, and then underwent 5 thaw/freeze cycles. The lipids were sonicated and passed 25 times through two 100-nm pore size polycarbonate membranes of a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Purified moesin-GGC-myc His wild type and mutants were labeled using Alexa 488-C5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) as described (25.Blin G. Margeat E. Carvalho K. Royer C.A. Roy C. Picart C.

J. 2008; 94: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ratio of Alexa 488 incorporated per mol of each moesin proteins was (0.5–0.8):1. The affinity of fluorescently labeled moesin and mutants for sucrose-loaded PIP2-LUVs was determined by sedimentation assays in a HEPES-KCl buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA). The co-sedimentation assays used a series of assays varying the concentration of total lipids, whereas keeping the total protein concentration constant at 400 nm. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the 100-μl samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h and 30 min at 4 °C using an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge. The top 80 μl of each sample were removed and considered as supernatant. 10 μl of Triton X-100 and 60 μl of KCl buffer were added to resuspend the pellet. The intensities of supernatant and pellet samples were read in a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite 1000, Tecan Austria) with excitation and emission set, respectively, at 490/521 nm (±5 nm). The percentage of bound protein was calculated as previously described (25.Blin G. Margeat E. Carvalho K. Royer C.A. Roy C. Picart C.

PIP2 stoichiometry titration was carried out using an established protein to membrane FRET assay (26.Lai C.L. Landgraf K.E. Voth G.A. Falke J.J. Membrane docking geometry and target lipid stoichiometry of membrane-bound PKCα C2 domain. A combined molecular dynamics and experimental study.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 402: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, LUVs were made using a lipid mixture of PE/PC/PS/l-α-phosphatidylinositol/sphingomyelin/cholesterol/dansyl-PE/PIP2 (23.8:9.1:18.1:4.5:4.5:25:5:10) to mimic the physiological membrane lipid composition as previously described (26.Lai C.L.

Biol. 2010; 402: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Samples contained purified moesin protein (3.6 μm) and 10 μm free Ca2+ in physiological buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm EDTA). PIP2 LUVs (10% PIP2) were titrated into protein solution, and the protein to membrane FRET was measured with a spectrofluorimeter (HORIBA, SPEX FLUOROG 321) at 25 °C, with excitation and emission slits at 4 and 8 nm, respectively. Intrinsic donor tryptophan residues in moesin were excited at 284 nm and emission at 522 nm from dansyl-PE acceptor residues was quantitated. To correct for direct acceptor excitation, we subtracted the background dansyl fluorescence of a control sample lacking protein from experimental samples. The data were analyzed using linear least squares fitting of the rise phase and the saturation phase such that the stoichiometry was defined by the intersection of these two straight lines relative to the molar amount of protein used in the assay.

To reconstitute the missing loops in full-length moesin (amino acids 320–326, 399–410, and 472–486) loop searches were performed followed by optimization of the molecular coordinates of the atoms by potential energy minimization using Sybyl 7.0 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) with AMBER Force Fields (FF99) parameters. Surface electrostatic potentials were rendered using the MOLCAD subroutine of Sybyl with the AMBER7 FF99 charge set, which has an unconventional color scheme but provides a particularly robust calculation of electrostatic potentials. Structures alignment and root mean square deviation calculations were performed by using VMD (developed with NIH support by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign).

https://openalex.org/W2018107956,"There is a well documented need to replenish the antibiotic pipeline with new agents to combat the rise of drug resistant bacteria. One strategy to combat resistance is to discover new chemical classes immune to current resistance mechanisms that inhibit essential metabolic enzymes. Many of the obvious drug targets that have no homologous isozyme in the human host have now been investigated. Bacterial drug targets that have a closely related human homologue represent a new frontier in antibiotic discovery. However, to avoid potential toxicity to the host, these inhibitors must have very high selectivity for the bacterial enzyme over the human homolog. We have demonstrated that the essential enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) from the clinically important pathogen Staphylococcus aureus could be selectively inhibited. Linking biotin to adenosine via a 1,2,3 triazole yielded the first BPL inhibitor selective for S. aureus BPL over the human equivalent. The synthesis of new biotin 1,2,3-triazole analogues using click chemistry yielded our most potent structure (K(i) 90 nM) with a >1100-fold selectivity for the S. aureus BPL over the human homologue. X-ray crystallography confirmed the mechanism of inhibitor binding. Importantly, the inhibitor showed cytotoxicity against S. aureus but not cultured mammalian cells. The biotin 1,2,3-triazole provides a novel pharmacophore for future medicinal chemistry programs to develop this new antibiotic class."
https://openalex.org/W2034067229,"Paclitaxel, an anti-microtubule agent, is an effective chemotherapeutic drug in breast cancer. Nonetheless, resistance to paclitaxel remains a major clinical challenge. The need to better understand the resistant phenotype and to find biomarkers that could predict tumor response to paclitaxel is evident. In estrogen receptor α-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer cells, phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (CAV1) on Tyr-14 facilitates mitochondrial apoptosis by increasing BCL2 phosphorylation in response to low dose paclitaxel (10 nM). However, two variants of CAV1 exist: the full-length form, CAV1α (wild-type CAV1 or wtCAV1), and a truncated form, CAV1β. Only wtCAV1 has the Tyr-14 region at the N terminus. The precise cellular functions of CAV1 variants are unknown. We now show that CAV1 variants play distinct roles in paclitaxel-mediated cell death/survival. CAV1β expression is increased in paclitaxel-resistant cells when compared with sensitive cells. Expression of CAV1β in sensitive cells significantly reduces their responsiveness to paclitaxel. These activities reflect an essential role for Tyr-14 phosphorylation because wtCAV1 expression, but not a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Y14F), inactivates BCL2 and BCLxL through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MCF-7 cells that express Y14F are resistant to paclitaxel and are resensitized by co-treatment with ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic small molecule inhibitor. Using structural homology modeling, we propose that phosphorylation on Tyr-14 enables a favorable conformation for proteins to bind to the CAV1 scaffolding domain. Thus, we highlight novel roles for CAV1 variants in cell death; wtCAV1 promotes cell death, whereas CAV1β promotes cell survival by preventing inactivation of BCL2 and BCLxL via JNK in paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986506670,"Ras proteins on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane signal from transient nanoscale proteolipid assemblies called nanoclusters. Interactions between the Ras lipid anchors and plasma membrane phospholipids, cholesterol, and actin cytoskeleton contribute to the formation, stability, and dynamics of Ras nanoclusters. Many small biological molecules are amphiphilic and capable of intercalating into membranes and altering lipid immiscibility. In this study we systematically examined whether amphiphiles such as indomethacin influence Ras protein nanoclustering in intact plasma membrane. We found that indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, induced profound and complex effects on Ras spatial organization, all likely related to liquid-ordered domain stabilization. Indomethacin enhanced the clustering of H-Ras.GDP and N-Ras.GTP in cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters. Indomethacin also abrogated efficient GTP-dependent lateral segregation of H- and N-Ras between cholesterol-dependent and cholesterol-independent clusters, resulting in mixed heterotypic clusters of Ras proteins that normally are separated spatially. These heterotypic Ras nanoclusters showed impaired Raf recruitment and kinase activation resulting in significantly compromised MAPK signaling. All of the amphiphilic anti-inflammatory agents we tested had similar effects on Ras nanoclustering and signaling. The potency of these effects correlated with the membrane partition coefficients of the individual agents and was independent of COX inhibition. This study shows that biological amphiphiles have wide-ranging effects on plasma membrane heterogeneity and protein nanoclustering, revealing a novel mechanism of drug action that has important consequences for cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2082821300,"We previously demonstrated that a deficiency in core fucosylation caused by the genetic disruption of α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) leads to lethal abnormalities and the development of emphysematous lesions in the lung by attenuation of TGF-β1 receptor signaling. Herein, we investigated the physiological relevance of core fucosylation in the pathogenesis of emphysema using viable heterozygous knock-out mice (Fut8(+/-)) that were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). The Fut8(+/-) mice exhibited a marked decrease in FUT8 activity, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activities were elevated in the lung at an early stage of exposure. Emphysema developed after a 3-month CS exposure, accompanied by the recruitment of large numbers of macrophages to the lung. CS exposure substantially and persistently elevated the expression level of Smad7, resulting in a significant reduction of Smad2 phosphorylation (which controls MMP-9 expression) in Fut8(+/-) mice and Fut8-deficient embryonic fibroblast cells. These in vivo and in vitro studies show that impaired core fucosylation enhances the susceptibility to CS and constitutes at least part of the disease process of emphysema, in which TGF-β-Smad signaling is impaired and the MMP-mediated destruction of lung parenchyma is up-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1964664754,"TNFα generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the cell surface that induce cell death, but how ROS communicate to mitochondria and their specific apoptotic action(s) are both undefined. ROS oxidize phospholipids to hydroperoxides that are friable and fragment adjacent to the (hydro)peroxide function, forming truncated phospholipids, such as azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine (Az-PC). Az-PC is relatively soluble, and exogenous Az-PC rapidly enters cells to damage mitochondrial integrity and initiate intrinsic apoptosis. We determined whether this toxic phospholipid is formed within cells during TNFα stimulation in sufficient quantities to induce apoptosis and if they are essential in TNFα-induced cytotoxicity. We found that TNFα induced ROS formation and phospholipid peroxidation in Jurkat cells, and either chemical interference with NADPH oxidase activity or siRNA suppression of the NADPH oxidase-4 subunit blocked ROS accumulation and phospholipid peroxidation. Mass spectrometry showed that phospholipid peroxides and then Az-PC increased after TNFα exposure, whereas ROS inhibition abolished Az-PC accumulation and TNFα-induced cell death. Glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4), which specifically metabolizes lipid hydroperoxides, fell in TNFα-stimulated cells prior to death. Ectopic GPx4 overcame this, reduced peroxidized phospholipid accumulation, blocked Az-PC accumulation, and prevented death. Conversely, GPx4 siRNA knockdown enhanced phospholipid peroxidation, increasing TNFα-stimulated Az-PC formation and apoptosis. Truncated phospholipids were essential elements of TNFα-induced apoptosis because overexpression of PAFAH2 (a phospholipase A(2) that selectively hydrolyzes truncated phospholipids) blocked TNFα-induced Az-PC accumulation without affecting phospholipid peroxidation. PAFAH2 also abolished apoptosis. Thus, phospholipid oxidation and truncation to apoptotic phospholipids comprise an essential element connecting TNFα receptor signaling to mitochondrial damage and apoptotic death."
https://openalex.org/W1985891703,"RING E3 ligases are proteins that must selectively recruit an E2-conjugating enzyme and facilitate ubiquitin transfer to a substrate. It is not clear how a RING E3 ligase differentiates a naked E2 enzyme from the E2∼ubiquitin-conjugated form or how this is altered upon ubiquitin transfer. RING-box protein 1 (Rbx1/ROC1) is a key protein found in the Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that functions with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme CDC34. The solution structure of Rbx1/ROC1 revealed a globular RING domain (residues 40–108) stabilized by three structural zinc ions (root mean square deviation 0.30 ± 0.04 Å) along with a disordered N terminus (residues 12–39). Titration data showed that Rbx1/ROC1 preferentially recruits CDC34 in its ubiquitin-conjugated form and favors this interaction by 50-fold compared with unconjugated CDC34. Furthermore, NMR and biochemical assays identified residues in helix α2 of Rbx1/ROC1 that are essential for binding and activating CDC34∼ubiquitin for ubiquitylation. Taken together, this work provides the first direct structural and biochemical evidence showing that polyubiquitylation by the RING E3 ligase Rbx1/ROC1 requires the preferential recruitment of an E2∼ubiquitin complex and subsequent release of the unconjugated E2 protein upon ubiquitin transfer to a substrate or ubiquitin chain.

The intracellular destiny of many proteins in the cell is governed by their post-translational modification with the covalent attachment of ubiquitin. This process, known as ubiquitylation, plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes including protein turnover, cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction (1.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation involves the sequential transfer of a ubiquitin molecule through an enzyme cascade consisting of a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) until it forms an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ϵ-amino group of a lysine on a substrate protein. The E2-E3 combination governs the specificity of the target protein for modification and the site of attachment to the substrate protein as well as the chain length and type of linkage between the ubiquitin molecules attached (2.Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). The really interesting new gene (RING) domain-containing E3 ligases function primarily as scaffolds that orient the E2∼ubiquitin thiol ester complex as well as the substrate protein for efficient ubiquitin transfer.

The Rbx1/ROC1 or Rbx2/ROC2 proteins are responsible for recognizing and recruiting the E2 conjugating enzyme during ubiquitin transfer to a target protein. Crystal structures of multiple CRLs demonstrate they form elongated structures with a long stalk-like N-terminal domain that binds to an adaptor (such as Skp1; CUL3 is the only exception to this rule) and various substrate recognition factors (such as F-box proteins) to recognize different substrate proteins (6.Angers S.

Recent structural and biochemical studies show that the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier protein NEDD8 to a conserved lysine residue near the C terminus of the cullin scaffold protein causes a conformational change in the C-terminal domain of CUL1 liberating the RING-domain of Rbx1/ROC1 (9.Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M. Schulman B.A. Structural insights into NEDD8 activation of cullin-RING ligases. Conformational control of conjugation.Cell. 2008; 134: 995-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The increased mobility of Rbx1/ROC1 is believed to enhance its rate of ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to the substrate protein (10.Deshaies R.J. Emberley E.D. Saha A. Control of cullin-ring ubiquitin ligase activity by nedd8.Subcell Biochem. 2010; 54: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11.Boh B.K. Smith P.G. Hagen T. Neddylation-induced conformational control regulates Cullin RING ligase activity in vivo.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This modulation of Rbx1/ROC1-based E3 ligases by cullin and NEDD8 is unique among the RING E3 ligases and represents one of the most intriguing and important regulation steps in the ubiquitination process. Cullin RING ligase K48R/G76C substituted ubiquitin disulfide complex between CDC34 and UbCys RING box protein 1 Skp1/Cullin 1/F-box heteronuclear single quantum coherence tobacco etch virus. The best characterized CRL E3 complex to date both biochemically and structurally is the Skp1/Cullin 1/F-box (SCF) ligase complex, which consists of Rbx1/ROC1 bound to the CUL1 catalytic C-terminal domain. UbcH5 and CDC34 (cell division cycle protein 34) are the two E2 enzymes known to directly interact and function with the SCF in humans (12.Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) with each being responsible for different facets in ubiquitylation on a target protein; UbcH5 attaches the initial ubiquitin to the substrate, whereas CDC34 is responsible for the successive addition of ubiquitin molecules to the substrate during polyubiquitin chain formation (13.Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Priming and extending. A UbcH5/Cdc34 E2 handoff mechanism for polyubiquitination on a SCF substrate.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 784-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A recent structural and functional study demonstrated that CDC34 can be allosterically inhibited by a small molecule that impedes the release of its ubiquitin cargo at the E2-E3 step (14.Ceccarelli D.F. Tang X. Pelletier B. Orlicky S. Xie W. Plantevin V. Neculai D. Chou Y.C. Ogunjimi A. Al-Hakim A. Varelas X. Koszela J. Wasney G.A. Vedadi M. Dhe-Paganon S. Cox S. Xu S. Lopez-Girona A. Mercurio F.

An allosteric inhibitor of the human Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.Cell. 2011; 145: 1075-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), demonstrating that inhibition of CDC34-dependent polyubiquitylation might represent a possible step for therapeutic intervention. The acidic C terminus of CDC34 has recently been shown to interact with ubiquitin (15.Spratt D.E. Shaw G.S. Association of the disordered C terminus of CDC34 with a catalytically bound ubiquitin.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as the C-terminal domain of CUL1 (16.Kleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 36012-36023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that the C terminus of CDC34 is important for bringing CDC34 and the SCF into closer proximity, the structural basis for the functional interaction between the catalytic domain of CDC34 and Rbx1/ROC1 remains unclear. Determination of the structural rationale for the enhanced activity of CDC34 bound to the RING E3 adaptor protein Rbx1/ROC1 would help to further clarify the mechanism of processive ubiquitination for this E2-E3 complex. In this study the solution structure of Rbx1/ROC1 in the absence of its cullin scaffold was determined. The structure shows that the N terminus of Rbx1/ROC1 undergoes a large structural rearrangement from a disordered conformation to a structured β-strand in the CRL complex. Furthermore, we used NMR spectroscopy to show that Rbx1/ROC1 displays poor affinity for CDC34 alone that is increased by more than 50-fold for CDC34 in its ubiquitin-loaded form. Using biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that the cullin-free Rbx1/ROC1 is capable of activating the catalytic core of CDC34. We also identify key residues in helix α2 of Rbx1/ROC1 that are important for binding and activating CDC34∼ubiquitin. This study provides the first structural details showing that the CDC34∼ubiquitin complex is recruited by Rbx1/ROC1 and functions within the sequential model for polyubiquitylation (18.Petroski M.D. Kleiger G.

Detection of sequential polyubiquitylation on a millisecond timescale.Nature. 2009; 462: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of Rbx1/ROC1 was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3-Myc3-ROC1 (Addgene, Cambridge MA) with flanking NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. Primers used for cloning full-length Rbx1/ROC1 were Rbx1_fr (5′-AATCTAGACATATGGCGGCAGCGATGGATGTGGATACCC-3′) and Rbx1_rv (5′-AACTCGAGAAGCTTTTATTACTAGTGCCCATACTTTTGG-3′). The resulting PCR product was then cloned into pET28a that contained an N-terminal 6-histidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site (MGSSHHHHHHSSGGRENLYFQ) to facilitate the removal of the tag during purification. This initial construct was then shortened from residues 1–108 to 12–108 and 36–108 using site-directed mutagenesis based upon the observed residues in the crystal structure of CUL1-Rbx1/ROC1, PDB code 1LDJ (7.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). The designed Rbx1/ROC112–108 and Rbx1/ROC136–108 constructs also had three extra glycine residues added between the TEV cleavage site and G12 to improve flexibility for TEV cleavage. The primers used to make Rbx1 12–108 were Rbx1d12fr (5′-AACTTGTATTTCCAGGGCGGCGGCGGCACCAACAGCGGCG-3′) and Rbx1d12rv (5′-CGCCGCTGTTGGTGCCGCCGCCGCCCTGGAAATACAAGTT-3′. The primers used to make Rbx1/ROC136–108 were Rbx1d36fr (5′-AACTTGTATTTCCAGGGCGGCGGCGGCGATATTGTGGTTGATAACTG-3′) and Rbx1d36rv (5′-CAGTTATCAACCACAATATCGCCGCCGCCGCCCTGGAAATACAAGTT3′). To improve the solubility of Rbx1/ROC112–108, four mutations (W27S, V30S, L32Q, and W33S) were incorporated into the N-terminal region of Rbx1/ROC1 that was predicted to have aggregation propensity by the online algorithm TANGO (20.Fernandez-Escamilla A.M.

These mutations were made using the primers Rbx1SSQSfr (5′-CGCTTTGAAGTGAAAAAGAGTAATGCAAGTGCTCAGAGTGCCTGGGATATTGTGG-3′) and Rbx1SSQSrv (5′-CCACAATATCCCAGGCACTCTGAGCACTTGCATTACTCTTTTTCACTTCAAAGCG-3′).The resulting vectors, pET28a-HisTEV-sRbx112–108 (where “sRbx1” stands for solubilized Rbx1) and pET28a-HisTEV-Rbx136–108, were verified by DNA sequencing (Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute Trp-87, Lys-89, and Lys-91 to alanines using the following primers: for W87A, Rbx1W87Afr (5′-CCACTGCATCTCTCGGGCACTCAAAACACGACAGG-3′) and Rbx1W87Arv (5′-CCTGTCGTGTTTTGAGTGCCCGAGAGATGCAGTGG-3′); for K89A, Rbx1K89Afr (5′-GCATCTCTCGCTGGCTCGCAACACGACAGGTGTGTCC-3′) and Rbx1K89Arv (5′-GGACACACCTGTCGTGTTGCGAGCCAGCGAGAGATGC-3′); for K89A/R91A, Rbx1K89R91fr (5′-CATCTCTCGCTGGCTCGCAACCGCACAGGTGTGTCCATTGG-3′) and Rbx1K89R91rv (5′-CCAATGGACACACCTGTGCGGTTGCGAGCCAGCGAGAGATG-3′); for R91A, Rbx1R91Afr (5′-CTCGCTGGCTCAAAACAGCACAGGTGTGTCCATTGG-3′)and Rbx1R91Arv (5′-CCAATGGACACACCTGTGCTGTTTTGAGCCAGCGAG-3′). The resulting vectors coding for sRbx112–108 W87A, K89A, K89A/R91A, and R91A were verified by DNA sequencing. To express unlabeled sRbx112–108 protein (where “s” stands for soluble Rbx112–108 with solubilizing mutations), a 10-ml overnight culture of BL21(DE3)-RIL transformed with pET28a-HisTEV-sRbx112–108 was used to inoculate 1 liter of prewarmed LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. To prepare 13C,15N-labeled sRbx112–108, cells were grown in 1 liter of M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) alone or with [13C6]glucose (2 g/liter) in the presence of 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. At an A600 of 0.5, the unlabeled and 15N- or 13C,15N-labeled growth was supplemented with 300 μm ZnCl2. Once the cells reached an A600 of 0.7, the cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 20 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets for unlabeled and 13C,15N-labeled sRbx112–108 were resuspended in 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)) with 1 mm PMSF and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). The resuspended cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then syringe-filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). After the column was washed with wash buffer containing 30 mm imidazole for 15 column volumes at 3 ml/min, the protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing eluted sRbx112–108 protein were pooled, TEV protease was added to cleave the His tag, and the protein was dialyzed against wash buffer overnight at 4 °C. The TEV-cleaved sRbx112–108 protein was then reloaded onto the HisTrap column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The flow-through containing purified sRbx112–108 was pooled and dialyzed against Rbx1 dialysis buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, or 6.0) in preparation for NMR experiments. The resulting sRbx112–108 contained an additional GGG at its N termini as a result of its cloning and TEV cleavage. After purification, the concentration of sRbx112–108 was determined by the better Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Purified sRbx112–108 was also submitted for ICP-AES Zn2+ analysis (Laboratory for Geochemical Analysis, University of Western Ontario) to confirm that three zinc ions were bound per sRbx112–108 molecule, similar to a previous study (23.Hristova V.A.

All NMR data were collected at 25 °C using a Varian Inova 600-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and z-field gradients.

Structures were determined using a combination of manually assigned NOEs and automatic NOE assignment with the program CYANA (35.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. Torsion angle dynamics for NMR structure calculation with the new program DYANA.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar).

After each cycle of refinement, the 20 structures with the lowest calculated target function were used to seed the subsequent rounds of structure calculations and were used in automated NOE assignment by CYANA. Dihedral angular restraints (ϕ,ψ) were determined by inputting the Hα, Cα, Cβ, and C′ chemical shift assignments of sRbx112–108 into TALOS+ (37.Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+.

The atomic coordinates for sRbx112–108 were deposited in the Protein Data Bank and assigned the identifier PDB code 2LGV. The elongation assay required the assembly of two reaction mixtures that contained CDC34∼ubiquitin and Nedd8-SCFβTrCP-IκBα-ubiquitin, respectively. The CDC34∼ubiquitin charge mix (5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 60 μm ubiquitin, 0.1 μm E1 enzyme, and CDC34 in concentrations as indicated. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before mixing with the Nedd8-SCFβTrCP-IκBα-ubiquitin complex. The Nedd8-SCFβTrCP-IκBα-ubiquitin complex was assembled in sequential steps. First, Rbx1/ROC1-CUL1 was neddylated in a reaction mixture (3 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1.5 pmol of Rbx1/ROC1-CUL1, 20 μm Nedd8, 83 nm Nedd8 E1 (APPBP1/Uba3), and 15 μm Ubc12. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. βTrCP/Skp1 (3 pmol) was then added to the mix, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min to allow for the assembly of Nedd8-SCFβTrCP. 32P-Labeled IκBα-Ub (1 pmol), prepared as described previously (13.Wu K.

However, the internalization mechanisms of CPPs are still under discussion, and it is not clear how cells compensate the disturbances induced by peptides in the plasma membrane. In this study, we demonstrate that the uptake of various CPPs enhances the intracellular Ca2+ levels in Jurkat and HeLa cells. The elevated Ca2+ concentration in turn triggers plasma membrane blebbing, lysosomal exocytosis, and membrane repair response. Our results indicate that CPPs split into two major classes: (i) amphipathic CPPs that modulate the plasma membrane integrity inducing influx of Ca2+ and activating downstream responses starting from low concentrations; (ii) non-amphipathic CPPs that do not evoke changes at relevant concentrations. Triggering of the membrane repair response may help cells to replace distorted plasma membrane regions and cells can recover from the influx of Ca2+ if its level is not drastically elevated.

https://openalex.org/W1987454964,"Host response to invasion by many gram-negative bacteria depends upon activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by endotoxin presented as a monomer bound to myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2). Metabolic labeling of hexaacylated endotoxin (LOS) from Neisseria meningitidis with [(13)C]acetate allowed the use of NMR to examine structural properties of the fatty acyl chains of LOS present in TLR4-agonistic and -antagonistic binary and ternary complexes with, respectively, wild-type or mutant (F126A) MD-2 ± TLR4 ectodomain. Chemical shift perturbation indicates that Phe(126) affects the environment and/or position of each of the bound fatty acyl chains both in the binary LOS·MD-2 complex and in the ternary LOS·MD-2·TLR4 ectodomain complex. In both wild-type and mutant LOS·MD-2 complexes, one of the six fatty acyl chains of LOS is more susceptible to paramagnetic attenuation, suggesting protrusion of that fatty acyl chain from the hydrophobic pocket of MD-2, independent of association with TLR4. These findings indicate that re-orientation of the aromatic side chain of Phe(126) is induced by binding of hexaacylated E, preceding interaction with TLR4. This re-arrangement of Phe(126) may act as a ""hydrophobic switch,"" driving agonist-dependent contacts needed for TLR4 dimerization and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2050629862,"The ubiquitous nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT/NCS2) family includes more than 2,000 members, but only 15 have been characterized experimentally. Escherichia coli has 10 members, of which the uracil permease UraA and the xanthine permeases XanQ and XanP are functionally known. Of the remaining members, YgfU is closely related in sequence and genomic locus with XanQ. We analyzed YgfU and showed that it is a proton-gradient dependent, low-affinity (Km 0.5 mm), and high-capacity transporter for uric acid. It also shows a low capacity for transport of xanthine at 37 °C but not at 25 °C. Based on the set of positions delineated as important from our previous Cys-scanning analysis of permease XanQ, we subjected YgfU to rationally designed site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that the conserved His-37 (TM1), Glu-270 (TM8), Asp-298 (TM9), and Gln-318 and Asn-319 (TM10) are functionally irreplaceable, and Thr-100 (TM3) is essential for the uric acid selectivity because its replacement with Ala allows efficient uptake of xanthine. The key role of these residues is corroborated by the conservation pattern and homology modeling on the recently described x-ray structure of permease UraA. In addition, site-specific replacements at TM8 (S271A, M274D, V282S) impair expression in the membrane, and V320N (TM10) inactivates the permease, whereas R327G (TM10) or S426N (TM14) reduces the affinity for uric acid (4-fold increased Km). Our study shows that comprehensive analysis of structure-function relationships in a newly characterized transporter can be accomplished with relatively few site-directed replacements, based on the knowledge available from Cys-scanning mutagenesis of a prototypic homolog.

Our study shows that comprehensive analysis of structure-function relationships in a newly characterized transporter can be accomplished with relatively few site-directed replacements, based on the knowledge available from Cys-scanning mutagenesis of a prototypic homolog. Conservation of sequence and overall structure in many evolutionarily broad families of transporters often correlates with high functional variations between homologs. In most cases, however, it is common that few of the members have been studied for structure-function relationships, whereas high-resolution evidence from crystallography is scarce. To explore the spectrum of substrate selectivity determinants in such families, it is important to introduce effective mutagenesis designs for the comprehensive ab initio study of new homologs, based on existing evidence from known members. Capitalization on data from Cys-scanning or other systematic analyses of a well studied homolog, if available, offers a powerful approach to this end. The above considerations apply promptly to the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) 2The abbreviations used are: NATnucleobase-ascorbate transporterTMtransmembrane segmentBADbiotin acceptor domainHIU5-hydroxy-isourateOHCU2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazolinehSVCThuman Na+-coupled ascorbic acid transporter-2. or nucleobase-cation symporter-2 (NCS2) family, an interesting example of a conserved but functionally diverse group of transporters present in all major taxa of organisms.

C, cells expressing each homolog were normalized to 0.7 mg of protein/ml of cell suspension and assayed for active transport of [14C]uric acid (1 mm, 25 °C) in the presence or absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) (10 μm). Transport assays were also performed for [3H]xanthine (1 μm, 25 °C), using XanQ as a positive control (4Karatza P. Frillingos S. Cloning and functional characterization of two bacterial members of the NAT/NCS2 family in Escherichia coli.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and for [3H]uracil (1 μm, 25 °C). Uracil uptake could not be detected with any of the unknown homologs; xanthine uptake was observed only with RutG, albeit to a marginal extent (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the context of this work, we cloned and overexpressed YgfU and showed that it is a proton-gradient dependent, low-affinity (Km 0.5 mm), and high-capacity transporter for uric acid that also transports xanthine, but with disproportionately low capacity. Subsequently, we subjected YgfU to site-directed mutagenesis, based on data available for the homologous xanthine permease XanQ, and found that residues irreplaceable for the mechanism occur at five highly conserved positions, whereas a single-amino acid replacement (T100A) converts the uric acid-selective YgfU to a dual-selectivity transporter for both uric acid and xanthine. These results are supported with mirror-image replacements made in XanQ and homology modeling on the recently described structure of UraA. [8-14C]Uric acid (51.5 mCi mmol−1), [8-3H]xanthine (28 Ci mmol−1), and [5,6-3H]uracil (59 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. Nonradioactive nucleobases were from Sigma. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized from BioSpring GmbH. High-fidelity Taq polymerase (Phusion high-fidelity PCR system) was from Finnzymes. Restriction endonucleases used were from Takara. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated avidin was from Amersham Biosciences. All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. E. coli K-12 was transformed according to Inoue et al. (26Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. High-efficiency transformation of Escherichia coli with plasmids.Gene. 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) was used for initial propagation of recombinant plasmids. T184 (27Teather R.M. Bramhall J. Riede I. Wright J.K. Fürst M. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Overath P.

Construction of expression plasmids and biotin acceptor domain (BAD)-tagged versions of NAT homologs was essentially as described previously for XanQ and XanP (4Karatza P. Frillingos S. Cloning and functional characterization of two bacterial members of the NAT/NCS2 family in Escherichia coli.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding sequences of NAT genes were amplified by PCR on the template of genomic DNA prepared from E. coli T184 and transferred to plasmid vector pT7-5 by restriction fragment replacement; BAD-tagged versions were prepared using two-stage (overlap extension) PCR (28Ho S.N.

For construction of mutants, two-stage PCR was performed on the template of YgfU-BAD or XanQ-BAD, as indicated. The entire coding sequence of all engineered constructs was verified by double-strand DNA sequencing in an automated DNA sequencer (MWG Biotech) (supplemental Table S2). E. coli T184 harboring given plasmids was grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing streptomycin (0.01 mg/ml) and ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Fully grown cultures were diluted 10-fold, allowed to grow to mid-logarithmic phase, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for an additional 2 h at 37 °C, harvested, and washed with appropriate buffers. E. coli T184 were assayed for active transport of [3H]xanthine (0.1–250 μm), [3H]uracil (1–100 μm), and [14C]uric acid (0.01–2 mm), by rapid filtration, at 25 and 37 °C, pH 7.5, as described (4Karatza P. Frillingos S. Cloning and functional characterization of two bacterial members of the NAT/NCS2 family in Escherichia coli.Mol. Membr.

For kinetic uptake measurements, initial rates were assayed in T184 cells, at 5–20 s, and data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism4, to determine Km and Vmax values. For ligand competition experiments with XanQ mutants, uptake of [3H]xanthine (1 μm) was assayed in the absence or presence of unlabeled analogues (1 mm) (4Karatza P. Frillingos S.

Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PVDF; Pall Corp.). The BAD-tagged permeases were probed with avidin-HRP. Signals were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Comparative sequence analysis of NAT/NCS2 homologs was based on BLAST-p search and ClustalW alignment; the most recent genome annotations were used for retrieving sequence data. Initial analysis of transmembrane topology of YgfU was performed using the program TMHMM (29Granseth E. Daley D.O. Rapp M. Melén K. von Heijne G.

However, it is one of the urinary organic acids found in humans with lactic acidosis (1Kumps A. Duez P. Mardens Y. Metabolic, nutritional, iatrogenic, and artifactual sources of urinary organic acids: a comprehensive table.Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 708-717PubMed Google Scholar), and several metabolic sequences can be proposed leading to this unusual short chain carboxylic acid (Fig. 1). A major natural source of 2-HIBA might be the plant cyanoglycoside linamarin (2Forslund K. Morant M. Jørgensen B. Olsen C.E. Asamizu E. Sato S. Tabata S. Bak S.

In addition, 2-HIBA could be produced during degradation of isobutane and isobutene via oxidation of the corresponding alcoholic and diolic metabolites. Besides, anthropogenic sources of 2-HIBA exist, because it is a pharmaceutical intermediate and by-product of industrial processes, e.g. the production of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (3Chisholm M.S. Artificial glass: the versatility of poly(methyl methacrylate) from its early exploitation to the new millenium.J. Chem. Edu. 2000; 77: 841-845Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has also been identified as a metabolite in the bacterial degradation of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (4Steffan R.J. McClay K. Vainberg S. Condee C.W. Zhang D.

Recently, we found a coenzyme B12-dependent rearrangement reaction in the bacterial degradation pathway of MTBE via 2-HIBA, likely catalyzed by a novel acyl-CoA mutase (7Rohwerder T. Breuer U.

Thus, in a single reaction the branched-chain α-hydroxy carboxylic acid is rearranged into an easily metabolizable linear isomer, now possessing an oxidizable secondary hydroxyl group at the β position. Consequently, the proposed 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase (HCM) would play a central role in MTBE metabolism enabling its complete mineralization.

However, HCM would be distinct from all other known acyl-CoA mutases because it would catalyze the conversion of hydroxylated carboxylic acids. This study aimed at elucidating the biochemistry of the acyl-CoA mutase activity from the MTBE-degrading bacterium Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L108. It was found that HCM consists of a large acyl-CoA-binding and a small B12-binding subunit, HcmA and HcmB, respectively. Destroying the corresponding genes hcmA and hcmB by insertional mutation resulted in complete loss of 2-HIBA-degrading capability. The wild-type mutase genes were cloned in Escherichia coli strains, and enzyme activity of heterologously expressed subunits was characterized. Catalysis by purified recombinant HCM was specific for 2-hydroxyisobutyryl- and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Sequence comparison with known acyl-CoA mutases identified a single active site amino acid residue present in HcmA likely being important for determining substrate specificity. To understand the function of this residue, we analyzed activities of three mutant HcmA subunits having relevant amino acid substitutions. Tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) (≥99%), 2-HIBA (>98%), tert-amyl alcohol (>99%), and anhydrides of butyric (98%) and isobutyric (98%) acids were purchased from Merck Schuchardt. 2-Methylpropan-1,2-diol was from Taros Chemicals at the highest purity available. Coenzyme B12 (≥97%), CoA (≥93%), methylmalonyl-CoA (≥96%, racemic mixture), and succinyl-CoA (≥94%) were purchased from Sigma. Enantiopure (R)- and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA were provided by Evonik Industries (53–54% acyl-CoA enantiomer, >99.9 and 98.9% enantiomeric excess, respectively; 40% NaCl; 6–7% N-hydroxysuccinimide). Acyl-CoA esters not commercially available were synthesized according to two methods. Isobutyryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were prepared from their anhydrides (12Simon E.J. Shemin D. The preparation of S-succinyl coenzyme A.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA was synthesized from its free acid via thiophenyl ester by the method of Padmakumar et al. (13Padmakumar R. Gantla S.

For growth and resting-cell studies, also tert-amyl alcohol, TBA, 2-methylpropan-1,2-diol, and 2-HIBA were supplied as sole source of carbon and energy at 0.5 g liter−1. E. coli TOP10 and ArcticExpress (DE3) were grown in Luria-Bertani broth. Growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD) of cultures at 700 or 550 nm as indicated. For sequencing a larger fragment of the hcm gene region of wild-type strain L108, genomic DNA was extracted using MasterPure DNA Purification kit (Epicenter) and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology (GATC Biotech). The obtained DNA sequences were analyzed for open reading frames using Rast (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology). A 4.5 kb sequence including both hcm genes was obtained. The gene encoding for the large subunit of HCM (hcmA) was amplified from strain L108 genomic DNA by applying the forward primer 5′-AATG ACC TGG CTT GAG CCG CAG A-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCCC GAA GAC CGG GTC TCG CGG-3′. PCR was accomplished with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) for 30 cycles, including denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was cloned into expression vector pASG-IBA43 (IBA Goettingen) and transformed into E. coli TOP10 according to the protocol of IBA Goettingen. Induction was performed at OD550 of 0.5 with 200 μg liter−1 anhydrotetracycline for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were centrifuged and suspended in Tris buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for further analysis. The cloning vector pPR-IBA1::hcmB for the small subunit of HCM was purchased from DNA2.0 and transformed into 100 μl of electrocompetent E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3) (Novagen) at 300 mV for 5 ms in chilled 0.1-cm cuvettes in a MicroPulser (Bio-Rad). Induction was performed with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 12 °C, after growth at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 20 mg liter−1 gentamycin and 50 mg liter−1 kanamycin to an OD550 of 0.4 and further incubation at 12 °C to an OD550 of 0.5. Then, cells were centrifuged and suspended in Tris buffer. For the purification of recombinant mutase subunits, crude extracts of induced E. coli cells were prepared by disruption using a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch GmbH, Germany) with glass beads (212–300 μm, Sigma) at 30 s−1 for 30 min. The recombinant HcmA and HcmB subunits were purified with the help of their His and Strep tags, respectively. All purification steps were performed at 12 °C. Crude extracts of E. coli TOP10 pASG-IBA43::hcmA were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow 10-ml column (IBA Goettingen). After washing with 20 column volumes of imidazole buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), HcmA was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing HcmA were concentrated via viva spin columns (30 kDa; GE Healthcare) and diluted with conservation buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4). Crude extracts of E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3) pPR-IBA1::hcmB were loaded on a Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity 10-ml column (IBA Goettingen). After washing with 20 column volumes of Tris buffer, HcmB was eluted with elution buffer (Tris buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin). Fractions containing HcmB were concentrated using viva spin columns (10 kDa) and diluted with conservation buffer. The hcmA mutant genes cloned into pASG-IBA43 were purchased from GeneCust Europe. Site-directed mutagenesis resulted in HcmA I90Y, I90F, and I90V mutants (with the point mutations a268t plus t269a, a268t, and a268g, respectively). The vectors were transformed into E. coli TOP10. Expression and purification were performed as described for the wild-type recombinant HcmA. Enzyme activity was routinely measured in 1–2 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, containing 10% glycerol, 833 μm coenzyme B12, and 10 mm MgCl2, at 30 °C in the dark. This reaction mixture was incubated in 10-ml headspace glass vials sealed with rubber stoppers. As variation of HcmA and HcmB ratios (up to 5:1 and 1:5, respectively) did not result in increased activities, the recombinant subunits were added at equimolar ratios (3 μm) throughout the study. After a 5-min preincubation in the presence of coenzyme B12, the reaction was started by adding acyl-CoA substrates. Throughout the experiments, oxygen concentrations were minimized by permanently flushing the incubation vials with nitrogen. For determination of pH optimum, pH values of the phosphate buffer and a phosphate/acetate buffer (phosphate buffer plus 50 mm sodium acetate buffer) were adjusted to values between 5.0 and 7.8. The temperature optimum was determined by incubating at temperatures between 20 and 55 °C. Concentrations of acyl-CoA ester substrates and products were quantified by ion-pair chromatography using an HPLC system (Shimadzu) with a Nucleosil 100–5 C18 column (250 mm × 3 mm, 5 μm; Macherey-Nagel) and a mobile phase of 14.5 vol% acetonitrile, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 4.5 for the separation of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-, 3-hydroxybutyryl-, methylmalonyl-, and succinyl-CoA, with retention times of about 35, 24, 30, and 40 min, respectively. For separation of isobutyryl- and butyryl-CoA, acetonitrile content of the eluent was 21.6 vol%, resulting in retention times of 35 and 40 min, respectively (17Valentin H.E. Steinbüchel A. Expression of an α-galactosidase gene under control of the homologous inulinase promoter in Kluyveromyces marxianus.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar). Eluent flow was adjusted to 0.6 ml min−1, and column oven temperature was 30 °C. Absorbance at 260 nm was used for quantifying acyl-CoA esters. In addition, spectra from 190 to 280 nm were recorded for distinguishing peaks of CoA esters from unspecific signals (18Hermans-Lokkerbol A. van der Heijden R. Verpoorte R. Isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography of coenzyme A esters involved in the metabolism of 3S-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A.

Detection limit at 260 nm was 0.5 μm CoA ester. For stopping enzymatic catalysis, samples were mixed with an equal volume of stop buffer (100 mm acetate, pH 3.5) and incubated at 60 °C for 5 min prior to HPLC analysis. To establish the enzymatic function of HcmAB in 2-HIBA degradation, we generated knock-out mutants of strain A. tertiaricarbonis L108 by electroporation of 1 μl of EZ-Tn5<KAN-2>Tnp transposome (Epicenter Biotechnologies) to 70 μl of electrocompetent L108 cells in chilled cuvettes at 1.8 kV for about 5 ms (MicroPulser; Bio-Rad). Transformed cells were rescued in 5 ml of MSM amended with 10 mm fructose for 6 h at 30 °C and 150 rpm. Dilutions were plated on MSM fructose agar containing 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. As the transposome integrates randomly into the DNA, all colonies obtained had to be analyzed for loss of their capability to grow on MSM agar containing 0.5 g liter−1 TBA. In addition, copies of the colonies were maintained on MSM fructose agar for further analysis. Colonies with restricted or even lost TBA degradation potential were transferred on MSM 2-HIBA agar plates. The mutants that failed to grow were further analyzed. The exact integration site of the kanamycin cassette into the genomic DNA was determined by direct DNA sequencing using flanking KAN-2 primers (Epicenter Biotechnologies) of 1 mg liter−1 high concentrated genomic DNA (MasterPure DNA Purification kit). Conditions were 4 min initial denaturation at 95 °C followed by 60 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 4 min 60 °C, finally cooled down to 8 °C. The products were cleaned with Centri-Sep columns (Applied Biosystems) and sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer with the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The resulting sequences were analyzed with BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Sequencing of genomic DNA of wild-type A. tertiaricarbonis L108 revealed that a 4.5-kb fragment comprised both hcmA and hcmB separated by two genes encoding for a putative acyl-CoA synthetase and a MeaB-like G protein chaperone, respectively (Fig. 2). A highly similar sequence (>97% identity) having the same gene organization has already been found in the genome of the MTBE-degrading strain Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 (20Kane S.R.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1931-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that HCM is involved in degradation of the MTBE metabolite 2-HIBA (7Rohwerder T. Breuer U. Benndorf D. Lechner U. Müller R.H. The alkyl tert-butyl ether intermediate 2-hydroxyisobutyrate is degraded via a novel cobalamin-dependent mutase pathway.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4128-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the organization of hcm-like genes interrupted by genes likely encoding for a acyl-CoA synthetase and MeaB-like chaperone is also present in other bacteria, such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides ATCC 17029 and Nocardioides sp. JS614 (Fig. 2), thus far not related to fuel oxygenate ether degradation. As has already been suggested on the basis of transcriptome analysis of MTBE-grown cells of strain PM1 (21Hristova K.R. Schmidt R. Chakicherla A.Y. Legler T.C. Wu J. Chain P.S. Scow K.M. Kane S.R.

Microbiol. 2007; 73: 7347-7357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the acyl-CoA synthetase could be involved in CoA activation of 2-HIBA (Fig. 1). The G protein chaperone may play a role in HCM assembly and stabilization, as has already found for MeaB and MeaI associated with MCM and ICM/IcmF, respectively (11Cracan V. Padovani D. Banerjee R.

Assembly and protection of the radical enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, by its chaperone.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose for the MeaB/MeaI paralog associated with HCM the name MeaH (Fig. 2). For precisely studying the role of HCM in bacterial 2-HIBA degradation, we tried to create hcmA and hcmB knock-out mutants of strain L108 by a site-specific mutagenesis approach via homologous recombination. However, even after several trials corresponding knock-out mutants were not obtained. On the other hand, unspecific transposon-mediated mutagenesis and screening for loss of capability to grow on 2-HIBA resulted in two hcm mutants, L108(ΔhcmA)K5 and L108(ΔhcmB)K7, bearing stable insertions of a functionally active kanamycin resistance gene in the hcmA and hcmB genes, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast to the wild-type L108 strain, both mutant strains were not able to grow on TBA and 2-methylpropan-1,2-diol, precursors of 2-HIBA in the tert-butyl alkyl ether degradation pathway (Fig. 1), establishing the postulated central role of HCM in the degradation of organic compounds possessing the tert-butyl moiety (7Rohwerder T. Breuer U. Benndorf D. Lechner U. Müller R.H. The alkyl tert-butyl ether intermediate 2-hydroxyisobutyrate is degraded via a novel cobalamin-dependent mutase pathway.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4128-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Accordingly, TBA and 2-methylpropan-1,2-diol were stoichiometrically converted to 2-HIBA by both knock-out mutants in resting-cell experiments (Fig. 3), indicating that only the 2-HIBA-metabolizing enzymatic activity was affected by the hcm knockouts. Contrarily, the mutants still grew well on tert-amyl alcohol, suggesting an alternative degradation pathway for this C5 homolog of TBA (23Schuster J. Schäfer F. Hübler N. Brandt A. Rosell M. Härtig C. Harms H. Müller R.H. Rohwerder T. Bacterial degradation of tert-amyl alcohol proceeds via hemiterpene 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol by employing the tertiary alcohol desaturase function of the Rieske nonheme mononuclear iron oxygenase MdpJ.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 972-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For biochemical characterization, wild-type hcmA and hcmB as well as hcmA mutant genes were heterologously expressed in E. coli. N-terminal His-tagged and C-terminal Strep-tagged proteins, respectively, were purified from crude extracts by one-step affinity chromatography. Denaturing gel electrophoresis established the presence of the mutase subunits in crude extracts of induced E. coli cells and successful purification of the tagged proteins (supplemental Fig. S2). Yields of purified HcmA (HcmA Ile90 and HcmA mutants) and HcmB were about 100 and 80 mg liter−1 of E. coli culture, respectively. As has already been shown for the small and large ICM subunits (9Ratnatilleke A. Vrijbloed J.W. Robinson J.A. Cloning and sequencing of the coenzyme B12-binding domain of isobutyryl-CoA mutase from Streptomyces cinnamonensis, reconstitution of mutase activity, and characterization of the recombinant enzyme produced in Escherichia coli.J.

However, a combination of both purified subunits resulted in an enzymatic rearrangement of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl- into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (Fig. 4). Under the experimental conditions applied, a linear increase in 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA for about 10 min could be achieved, thus, enabling determination of turnover rates by tracing changes in substrate and product concentrations with HPLC (supp"

These signaling interactions transmit important information that alters cell function through changes in protein dynamics and gene expression. Here, we identify syndecan-2 (SDC2) as a gene whose expression is induced in smooth muscle cells upon physical contact with endothelial cells. Syndecan-2 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is known to be important for developmental processes, including angiogenesis. Our results show that endothelial cells induce mRNA expression of syndecan-2 in smooth muscle cells by activating Notch receptor signaling. Both NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 contribute to the increased expression of syndecan-2 and are themselves sufficient to promote its expression independent of endothelial cells. Syndecan family members serve as coreceptors for signaling molecules, and interestingly, our data show that syndecan-2 regulates Notch signaling and physically interacts with NOTCH3. Notch activity is attenuated in smooth muscle cells made deficient in syndecan-2, and this specifically prevents expression of the differentiation marker smooth muscle α-actin. These results show a novel mechanism in which Notch receptors control their own activity by inducing the expression of syndecan-2, which then acts to propagate Notch signaling by direct receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1975548183,"Growth hormone receptor (GHR) endocytosis is a highly regulated process that depends on the binding and activity of the multimeric ubiquitin ligase, SCF(βTrCP) (Skp Cullin F-box). Despite a specific interaction between β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) and the GHR, and a strict requirement for ubiquitination activity, the receptor is not an obligatory target for SCF(βTrCP)-directed Lys(48) polyubiquitination. We now show that also Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chain formation is required for GHR endocytosis. We identified both the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the ubiquitin ligase COOH terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP) as being connected to this process. Ubc13 activity and its interaction with CHIP precede endocytosis of GHR. In addition to βTrCP, CHIP interacts specifically with the cytosolic tails of the dimeric GHR, identifying both Ubc13 and CHIP as novel factors in the regulation of cell surface availability of GHR."

OPC migration is important for myelin formation during central nervous system development and repair. However, the precise extracellular and intracellular mechanisms that regulate OPC migration remain elusive. Slits were reported to regulate neurodevelopmental processes such as migration, adhesion, axon guidance, and elongation through binding to roundabout receptors (Robos). However, the potential roles of Slits/Robos in oligodendrocytes remain unknown. In this study, Slit2 was found to be involved in regulating the dispersal of OPCs through the association between Robo1 and Fyn. Initially, we examined the expression of Robos in OPCs both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, the Boyden chamber assay showed that Slit2 could inhibit OPC migration. RoboN, a specific inhibitor of Robos, could significantly attenuate this effect. The effects were confirmed through the explant migration assay. Furthermore, treating OPCs with Slit2 protein deactivated Fyn and increased the level of activated RhoA-GTP. Finally, Fyn was found to form complexes with Robo1, but this association was decreased after Slit2 stimulation. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that Slit2 regulates the dispersal of oligodendrocyte precursor cells through Fyn and RhoA signaling."

The chimeric proteins form circular octamers, whereas the wild-type WzzB from S. flexneri was found to be an open trimer. We also present the structure of a Wzz(FepE) mutant, which exhibits severe attenuation in its ability to produce very long O-antigen polymers. Our findings suggest that the differences in the modal length distribution depend primarily on the surface-exposed amino acids in specific regions rather than on the differences in the oligomeric state of the PCP protomers."

Myosin is a type of molecular motor protein that converts energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical movement along actin filaments. Myosin motor function must be tightly regulated in cells to transport cargo efficiently and to avoid futile hydrolysis of ATP. The regulation of muscle myosin (conventional myosin) is well established. Among more than 30 types of unconventional myosins, the regulation of vertebrate myosin 5a is best characterized. Myosin 5a consists of two identical heavy chains that dimerize through coiled-coil structures to form a homodimer. The N-terminal ∼760 amino acid residues form the motor domain containing ATP- and actin-binding sites. The motor domain is followed by a neck that consists of six IQ motifs with the consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR, which act as the binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) 3The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinGTDglobular tail domain of myosin 5aGST-GTDGST fusion protein of GTDHMMheavy meromyosinMDmotor domainRLCregulatory light chainS1subfragment 1 of myosin. or CaM-like light chains.

The fact that the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin 5a is stimulated by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM binds to IQ motifs of myosin 5a heavy chain indicate that Ca2+ regulates myosin 5a function via the bound CaM (5.Cheney R.E.

However, it is not known which IQ motif and bound CaM is responsible for the regulation, nor how the head-tail interaction is affected by Ca2+. It appears that activation of ATPase activity of myosin 5a by high Ca2+ is correlated with Ca2+-induced dissociation of CaM from a single specific IQ motif (12.Nascimento A.A. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Enzymatic characterization and functional domain mapping of brain myosin-V.J. Biol.

Several groups identified the specific IQ motif to be the second IQ motif (IQ2) and proposed that Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin 5a is via the CaM in IQ2 (13.Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M.

This hypothesis seems plausible since the regulation of scallop myosin and smooth muscle myosin is initiated from the regulatory light chain (a CaM-like light chain) bound to IQ2 (17.Ikebe M.

Recently, we proposed a model for the interaction between the head and the GTD of myosin 5a based on mutagenesis analysis of the highly conserved charged residues in the motor domain and the GTD on the regulation (11.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Wang Q. Ikebe R. Craig R. Ikebe M. The globular tail domain puts on the brake to stop the ATPase cycle of myosin Va.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In our model, we assign the GTD-binding site to a pocket of the motor domain, formed by the N-terminal domain, converter, and the CaM in the first IQ motif (IQ1). This assignment immediately suggests a possible mechanism for Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin 5a: the CaM in IQ1 is part of or close to the GTD-binding pocket and Ca2+-induced conformational change of CaM in IQ1 may prevent the interaction between the motor domain and the GTD, thus activating motor function. Of course, this model could not exclude the possibility that Ca2+-induced activation is initiated from the CaM in IQ2 and transferred to the CaM in IQ1 through the interaction between these two CaMs. In the present study, we provide direct evidence that it is the CaM in IQ1, but not the one in IQ2, responsible for the regulation of myosin 5a by Ca2+. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), unless indicated otherwise. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (20.Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I.

Anti-FLAG M2 antibody, Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, phosphoenol pyruvate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazine, and pyruvate kinase were from Sigma. FLAG peptide (AspTyrLysAspAspAspAspLys) was synthesized by Augct Co. (Beijing, China). Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow and Glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow were from GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. GST-GTD was prepared as described previously (10.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Mabuchi K. Craig R. Ikebe M.

All myosin 5a constructs in this study were created from a melanocyte isoform of myosin 5a cDNA(21.Seperack P.K. Mercer J.A. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Retroviral sequences located within an intron of the dilute gene alter dilute expression in a tissue-specific manner.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2326-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). M5aΔT and M5aHMM with N-terminal His-tag and Flag-tag were prepared as described previously (10.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Mabuchi K. Craig R. Ikebe M.

C-terminal-truncated myosin 5a constructs were produced by introducing a stop codon at various nucleotide sites (Fig. 1). M5aΔT-IQ26 was created by substituting IQ2 (aa 788–812) in M5aΔT with IQ6 (aa 884–908). MD-IQ1/6 was created by substituting IQ2 (aa 788–815) in MD-IQ1/2 with IQ6 (aa 884–908). MD-IQ3 and MD-IQ5 were created by substituting IQ1 (aa 765–787) in MD-IQ1 with IQ3 (aa 813–835) and IQ5 (aa 861–883), respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared using Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen) as described previously (6.Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M.

Sf9 cells were coinfected with the recombinant viruses of myosin 5a heavy chain and CaM wild type or mutants. The expressed myosin 5a was purified by anti-Flag M2 affinity chromatography as described previously (6.Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M.

The concentrations of the purified myosin 5a were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using the following molar extinction coefficients (liters·mol−1·cm−1): 167510 (M5aΔT), 164950 (M5aΔT-IQ26), 150300 (M5aHMM), 141220 (MD-IQ1–6), 106560 (MD-IQ1/2), 104000 (MD-IQ1/6), 100040 (MD-IQ1), 96080 (MD-IQ1-short), 90270 (MD), 102360 (MD-IQ3), and 101080 (MD-IQ5). These molar extinction coefficients were calculated based on the amino acid composition of myosin 5a heavy chain and the bound CaM. In the case where the absorbance at 280 nm was lower than 0.5 or the absorbance spectrum was aberrant, the protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining with known concentrations of myosin 5a protein as a standard. The cDNA for human CaM was obtained by PCR and subcloned into pFastBac or pT7 vector. CaM mutations abolishing Ca2+-binding sites, including B12Q (mutation of E31Q/E67Q), B34Q (mutations of E104Q/E140Q), and B1234Q (mutations of E31Q/E67Q/E104Q/E140Q) were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis with Ultra High Fidelity Pfu (Stratagene, CA) and standard molecular biological techniques. The CaM in pFastBac was used for preparing recombinant baculovirus by using Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen). The CaM in pT7 was used for expressing CaM in Escherichia coli. CaM wild type and B12Q mutant were expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified according to a published method using affinity chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (22.Ikura M. Marion D. Kay L.E. Shih H. Krinks M. Klee C.B. Bax A. Heteronuclear 3D NMR and isotopic labeling of calmodulin. Towards the complete assignment of the 1H NMR spectrum.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography could not be used for CaM-B34Q and -B1234Q mutants, and therefore an alternative purification scheme, based on that of smooth muscle myosin regulatory light chain (23.Ikebe M. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders 2nd, C.R. Ikebe R. Structural requirement of the regulatory light chain of smooth muscle myosin as a substrate for myosin light chain kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was devised as described below. BL21(DE3) was transformed with CaM in pT7 expression vector and then cultured in 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 nm was 0.8–1.0. About 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the liquid culture, and the cells were cultured overnight. After two freeze-thaw treatments, the harvested cells were suspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated for 1 h (all experiments were done at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated). To decrease the viscosity of cell lysates, 3 mm MgCl2 and 20 units/ml DNase I were added to digest DNA. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min). Unwanted protein in the supernatant was precipitated by adding 3% TCA and adjusting to pH 5.3 with 10 n NaOH, and removed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min). CaM in the supernatant was precipitated by increasing TCA to 6% and collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min). The pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (adjusting pH with 1 m Tris-base). After dialyzing against 1 liter of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 1 mm DTT) overnight and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 cm × 11 cm). After washing with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with 120 ml of Buffer-A containing a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mm. The fractions containing CaM were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer D (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT), and stored at −80 °C. CaM concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm (1A280 is equal to 5.26 mg/ml CaM). CaM-C (the C-lobe of CaM, aa 80–148) was prepared similarly to wild type CaM, except that 2 m NaCl instead of 0.3 m NaCl was used for binding of CaM-C with phenyl-Sepharose. CaM-C concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm (1A280 is equal to 3.28 mg/ml CaM-C). CaM-N (the N-lobe of CaM, aa 1–79) was prepared by precipitation with TCA without chromatography. Briefly, BL21(DE3) was transformed with CaM-N in pT7 expression vector and then cultured in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and induced by IPTG. After two freeze-thaw treatments, the harvested cells were suspended in 80 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated for 1 h and digested with DNase as above. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min). Unwanted protein in the supernatant was precipitated by adding 3% TCA and adjusting to pH 5.3 with 10 n NaOH, and removed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min). The TCA concentration in the supernatant was increased to 6% to precipitate the remaining unwanted proteins, which were removed by centrifugation. CaM-N in the supernatant was then precipitated by increasing TCA to 10% and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in ∼1 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a Sephadex G25 column preequilibrated with Buffer-D for buffer exchange. Since CaM-N does not contain aromatic amino acid residues, its protein concentration was estimated by SDS-PAGE (4–20%) with purified CaM-C as standard. The ATPase activity of myosin 5a was measured in a plate-based, ATP regeneration system as described previously with slight modification (11.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Wang Q. Ikebe R. Craig R. Ikebe M. The globular tail domain puts on the brake to stop the ATPase cycle of myosin Va.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the ATPase activities of myosin 5a were measured in a solution containing 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 12 μm CaM, 0.5 mm ATP, 2.5 mm PEP, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20–50 nm truncated myosin 5a, 40 μm actin, various concentrations of GST-GTD, and 1 mm EGTA at 25 °C. For pCa4 conditions, 1 mm EGTA was replaced by 0.87 mm EGTA and 1 mm CaCl2. To measure the ATPase activity of MD-IQ1 with CaM variant, the corresponding CaM variant was included in the assay in place of wild type CaM. The inhibition of ATPase activities by GST-GTD was fitted with a quadratic equation or hyperbolic equation to obtain the Kd between the myosin 5a head and GST-GTD as described previously (11.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Wang Q. Ikebe R. Craig R. Ikebe M. The globular tail domain puts on the brake to stop the ATPase cycle of myosin Va.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Purified myosin 5a constructs were incubated with rabbit skeletal actin (10 μm) in a 50 μl solution consisting of 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 12 μm CaM WT, or mutants, and 1 mm EGTA (1 mm EGTA was replaced with 0.87 mm EGTA and 1 mm CaCl2 for pCa4 conditions) at 0 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged in a benchtop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Optima MAX-XP) at 80,000 rpm for 10 min at 0 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-gel sample buffer (containing 5 mm EGTA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amounts of the myosin 5 heavy chain and CaM were determined by NIH Image J 1.42Q (Bethesda, MD). CaM and its variants display unique electrophoretic mobility shift in SDS-PAGE in response to Ca2+ (24.Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. High affinity Ca2+ binding sites of calmodulin are critical for the regulation of myosin Ibeta motor function.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Before applied to SDS-PAGE (15%), the purified CaM variants and the purified MD-IQ1 coexpressed with CaM variants were incubated with 5 mm EGTA or 5 mm CaCl2 on ice for 30 min, then mixed with SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To investigate the regulation of myosin 5a, we produced a number of truncated myosin 5a (Fig. 1). We coexpressed the truncated myosin-5 with CaM and purified them with Anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. The apparent molecular masses of the truncated myosins in SDS-PAGE agree well with the calculated values based on their sequences. All truncated myosins, except MD, were copurified with CaM (supplemental Fig. S1). It is known that the association of CaM with IQ2 of myosin 5a is regulated by Ca2+, and it was proposed that the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin 5a is via the CaM in IQ2 (13.Homma K. Saito J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23316-23325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we created M5aΔT-IQ26, a truncated myosin 5a having the globular tail domain (GTD) deleted and the IQ2 substituted with IQ6 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). We found that the actin-activated ATPase activity of M5aΔT-IQ26 is still inhibited by the GST-GTD in a Ca2+-dependent manner, similar to that of M5aΔT with its authentic IQ motifs (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, the substitution of IQ2 with IQ6 does not alter the regulation of myosin 5a. It is possible that, similar to that of IQ2, the association of CaM with IQ6 is also regulated by Ca2+; thus the substitution of IQ2 with IQ6 does not alter the regulation. To test this possibility, we created MD-IQ1/6 by substituting IQ2 in MD-IQ1/2 with IQ6 (Fig. 1), and measured the association of CaM with MD-IQ1/2 and MD-IQ1/6. We found that high Ca2+ dissociates 43% CaM from MD-IQ1/2 and less than 5% CaM from MD-IQ1/6 (supplemental Fig. S3). These results are consistent with previous report, that IQ6 has high affinity to CaM in either low or high Ca2+ conditions (25.Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Calmodulin bridging of IQ motifs in myosin-V.FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ca2+-dependent dissociation of CaM from IQ2 is not responsible for the regulation of myosin-5a. We previously found that the strong inhibition by the GTD requires the double-headed structure and an intact first coiled-coil segment (10.Li X.D. Jung H.S. Mabuchi K. Craig R. Ikebe M.

However, as pointed out by Thirumurugan et al. (9.Thirumurugan K. Sakamoto T. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Sellers J.R. Knight P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2043871531,"Phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms for posttranscriptional modification of proteins. The addition of a compact, negatively charged moiety to a protein can significantly change its function and localization by affecting its structure and interaction network. We have used all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the structural consequences of phosphorylating the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) residue Ser(936), which is the best characterized phosphorylation site in NKA, targeted in vivo by protein kinase A (PKA). The Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that Ser(936) phosphorylation opens a C-terminal hydrated pathway leading to Asp(926), a transmembrane residue proposed to form part of the third sodium ion-binding site. Simulations of a S936E mutant form, for which only subtle effects are observed when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied with electrophysiology, does not mimic the effects of Ser(936) phosphorylation. The results establish a structural association of Ser(936) with the C terminus of NKA and indicate that phosphorylation of Ser(936) can modulate pumping activity by changing the accessibility to the ion-binding site."

The toxin belongs to a family of peptide that folds according to an inhibitor cystine knot motif and thus contains three disulfide bridges with a Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys5, and Cys3-Cys6 connecting pattern (2.Mosbah A.

The solution structure, as defined by 1H NMR, illustrates that MCa contains three β-strands (strand 1 from amino acid residues 9–11, strand 2 from 20–23, and strand 3 from 30–33). One distinctiveness of MCa is the fact that it is greatly enriched in basic amino acid residues. Of the 33 amino acids that compose MCa, 12 of them are basic, most of them represented by Lys residues. Interestingly, the β-strands of MCa encompass most of the basic domains (see Fig. 1A). MCa turned to be of interest to our research group for several reasons. First, it is an exquisite pharmacological activator of the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) from skeletal muscle because it promotes high Po gating modes and long lasting subconductance states of the ion channel (3.Chen L.

Third, and this is the scope of this paper, MCa has been shown to act as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) (10.Estève E. Mabrouk K. Dupuis A. Smida-Rezgui S. Altafaj X. Grunwald D. Platel J.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This discovery stemmed from earlier criticisms that MCa may not be an activator of RyR1 because peptide toxins were not known to cross the plasma membrane, which would be required here to bind to RyR1. Studies that were undertaken to demonstrate the ability of MCa to reach its target showed that (i) MCa triggers Ca2+ release from the SR a few seconds after its application in the extracellular medium (5.Estève E.

Since these pioneering studies, MCa or analogues thereof proved powerful vectors for the cell entry of proteins, peptides (11.Ram N. Weiss N. Texier-Nogues I. Aroui S. Andreotti N. Pirollet F.

Although the mode of cell penetration of MCa may vary according to cargo nature, cell type, or chemical linkage employed, the data gathered so far suggest that the peptide may enter cells according to two priming steps onto the plasma membrane: first an interaction with proteoglycans with an affinity in the micromolar range, followed by a second interaction with negatively charged lipids which occurs with greater affinity (16.Boisseau S. Mabrouk K. Ram N. Garmy N. Collin V. Tadmouri A. Mikati M. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. Fantini J. De Waard M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24274-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mode of cell entry of MCa is not altered by the absence of proteoglycans, but simply reduced quantitatively, suggesting that proteoglycans do not orient the mode of cell penetration. Two modes seem to concur to MCa cell entry, as far as observed, one related to macropinocytosis and another to membrane translocation. The balance between both modes of entry was found correlated to cargo nature and the type of MCa analogue used. It is of great interest to pursue the study of MCa as CPP despite the wealth of new CPP sequences that are discovered yearly. Among the competitive advantage of MCa over other CPP sequences are the facts that it has almost no associated toxicity in vitro and in vivo, penetrates into cells at very low concentrations, and is extremely stable in vivo upon intravenous injection (over 24 h). 4C.

De Waard, unpublished data. maurocalcine 2-aminobutyric acid cell-penetrating peptide folded N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ryanodine receptor sarcoplasmic reticulum unfolded. Although MCa appears as an elaborate and efficient CPP, its pharmacological properties represent a serious hindrance while envisioning in vitro and in vivo applications. In addition, because of its length (33 amino acid residues) and the presence of three disulfide bridges, MCa is a relatively difficult to synthesize CPP, compared with other CPPs, and would benefit from a downsizing approach. Several strategies have been employed successfully in the past to overcome one or both of these issues. The first strategy was based on single-point mutations of the MCa sequence. This strategy preserved the disulfide bridges and the three-dimensional structure of the analogues. Overall, mutations affected more seriously the pharmacology of MCa than the cell penetration properties (18.Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Critical amino acid residues of maurocalcine involved in pharmacology, lipid interaction and cell penetration.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Many of the amino acids involved in RyR1 binding and pharmacology were located within the cluster of basic amino acids that presented sequence homology with the L-type Cav1.1 channel. Some of these residues, but not all, were also important for cell penetration properties. Hence, several analogues could be defined that kept close to intact cell penetration properties while entirely losing their pharmacological action (MCa R24A for instance). Some other analogues were actually better than MCa itself for cell penetration, suggesting that pairs of mutations, aiming at disrupting pharmacology and improving penetration, may be used in the future to define still better CPP analogues of MCa. The second strategy, which has yield success, is based on the chemical synthesis of d-MCa, an analogue entirely based on the use of d-amino acids. This peptide is a mirror image of the natural l-MCa but, like other d-CPPs, preserves its cell penetration properties while losing entirely its ability to interact with RyR1 (19.Poillot C. Dridi K. Bichraoui H. Pêcher J. Alphonse S. Douzi B. Ronjat M. Darbon H. De Waard M. d-Maurocalcine, a pharmacologically inert efficient cell-penetrating peptide analogue.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34168-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This method has several advantages. It no longer is sensitive to proteases that may be an additional advantage for in vivo experiments where the half-life of the circulating peptide matters. It is also possible to improve this analog by introducing point mutations shown previously to improve cell penetration (19.Poillot C. Dridi K. Bichraoui H. Pêcher J. Alphonse S. Douzi B. Ronjat M. Darbon H. De Waard M. d-Maurocalcine, a pharmacologically inert efficient cell-penetrating peptide analogue.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34168-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In these two strategies, although being effective, one may argue that (i) the peptides are still among the longest CPP known to date, implying increased costs of production, and (ii) the yield of production of these peptides is hampered by the folding process. Also, the use of peptides with internal disulfide bridges, despite have advantageous features in term of stability in vivo, makes chemical coupling of these CPPs to cargoes more complicated (difficulty to add extra Cys residues to the peptides for instance without interfering with the correct folding process). The third strategy that was used to circumvent one of this criticism was the chemical synthesis of an MCa analog in which all internal Cys residues were replaced by isosteric 2-aminobutyric acid residues (11.Ram N. Weiss N. Texier-Nogues I. Aroui S. Andreotti N. Pirollet F. Ronjat M. Sabatier J.M. Darbon H. Jacquemond V. De Waard M. Design of a disulfide-less, pharmacologically inert, and chemically competent analog of maurocalcine for the efficient transport of impermeant compounds into cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27048-27056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide was still 33-mer long but one step in production was saved by avoiding the folding process. In addition, an extra-Cys residue could be added to the N terminus of the peptide to favor simplified cargo grafting on this CPP analogue. This peptide, termed here C-MCaUF1–33 (C for extra-Cys, UF for unfolded, and 1–33 for its length; see Fig. 1B) no longer has any secondary structures, but efficiently penetrates into cells. Interestingly also, the peptide completely lacks pharmacological activity, indicating that folding and secondary structures are essential for binding onto RyR1. Although this peptide is an efficient CPP, it remains less potent than MCa in its folded version, suggesting that further optimization should be brought to this analogue. Such optimization appears feasible on the basis of the fact that MCa fulfills three different functions (pharmacology, obligation to resemble the L-type channel, and cell penetration). We reasoned that because only cell penetration was the quality we searched for, the peptide could be further simplified and novel analogues be designed. In this study, we undertook to identify new more potent MCa analogues with three criteria in mind. First, these analogues should be shorter than the folded version of MCa (MCaF) or the unfolded version (MCaUF). Second, these peptides should be designed to better delimitate the domains of MCa responsible for cell penetration. Third, we should be able to design analogues with extra free SH functions for cargo grafting. We present several new analogues that have highly potent cell penetration capabilities, while losing pharmacological activity, preserving lack of cell toxicity, and with facilitated cargo grafting. This new generation of MCa analogues is predicted to have bright futures for CPP applications in vitro and in vivo. N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acid, Wang-Tentagel resin, and reagents used for peptide syntheses were obtained from Iris Biotech. Solvents were analytical grade products from Acros Organics. Cy5 maleimide mono-reactive dye was purchased from GE Healthcare. Chemical syntheses of MCa analogues were performed as described previously (19.Poillot C. Dridi K. Bichraoui H. Pêcher J. Alphonse S. Douzi B. Ronjat M. Darbon H. De Waard M. d-Maurocalcine, a pharmacologically inert efficient cell-penetrating peptide analogue.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34168-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, analogues of MCa were chemically synthesized by the solid phase method (20.Merrifield R.B. Solid-phase peptide synthesis.Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1969; 32: 221-296PubMed Google Scholar) using an automated peptide synthesizer (CEM© Liberty). Peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.24 meq of Fmoc-d-Arg-Pbf-Wang-Tentagel resin using 0.24 mmol of Fmoc l-amino acid derivatives. The side chain protecting groups were: Trityl for Cys and Asn; tert-butyl for Ser, Thr, Glu, and Asp; Pbf for Arg; and tert-butylcarbonyl for Lys. Reagents were at the following concentrations: Fmoc-amino acids (0.2 m Fmoc-AA-OH in dimethylformamide), activator (0.5 m 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate in dimethyformamide), activator base (2 m diisopropylethylamine in N-methyl-pyrrolidone) and deprotecting agent (5% piperazine/0.1 m 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in dimethyformamide), as advised by PepDriver (CEM©). After peptide chain assembly, resins were treated 4 h at room temperature with a mixture of TFA/water/triisopropylsilan/dithiothreitol (DTT) (92.5/2.5/2.5/2.5). The peptide mixtures were then filtered, and the filtrates were precipitated by adding cold t-butylmethyl ether. The crude peptides were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatants were discarded. MCa analogues were purified by HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (218TP1010, 25 × 10 cm). Elutions of the peptides were performed with a 10–60% acetonitrile linear gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The purified fractions were analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC (Vydac C18 column 218TP104, 25 × 4.6 cm). All analogues were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Each peptide was labeled with Cy5 according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). Peptides were dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.3. 300 μl of the solubilized peptides was added to Cy5-maleimide-containing tubes. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then purified by HPLC using an analytical Vydac C18 column. Elution of the Cy5-labeled peptides was performed with a 10–60% acetonitrile linear gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The pure peak fractions were lyophilized and peptides quantified by UV spectrophotometer at 649 nm. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and F98 cell lines (from ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in F-12 nutrient medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v, CHO) or 2% (v/v, F98) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into 96-well micro plates at a density of ∼8 × 104 cells/well. After 2 days of culture, the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with MCa analogues at a concentration of 10 μm. Control wells containing cell culture medium alone or with cells, both without peptide addition, were included in each experiment. 0.1% saponin was used as toxic agent for comparison. The cells were then incubated with MTT for 30 min. Conversion of MTT into purple colored MTT formazan by the living cells indicates the extent of cell viability. The crystals were dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide, and the optical density was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (Biotek ELx-800; Mandel Scientific Inc.) for quantification of cell viability. All assays were run in triplicate. For analysis of the subcellular localization of MCa-Cy5 analogues in living cells, cell cultures were incubated with the fluorescent peptides for 2 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. The plasma membrane was stained with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A (Molecular Probes) for 5 min. Cells were washed once more. Live cells were then immediately analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SPE operating system. Rhodamine (580 nm) and Cy5 (670 nm) were sequentially excited, and emission fluorescence was collected in z-confocal planes of 10–15-nm steps. CHO cells were incubated with various concentrations of Cy5-labeled peptides in F-12K culture medium without serum at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS to remove excess extracellular peptide and treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C to detach cells from the surface and centrifuged at 200 × g before suspension in PBS. For experiments with the macropinocytosis inhibitor, amiloride, CHO cells were initially washed with F-12K and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm amiloride (Sigma). The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 μm Cy5-MCa analogues. For all of these experimental conditions, flow cytometry analyses were performed with live cells using a Becton Dickinson FACS LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were obtained and analyzed using FCS express software (De Novo). Live cells were gated by forward/side scattering from a total of 10,000 events. Heavy SR vesicles were prepared following the method of Kim et al. (21.Kim D.H. Ohnishi S.T. Ikemoto N. Kinetic studies of calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method. Heavy SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in an assay buffer composed of 10 nm [3H]ryanodine, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2 (pCa = 5), and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Truncated MCa analogues were added prior to the addition of heavy SR vesicles. [3H]Ryanodine bound to heavy SR vesicles was measured by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass filters followed by three washes with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. [3H]Ryanodine retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 80 μm unlabeled ryanodine. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. All data are given as mean ± S.D. for n number of observations, and statistical significance (p) was calculated using Student's t test. Fig. 1A illustrates the primary structure of MCa with its secondary structures (β-strands) and its pattern of disulfide bridges. This peptide will be termed MCaF, for folded (F) MCa. An earlier report has demonstrated that replacing the six internal cysteine residues of MCa by Abu residues results in a pharmacologically inert and unfolded (UF) CPP (MCaUF1–33, Fig. 1B). This peptide loses its secondary structures (11.Ram N. Weiss N. Texier-Nogues I. Aroui S. Andreotti N. Pirollet F. Ronjat M. Sabatier J.M. Darbon H. Jacquemond V. De Waard M.

Because this project aims at identifying shorter CPP sequences based on MCaUF1–33 sequence by the delivery of Cy5 cargo, we first determined where at the N terminus (C-MCaUF1–33) or C terminus (MCaUF1–33-C) the cargo could be best grafted after addition of an extra cysteine residue (C) (Fig. 1B). As shown, both vector-cargo complexes Cy5-C-MCaUF1–33 and MCaUF1–33-C-Cy5 penetrated efficiently within CHO cells, as estimated by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C) or by FACS (Fig. 1D). At 3 μm, a slightly better cell penetration was observed with Cy5 localized at the C terminus of MCaUF1–33, but this difference was not significant. Because chemical syntheses of truncated MCaUF1–33 analogues was facilitated by adding the extra cysteine residue at the C terminus of the sequence rather than a"
https://openalex.org/W1993572220,"Steroid receptors (SRs) are the largest family of metazoan transcription factors and control genes involved in development, endocrine signaling, reproduction, immunity, and cancer. The entire hormone receptor system is driven by a molecular switch triggered by the binding of small lipophilic ligands. This makes the SRs ideal pharmaceutical targets, yet even the best clinically approved synthetic steroidal agonists are prone to cross-reactivity and off-target pharmacology. The mechanism underlying this promiscuity is derived from the fact that SRs share common structural features derived from their evolutionary relationship. More often than not, rational attempts to probe SR drug selectivity via mutagenesis fail even when high quality structural and functional data are available due to the fact that important mutations often result in nonfunctional receptors. This highlights the fact that SRs suffer from instability, preventing in-depth mutational analysis and hampering crystallization of key receptor-ligand complexes. We have taken a unique approach to address this problem by using a resurrected ancestral protein to determine the structure of a previously intractable complex and identified the structural mechanisms that confer activation and selectivity for a widely used glucocorticoid, mometasone furoate. Moreover, we have identified a single residue located outside of the ligand-binding pocket that controls mometasone furoate antagonism versus agonism in the human mineralocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1984022930,"Alternative splicing of the smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (Mypt1) exon 23 (E23) is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated and, thus, an attractive model for the study of smooth muscle phenotypic specification. We have proposed that Tra2β functions as a tissue-specific activator of Mypt1 E23 splicing on the basis of concordant expression patterns and Tra2β activation of Mypt1 E23 mini-gene splicing in vitro. In this study we examined the relationship between Tra2β and Mypt1 E23 splicing in vivo in the mouse. Tra2β was 2- to 5-fold more abundant in phasic smooth muscle tissues, such as the portal vein, small intestine, and small mesenteric artery, in which Mypt1 E23 is predominately included as compared with the tonic smooth muscle tissues, such as the aorta and inferior vena cava, in which Mypt1 E23 is predominately skipped. Tra2β was up-regulated in the small intestine postnatally, concordant with a switch to Mypt1 E23 splicing. Targeting of Tra2β in smooth muscle cells using SM22α-Cre caused a substantial reduction in Mypt1 E23 inclusion specifically in the intestinal smooth muscle of heterozygotes, indicating sensitivity to Tra2β gene dosage. The switch to the Mypt1 E23 skipped isoform coding for the C-terminal leucine zipper motif caused increased sensitivity of the muscle to the relaxant effects of 8-Br-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). We conclude that Tra2β is necessary for the tissue-specific splicing of Mypt1 E23 in the phasic intestinal smooth muscle. Tra2β, by regulating the splicing of Mypt1 E23, sets the sensitivity of smooth muscle to cGMP-mediated relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2069891698,"Being an obligate aerobe, Mycobacterium tuberculosis faces a number of energetic challenges when it encounters hypoxia and environmental stress during intracellular infection. Consequently, it has evolved innovative strategies to cope with these unfavorable conditions. Here, we report a novel flavohemoglobin (MtbFHb) from M. tuberculosis that exhibits unique features within its heme and reductase domains distinct from conventional FHbs, including the absence of the characteristic hydrogen bonding interactions within the proximal heme pocket and mutations in the FAD and NADH binding regions of the reductase domain. In contrast to conventional FHbs, it has a hexacoordinate low-spin heme with a proximal histidine ligand lacking imidazolate character and a distal heme pocket with a relatively low electrostatic potential. Additionally, MtbFHb carries a new FAD binding site in its reductase domain similar to that of D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH). When overexpressed in Escherichia coli or Mycobacterium smegmatis, MtbFHb remained associated with the cell membrane and exhibited D-lactate:phenazine methosulfate reductase activity and oxidized D-lactate into pyruvate by converting the heme iron from Fe(3+) to Fe(2+) in a FAD-dependent manner, indicating electron transfer from D-lactate to the heme via FAD cofactor. Under oxidative stress, MtbFHb-expressing cells exhibited growth advantage with reduced levels of lipid peroxidation. Given the fact that D-lactate is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation and that M. tuberculosis lacks the gene encoding D-LDH, we propose that the novel D-lactate metabolizing activity of MtbFHb uniquely equips M. tuberculosis to balance the stress level by protecting the cell membrane from oxidative damage via cycling between the Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) redox states."
https://openalex.org/W1991639177,"Human aldo-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) and AKR1C enzymes are essential for bile acid biosynthesis and steroid hormone metabolism. AKR1D1 catalyzes the 5β-reduction of Δ4-3-ketosteroids, whereas AKR1C enzymes are hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs). These enzymes share high sequence identity and catalyze 4-pro-(R)-hydride transfer from NADPH to an electrophilic carbon but differ in that one residue in the conserved AKR catalytic tetrad, His120 (AKR1D1 numbering), is substituted by a glutamate in AKR1D1. We find that the AKR1D1 E120H mutant abolishes 5β-reductase activity and introduces HSD activity. However, the E120H mutant unexpectedly favors dihydrosteroids with the 5α-configuration and, unlike most of the AKR1C enzymes, shows a dominant stereochemical preference to act as a 3β-HSD as opposed to a 3α-HSD. The catalytic efficiency achieved for 3β-HSD activity is higher than that observed for any AKR to date. High resolution crystal structures of the E120H mutant in complex with epiandrosterone, 5β-dihydrotestosterone, and Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione elucidated the structural basis for this functional change. The glutamate-histidine substitution prevents a 3-ketosteroid from penetrating the active site so that hydride transfer is directed toward the C3 carbonyl group rather than the Δ4-double bond and confers 3β-HSD activity on the 5β-reductase. Structures indicate that stereospecificity of HSD activity is achieved because the steroid flips over to present its α-face to the A-face of NADPH. This is in contrast to the AKR1C enzymes, which can invert stereochemistry when the steroid swings across the binding pocket. These studies show how a single point mutation in AKR1D1 can introduce HSD activity with unexpected configurational and stereochemical preference.

https://openalex.org/W1986843752,"Recognition of microbial molecules by mammalian host receptors is essential to mount an immune response. Hexaacylated LPS is the prototypic example of a bacterial molecule recognized by the receptor complex TLR4/MD-2 with its lipid A moiety, whereas bacterial lipopeptides are recognized by TLR2. Here we show that a series of synthetic triacylated lipid A-like molecules are weak Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (mainly TLR2 agonists) but very potent TLR4/MD-2 antagonists (submicromolar range). Not only do they block human cell responses to LPS but also to whole gram-negative bacteria, and they inhibit the phagocytosis of gram-negative bacteria. These compounds may represent promising immunomodulatory agents."
https://openalex.org/W2035077297,"Immunosuppression via cell-cell contact with apoptotic cells is a well studied immunological phenomenon. Although the original studies of immune repression used primary cells, which undergo spontaneous cell death or apoptosis in response to irradiation, more recent studies have relied on chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis in cell lines. In this work, we demonstrate that Jurkat cells induced to die with actinomycin D suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, whereas cells treated with etoposide did not. This immune repression mediated by actinomycin D-treated cells did not require phagocytosis or cell-cell contact and thus occurs through a different mechanism from that seen with primary apoptotic neutrophils. Moreover, cells induced to die with etoposide and then treated for a short time with actinomycin D also suppressed macrophage responses, indicating that suppression was mediated by actinomycin D independent of the mechanism of cell death. Finally, phagocytosis of actinomycin D-treated cells caused apoptosis in macrophages, and suppression could be blocked by inhibition of caspase activity in the target macrophage. Together, these data indicate that apoptotic cells act as ""Trojan horses,"" delivering actinomycin D to engulfing macrophages. Suppression of cytokine production by macrophages is therefore due to exposure to actinomycin D from apoptotic cells and is not the result of cell-receptor interactions. These data suggest that drug-induced death may not be an appropriate surrogate for the immunosuppressive activity of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, these effects of cytotoxic drugs on infiltrating immune phagocytes may have clinical ramifications for their use as antitumor therapies."
