https://openalex.org/W2006607885,"Background Natural products have been an important source of lead compounds for drug discovery. How to find and evaluate bioactive natural products is critical to the achievement of drug/lead discovery from natural products. Methodology We collected 19,7201 natural products structures, reported biological activities and virtual screening results. Principal component analysis was employed to explore the chemical space, and we found that there was a large portion of overlap between natural products and FDA-approved drugs in the chemical space, which indicated that natural products had large quantity of potential lead compounds. We also explored the network properties of natural product-target networks and found that polypharmacology was greatly enriched to those compounds with large degree and high betweenness centrality. In order to make up for a lack of experimental data, high throughput virtual screening was employed. All natural products were docked to 332 target proteins of FDA-approved drugs. The most potential natural products for drug discovery and their indications were predicted based on a docking score-weighted prediction model. Conclusions Analysis of molecular descriptors, distribution in chemical space and biological activities of natural products was conducted in this article. Natural products have vast chemical diversity, good drug-like properties and can interact with multiple cellular target proteins."

This study characterized the fecal microbiota in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The relationship between microbiota changes and changes in hepatic steatosis was also studied.Fecal microbiota of histology-proven NASH patients and healthy controls was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing. NASH patients were from a previously reported randomized trial on probiotic treatment. Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to monitor changes in intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG).A total of 420,344 16S sequences with acceptable quality were obtained from 16 NASH patients and 22 controls. NASH patients had lower fecal abundance of Faecalibacterium and Anaerosporobacter but higher abundance of Parabacteroides and Allisonella. Partial least-square discriminant analysis yielded a model of 10 genera that discriminated NASH patients from controls. At month 6, 6 of 7 patients in the probiotic group and 4 of 9 patients in the usual care group had improvement in IHTG (P=0.15). Improvement in IHTG was associated with a reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes (R(2)=0.4820, P=0.0028) and increase in Bacteroidetes (R(2)=0.4366, P=0.0053). This was accompanied by corresponding changes at the class, order and genus levels. In contrast, bacterial biodiversity did not differ between NASH patients and controls, and did not change with probiotic treatment.NASH patients have fecal dysbiosis, and changes in microbiota correlate with improvement in hepatic steatosis. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanism underlying the interaction between gut microbes and the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1998330439,"Next-generation-sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of genome assembly because of its much higher data throughput and much lower cost compared with traditional Sanger sequencing. However, NGS poses new computational challenges to de novo genome assembly. Among the challenges, GC bias in NGS data is known to aggravate genome assembly. However, it is not clear to what extent GC bias affects genome assembly in general. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis on the effects of GC bias on genome assembly. Our analyses reveal that GC bias only lowers assembly completeness when the degree of GC bias is above a threshold. At a strong GC bias, the assembly fragmentation due to GC bias can be explained by the low coverage of reads in the GC-poor or GC-rich regions of a genome. This effect is observed for all the assemblers under study. Increasing the total amount of NGS data thus rescues the assembly fragmentation because of GC bias. However, the amount of data needed for a full rescue depends on the distribution of GC contents. Both low and high coverage depths due to GC bias lower the accuracy of assembly. These pieces of information provide guidance toward a better de novo genome assembly in the presence of GC bias."
https://openalex.org/W1996064094,"Aquaculture is an expanding activity worldwide. However its rapid growth can affect the aquatic environment through release of large amounts of chemicals, including antibiotics. Moreover, the presence of organic matter and bacteria of different origin can favor gene transfer and recombination. Whereas the consequences of such activities on environmental microbiota are well explored, little is known of their effects on allochthonous and potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as enterococci. Sediments from three sampling stations (two inside and one outside) collected in a fish farm in the Adriatic Sea were examined for enterococcal abundance and antibiotic resistance traits using the membrane filter technique and an improved quantitative PCR. Strains were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and gentamicin; samples were directly screened for selected tetracycline [tet(M), tet(L), tet(O)] and macrolide [erm(A), erm(B) and mef] resistance genes by newly-developed multiplex PCRs. The abundance of benthic enterococci was higher inside than outside the farm. All isolates were susceptible to the four antimicrobials tested, although direct PCR evidenced tet(M) and tet(L) in sediment samples from all stations. Direct multiplex PCR of sediment samples cultured in rich broth supplemented with antibiotic (tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin or gentamicin) highlighted changes in resistance gene profiles, with amplification of previously undetected tet(O), erm(B) and mef genes and an increase in benthic enterococcal abundance after incubation in the presence of ampicillin and gentamicin. Despite being limited to a single farm, these data indicate that aquaculture may influence the abundance and spread of benthic enterococci and that farm sediments can be reservoirs of dormant antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including enterococci, which can rapidly revive in presence of new inputs of organic matter. This reservoir may constitute an underestimated health risk and deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2158461066,"Aim The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and patterns of exposure to antidepressants before, during and after pregnancy in a cohort including all pregnant women in Denmark between 1997 and 2010. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study including 912 322 pregnancies. Information was retrieved from the Danish Birth Registry and The Register of Medicinal Product Statistics to identify women redeeming an antidepressant prescription during pregnancy. Exposure periods were based on standard treatment doses and dispensed pack sizes. Results We identified 19 740 pregnancies exposed to an antidepressant at some point during pregnancy. The rate of exposure increased from 0.2% in 1997 to 3.2% in 2010. We found that the rate of exposure was halved during the first 3 months of pregnancy. In contrast, we describe a clear increase in exposure after pregnancy among pre-delivery treatment-naïve women. Conclusions In spite of uncertainty concerning antidepressants’ safety during pregnancy we find a 16-fold increase in exposure rates between 1997 and 2010. The rates describe a sharp decrease in exposure during pregnancy that is probably caused by physicians’ hesitation to prescribe antidepressants and women’s fear of unwanted effects on the unborn child. More studies are needed to clarify the consequences of antidepressant discontinuation during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2083474780,"Neuropeptide kisspeptin has been suggested to be an essential central regulator of reproduction in response to changes in serum gonadal steroid concentrations. However, in spite of wide kisspeptin receptor distribution in the brain, especially in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, the research focus has mostly been confined to the kisspeptin regulation on GnRH neurons. Here, by using medaka whose kisspeptin (kiss1) neurons have been clearly demonstrated to be regulated by sex steroids, we analyzed the anatomical distribution of kisspeptin receptors Gpr54-1 and Gpr54-2. Because the both receptors were shown to be activated by kisspeptins (Kiss1 and Kiss2), we analyzed the anatomical distribution of the both receptors by in situ hybridization. They were mainly expressed in the ventral telencephalon, preoptic area, and hypothalamus, which have been suggested to be involved in homeostatic functions including reproduction. First, we found gpr54-2 mRNA expression in nucleus preopticus pars magnocellularis and demonstrated that vasotocin and isotocin (Vasopressin and Oxytocin ortholog, respectively) neurons express gpr54-2 by dual in situ hybridization. Given that kisspeptin administration increases serum oxytocin and vasopressin concentration in mammals, the present finding are likely to be vertebrate-wide phenomenon, although direct regulation has not yet been demonstrated in mammals. We then analyzed co-expression of kisspeptin receptors in three types of GnRH neurons. It was clearly demonstrated that gpr54-expressing cells were located adjacent to GnRH1 neurons, although they were not GnRH1 neurons themselves. In contrast, there was no gpr54-expressing cell in the vicinities of neuromodulatory GnRH2 or GnRH3 neurons. From these results, we suggest that medaka kisspeptin neurons directly regulate some behavioral and neuroendocrine functions via vasotocin/isotocin neurons, whereas they do not regulate hypophysiotropic GnRH1 neurons at least in a direct manner. Thus, direct kisspeptin regulation of GnRH1 neurons proposed in mammals may not be the universal feature of vertebrate kisspeptin system in general."
https://openalex.org/W2046174396,"The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is overexpressed and highly associated with poor prognosis in many malignancies. However, the role of HSP90 in gastric cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of HSP90 expression with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in advanced gastric cancer, and estimate the alteration of HSP90 expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. HSP90 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) antigen expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 322 advanced gastric carcinoma samples. The relationships between HSP90 and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis were analyzed. The response of HSP90 level was assessed in chemotherapeutic effect in 54 patients received 1–2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The positive expression of HSP90 was found to be 69.6% in 322 advanced gastric carcinoma samples. HSP90 protein expression was significantly associated with depth invasion (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001) and stage of disease (P<0.001). The positive rates of HSP90 expression were higher in both prominent serosal invasion group (P<0.001) and lymph node metastasis group (P<0.001). Moreover, HSP90 was significantly correlated with MMP-9 among 322 gastric cancer tissues (P<0.001). In univariate and multivariate analyses, HSP90 was an independent prognostic factor for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). These results suggested that HSP90 may play an important role on tumor invasion, metastasis and prognosis, and might act as a promising target for prognostic prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2168853947,"Thyroid hormone induces tumor cell and blood vessel cell proliferation via a cell surface receptor on heterodimeric integrin αvβ3. We investigated the role of thyroid hormone-induced internalization of nuclear integrin αv monomer. Physiological concentration of thyroxine (free T4, 10(-10) M), but not 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), induced cellular internalization and nuclear translocation of integrin αv monomer in human non-small-cell lung cancer (H522) and ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3) cells. T4 did not complex with integrin αv monomer during its internalization. The αv monomer was phosphorylated by activated ERK1/2 when it heterodimerized with integrin β3 in vitro. Nuclear αv complexed with transcriptional coactivator proteins, p300 and STAT1, and with corepressor proteins, NCoR and SMRT. Nuclear αv monomer in T4-exposed cells, but not integrin β3, bound to promoters of specific genes that have important roles in cancer cells, including estrogen receptor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and thyroid hormone receptor β1 in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In summary, monomeric αv is a novel coactivator regulated from the cell surface by thyroid hormone for the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. This study also offers a mechanism for modulation of gene expression by thyroid hormone that is adjunctive to the nuclear hormone receptor (TR)-T3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1964263001,"Norovirus (NoV) P domain complexes, the 24 mer P particles and the P dimers, induced effective humoral immunity, but their role in the cellular immune responses remained unclear. We reported here a study on cellular immune responses of the two P domain complexes in comparison with the virus-like particle (VLP) of a GII.4 NoV (VA387) in mice. The P domain complexes induced significant central memory CD4(+) T cell phenotypes (CD4(+) CD44(+) CD62L(+) CCR7(+)) and activated polyclonal CD4(+) T cells as shown by production of Interleukin (IL)-2, Interferon (IFN)-γ, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α. Most importantly, VA387-specific CD4(+) T cell epitope induced a production of IFN-γ, indicating an antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell response in P domain complex-immunized mice. Furthermore, P domain complexes efficiently induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC) maturation, evidenced by up-regulation of co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules, as well as production of IL-12 and IL-1β. Finally, P domain complex-induced mature dendritic cells (DCs) elicited proliferation of specific CD4(+) T cells targeting VA387 P domain. Overall, we conclude that the NoV P domain complexes are efficiently presented by DCs to elicit not only humoral but also cellular immune responses against NoVs. Since the P particle is highly effective for both humoral and cellular immune responses and easily produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli), it is a good choice of vaccine against NoVs and a vaccine platform against other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2125174487,"There is a growing body of evidence that soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid β (Aβ) play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the importance of soluble Aβ oligomers as a therapeutic target for AD, the dynamic metabolism of these Aβ species in vivo has not been elucidated because of the difficulty in monitoring brain Aβ oligomers in living animals. Here, using a unique large pore-sized membrane microdialysis, we characterized soluble Aβ oligomers in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of awake, freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic and control WT mice. We could detect high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) Aβ oligomers in the brain ISF of living animals, which increased dramatically in an age-dependent manner (5- to 8-fold increase, 4 vs. 17-18 mo). Notably, HMW Aβ decreased more slowly than other forms of Aβ after acute γ-secretase inhibition [% decrease from the baseline (HMW vs. LMW) was 36.9 vs. 74.1% (Aβ40, P<0.05) and 25.4 vs. 88.0% (Aβ42, P<0.01)], suggesting that HMW Aβ oligomers clear more slowly than other forms from the brain. These data reveal the dynamic metabolism of neurotoxic Aβ oligomers in AD brain and could provide new insights into Aβ-targeted therapies for AD.—Takeda, S., Hashimoto, T., Roe, A. D., Hori, Y., Spires-Jones, T. L.and Hyman, B. T., Brain interstitial oligomeric amyloid β increases with age and is resistant to clearance from brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2041256522,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells can mediate humoral immune responses and augment autoimmunity, whereas the role of Tfh cells on regulatory B (B10) cells in autoimmunity diseases is not clear. Here, we investigated the percentages of Tfh cells and B10 cells in lupus-prone MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice and examined the effects and mechanism of Tfh cell-derived interleukin-21 (IL-21) on IL-10 production during the differentiation of B10 cells. Both Tfh cells and B10 cells were expanded in spleens of MRL/lpr mice. In addition, a positive correlation between the proportions of Tfh cells and B10 cells was observed. Tfh cell-derived IL-21 from MRL/lpr mice could promote IL-10 production during the differentiation of B10 cells. Importantly, neutralization of IL-21 inhibited IL-10 production and expansion of B10 cells both in vitro and in vivo. IL-21 induced IL-10 production via activation of phosphorylated signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3). Inhibition of p-STAT3 effectively blocked IL-10 production during the differentiation of B10 cells. Moreover, IL-21-induced IL-10 exerted a regulatory function by inhibiting the proliferation of T cells. These data suggest that Tfh cells not only mediate humoral immune responses and augment autoimmunity but also play a broader role in immune regulatory actions via the induction of IL-10 production."
https://openalex.org/W1969175586,"C1q/TNF-related protein 13 (CTRP13), a hormone secreted by adipose tissue (adipokines), helps regulate glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues. We previously reported that CTRP13 expression is increased in obese and hyperphagic leptin-deficient mice, suggesting that it may modulate food intake and body weight. CTRP13 is also expressed in the brain, although its role in modulating whole-body energy balance remains unknown. Here, we show that CTRP13 is a novel anorexigenic factor in the mouse brain. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that food restriction downregulates Ctrp13 expression in mouse hypothalamus, while high-fat feeding upregulates expression. Central administration of recombinant CTRP13 suppressed food intake and reduced body weight in mice. Further, CTRP13 and the orexigenic neuropeptide agouti-related protein (AgRP) reciprocally regulate each other's expression in the hypothalamus: central delivery of CTRP13 suppressed Agrp expression, while delivery of AgRP increased Ctrp13 expression. Food restriction alone reduced Ctrp13 and increased orexigenic neuropeptide gene (Npy and Agrp) expression in the hypothalamus; in contrast, when food restriction was coupled to enhanced physical activity in an activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model, hypothalamic expression of both Ctrp13 and Agrp were upregulated. Taken together, these results suggest that CTRP13 and AgRP form a hypothalamic feedback loop to modulate food intake and that this neural circuit may be disrupted in an anorexic-like condition."
https://openalex.org/W1981613222,"MicroRNAs (miRs) have been identified as potent regulators of both normal development and the hallmarks of cancer. Targeting of microRNAs has been shown to have preclinical promise, and select miR-based therapies are now in clinical trials. Ewing Sarcoma is a biologically aggressive pediatric cancer with little change in clinical outcomes despite improved chemotherapeutic regimens. There is a substantial need for new therapies to improve Ewing Sarcoma outcomes and to prevent chemotherapy-related secondary sequelae. Most Ewing Sarcoma tumors are driven by the EWS/Fli-1 fusion oncoprotein, acting as a gain-of-function transcription factor causing dysregulation of a variety of targets, including microRNAs. Our previous studies, and those of others, have identified upregulation of miRs belonging to the related miR-17∼92a, miR-106b∼25, and miR-106a∼363 clusters in Ewing Sarcoma. However, the functional consequences of this have not been characterized, nor has miR blockade been explored as an anti-cancer strategy in Ewing Sarcoma. To simulate a potential therapeutic approach, we examined the effects of blockade of these clusters, and their component miRs. Using colony formation as a read-out, we find that blockade of selected individual cluster component miRs, using specific inhibitors, has little or no effect. Combinatorial inhibition using miR “sponge” methodology, on the other hand, is inhibitory to colony formation, with blockade of whole clusters generally more effective than blockade of miR families. We show that a miR-blocking sponge directed against the poorly characterized miR-106a∼363 cluster is a particularly potent inhibitor of clonogenic growth in a subset of Ewing Sarcoma cell lines. We further identify upregulation of miR-15a as a downstream mechanism contributing to the miR-106a∼363 sponge growth-inhibitory effect. Taken together, our studies provide support for a pro-oncogenic role of the miR-106a∼363 cluster in Ewing Sarcoma, and identify miR-106a∼363 blockade, as well as miR-15a replacement, as possible strategies for inhibition of Ewing Sarcoma growth."
https://openalex.org/W2106842254,"Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in protein cross-linking and cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN). In cancer, TG2 induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, contributing to metastasis. Because cadherins bind β-catenin at cell-cell junctions, disruption of adherens junctions destabilizes cadherin-catenin complexes. The goal of the present study was to analyze whether and how TG2 interacts with and regulates β-catenin signaling in ovarian cancer (OC) cells. We observed a significant correlation between TG2 and β-catenin expression levels in OC cells and tumors. TG2 augmented Wnt/P-catenin signaling, as evidenced by enhanced β-catenin transcriptional activity, inducing transcription of target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. By promoting integrin-mediated cell adhesion to FN, TG2 physically associates with and recruits c-Src, which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin at Tyr654, releasing it from E-cadherin and rendering it available for transcriptional regulation. By interacting with FN and enhancing β-catenin signaling, complexed TG2 stimulates OC cell proliferation. In summary, our data demonstrate that TG2 regulates β-catenin expression and function in OC cells and define the c-Src-dependent mechanism through which this occurs.—Condello, S., Cao, L., Matei, D., Tissue transglutaminase regulates β-catenin signaling through a c-Src-dependent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W1977605451,"Lonicera japonica Thunb. is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, and antiviral pharmacological properties. The major active secondary metabolites of this plant are chlorogenic acid (CGA) and luteoloside. While the biosynthetic pathways of these metabolites are relatively well known, the genetic information available for this species, especially the biosynthetic pathways of its active ingredients, is limited.We obtained one million reads (average length of 400 bp) in a whole sequence run using a Roche/454 GS FLX titanium platform. Altogether, 85.69% of the unigenes covering the entire life cycle of the plant were annotated and 325 unigenes were assigned to secondary metabolic pathways. Moreover, 2039 unigenes were predicted as transcription factors. Nearly all of the possible enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of CGA and luteoloside were discovered in L. japonica. Three hydroxycinnamoyl transferase genes, including two hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase genes and one hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) gene featuring high similarity to known genes from other species, were cloned. The HCT gene was discovered for the first time in L. japonica. In addition, 188 candidate cytochrome P450 unigenes and 245 glycosyltransferase unigenes were found in the expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset.This study provides a high quality EST database for L. japonica by 454 pyrosequencing. Based on the EST annotation, a set of putative genes involved in CGA and luteoloside biosynthetic pathways were discovered. The database serves as an important source of public information on genetic markers, gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in L. japonica."
https://openalex.org/W1978772420,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a permanent disability in patients. To this day no curative treatment can be proposed to restore lost functions. Therefore, extensive experimental studies have been conducted to induce recovery after SCI. One of the most promising therapies is based on the use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). OECs can be obtained from either the olfactory bulbs (OB-OECs) or from olfactory mucosa (OM-OECs), involving a less invasive approach for autotransplantation. However the vast majority of experimental transplantations have been focusing on OB-OECs although the OM represents a more accessible source of OECs. Importantly, the ability of OM-OECs in comparison to OB-OECs to induce spinal cord recovery in the same lesion paradigm has never been described. We here present data using a multiparametric approach, based on electrophysiological, behavioral, histological and magnetic resonance imaging experiments on the repair potential of OB-OECs and OM-OECs from either primary or purified cultures after a severe model of SCI. Our data demonstrate that transplantation of OECs obtained from OB or OM induces electrophysiological and functional recovery, reduces astrocyte reactivity and glial scar formation and improves axonal regrowth. We also show that the purification step is essential for OM-OECs while not required for OB-OECs. Altogether, our study strongly indicates that transplantation of OECs from OM represents the best benefit/risk ratio according to the safety of access of OM and the results induced by transplantations of OM-OECs. Indeed, purified OM-OECs in addition to induce recovery can integrate and survive up to 60 days into the spinal cord. Therefore, our results provide strong support for these cells as a viable therapy for SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2061220655,"Recent advances in sensor and recording technology have allowed scientists to acquire very large time-series datasets. Researchers often analyze these datasets in the context of events, which are intervals of time where the properties of the signal change relative to a baseline signal. We have developed DETECT, a MATLAB toolbox for detecting event time intervals in long, multi-channel time series. Our primary goal is to produce a toolbox that is simple for researchers to use, allowing them to quickly train a model on multiple classes of events, assess the accuracy of the model, and determine how closely the results agree with their own manual identification of events without requiring extensive programming knowledge or machine learning experience. As an illustration, we discuss application of the DETECT toolbox for detecting signal artifacts found in continuous multi-channel EEG recordings and show the functionality of the tools found in the toolbox. We also discuss the application of DETECT for identifying irregular heartbeat waveforms found in electrocardiogram (ECG) data as an additional illustration."
https://openalex.org/W1977799249,"Drastic membrane reorganization occurs when mammalian sperm binds to and fuses with the oocyte membrane. Two oocyte protein families are essential for fertilization, tetraspanins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. The firsts are associated to tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and the seconds to lipid rafts. Here we report membrane raft involvement in mouse fertilization assessed by cholesterol modulation using methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Cholesterol removal induced: (1) a decrease of the fertilization rate and index; and (2) a delay in the extrusion of the second polar body. Cholesterol repletion recovered the fertilization ability of cholesterol-depleted oocytes, indicating reversibility of these effects. In vivo time-lapse analyses using fluorescent cholesterol permitted to identify the time-point at which the probe is mainly located at the plasma membrane enabling the estimation of the extent of the cholesterol depletion. We confirmed that the mouse oocyte is rich in rafts according to the presence of the raft marker lipid, ganglioside GM1 on the membrane of living oocytes and we identified the coexistence of two types of microdomains, planar rafts and caveolae-like structures, by terms of two differential rafts markers, flotillin-2 and caveolin-1, respectively. Moreover, this is the first report that shows characteristic caveolae-like invaginations in the mouse oocyte identified by electron microscopy. Raft disruption by cholesterol depletion disturbed the subcellular localization of the signal molecule c-Src and the inhibition of Src kinase proteins prevented second polar body extrusion, consistent with a role of Src-related kinases in fertilization via signaling complexes. Our data highlight the functional importance of intact membrane rafts for mouse fertilization and its dependence on cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1989637243,"The subcellular location and cell biological function of small GTPase Rab40c in mammalian cells have not been investigated in detail. In this study, we demonstrated that the exogenously expressed GFP-Rab40c associates with lipid droplets marked by neutral lipid specific dye Oil red or Nile red, but not with the Golgi or endosomal markers. Further examination demonstrated that Rab40c is also associated with ERGIC-53 containing structures, especially under the serum starvation condition. Rab40c is increasingly recruited to the surface of lipid droplets during lipid droplets formation and maturation in HepG2 cells. Rab40c knockdown moderately decreases the size of lipid droplets, suggesting that Rab40c is involved in the biogenesis of lipid droplets. Stimulation for adipocyte differentiation increases the expression of Rab40c in 3T3-L1 cells. Rab40c interacts with TIP47, and is appositionally associated with TIP47-labeled lipid droplets. In addition, over-expression of Rab40c causes the clustering of lipid droplets independent of its GTPase activity, but completely dependent of the intact SOCS box domain of Rab40c. In addition, Rab40c displayed self-interaction as well as interaction with TIP47 and the SOCS box is essential for its ability to induce clustering of lipid droplets. Our results suggest that Rab40c is a novel Rab protein associated with lipid droplets, and is likely involved in modulating the biogenesis of lipid droplets."
https://openalex.org/W2142196720,"Studies of the control of complex sequential movements have dissociated two aspects of movement planning: control over the sequential selection of movement plans, and control over the precise timing of movement execution. This distinction is particularly relevant in the production of speech: utterances contain sequentially ordered words and syllables, but articulatory movements are often executed in a non-sequential, overlapping manner with precisely coordinated relative timing. This study presents a hybrid dynamical model in which competitive activation controls selection of movement plans and coupled oscillatory systems govern coordination. The model departs from previous approaches by ascribing an important role to competitive selection of articulatory plans within a syllable. Numerical simulations show that the model reproduces a variety of speech production phenomena, such as effects of preparation and utterance composition on reaction time, and asymmetries in patterns of articulatory timing associated with onsets and codas. The model furthermore provides a unified understanding of a diverse group of phonetic and phonological phenomena which have not previously been related."
https://openalex.org/W2162401979,"In retinal proliferative diseases, Müller glial cells (MGCs) acquire migratory abilities. However, the mechanisms that regulate this migration remain poorly understood. In addition, proliferative disorders associated with enhanced activities of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 also present increased levels of the protease inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M) and its receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). In the present work, we investigated whether the protease activated form of α2M, α2M*, and LRP1 are involved with the MGC migratory process. By performing wound-scratch migration and zymography assays, we demonstrated that α2M* induced cell migration and proMMP-2 activation in the human Müller glial cell line, MIO-M1. This induction was blocked when LRP1 and MT1-MMP were knocked down with siRNA techniques. Using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical procedures, we found that α2M* induced an increase in LRP1 and MT1-MMP accumulation in early endosomes, followed by endocytic recycling and intracellular distribution of MT1-MMP toward cellular protrusions. Moreover, Rab11-dominant negative mutant abrogated MT1-MMP recycling pathway, cell migration, and proMMP-2 activation induced by α2M*. In conclusion, α2M*, through its receptor LRP1, induces cellular migration of Müller glial cells by a mechanism that involves MT1-MMP intracellular traffic to the plasma membrane by a Rab11-dependent recycling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2003723244,"General anesthetics exert many of their CNS actions by binding to and modulating membrane-embedded pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). The structural mechanisms underlying how anesthetics modulate pLGIC function remain largely unknown. GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC homologue, is inhibited by general anesthetics, suggesting anesthetics stabilize a closed channel state, but in anesthetic-bound GLIC crystal structures the channel appears open. Here, using functional GLIC channels expressed in oocytes, we examined whether propofol induces structural rearrangements in the GLIC transmembrane domain (TMD). Residues in the GLIC TMD that frame intrasubunit and intersubunit water-accessible cavities were individually mutated to cysteine. We measured and compared the rates of modification of the introduced cysteines by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents in the absence and presence of propofol. Propofol slowed the rate of modification of L240C (intersubunit) and increased the rate of modification of T254C (intrasubunit), indicating that propofol binding induces structural rearrangements in these cavities that alter the local environment near these residues. Propofol acceleration of T254C modification suggests that in the resting state propofol does not bind in the TMD intrasubunit cavity as observed in the crystal structure of GLIC with bound propofol (Nury, H., Van Renterghem, C., Weng, Y., Tran, A., Baaden, M., Dufresne, V., Changeux, J. P., Sonner, J. M., Delarue, M., and Corringer, P. J. (2011) Nature 469, 428–431). In silico docking using a GLIC closed channel homology model suggests propofol binds to intersubunit sites in the TMD in the resting state. Propofol-induced motions in the intersubunit cavity were distinct from motions associated with channel activation, indicating propofol stabilizes a novel closed state.Background: GLIC, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), is inhibited by general anesthetics, but in anesthetic-bound crystal structures the channel appears open.Results: Propofol induces structural rearrangements in the GLIC transmembrane domain that increase intrasubunit and decrease intersubunit cavity accessibilities.Conclusion: Propofol inhibits GLIC by stabilizing a distinct closed channel state.Significance: This study increases our understanding of how anesthetics modulate pLGIC function. General anesthetics exert many of their CNS actions by binding to and modulating membrane-embedded pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). The structural mechanisms underlying how anesthetics modulate pLGIC function remain largely unknown. GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC homologue, is inhibited by general anesthetics, suggesting anesthetics stabilize a closed channel state, but in anesthetic-bound GLIC crystal structures the channel appears open. Here, using functional GLIC channels expressed in oocytes, we examined whether propofol induces structural rearrangements in the GLIC transmembrane domain (TMD). Residues in the GLIC TMD that frame intrasubunit and intersubunit water-accessible cavities were individually mutated to cysteine. We measured and compared the rates of modification of the introduced cysteines by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents in the absence and presence of propofol. Propofol slowed the rate of modification of L240C (intersubunit) and increased the rate of modification of T254C (intrasubunit), indicating that propofol binding induces structural rearrangements in these cavities that alter the local environment near these residues. Propofol acceleration of T254C modification suggests that in the resting state propofol does not bind in the TMD intrasubunit cavity as observed in the crystal structure of GLIC with bound propofol (Nury, H., Van Renterghem, C., Weng, Y., Tran, A., Baaden, M., Dufresne, V., Changeux, J.

In silico docking using a GLIC closed channel homology model suggests propofol binds to intersubunit sites in the TMD in the resting state. Propofol-induced motions in the intersubunit cavity were distinct from motions associated with channel activation, indicating propofol stabilizes a novel closed state. Background: GLIC, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), is inhibited by general anesthetics, but in anesthetic-bound crystal structures the channel appears open.

Conclusion: Propofol inhibits GLIC by stabilizing a distinct closed channel state. Significance: This study increases our understanding of how anesthetics modulate pLGIC function. General anesthesia, a routine and indispensable tool in modern surgery, remains a poorly understood phenomenon. General anesthetics (GAs) 2The abbreviations used are: GA, general anesthetic; pLGIC, pentameric ligand-gated ion channel; GLIC, G. violaceus ligand gated ion channel; TMD, transmembrane domain; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; pCMBS−, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; GABAAR, GABAA receptor; ELIC, Erwinia chrysanthemi ion channel. are believed to exert many of their actions by binding to and modulating membrane-embedded pentameric ligand gated ion channels (pLGICs) (2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of general anaesthesia.Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression studies and experiments using transgenic mice have shown that GAs potentiate anion-selective pLGICs like GABAARs and glycine receptors (3Zeller A. Jurd R. Lambert S. Arras M.

The molecular details underlying the various actions of GAs on pLGICs, e.g. location of the GA binding site(s), protein movements triggered by GA binding, and structural elements that mediate their positive versus negative allosteric modulation, are not well understood. pLGICs are composed of five identical or homologous subunits arranged pseudo-symmetrically around a central ion-conducting channel (Fig. 1). Structural knowledge of these proteins comes from a 4 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in a presumed unliganded closed state (6Unwin N.

In general, each subunit can be divided into two parts: an extracellular binding domain made of β-strands and a transmembrane channel domain (TMD) consisting of four α-helical membrane-spanning segments (M1-M4) (Fig. 1). The M2 helices of each of the subunits form the ion-conducting channel. The M1, M3, and M4 segments form an outer ring of helices that are partly exposed to lipid (for review, see Ref. 11Baenziger J.E.

Recent data suggest that GAs bind to pLGICs in water-accessible cavities in the TMD located between adjacent subunits (inter-), within a subunit (intra-), and in the channel pore.

In recently solved GA-bound crystal structures of the prokaryotic pLGIC homolog GLIC, propofol and desflurane occupy an intrasubunit cavity in the TMD (1Nury H. Van Renterghem C. Weng Y. Tran A.

When apo- and GA-bound GLIC structures are compared, GAs induce little change in protein conformation. Whether the static crystal structures of GLIC solved in detergent micelles accurately reflect GA actions on pLGICs embedded in membrane lipids remains largely untested and how GAs inhibit GLIC currents is still unclear. Molecular simulations of GLIC indicate that GAs can bind to multiple sites in the TMD of GLIC and induce motions that close the channel (19Brannigan G. LeBard D.N. Hénin J. Eckenhoff R.G. Klein M.L.

So far GA-induced motions have not been demonstrated in functional GLIC channels embedded in a lipid membrane, especially in the resting state. Here, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to test the hypothesis that propofol binds within the intrasubunit cavity of GLIC when the channel is in a resting, non-conducting state and to examine if propofol binding alone induces structural rearrangements in the TMD. Understanding the action of GAs on pLGICs requires not only the identification of their binding site(s) but also knowledge of the structural rearrangements that mediate their allosteric action on pLGIC gating. Using the propofol-bound GLIC crystal structure as a guide, we individually mutated residues in the intrasubunit cavity, intersubunit cavity, and channel pore to cysteine. We measured the rate at which the introduced cysteines were modified by sulfhydryl-specific reagents in the absence and presence of propofol. This approach has been used successfully in a variety of channels to identify binding sites and to detect drug-induced structural movements (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Substituted-cysteine accessibility method.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Propofol increased the rate of modification of T254C in the intrasubunit cavity, indicating that this region moves in response to propofol binding and that in a resting, closed channel state propofol does not bind in the intrasubunit cavity. In silico docking using a GLIC closed channel homology model suggests propofol binds to an intersubunit cavity in the resting state. The DNA sequence encoding GLIC (residues 44–359) was extracted by PCR amplification from G. violaceus cells (ATCC) and subcloned in vectors pUNIV (26Venkatachalan S.P. Bushman J.D. Mercado J.L. Sancar F. Christopherson K.R. Boileau A.J. Optimized expression vector for ion channel studies in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells using alfalfa mosaic virus.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 454: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. GLIC DNA sequence was preceded in pUNIV by the DNA sequence encoding the signal peptide of the GABAA receptor β2 subunit to promote cell surface expression. GLIC mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Capped cRNAs encoding WT and mutant GLIC were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion). Single X. laevis oocytes were injected with 27 nl of cRNA (50–100 ng/μl). Injected oocytes were incubated at 16 °C in ND96 (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamycin and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2–5 days before use for electrophysiological recordings. Stock solutions of propofol (Sigma), methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), and 4-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonate (pCMBS−) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were prepared in DMSO, and that of 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) (Toronto Research Chemicals) was prepared in deionized water. Stocks were kept frozen at −20 °C and diluted to working concentration in ND96 just before use where final DMSO concentration (≤1%) did not affect GLIC function. Oocytes were perfused continuously with ND96 at pH 7.6 at a flow rate of 5 ml/min while being held under a two-electrode voltage clamp at −60 mV in a bath volume of 200 μl. Borosilicate glass electrodes (Warner Instruments) used for recordings were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.4–1.0 megaohms. Electrophysiological data were collected using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced to a computer with a Digidata 1200 A/D device (Axon Instruments) and recorded using the Whole Cell Program, Version 4.0.2 (kindly provided by J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). Proton-induced currents were measured by perfusing ND96 buffered at pH 6.5–3.8. For pH 5.0–3.8, HEPES was replaced with 5 mm sodium citrate as the buffering agent. For pH 6.5–6.0, 5 mm MES was used as the buffering agent. Proton-induced currents were measured at pH 5.0 until peak current amplitudes varied by < 10%. pH-response curves were obtained by successive applications of 5–6 different pH pulses at room temperature separated by 3–7 min washes. pH dose-response data were fit to Equation 1, I=Imax/(1+10(pH−pH50)×nH)(Eq. 1) where I is the peak response at a given pH, Imax is the maximum amplitude of current, pH50 is the pH inducing half-maximal response, and nH is the Hill coefficient. GraphPad Prism 4 was used for data analysis and curve fitting. Propofol modulation experiments were performed at pH5–20. Modulation is defined as (I+propofol/I) where I+propofol is the current in the presence of propofol, and I is the control current elicited by pH5–20. Propofol was pre-applied for 15 s at pH 7.6 before co-application with pH5–20. Propofol alone did not elicit any current responses. To determine concentration dependence of propofol modulation of pH5–20 currents, 5–7 different concentrations of propofol were co-applied with pH5–20. Successive applications were separated by 5–10-min washes. (I+propofol/I) was determined for each propofol concentration and were fit to Equation 2, P=Pmax/(1+(IC50/[propofol])nH)(Eq. 2) where P is the propofol modulation (I+propofol/I) at a given propofol concentration, and Pmax is the peak propofol modulation. IC50 is the propofol concentration causing 50% of Pmax, and nH is the Hill coefficient. For N238C(15′), where propofol potentiated currents, the EC50 for potentiation was determined. We used three sulfhydryl-specific reagents, MTSEA, MMTS, and pCMBS−, in this study. The functional effect of modifying substituted cysteines with these reagents was evaluated in oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp. Currents were stabilized before the addition of sulfhydryl reagents by application of pH10–30 buffer at 5-min intervals until the proton-activated currents (I) varied by <10%. After the proton responses were stabilized, freshly diluted sulfhydryl-reactive reagent was applied for 3–5 min; the oocyte was washed for 5 min, and then pH10–30 responses were measured again. The effect of cysteine modification on proton current was calculated as (Imodified/I), where Imodified is the current elicited by protons after sulfhydryl reagent application and complete modification of all available cysteines, and I is the current elicited by protons before sulfhydryl reagent application. For each mutant, initial screening was performed to determine the concentration of sulfhydryl reagent that resulted in maximally altered current responses within 3–5 min (i.e. all available cysteines were modified). The effect of covalent modification of substituted cysteines on propofol modulation was also determined. Modulation of pH5–20 currents by 100 μm propofol (I+propofol/I) was measured before and after sulfhydryl modification. After sulfhydryl modification, pH5–20 was redetermined by measuring the current responses to 3–4 different pH buffer pulses. This was done to ensure propofol modulation was measured at the same effective proton concentration before and after covalent modification of the cysteines. Propofol modulation of unmodified and modified receptors is plotted side by side for comparison (Figs. 4E and 5E). For T254C, modulation of pH5–20 currents by a lower concentration of propofol (10 μm) was also measured before and after sulfhydryl modification.FIGURE 5.Effect of different sulfhydryl reagent modifications of N238C and L240C on proton-mediated currents and propofol modulation.

Data are the mean ± S.E. from ≥3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate of reaction between cysteine and the sulfhydryl-specific reagents depends on the accessibility and ionization of the substituted cysteine (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Substituted-cysteine accessibility method.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). A water-accessible cysteine is more likely to be ionized and, hence, react faster. Steric block by ligands competing for the same site as the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent will reduce the rate of cysteine modification. We used MTSEA for all rate experiments except for N238C. For N238C, the reaction with MMTS was faster than MTSEA and allowed more accurate rate determination. For L240C, pCMBS− reaction rates were also determined to rule out any effect on reaction rates due to the switching of propofol modulation from inhibition to potentiation upon modification of L240C with MTSEA (FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5.). The rate of covalent modification of introduced cysteines was determined by measuring the effect of sequential applications of sulfhydryl reagents on pH10–30 current responses. pH10–30 buffer was applied, and the cell was washed for 30 s; sulfhydryl reagent was applied for 5–20s in pH 7.6 buffer, and the cell was washed for 2.5min. The procedure was repeated until pH10–30 currents reached a plateau. The effect of propofol on the rate of sulfhydryl modification was tested by co-applying sulfhydryl reagent with propofol (100 μm) in pH 7.6 buffer. In all cases the wash times were adjusted to ensure that currents obtained from test pulses of pH10–30 buffer after brief exposure to high concentrations of propofol were stabilized. This ensured complete drug wash out and that any changes in current amplitudes were the result of sulfhydryl reagent application. For all rate experiments, the peak currents elicited by the test pulses were plotted against the exposure (×) of sulfhydryl-specific reagent, defined as the cumulative time of MTSEA/MMTS/pCMBS− application multiplied by their respective concentrations, x=t(s)×[sulfhydrl reactive reagent](M)(Eq. 3) The data were fit to a single exponential equation, I'=(I0−Iplateau)×e−k2x+Iplateau(Eq. 4) where I′ is the peak current elicited by the test pH10–30 pulse. I0 is the current elicited by pH10–30 buffer at time t = 0 when no sulfhydryl reactive reagent was applied, Iplateau is the current remaining after all available cysteines were modified (i.e. reaction had proceeded to apparent completion) and is defined by the curve fit, and k2 is the second order rate constant. To verify the accuracy of this protocol, second-order rate constants were determined using at least two different concentrations of sulfhydryl reagent. k2 values were similar, verifying pseudo-unimolecular kinetics. For easier visual comparison between control and experimental data sets, the data in FIGURE 6., FIGURE 7. were normalized to the maximum current in each experiment.FIGURE 6.Propofol slows modification of L240C and has no effect on N238C and E242C modification. A, shown is an example of a rate experiment at L240C where modification by PCMBS− potentiates the proton-induced current; pH20-induced currents were measured before and after successive applications of 100 μm PCMBS− (top) or 200 μm PCMBS + 100 μm propofol (below) in pH 7.6 buffer. PCMBS− exposure time (s) is indicated on top of the arrows. B, current amplitudes were normalized to maximal potentiation by PCMBS− and plotted against cumulative PCMBS exposure time (s) weighted by concentration of PCMBS− (m) and fit with single exponential functions as described under “Materials and Methods.” B–E, shown are rates of modification of L240C (B and C), N238C (D), and E242C (E) in the absence (○) or presence (■) of 100 μm propofol. B and C, propofol significantly slowed modification of L240C by PCMBS− and MTSEA. D and E, propofol had no effects on modification of N238C and E242C by MMTS or MTSEA, respectively. Data points are the mean ± S.E. from ≥3 experiments. Single exponential fits of the data are shown as dotted (Control) and solid (+Propofol) lines. Second order rate constants are reported in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For V241C, there was a delay in the appearance of a functional effect of MTSEA modification, and the rate data for V241C could not be fit using a single pseudo-unimolecular reaction model. Because GLIC is a homopentamer, mutation at a single site introduces five engineered cysteines in the protein. For V241C, modification of multiple cysteines may be required before a functional effect is observed. A similar effect has been reported when measuring the PCMBS− rates of modification for several GLIC cysteine mutants (27Parikh R.B. Bali M. Akabas M.H.

For T254C, we also determined the rate of MTSEA modification at pH 6.5 in the presence and absence of propofol (100 μm). For this mutant, pH 6.5 elicited about 80% of Imax, and thus we probed the reaction rates of channels in a mixture of open, closed, and desensitized states. Because acidic pH reduces the ionization of cysteines and hence slows their rate of reaction, comparison of rates were performed only between control (pH 6.5 without propofol) and (pH 6.5 + propofol) but not between rates determined at"

Further, a nonlinear generalization of the oscillator-based tremor model, useful for derivation of a control strategy involving incorporation of parametric-bound knowledge, is provided. Using the Lyapunov method, a robust adaptive output feedback control law, based on measurement of the tremor signal from the fingers of a patient, is formulated to estimate the stimulation amplitude required to control the tremor. By means of the proposed control strategy, an algorithm is developed for estimation of DBS parameters such as amplitude, frequency and pulse width, which provides a framework for development of an automatic clinical device for control of motor symptoms. The DBS parameter estimation results for the proposed control scheme are verified through numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W1989875778,"Prognosis of patients with loco-regional skin metastases has not been analyzed in detail and the presence or absence of concurrent lymph node metastasis represents the only established prognostic factor thus far. Most studies were limited to patients already presenting with skin lesions at the time of initial diagnosis. We aimed to analyze the impact of a broad penal of prognostic factors in patients with skin metastases at the time of first metastatic spread, including patients with synchronous lesions already present at the time of initial diagnosis, stage I/II patients with loco-regional recurrence and patients initially presenting with skin metastasis but unknown primary melanoma.We investigated disease-specific survival of 380 patients treated at our department between 1996 and 2010 using Kaplan Meier survival probabilities and Cox-proportional hazard analysis.Five-year survival probability was 60.1% for patients with skin metastases only and 36.3% for those with synchronous nodal metastases. The number of involved nodes and a tumor thickness of at least 3 mm had independent negative impact on prognosis. A strong relationship was identified between the risk of death and the number of involved nodes. Neither ulceration nor the timing of the first occurrence of metastases as either in stage I/II patients, at the time of excision of the primary melanoma or initially in patients with unknown primary tumor, had additional effects on survival.Lymph node involvement was confirmed as the most important prognostic factor for melanoma patients with loco-regional skin metastasis including those with unknown primary tumor and stage I/II patients with skin recurrence. Consideration of the tumor thickness and of the number of involved lymph nodes instead of the exclusive differentiation into presence vs. absence of nodal disease may allow a more accurate prediction of prognosis for patients with satellite or in-transit metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2031822154,"Cross-modal processing depends strongly on the compatibility between different sensory inputs, the relative timing of their arrival to brain processing components, and on how attention is allocated. In this behavioral study, we employed a cross-modal audio-visual Stroop task in which we manipulated the within-trial stimulus-onset-asynchronies (SOAs) of the stimulus-component inputs, the grouping of the SOAs (blocked vs. random), the attended modality (auditory or visual), and the congruency of the Stroop color-word stimuli (congruent, incongruent, neutral) to assess how these factors interact within a multisensory context. One main result was that visual distractors produced larger incongruency effects on auditory targets than vice versa. Moreover, as revealed by both overall shorter response times (RTs) and relative shifts in the psychometric incongruency-effect functions, visual-information processing was faster and produced stronger and longer-lasting incongruency effects than did auditory. When attending to either modality, stimulus incongruency from the other modality interacted with SOA, yielding larger effects when the irrelevant distractor occurred prior to the attended target, but no interaction with SOA grouping. Finally, relative to neutral-stimuli, and across the wide range of the SOAs employed, congruency led to substantially more behavioral facilitation than did incongruency to interference, in contrast to findings that within-modality stimulus-compatibility effects tend to be more evenly split between facilitation and interference. In sum, the present findings reveal several key characteristics of how we process the stimulus compatibility of cross-modal sensory inputs, reflecting stimulus processing patterns that are critical for successfully navigating our complex multisensory world."
https://openalex.org/W2044661773,"People are often called upon to witness, and to empathize with, the pain and suffering of others. In the current study, we directly compared neural responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering by presenting participants (n = 41) with 96 verbal stories, each describing a protagonist's physical and/or emotional experience, ranging from neutral to extremely negative. A separate group of participants rated “how much physical pain”, and “how much emotional suffering” the protagonist experienced in each story, as well as how “vivid and movie-like” the story was. Although ratings of Pain, Suffering and Vividness were positively correlated with each other across stories, item-analyses revealed that each scale was correlated with activity in distinct brain regions. Even within regions of the “Shared Pain network” identified using a separate data set, responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering were distinct. More broadly, item analyses with continuous predictors provided a high-powered method for identifying brain regions associated with specific aspects of complex stimuli – like verbal descriptions of physical and emotional events."
https://openalex.org/W2074154564,"The increasing demand for forest-derived bio-fuel may decrease the amount of dead wood and hence also the amount of available substrate for saproxylic ( = dead-wood dependent) organisms. Cut stumps constitute a large portion of dead wood in managed boreal forests. The lichen flora of such stumps has received little interest. Therefore, we investigated which lichens that occur on stumps in young (4–19 years), managed forests and analyzed how species richness and occurrence of individual species were related to stump and stand characteristics. We performed lichen inventories of 576 Norway spruce stumps in 48 forest stands in two study areas in Central Sweden, recording in total 77 lichen species. Of these, 14 were obligately lignicolous, while the remaining were generalists that also grow on bark, soil or rocks. We tested the effect of characteristics reflecting successional stage, microclimate, substrate patch size, and the species pool in the surrounding area on (1) total lichen species richness, (2) species richness of obligately lignicolous lichens and (3) the occurrence of four obligately lignicolous lichen species. The most important variables were stump age, with more species on old stumps, and study area, with similar total species richness but differences in occupancy for individual species. Responses for total lichen species richness and species richness of obligately lignicolous lichens were overall similar, indicating similar ecological requirements of these two groups. Our results indicate that species richness measurements serve as poor proxies for the responses of individual, obligately lignicolous lichen species."
https://openalex.org/W2037887987,"Background and Objectives India has the highest annual number of maternal deaths of any country. As obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in India, numerous efforts are under way to promote access to skilled attendance at birth and emergency obstetric care. Current initiatives also seek to increase access to active management of the third stage of labor for postpartum hemorrhage prevention, particularly through administration of an uterotonic after delivery. However, prior research suggests widespread inappropriate use of uterotonics at facilities and in communities–for example, without adequate monitoring or referral support for complications. This qualitative study aimed to document health providers’ and community members’ current knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding uterotonic use during labor and delivery in India’s Karnataka state. Methods 140 in-depth interviews were conducted from June to August 2011 in Bagalkot and Hassan districts with physicians, nurses, recently delivered women, mothers-in-law, traditional birth attendants (dais), unlicensed village doctors, and chemists (pharmacists). Results Many respondents reported use of uterotonics, particularly oxytocin, for labor augmentation in both facility-based and home-based deliveries. The study also identified contextual factors that promote inappropriate uterotonic use, including high value placed on pain during labor; perceived pressure to provide or receive uterotonics early in labor and delivery, perhaps leading to administration of uterotonics despite awareness of risks; and lack of consistent and correct knowledge regarding safe storage, dosing, and administration of oxytocin. Conclusions These findings have significant implications for public health programs in a context of widespread and potentially increasing availability of uterotonics. Among other responses, efforts are needed to improve communication between community members and providers regarding uterotonic use during labor and delivery and to target training and other interventions to address identified gaps in knowledge and ensure that providers and pharmacists have up-to-date information regarding proper usage of uterotonic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2056437630,"CD244 (2B4) is a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family of immune cell receptors and it plays an important role in modulating NK cell and CD8(+) T cell immunity. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of CD244/2B4 on CD4(+) T cells from active TB patients and latent infection individuals. Active TB patients had significantly elevated CD244/2B4 expression on M. tuberculosis antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells compared with latent infection individuals. The frequencies of CD244/2B4-expressing antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells were significantly higher in retreatment active TB patients than in new active TB patients. Compared with CD244/2B4-dull and -middle CD4(+) T cells, CD244/2B4-bright CD4(+) T cell subset had significantly reduced expression of IFN-γ, suggesting that CD244/2B4 expression may modulate IFN-γ production in M. tuberculosis antigen-responsive CD4(+) T cells. Activation of CD244/2B4 signaling by cross-linking led to significantly decreased production of IFN-γ. Blockage of CD244/2B4 signaling pathway of T cells from patients with active TB resulted in significantly increased production of IFN-γ, compared with isotype antibody control. In conclusion, CD244/2B4 signaling pathway has an inhibitory role on M. tuberculosis antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1969789621,"Strong evidence exists for the role of physical activity in preventing and managing a range of chronic health conditions. A particular challenge in promoting physical activity as a health strategy exists in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups, as such groups demonstrate high risk for a range of non-communicable diseases. The aim of this research was to examine the perspective of multicultural health service providers for CALD groups with respect to the physical activity services/initiatives on offer, access barriers to these services, and ideas for future service delivery in this area. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 multicultural health service providers across the capital cities of the three most populous states in Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria), and thematic content analysis was used to examine the data. Findings indicated that the majority of physical activity initiatives were associated with organizations offering other social services for CALD communities but were greatly restrained by resources. As well, it was found that most services were not designed by taking into account specific cultural requirements for CALD communities or their cultural expectations. Common barriers identified to service uptake were classified as socio-cultural (e.g., gender, language, context of health) and environmental (e.g., transportation) in nature. These findings should be utilized when planning future physical activity and health promotion initiatives for increasing CALD participation. In particular, programs need to be culturally tailored to the specific expectations of CALD groups, addressing cultural safety and sensitivity, and should be in partnership with other organizations to extend the reach and capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2124404396,"In the face of a steady decline in dairy cow fertility over several decades, using hormones to assist reproduction has become common. In the European Union, hormones are prescription-only medicines, giving veterinary practitioners a central role in their deployment. This study explored the clinical and ethical beliefs of practitioners, and provides data on their current prescribing practices. During 2011, 93 practitioners working in England completed a questionnaire (95% response rate). Of the 714 non-organic farms they attended, only 4 farms (0.6%) never used hormones to assist the insemination of lactating dairy cows. Practitioners agreed (>80%) that hormones improve fertility and farm businesses profitability. They also agreed (>80%) that if farmers are able to tackle management issues contributing to poor oestrus expression, then over a five year period these outcomes would both improve, relative to using hormones instead. If management issues are addressed instead of prescribing hormones, practitioners envisaged a less favourable outcome for veterinary practices profitability (p<0.01), but an improvement in genetic selection for fertility (p<0.01) and overall cow welfare (p<0.01). On farms making no efforts to address underlying management problems, long-term routine use at the start of breeding for timing artificial insemination or inducing oestrus was judged “unacceptable” by 69% and 48% of practitioners, respectively. In contrast, practitioners agreed (≥90%) that both these types of use are acceptable, provided a period of time has been allowed to elapse during which the cow is observed for natural oestrus. Issues discussed include: weighing quality versus length of cow life, fiscal factors, legal obligations, and balancing the interests of all stakeholders, including the increasing societal demand for food. This research fosters debate and critical appraisal, contributes to veterinary ethics, and encourages the pro-active development of professional codes of conduct."
https://openalex.org/W2147024386,"Proteins responsible for basal and stimulated endocytosis in nerves containing small clear synaptic vesicles (SCSVs) or large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) are revealed herein, using probes that exploit surface-exposed vesicle proteins as acceptors for internalization. Basal uptake of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) by both SCSV-releasing cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and LDCV-enriched trigeminal ganglionic neurons (TGNs) was found to require protein acceptors and acidic compartments. In addition, dynamin, clathrin, adaptor protein complex-2 (AP2), and amphiphysin contribute to the depolarization-evoked entry. For fast recycling of SCSVs, knockdown and knockout strategies demonstrated that CGNs use predominantly dynamin 1, whereas isoform 2 and, to a smaller extent, isoform 3 support a less rapid mode of stimulated endocytosis. Accordingly, proximity ligation assay confirmed that dynamin 1 and 2 colocalize with amphiphysin 1 in CGNs, and the latter copurified with both dynamins from cell extracts. In contrast, LDCV-releasing TGNs preferentially employ dynamins 2 and 3 and amphiphysin 1 for evoked endocytosis and lack the fast phase. Hence, stimulation recruits dynamin, clathrin, AP2, and amphiphysin to augment BoNT internalization, and neurons match endocytosis mediators to the different demands for locally recycling SCSVs or replenishing distally synthesized LDCVs.—Meng, J., Wang, J., Lawrence, G.

https://openalex.org/W2008281070,"Hemoglobin (Hb) plays a critical role in human physiological function by transporting O2. Hb is safe and inert within the confinement of the red blood cell but becomes reactive and toxic upon hemolysis. Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acute-phase serum protein that scavenges Hb and the resulting Hb-Hp complex is subjected to CD163-mediated endocytosis by macrophages. The interaction between Hb and Hp is extraordinarily strong and largely irreversible. As the structural details of the human Hb-Hp complex are not yet available, this study reports for the first time on insights of the binding modalities and molecular details of the human Hb-Hp interaction by means of protein-protein docking. Furthermore, residues that are pertinent for complex formation were identified by computational alanine scanning mutagenesis. Results revealed that the surface of the binding interface of Hb-Hp is not flat and protrudes into each binding partner. It was also observed that the secondary structures at the Hb-Hp interface are oriented as coils and α-helices. When dissecting the interface in more detail, it is obvious that several tyrosine residues of Hb, particularly β145Tyr, α42Tyr and α140Tyr, are buried in the complex and protected from further oxidative reactions. Such finding opens up new avenues for the design of Hp mimics which may be used as alternative clinical Hb scavengers."

Identification and characterization of placental multi-protein complexes is an important step to integratedly understand the protein-protein interaction networks in placenta which determine placental function. In this study, blue native/sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN/SDS-PAGE) and Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to screen the multi-protein complexes in placenta. 733 unique proteins and 34 known and novel heterooligomeric multi-protein complexes including mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, integrin complexes, proteasome complexes, histone complex, and heat shock protein complexes were identified. A novel protein complex, which involves clathrin and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel protein 2, was identified and validated by antibody based gel shift assay, co-immunoprecipitation and immunoﬂuorescence staining. These results suggest that BN/SDS-PAGE, when integrated with LC-MS/MS, is a very powerful and versatile tool for the investigation of placental protein complexes. This work paves the way for deeper functional characterization of the placental protein complexes associated with pregnancy disorders."

Whether there are differences in survival outcomes between the East and West, however, remain unclear.The survival data for CLL patients identified in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database between 1990 and 2004, together with corresponding data in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, were retrieved. The relative survivals (RS, adjusted for the expected survival in the general population) were estimated in patients diagnosed in three 5-year periods of time.CLL drastically shortened patients' life expectancy; more importantly, this negative impact in Taiwan was much larger than that in the US: the 5-year RS in Taiwan and US were 59% and 76%, and the 10-year RS, 45% and 56%, respectively. Nevertheless, survival in Taiwan was better in the periods after 1995 (5-year RS, from 53.0% to 60.6%), a time period corresponding to the introduction of the Taiwan National Health Insurance scheme. Such improvement was largely due to decreased mortality in patients younger than 65 (5-year RS, from 53.5% to 69.1%). Despite the improvement, patients' RS in Taiwan in recent periods remain steadily 15∼20% inferior to that in the US in both younger and older patient groups.The improved RS in Taiwan implies that therapeutic advances are changing the prognosis of CLL. The stable RS gap between Taiwanese and the US patients suggests the existence of an ethnic difference in CLL patients' outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1965050256,"Sigma factors of RNA polymerase recognize promoters and have a central role in controlling transcription initiation and acclimation to changing environmental conditions. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes four non-essential group 2 sigma factors, SigB, SigC, SigD and SigE that closely resemble the essential SigA factor. Three out of four group 2 sigma factors were simultaneously inactivated and acclimation responses of the triple inactivation strains were studied. All triple inactivation strains grew slowly in low light, and our analysis suggests that the reason is a reduced capacity to adjust the perception of light. Simultaneous inactivation of SigB and SigD hampered growth also in high light. SigB is the most important group 2 sigma factor for salt acclimation, and elimination of all the other group 2 sigma factors slightly improved the salt tolerance of Synechocystis. Presence of only SigE allowed full salt acclimation including up-regulation of hspA and ggpS genes, but more slowly than SigB. Cells with only SigD acclimated to high salt but the acclimation processes differed from those of the control strain. Presence of only SigC prevented salt acclimation."
https://openalex.org/W2010990676,"The Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) protein is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis that acts primarily by inhibiting the p53 tumor suppressor. Similarly, the PI3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is critical for growth factor-mediated cell survival. Additionally, it has been reported that AKT can directly phosphorylate and activate MDM2. In this study, we show that IGF-1 up-regulates MDM2 protein levels in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or expression of a dominant negative eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) mutant protein, as well as ablation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), efficiently abolishes IGF-1-mediated up-regulation of MDM2. In addition, we show that rapamycin effectively inhibits MDM2 expression and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. Taken together, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which IGF-1 activates MDM2 via the mTOR pathway, and that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR combined with chemotherapy may be more effective in treatment of a subset of cancers harboring increased MDM2 activation."

It has been proposed that BAR domains are able to sense membrane curvature and to induce membrane tubulation. We report here that active Arf1 is required for the recruitment of Arfaptin2 to artificial liposomes mimicking the Golgi apparatus lipid composition. The Arf1-dependent recruitment of Arfaptin2 increases with membrane curvature, while the recruitment of Arf1 itself is not sensitive to curvature. At high protein concentrations, the binding of Arfaptin2 induces membrane tubulation. Finally, membrane-bound Arfaptin2 is released from the liposome when ArfGAP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP in Arf1. These results show that both Arf1 activation and high membrane curvature are required for efficient recruitment of Arfaptin2 to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1990390086,"Genes are characterized as essential if their knockout is associated with a lethal phenotype, and these ""essential genes"" play a central role in biological function. In addition, some genes are only essential when deleted in pairs, a phenomenon known as synthetic lethality. Here we consider genes displaying synthetic lethality as ""essential pairs"" of genes, and analyze the properties of yeast essential genes and synthetic lethal pairs together. As gene duplication initially produces an identical pair or sets of genes, it is often invoked as an explanation for synthetic lethality. However, we find that duplication explains only a minority of cases of synthetic lethality. Similarly, disruption of metabolic pathways leads to relatively few examples of synthetic lethality. By contrast, the vast majority of synthetic lethal gene pairs code for proteins with related functions that share interaction partners. We also find that essential genes and synthetic lethal pairs cluster in the protein-protein interaction network. These results suggest that synthetic lethality is strongly dependent on the formation of protein-protein interactions. Compensation by duplicates does not usually occur mainly because the genes involved are recent duplicates, but is more commonly due to functional similarity that permits preservation of essential protein complexes. This unified view, combining genes that are individually essential with those that form essential pairs, suggests that essentiality is a feature of physical interactions between proteins protein-protein interactions, rather than being inherent in gene and protein products themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1993095285,"A growing body of behavioral studies has demonstrated that women’s hemispheric specialization varies as a function of their menstrual cycle, with hemispheric specialization enhanced during their menstruation period. Our recent high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) study with lateralized emotional versus neutral words extended these behavioral results by showing that hemispheric specialization in men, but not in women under birth-control, depends upon specific EEG resting brain states at stimulus arrival, suggesting that hemispheric specialization may be pre-determined at the moment of the stimulus onset. To investigate whether EEG brain resting state for hemispheric specialization could vary as a function of the menstrual phase, we tested 12 right-handed healthy women over different phases of their menstrual cycle combining high-density EEG recordings and the same lateralized lexical decision paradigm with emotional versus neutral words. Results showed the presence of specific EEG resting brain states, associated with hemispheric specialization for emotional words, at the moment of the stimulus onset during the menstruation period only. These results suggest that the pre-stimulus EEG pattern influencing hemispheric specialization is modulated by the hormonal state."
https://openalex.org/W2076646188,"Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, is essential for tumour growth; this process is stimulated by the secretion of numerous growth factors including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF signalling, through its receptor platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), is involved in vessel maturation, stimulation of angiogenesis and upregulation of other angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PDGFR is a promising target for anti-cancer therapy because it is expressed on both tumour cells and stromal cells associated with the vasculature. MLN0518 (tandutinib) is a potent inhibitor of type III receptor tyrosine kinases that demonstrates activity against PDGFRα/β, FLT3 and c-KIT. In this study a multi-parametric MRI and histopathological approach was used to interrogate changes in vascular haemodynamics, structural response and hypoxia in C6 glioma xenografts in response to treatment with MLN0518. The doubling time of tumours in mice treated with MLN0518 was significantly longer than tumours in vehicle treated mice. The perfused vessel area, number of alpha smooth muscle actin positive vessels and hypoxic area in MLN0518 treated tumours were also significantly lower after 10 days treatment. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in vessel calibre or fractional blood volume as assessed using susceptibility contrast MRI. Histological assessment of vessel size and total perfused area did not demonstrate any change with treatment. Intrinsic susceptibility MRI did not reveal any difference in baseline R2* or carbogen-induced change in R2*. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI revealed anti-vascular effects of MLN0518 following 3 days treatment. Hypoxia confers chemo- and radio-resistance, and alongside PDGF, is implicated in evasive resistance to agents targeted against VEGF signalling. PDGFR antagonists may improve potency and efficacy of other therapeutics in combination. This study highlights the challenges of identifying appropriate quantitative imaging response biomarkers in heterogeneous models, particularly considering the multifaceted roles of angiogenic growth factors."

https://openalex.org/W1982417882,"During infection of cells by Legionella pneumophila, the bacterium secretes a large number of effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm, allowing it to alter many cellular processes and make the vacuole and the host cell into more hospitable environments for bacterial replication. One major change induced by infection is the recruitment of ER-derived vesicles to the surface of the vacuole, where they fuse with the vacuole membrane and prevent it from becoming an acidified, degradative compartment. However, the recruitment of mitochondria to the region of the vacuole has also been suggested by ultrastructural studies. In order to test this idea in a controlled and quantitative experimental system, and to lay the groundwork for a genome-wide screen for factors involved in mitochondrial recruitment, we examined the behavior of mitochondria during the early stages of Legionella pneumophila infection of Drosophila S2 cells. We found that the density of mitochondria near vacuoles formed by infection with wild type Legionella was not different from that found in dotA– mutant-infected cells during the first 4 hours after infection. We then examined 4 parameters of mitochondrial motility in infected cells: velocity of movement, duty cycle of movement, directional persistence and net direction. In the 4 hours following infection, most of these measures were indistinguishable between wild type and dotA−.infection. However, wild type Legionella did induce a modest shift in the velocity distribution toward faster movement compared dotA− infection, and a small downward shift in the duty cycle distribution. In addition, wild type infection produced mitochondrial movement that was biased in the direction of the bacterial vacuole relative to dotA-, although not enough to cause a significant accumulation within 10 um of the vacuole. We conclude that in this host cell, mitochondria are not strongly recruited to the vacuole, nor is their motility dramatically affected."

Materials and Methods The sinograms from 320-detector row CT angiography of four clinical candidates for face transplantation were processed utilizing standard FBP, FBP with simulated 75, 62, and 50% tube current, and AIDR3D with corresponding dose reduction. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured at muscle, fat, artery, and vein. Image quality for each reconstruction strategy was assessed by two independent readers using a 4-point scale. Results Compared to FBP, the median SNR and CNR for AIDR3D images were higher at all sites for all 4 different tube currents. The AIDR3D with simulated 50% tube current achieved comparable SNR and CNR to FBP with standard dose (median muscle SNR: 5.77 vs. 6.23; fat SNR: 6.40 vs. 5.75; artery SNR: 43.8 vs. 45.0; vein SNR: 54.9 vs. 55.7; artery CNR: 38.1 vs. 38.6; vein CNR: 49.0 vs. 48.7; all p-values >0.19). The interobserver agreement in the image quality score was good (weighted κ = 0.7). The overall score and the scores for smaller arteries were significantly lower when FBP with 50% dose reduction was used. The AIDR3D reconstruction images with 4 different simulated doses achieved a mean score ranging from 3.68 to 3.82 that were comparable to the scores from images reconstructed using FBP with original dose (3.68–3.77). Conclusions Simulated radiation dose reduction applied to clinical CT angiography for face transplant planning suggests that AIDR3D allows for a 50% reduction in radiation dose, as compared to FBP, while preserving image quality."
https://openalex.org/W1981401430,"Natural populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, segregate genetic variation that leads to cardiac disease phenotypes. One nearly isogenic line from a North Carolina peach orchard, WE70, is shown to harbor two genetically distinct heart phenotypes: elevated incidence of arrhythmias, and a dramatically constricted heart diameter in both diastole and systole, with resemblance to restrictive cardiomyopathy in humans. Assuming the source to be rare variants of large effect, we performed Bulked Segregant Analysis using genomic DNA hybridization to Affymetrix chips to detect single feature polymorphisms, but found that the mutant phenotypes are more likely to have a polygenic basis. Further mapping efforts revealed a complex architecture wherein the constricted cardiomyopathy phenotype was observed in individual whole chromosome substitution lines, implying that variants on both major autosomes are sufficient to produce the phenotype. A panel of 170 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL) was generated, and a small subset of mutant lines selected, but these each complemented both whole chromosome substitutions, implying a non-additive (epistatic) contribution to the ""disease"" phenotype. Low coverage whole genome sequencing was also used to attempt to map chromosomal regions contributing to both the cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, but a polygenic architecture had to be again inferred to be most likely. These results show that an apparently simple rare phenotype can have a complex genetic basis that would be refractory to mapping by deep sequencing in pedigrees. We present this as a cautionary tale regarding assumptions related to attempts to map new disease mutations on the assumption that probands carry a single causal mutation."

One of the Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigens called PvTRAg33.5 had earlier been shown to be predominantly of alpha helical in nature with multidomain structure, induced immune responses in humans, binds to host erythrocytes, and its sequence is highly conserved in the parasite population. In the present study, we divided this protein into three different parts i.e. N-terminal (amino acid position 24–106), middle (amino acid position 107–192), and C-terminal region (amino acid position 185–275) and determined the erythrocyte binding activity of these fragments. This binding activity was retained by the middle and C-terminal fragments covering 107 to 275 amino acid region of the PvTRAg33.5 protein. Eight non-overlapping peptides covering this 107 to 275 amino acid region were then synthesized and tested for their erythrocyte binding activity to further define the binding domains. Only two peptides, peptide P4 (at 171–191 amino acid position) and peptide P8 (at 255–275 amino acid position), were found to contain the erythrocyte binding activity. Competition assay revealed that each peptide recognizes its own erythrocyte receptor. These two peptides were found to be located on two parallel helices at one end of the protein in the modelled structure and could be exposed on its surface to form a suitable site for protein-protein interaction. Natural antibodies present in the sera of the P. vivax exposed individuals or the polyclonal rabbit antibodies against this protein were able to inhibit the erythrocyte binding activity of PvTRAg33.5, its fragments, and these two synthetic peptides P4 and P8. Further studies on receptor-ligand interaction might lead to the development of the therapeutic reagent."
https://openalex.org/W2129993675,"In studies of schizotypy, investigators seldom inform participants that they are engaged in research designed to shed light on risk for schizophrenia. Such nondisclosure is justified in part by the argument that disclosure of risk status may be harmful. However, there is little evidence that this is the case. Harm arising from disclosure of risk status was examined in two experiments. In the first, participants (n = 114 psychology undergraduates) were asked to anticipate their reactions to news of risk for schizophrenia, depression, cancer, and diabetes, and also to indicate whether they would want to know their schizophrenia risk status. Participants anticipated schizophrenia risk would have a negative impact that was significantly greater than depression or diabetes risk but similar to cancer risk. The anticipated impact of schizophrenia risk was predicted by expectations of stigmatization as well as confidence in the accuracy of biological screening. Although 81% indicated a preference for knowing their risk status, just 11% were prepared to undergo an assessment to find out. In the second, a between-subjects deception paradigm was used to inform participants (n = 144 psychology undergraduates) they had an enzyme deficiency that placed them at increased risk for schizophrenia, cancer, or depression. Impact was assessed using prospective self-report and salivary cortisol and retrospective self-report. Impact was modeled using measures of stigmatization and health locus of control. Retrospectively, schizophrenia, cancer, and depression risk had strong negative impacts relative to a control group, but there was no effect on prospective measures. Together, the findings suggest that news of risk for schizophrenia has the potential to engender distress, although participants' anticipations and reflections of responses are not corroborated in prospectively measured outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2130134109,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) fitness has been associated with virus entry, a process mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env). We previously described Env genetic diversification in a Zambian, subtype C infected, slow-progressor child (1157i) in parallel with an evolving neutralizing antibody response. Because of the role the Variable-3 loop (V3) plays in transmission, cell tropism, neutralization sensitivity, and fitness, longitudinally isolated 1157i C2-V4 alleles were cloned into HIV-1NL4-3-eGFP and -DsRed2 infectious molecular clones. The fluorescent reporters allowed for dual-infection competitions between all patient-derived C2-V4 chimeras to quantify the effect of V3 diversification and selection on fitness. ‘Winners’ and ‘losers’ were readily discriminated among the C2-V4 alleles. Exceptional sensitivity for detection of subtle fitness differences was revealed through analysis of two alleles differing in a single synonymous amino acid. However, when the outcomes of N = 33 competitions were averaged for each chimera, the aggregate analysis showed that despite increasing diversification and divergence with time, natural selection of C2-V4 sequences in this individual did not appear to be producing a ‘survival of the fittest’ evolutionary pattern. Rather, we detected a relatively flat fitness landscape consistent with mutational robustness. Fitness outcomes were then correlated with individual components of the entry process. Env incorporation into particles correlated best with fitness, suggesting a role for Env avidity, as opposed to receptor/coreceptor affinity, in defining fitness. Nevertheless, biochemical analyses did not identify any step in HIV-1 entry as a dominant determinant of fitness. Our results lead us to conclude that multiple aspects of entry contribute to maintaining adequate HIV-1 fitness, and there is no surrogate analysis for determining fitness. The capacity for subtle polymorphisms in Env to nevertheless significantly impact viral fitness suggests fitness is best defined by head-to-head competition."
