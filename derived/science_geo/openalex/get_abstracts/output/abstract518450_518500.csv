https://openalex.org/W2010873488,"Christina Curtis, Darryl Shibata and colleagues report genomic profiling of 349 individual glands sampled from 15 human colorectal tumors. They observe high within-tumor heterogeneity and mixing of subclones in distant tumor regions, supporting a model whereby tumor growth occurs predominantly as a single expansion, with most detectable subclonal mutations arising during the earliest phases of tumor growth. What happens in early, still undetectable human malignancies is unknown because direct observations are impractical. Here we present and validate a 'Big Bang' model, whereby tumors grow predominantly as a single expansion producing numerous intermixed subclones that are not subject to stringent selection and where both public (clonal) and most detectable private (subclonal) alterations arise early during growth. Genomic profiling of 349 individual glands from 15 colorectal tumors showed an absence of selective sweeps, uniformly high intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and subclone mixing in distant regions, as postulated by our model. We also verified the prediction that most detectable ITH originates from early private alterations and not from later clonal expansions, thus exposing the profile of the primordial tumor. Moreover, some tumors appear 'born to be bad', with subclone mixing indicative of early malignant potential. This new model provides a quantitative framework to interpret tumor growth dynamics and the origins of ITH, with important clinical implications."

Optogenetic systems enable precise spatial and temporal control of cell behavior. We engineered a light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (LACE) system that induces transcription of endogenous genes in the presence of blue light. This was accomplished by fusing the light-inducible heterodimerizing proteins CRY2 and CIB1 to a transactivation domain and the catalytically inactive dCas9, respectively. The versatile LACE system can be easily directed to new DNA sequences for the dynamic regulation of endogenous genes."

Using a novel in vivo metabolomics approach, we show that the major mechanism by which insulin suppresses HGP is through reductions in hepatic acetyl CoA by suppression of lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) leading to reductions in pyruvate carboxylase flux. This mechanism was confirmed in mice and rats with genetic ablation of insulin signaling and mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase. Insulin’s ability to suppress hepatic acetyl CoA, PC activity, and lipolysis was lost in high-fat-fed rats, a phenomenon reversible by IL-6 neutralization and inducible by IL-6 infusion. Taken together, these data identify WAT-derived hepatic acetyl CoA as the main regulator of HGP by insulin and link it to inflammation-induced hepatic insulin resistance associated with obesity and T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2079015343,"Resistance to RAF- and MEK-targeted therapy is a major clinical challenge. RAF and MEK inhibitors are initially but only transiently effective in some but not all patients with BRAF gene mutation and are largely ineffective in those with RAS gene mutation because of resistance. Through a genetic screen in BRAF-mutant tumor cells, we show that the Hippo pathway effector YAP (encoded by YAP1) acts as a parallel survival input to promote resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. Combined YAP and RAF or MEK inhibition was synthetically lethal not only in several BRAF-mutant tumor types but also in RAS-mutant tumors. Increased YAP in tumors harboring BRAF V600E was a biomarker of worse initial response to RAF and MEK inhibition in patients, establishing the clinical relevance of our findings. Our data identify YAP as a new mechanism of resistance to RAF- and MEK-targeted therapy. The findings unveil the synthetic lethality of combined suppression of YAP and RAF or MEK as a promising strategy to enhance treatment response and patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2136453810,"An early stage in mouse blood development is reconstructed from gene expression data on thousands of single cells. Reconstruction of the molecular pathways controlling organ development has been hampered by a lack of methods to resolve embryonic progenitor cells. Here we describe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression profiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition graphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo, we map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression analysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points between E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then used as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a computationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood development. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox factors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal the transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2033591334,"Inflammation is a prominent feature of CNS injury that heavily influences neuronal survival, yet the signals that initiate and control it remain poorly understood. Here we identify the nuclear alarmin, interleukin (IL)-33, as an important regulator of the innate immune response after CNS injury. IL-33 is expressed widely throughout the healthy brain and is concentrated in white mater due to predominant expression in post-mitotic oligodendrocytes. IL-33 is released immediately after CNS injury from damaged oligodendrocytes, acting on local astrocytes and microglia to induce chemokines critical for monocyte recruitment. Mice lacking IL-33 have impaired recovery after CNS injury, which is associated with reduced myeloid cell infiltrates and decreased induction of M2 genes at the injury site. These results demonstrate a novel molecular mediator contributing to immune cell recruitment to the injured CNS and may lead to new therapeutic insights in CNS injury and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1980518572,"Lapses of attention are commonplace, potentially because they are detected too late to be prevented. The authors use real-time fMRI to provide participants continuous access to their attentional state. Real-time feedback, particularly from frontoparietal cortex, improved sustained attention abilities and modified representations in visual cortex and basal ganglia. Lapses of attention can have negative consequences, including accidents and lost productivity. Here we used closed-loop neurofeedback to improve sustained attention abilities and reduce the frequency of lapses. During a sustained attention task, the focus of attention was monitored in real time with multivariate pattern analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging data. When indicators of an attentional lapse were detected in the brain, we gave human participants feedback by making the task more difficult. Behavioral performance improved after one training session, relative to control participants who received feedback from other participants' brains. This improvement was largest when feedback carried information from a frontoparietal attention network. A neural consequence of training was that the basal ganglia and ventral temporal cortex came to represent attentional states more distinctively. These findings suggest that attentional failures do not reflect an upper limit on cognitive potential and that attention can be trained with appropriate feedback about neural signals."
https://openalex.org/W2047103966,"Currently, major concerns about the safety and efficacy of RNA interference (RNAi)-based bone anabolic strategies still exist because of the lack of direct osteoblast-specific delivery systems for osteogenic siRNAs. Here we screened the aptamer CH6 by cell-SELEX, specifically targeting both rat and human osteoblasts, and then we developed CH6 aptamer-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating osteogenic pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1 (Plekho1) siRNA (CH6-LNPs-siRNA). Our results showed that CH6 facilitated in vitro osteoblast-selective uptake of Plekho1 siRNA, mainly via macropinocytosis, and boosted in vivo osteoblast-specific Plekho1 gene silencing, which promoted bone formation, improved bone microarchitecture, increased bone mass and enhanced mechanical properties in both osteopenic and healthy rodents. These results indicate that osteoblast-specific aptamer-functionalized LNPs could act as a new RNAi-based bone anabolic strategy, advancing the targeted delivery selectivity of osteogenic siRNAs from the tissue level to the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2009864558,"Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) occur naturally in marijuana (Cannabis) and may be formulated, individually or in combination in pharmaceuticals such as Marinol or Sativex. Although it is known that these hydrophobic compounds can be transported in blood by albumin or lipoproteins, the intracellular carrier has not been identified. Recent reports suggest that CBD and THC elevate the levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) when administered to humans, suggesting that phytocannabinoids target cellular proteins involved in endocannabinoid clearance. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are intracellular proteins that mediate AEA transport to its catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). By computational analysis and ligand displacement assays, we show that at least three human FABPs bind THC and CBD and demonstrate that THC and CBD inhibit the cellular uptake and catabolism of AEA by targeting FABPs. Furthermore, we show that in contrast to rodent FAAH, CBD does not inhibit the enzymatic actions of human FAAH, and thus FAAH inhibition cannot account for the observed increase in circulating AEA in humans following CBD consumption. Using computational molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis we identify key residues within the active site of FAAH that confer the species-specific sensitivity to inhibition by CBD. Competition for FABPs may in part or wholly explain the increased circulating levels of endocannabinoids reported after consumption of cannabinoids. These data shed light on the mechanism of action of CBD in modulating the endocannabinoid tone in vivo and may explain, in part, its reported efficacy toward epilepsy and other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2069677215,"Mesoaccumbens fibers are thought to co-release dopamine and glutamate. However, the mechanism is unclear, and co-release by mesoaccumbens fibers has not been documented. Using electron microcopy, we found that some mesoaccumbens fibers have vesicular transporters for dopamine (VMAT2) in axon segments that are continuous with axon terminals that lack VMAT2, but contain vesicular glutamate transporters type 2 (VGluT2). In vivo overexpression of VMAT2 did not change the segregation of the two vesicular types, suggesting the existence of highly regulated mechanisms for maintaining this segregation. The mesoaccumbens axon terminals containing VGluT2 vesicles make asymmetric synapses, commonly associated with excitatory signaling. Using optogenetics, we found that dopamine and glutamate were released from the same mesoaccumbens fibers. These findings reveal a complex type of signaling by mesoaccumbens fibers in which dopamine and glutamate can be released from the same axons, but are not normally released at the same site or from the same synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2029034653,"Natural variation within species reveals aspects of genome evolution and function. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an important model for eukaryotic biology, but researchers typically use one standard laboratory strain. To extend the usefulness of this model, we surveyed the genomic and phenotypic variation in 161 natural isolates. We sequenced the genomes of all strains, finding moderate genetic diversity (π = 3 × 10(-3) substitutions/site) and weak global population structure. We estimate that dispersal of S. pombe began during human antiquity (∼340 BCE), and ancestors of these strains reached the Americas at ∼1623 CE. We quantified 74 traits, finding substantial heritable phenotypic diversity. We conducted 223 genome-wide association studies, with 89 traits showing at least one association. The most significant variant for each trait explained 22% of the phenotypic variance on average, with indels having larger effects than SNPs. This analysis represents a rich resource to examine genotype-phenotype relationships in a tractable model."
https://openalex.org/W2054069391,"Generation of potent antibodies by a mutation-selection process called affinity maturation is a key component of effective immune responses. Antibodies that protect against highly mutable pathogens must neutralize diverse strains. Developing effective immunization strategies to drive their evolution requires understanding how affinity maturation happens in an environment where variants of the same antigen are present. We present an in silico model of affinity maturation driven by antigen variants which reveals that induction of cross-reactive antibodies often occurs with low probability because conflicting selection forces, imposed by different antigen variants, can frustrate affinity maturation. We describe how variables such as temporal pattern of antigen administration influence the outcome of this frustrated evolutionary process. Our calculations predict, and experiments in mice with variant gp120 constructs of the HIV envelope protein confirm, that sequential immunization with antigen variants is preferred over a cocktail for induction of cross-reactive antibodies focused on the shared CD4 binding site epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2161959573,"Background Prior electronic cigarette (EC) topography data are based on two video analyses with limited parameters. Alternate methods for measuring topography are needed to understand EC use and nicotine intake. Objectives This study evaluated EC topography with a CReSS Pocket device and quantified nicotine intake. Methods Validation tests on pressure drop, flow rate, and volume confirmed reliable performance of the CReSS Pocket device. Twenty participants used Blu Cigs and V2 Cigs for 10 minute intervals with a 10–15 minute break between brands. Brand order was reversed and repeated within 7 days Data were analyzed to determine puff duration, puff count, volume, flow rate, peak flow, and inter-puff interval. Nicotine intake was estimated from cartomizer fluid consumption and topography data. Results Nine patterns of EC use were identified. The average puff count and inter-puff interval were 32 puffs and 17.9 seconds. All participants, except one, took more than 20 puffs/10 minutes. The averages for puff duration (2.65 seconds/puff), volume/puff (51ml/puff), total puff volume (1,579 ml), EC fluid consumption (79.6 mg), flow rate (20 ml/s), and peak flow rate (27 ml/s) were determined for 10-minute sessions. All parameters except total puff count were significantly different for Blu versus V2 EC. Total volume for Blu versus V2 was four-times higher than for conventional cigarettes. Average nicotine intake for Blu and V2 across both sessions was 1.2 ± 0.5 mg and 1.4 ± 0.7 mg, respectively, which is similar to conventional smokers. Conclusions EC puffing topography was variable among participants in the study, but often similar within an individual between brands or days. Puff duration, inter-puff interval, and puff volume varied from conventional cigarette standards. Data on total puff volume and nicotine intake are consistent with compensatory usage of EC. These data can contribute to the development of a standard protocol for laboratory testing of EC products."
https://openalex.org/W2002469804,"Short-term plasticity of AMPAR currents during high-frequency stimulation depends not only on presynaptic transmitter release and postsynaptic AMPAR recovery from desensitization, but also on fast AMPAR diffusion. How AMPAR diffusion within the synapse regulates synaptic transmission on the millisecond scale remains mysterious. Using single-molecule tracking, we found that, upon glutamate binding, synaptic AMPAR diffuse faster. Using AMPAR stabilized in different conformational states by point mutations and pharmacology, we show that desensitized receptors bind less stargazin and are less stabilized at the synapse than receptors in opened or closed-resting states. AMPAR mobility-mediated regulation of short-term plasticity is abrogated when the glutamate-dependent loss in AMPAR-stargazin interaction is prevented. We propose that transition from the activated to the desensitized state leads to partial loss in AMPAR-stargazin interaction that increases AMPAR mobility and allows faster recovery from desensitization-mediated synaptic depression, without affecting the overall nano-organization of AMPAR in synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2009958353,"Stem cells reside in ‘niches’, where support cells provide critical signalling for tissue renewal. Culture methods mimic niche conditions and support the growth of stem cells in vitro. However, current functional assays preclude statistically meaningful studies of clonal stem cells, stem cell–niche interactions, and genetic analysis of single cells and their organoid progeny. Here, we describe a ‘microraft array’ (MRA) that facilitates high-throughput clonogenic culture and computational identification of single intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and niche cells. We use MRAs to demonstrate that Paneth cells, a known ISC niche component, enhance organoid formation in a contact-dependent manner. MRAs facilitate retrieval of early enteroids for quantitative PCR to correlate functional properties, such as enteroid morphology, with differences in gene expression. MRAs have broad applicability to assaying stem cell–niche interactions and organoid development, and serve as a high-throughput culture platform to interrogate gene expression at early stages of stem cell fate choices. Magness and colleagues present a microwell-based culture system to analyse interactions between intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and Paneth cells, and show that their direct contact enhances formation of ISC-derived organoids."
https://openalex.org/W2128715200,"EBER2 is an abundant nuclear noncoding RNA expressed by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Probing its possible chromatin localization by CHART revealed EBER2’s presence at the terminal repeats (TRs) of the latent EBV genome, overlapping previously identified binding sites for the B cell transcription factor PAX5. EBER2 interacts with PAX5 and is required for the localization of PAX5 to the TRs. EBER2 knockdown phenocopies PAX5 depletion in upregulating the expression of LMP2A/B and LMP1, genes nearest the TRs. Knockdown of EBER2 also decreases EBV lytic replication, underscoring the essential role of the TRs in viral replication. Recruitment of the EBER2-PAX5 complex is mediated by base-pairing between EBER2 and nascent transcripts from the TR locus. The interaction is evolutionarily conserved in the related primate herpesvirus CeHV15 despite great sequence divergence. Using base-pairing with nascent RNA to guide an interacting transcription factor to its DNA target site is a previously undescribed function for a trans-acting noncoding RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2128346152,"Neurogliaform interneurons constitute an essential component of cortical circuits. This paper provides evidence that, during early development, superficial neurogliaform cells of the primary somatosensory barrel field cortex receive prominent innervation from the thalamus. These afferents also activate postsynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, which are essential for the neurons' proper cortical integration. Neuronal microcircuits in the superficial layers of the mammalian cortex provide the substrate for associative cortical computation. Inhibitory interneurons constitute an essential component of the circuitry and are fundamental to the integration of local and long-range information. Here we report that, during early development, superficially positioned Reelin-expressing neurogliaform interneurons in the mouse somatosensory cortex receive afferent innervation from both cortical and thalamic excitatory sources. Attenuation of ascending sensory, but not intracortical, excitation leads to axo-dendritic morphological defects in these interneurons. Moreover, abrogation of the NMDA receptors through which the thalamic inputs signal results in a similar phenotype, as well as in the selective loss of thalamic and a concomitant increase in intracortical connectivity. These results suggest that thalamic inputs are critical in determining the balance between local and long-range connectivity and are fundamental to the proper integration of Reelin-expressing interneurons into nascent cortical circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2052503012,"Sound localization critically depends on detection of differences in arrival time of sounds at the two ears (acoustic delay). The fundamental mechanisms are debated, but all proposals include a process of coincidence detection and a separate source of internal delay that offsets the acoustic delay and determines neural tuning. We used in vivo patch-clamp recordings of binaural neurons in the Mongolian gerbil and pharmacological manipulations to directly compare neuronal input to output and to separate excitation from inhibition. Our results cannot be accounted for by existing models and reveal that coincidence detection is not an instantaneous process, but is instead shaped by the interaction of intrinsic conductances with preceding synaptic activity. This interaction generates an internal delay as an intrinsic part of the process of coincidence detection. The multiplication and time-shifting stages thought to extract synchronous activity in many brain areas can therefore be combined in a single operation."
https://openalex.org/W1981939948,"Ultrasonography of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a non-invasive and rapid method that might be helpful in the identification of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The use of an ONSD greater than 5 mm on ultrasound as an indicator of increased ICP in a Caucasian population has been studied. However, the cut-off point of this predictor in Chinese patients has not been established. Thus, we conducted this study to identify the ONSD criterion for the detection of elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) in a Chinese population and to investigate the influencing factors. This study was a blind cross-sectional study. Patients who presented with suspected increased ICP were included. The opening pressure on LP of each participant was confirmed. We analyzed the clinical differences between the groups of patients with abnormal and normal opening pressures on LP. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the ONSD cut-off point for the identification of abnormal opening pressure on LP. In total, 279 patients were recruited, and 101 patients presented with elevated opening pressure on LP. ONSD was a significant independent predictor of elevated opening pressure on LP (p<0.001). However, no statistical significance was observed regarding the factors that might have affected this relationship including gender, age, body mass index, waistline, head circumference, hypertension and pathological subtype. The ONSD cut-off point for the identification of elevated opening pressure on LP was 4.1 mm; this cut-off yielded a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%. ONSD is a strong and accurate predictor of elevated opening pressure on LP. The cut-off point of this predictor in a Chinese population was remarkably lower than that found in a Caucasian population. Thus, ethnic differences should be noted when using the ONSD as an indicator of increased ICP."
https://openalex.org/W2138323709,"A series of designed peptides call the sphere of influence of the helix macrodipole into question, showing that the favorable rotamers allowed by K→E hydrogen bonds beat out the entropically penalized but macrodipole-aligned E→K hydrogen bonds. The noncovalent forces that stabilize protein structures are not fully understood. One way to address this is to study equilibria between unfolded states and α-helices in peptides. Electrostatic forces—which include interactions between side chains, the backbone and side chains, and side chains and the helix macrodipole—are believed to contribute to these equilibria. Here we probe these interactions experimentally using designed peptides. We find that both terminal backbone–side chain and certain side chain–side chain interactions (which include both local effects between proximal charges and interatomic contacts) contribute much more to helix stability than side chain–helix macrodipole electrostatics, which are believed to operate at larger distances. This has implications for current descriptions of helix stability, the understanding of protein folding and the refinement of force fields for biomolecular modeling and simulations. In addition, this study sheds light on the stability of rod-like structures formed by single α-helices, which are common in natural proteins such as non-muscle myosins."
https://openalex.org/W1976728550,"The placebo effect is a component of any response to a treatment (effective or inert), but we still ignore why it exists. We propose that placebo analgesia is a facet of pain perception, others being the modulating effects of emotions, cognition and past experience, and we suggest that a computational understanding of pain may provide a unifying explanation of these phenomena. Here we show how Bayesian decision theory can account for such features and we describe a model of pain that we tested against experimental data. Our model not only agrees with placebo analgesia, but also predicts that learning can affect pain perception in other unexpected ways, which experimental evidence supports. Finally, the model can also reflect the strategies used by pain perception, showing that modulation by disparate factors is intrinsic to the pain process."

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized and controlled vocabulary covering phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases, and becomes a comprehensive resource for computational analysis of human disease phenotypes. Most of the existing HPO-based software tools cannot be used offline and provide only few similarity measures. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing a comprehensive and offline software for phenotypic features similarity based on HPO. Results HPOSim is an R package for analyzing phenotypic similarity for genes and diseases based on HPO data. Seven commonly used semantic similarity measures are implemented in HPOSim. Enrichment analysis of gene sets and disease sets are also implemented, including hypergeometric enrichment analysis and network ontology analysis (NOA).

https://openalex.org/W2052795301,"A short-term memory can be evoked by different inputs and control separate targets in different behavioral contexts. To address the circuit mechanisms underlying context-dependent memory function, we determined through optical imaging how memory is encoded at the whole-network level in two behavioral settings. Persistent neural activity maintaining a memory of desired eye position was imaged throughout the oculomotor integrator after saccadic or optokinetic stimulation. While eye position was encoded by the amplitude of network activity, the spatial patterns of firing were context dependent: cells located caudally generally were most persistent following saccadic input, whereas cells located rostrally were most persistent following optokinetic input. To explain these data, we computationally identified four independent modes of network activity and found these were differentially accessed by saccadic and optokinetic inputs. These results show how a circuit can simultaneously encode memory value and behavioral context, respectively, in its amplitude and spatial pattern of persistent firing."

Although the A rule was reported over 30 years ago, there is still no general consensus for the mechanism (9.Obeid S. Blatter N. Kranaster R. Schnur A. Diederichs K. Welte W. Marx A.

In some cases an amino acid of the pol is inserted into space available due to the missing base (9.Obeid S. Blatter N. Kranaster R. Schnur A. Diederichs K. Welte W. Marx A.

One of the issues is which pol(s) is most relevant in considering the bypass of AP sites. Although hpol η has been reported to be inefficient in the bypass of such sites (17.Haracska L. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Inefficient bypass of an abasic site by DNA polymerase η. Inefficient bypass of an abasic site by DNA polymerase η.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6861-6866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it was found to be the most efficient single pol (at an AP site) when compared with other human translesion synthesis pols (18.Choi J.-Y. Lim S. Kim E.J. Jo A. Guengerich F.P. Translesion synthesis across abasic lesions by human B-family and Y-family DNA polymerases α, δ, η, ι, κ, and REV1.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 404: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yeast pol η was reported to be important in one study (19.Zhao B. Xie Z. Shen H. Wang Z. Role of DNA polymerase η in the bypass of abasic sites in yeast cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3984-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but not in another (20.Gibbs P.E. McDonald J.

We analyzed hpol η in terms of its miscoding properties, in light of the evidence that it may be an important factor in mutagenesis at AP sites. We found a proclivity of hpol η to insert both purines, A and G, opposite AP sites, which is reminiscent of an earlier reported behavior of hpol β (8.Sagher D. Strauss B. Abasic sites from cytosine as termination signals for DNA synthesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4285-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A structural basis was identified using x-ray crystallography, i.e. water-mediated hydrogen bonding between the 5′-phosphate of the AP site and the Watson-Crick face of purines. When an appropriate pyrimidine is present in the template 5′ to the AP position, extensive −1 frameshifts occur. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), T4 polynucleotide kinase, and uracil DNA glycosylase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). A mixture of four dNTPs was purchased from Invitrogen. All nonhydrolyzable dNMPNPPs were obtained from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Biospin 6 columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. All unmodified oligonucleotides (HPLC purification) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides containing an AP site or an AP analog (tetrahydrofuran (THF)) were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego). The catalytic core (amino acids 1–432) of hpol η was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (22.Biertümpfel C. Zhao Y. Kondo Y. Ramón-Maiques S. Gregory M. Lee J.Y.

The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. Prior to kinetic assays, time course experiments were run to optimize reaction conditions. All polymerase reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). The 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled primer-template (18-/23-mer) duplex (5 μm) was extended using 4–40 nm concentrations of hpol η in the presence of various concentrations of a single dNTP (0–1 mm) at 37 °C for 5–20 min. Reactions were terminated with a quench solution containing 20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide (v/v), bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol. Products were separated on 18% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5 m urea. Gels were scanned by a Typhoon Scanner (GE Healthcare) and analyzed by fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The values of kcat and Km were determined using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study Open table in a new tab Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench flow apparatus (KinTek, Austin, TX). The 18-mer primer was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to a 23-mer template. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing 32P-labeled primer-template/polymerase mixtures with an equal volume of dNTP-Mg2+ complex at 37 °C. The final concentrations of the reactants were as follows: 25 nm hpol η, 50 nm 32P-labeled primer-template complex, 0.5 mm dNTP. Other reaction conditions were the same as described for steady-state kinetic assays. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA at reaction times varying from 5 ms to 5 s. Products were separated using 18% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Bands on the gels were visualized using a phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad, Molecular Imager FX) and Quantity One software as previously described (26.Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A.

Pre-steady-state points were fit (GraphPad Prism) to burst Equation 1, y=A(1−e−kpt)+ksst(Eq. 1) where A indicates the burst amplitude, kp is the first order rate, and kss is steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation. A 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled primer containing a deoxyuridine (U) residue, 5′-CGG GCT CGT AAG CGT CUT-3′, was used to generate shorter chains after the cleavage by uracil DNA glycosylase and piperidine treatment (26.Zang H.

Reaction conditions were similar to those used in steady-state kinetic assays except that the final concentrations were as follows: 3 μm hpol η and 25 μm primer-template duplex, in a total volume of 80 μl. The primer was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (1 mm each) for 2–24 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by removal of excess dNTP and Mg2+ using a spin column. The extent of reactions was monitored by electrophoresis prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The reaction mixture was treated with 50 units of uracil DNA glycosylase and 0.25 m hot piperidine following a previous protocol (26.Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V.

LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Associates) coupled to a Thermo Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) operating in an ESI negative mode. Samples were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH octadecylsilane (C18) column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. Eluent A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 in 98% H2O, 2% CH3CN (v/v), and eluent B consisted of 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 in 90% CH3CN, 10% H2O (v/v). A gradient program was run as follows: 0–3-min linear gradient from 0 to 3% B; 3–5-min linear gradient to 20% B; 5–6-min linear gradient to 100% B, held at 100% B for 2 min; 8–10 min from 100% B to 0% B, held at 0% B for 3 min. MS data were acquired using Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo). ESI settings were as follows: source voltage 4 kV; source current 100 A; capillary voltage −49 V; capillary temperature 350 °C; tube lens voltage −90 V. The most abundant species (−2 or −3 charged) were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with a normalized collision energy of 35%. An activation Q setting of 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms were used. Oligonucleotide sequences were identified by comparing the observed CID spectra and theoretical spectra of candidate oligonucleotide sequences, which were calculated by software Mongo Oligo Calculator 2.0 from the University of Utah. The relative yields of various DNA extension products were based on their respective peak areas of the most abundant ions in extracted ion chromatograms (EICs). Some products with the same retention times and the same molecular weights were quantified by comparing the amounts of their specific CID fragments. Primer and template sequences employed in the crystallization experiments are listed in Table 1. DNA templates containing an AP site (THF-based mimic) were purchased from TriLink, and unmodified 8-mer primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Template and primer strands were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and annealed in the presence of 10 mm sodium HEPES buffer (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl by heating for 10 min at 85 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Prior to crystallization, the DNA duplex was mixed with the protein in a 1.2:1 molar ratio in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 450 mm KCl and 3 mm DTT. Following addition of 5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2, the complex was concentrated to a final concentration of ∼2–3 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Either non-hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates (dNMPNPP) or dCTP was then added to form the ternary complexes. Crystallization experiments were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 18 °C using a sparse matrix screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) (28.Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. Sparse matrix sampling: a screening method for crystallization of proteins.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). One μl of the complex solution was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 500-μl reservoir wells. Crystals appeared in droplets containing 0.1 m sodium MES (pH 5.5), containing 5 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2, and 24–28% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether within 1 day and grew to their maximum size within a week. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops, cryo-protected in reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol (v/v), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on the 21-ID-D or 21-ID-F beamline of the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). All data were integrated and scaled with the program HKL2000 (29.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab As a result of instability of natural AP sites, most crystal structure studies and kinetic assays have been carried out using a THF analog instead of true AP sites (Fig. 1) (18.Choi J.-Y.

In this study, experiments were performed using four DNA oligonucleotides containing the stable AP analog THF as well as two oligonucleotides containing a natural AP site (oligonucleotide sequences shown in Table 1). These oligonucleotides have similar sequences except for the neighboring bases at the 5′ side of AP sites. Natural AP sites and the THF analog demonstrated similar steady-state kinetic properties (Table 2). In this study, undamaged G was used as the control template base because G is the most commonly lost base due to AP site formation in cells (18.Choi J.-Y. Lim S. Kim E.J. Jo A. Guengerich F.P.

We used this human pathogen to investigate the roles and potential interdependencies of the conserved proteins CpsABCD encoded in the cps operon, by developing knock-out and functional mutant strains. The mutant strains were examined for CPS quantity, size, and attachment to the cell surface as well as CpsD phosphorylation. We observed that CpsB, -C, and -D compose a phosphoregulatory system where the CpsD autokinase phosphorylates its C-terminal tyrosines in a CpsC-dependent manner. These Tyr residues are also the target of the cognate CpsB phosphatase. An interaction between CpsD and CpsC was observed, and the phosphorylation state of CpsD influenced the subsequent action of CpsC.

GBS colonizes the anogenital tract of 10–30% of healthy women, and vertical transmission may cause bacterial septicemia and meningitis in the neonate (2.Barton L.L. Feigin R.D. Lins R.

GBS produces a capsule that surrounds and protects the bacterium by preventing complement deposition and opsonophagocytosis (6.Marques M.B. Kasper D.L. Pangburn M.K. Wessels M.R. Prevention of C3 deposition by capsular polysaccharide is a virulence mechanism of type III group B streptococci.Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) conjugated to carrier proteins are currently used as vaccines against several pathogens (7.van den Biggelaar A.H. Pomat W.S. Immunization of newborns with bacterial conjugate vaccines.Vaccine. 2013; 31: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8.Avci F.Y. Kasper D.L. How bacterial carbohydrates influence the adaptive immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 107-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CPS biosynthesis in GBS has not been investigated in detail but is presumably similar to the better characterized pathway of S. pneumoniae (see Ref. 9.Yother J. Capsules of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria: paradigms for polysaccharide biosynthesis and regulation.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar for a detailed review). Briefly, the basic repeating units of the CPS of S. pneumoniae are synthesized at the cytosolic side of the membrane by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases. The unit is anchored to a membrane lipid, and it is transferred to the outer side of the membrane, where it is polymerized into the full-length CPS. The CPS is then covalently bound to the cell wall peptidoglycan, thus creating the mucoid capsule layer covering the bacterial surface (9.Yother J. Capsules of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria: paradigms for polysaccharide biosynthesis and regulation.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Also in GBS, the CPS has been demonstrated to be covalently bound to the cell wall peptidoglycan (10.Deng L. Kasper D.L. Krick T.P. Wessels M.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7497-7504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The CPS from GBS comprises repeating units constituted of 5–7 monosaccharides, depending on the serotype. The enzymes required for the transport and the assembly of the CPS are encoded in the cps operon (11.Rubens C.E. Heggen L.M. Haft R.F. Wessels M.R.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5176-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of 16–18 genes transcribed in a single transcript (12.Yamamoto S. Miyake K. Koike Y. Watanabe M. Machida Y. Ohta M. Iijima S. Molecular characterization of type-specific capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5176-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cps operon is divided into three main regions (13.Cieslewicz M.J. Chaffin D. Glusman G. Kasper D. Madan A. Rodrigues S. Fahey J. Wessels M.R. Rubens C.E. Structural and genetic diversity of group B streptococcus capsular polysaccharides.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The central part of the operon (cpsE–L) determines the capsule serotype and comprises genes encoding glycosyltransferases and a polymerase. The last four genes of the operon (neuA–neuD) encode enzymes that synthesize sialic acid. Finally, the first genes of the operon (cpsA–D) are not directly involved in the biosynthesis of the CPS repeating units (14.Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R. Functional analysis in type Ia group B Streptococcus of a cluster of genes involved in extracellular polysaccharide production by diverse species of streptococci.J. Biol.

The genes cpsA–D are conserved among all the GBS capsule serotypes and have orthologues in other encapsulated streptococci, such as S. pneumoniae (12.Yamamoto S. Miyake K. Koike Y. Watanabe M. Machida Y. Ohta M. Iijima S. Molecular characterization of type-specific capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5176-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their function in GBS has been previously investigated through the construction and characterization of knock-out mutants, suggesting that CpsA is required for transcription of the cps operon, whereas CpsC and CpsD have a more undefined role in polymerization/export of CPS (14.Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R. Functional analysis in type Ia group B Streptococcus of a cluster of genes involved in extracellular polysaccharide production by diverse species of streptococci.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, recombinant CpsA was shown to bind the cps operon promoter in vitro (15.Hanson B.R. Runft D.L. Streeter C. Kumar A. Carion T.W. Neely M.N. Functional analysis of the CpsA protein of Streptococcus agalactiae.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CpsA is a 485-aa membrane protein with a major extracellular portion. The extracellular domains of the homologous proteins in S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis have recently been crystallized and were proposed to be responsible for hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate linkage between the CPS and the membrane lipid anchor (16.Kawai Y. Marles-Wright J. Cleverley R.M. Emmins R. Ishikawa S. Kuwano M. Heinz N. Bui N.K. Hoyland C.N. Ogasawara N. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Daniel R.A. Errington J. A widespread family of bacterial cell wall assembly proteins.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4931-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and subsequent attachment of CPS to the peptidoglycan (17.Eberhardt A. Hoyland C.N. Vollmer D. Bisle S. Cleverley R.M. Johnsborg O. Håvarstein L.S. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Attachment of capsular polysaccharide to the cell wall in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Microb. Drug Resist. 2012; 18: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these functions appear different from those suggested for CpsA in GBS. Concerning CpsBCD, orthologous proteins in S. pneumoniae (46–64% aa identity) were described to constitute a phosphoregulatory system, where CpsD is an autokinase and CpsB is the cognate phosphatase (18.Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CpsD negatively regulates capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19.Bender M.H. Yother J. CpsB is a modulator of capsule-associated tyrosine kinase activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47966-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By analogy, it can be argued that CPS biosynthesis in GBS is similar to S. pneumoniae overall. However, experimental studies investigating the role of CpsABCD in GBS are limited and present potential discrepancies compared with S. pneumoniae and other related species. Moreover, it is still unclear whether and how the GBS CpsABCD proteins and their counterparts in other species act in concert as a system. In the present work, we attempted to elucidate the molecular details of the final steps in the biosynthesis of the GBS CPS, with a focus on the role of CpsABCD. To that end, we developed a panel of knock-out and functional mutant strains and analyzed the effects on cps operon transcription; CPS quantity, size, and attachment to the cell surface; and CpsD phosphorylation. In vivo molecular interactions between the CpsABCD proteins were also investigated. The resulting data provided novel insights into the role of each individual protein as well as their interdependencies. We concluded that these proteins are not involved in cps transcription or the synthesis of the basal repeating unit, but they are responsible for balancing the processes of polymerization and attachment to the cell wall of the CPS. GBS strains 515 and 515ΔcpsE were provided by Dr. Dennis Kasper (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and Dr. Michael Cieslewicz (14.Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R.

Tryptic soy broth, 15 g/liter agar (TSA) was used as solid medium. Strains were stored at −80 °C in THB medium, 15% glycerol. MAX Efficiency® DH5αTM competent cells (Life Technologies) and chemically competent HK100 and BTH101 Escherichia coli cells were prepared in-house and used for transformation, propagation, and preparation of plasmids. E. coli was grown at 37 °C with agitation (180 rpm) in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or on LB + 15 g/liter agar plates. Erythromycin was used for selection of GBS (1 μg/ml) or E. coli (100 μg/ml) containing the pJRS233-derived plasmids (20.Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R.

Kanamycin was used for selection of E. coli (50 μg/ml) containing the pET24b-derived plasmids (Novagen, Pretoria, South Africa) and the pKT25-derived plasmids (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). Ampicillin was used for selection of E. coli (100 μg/ml) containing the pUT18C-derived plasmids (Euromedex) and the pET15-derived plasmids (Millipore). To prepare each mutant strain, the shuttle vector pJRS233 (20.Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R.

Mutant strains obtained are described in Table 2, and primers used for the development of constructs are listed in Table 1. Constructs for genes with codon substitutions were prepared using a splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOEing-PCR) strategy (21.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Engineering hybrid genes without the use of restriction enzymes: gene splicing by overlap extension.Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Briefly, amplicons up- and downstream of the codon substitution were amplified from GBS 515 genomic DNA using the PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies). Internal primers used to amplify the two parts of the genes have 15-bp overlapping tails and introduce the codon substitution, and amplicons are then joined together by SOEing-PCR. The resulting fragment was ligated into pJRS233 using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites.TABLE 2GBS strains used in this workStrain nameDescriptionMutated protein (full-length aa)GBS 515Wild type strainΔcpsEcpsE deletionDetails in Ref. 14.Cieslewicz M.J.

Incomplete primer extension during in vitro DNA amplification catalyzed by Taq polymerase: exploitation for DNA sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9613-9620Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gene and 900–1,000 bp up- and downstream of the coding sequence were amplified from GBS 515 genomic DNA and cloned into pET24b using NotI and XhoI (cpsA inserts) or BamHI and XhoI (cpsB-C-D inserts) restriction sites. In-frame deletions were developed by amplifying the plasmid using primers with 15-bp overlapping tails annealing at the two sides of the region to delete. Linear plasmids were transformed into HK100 competent cells able to recircularize the plasmid. Following propagation and purification of the plasmid, the inserts containing the in-frame deletions were transferred into pJRS233 plasmid by restriction digestion, ligation, and transformation of E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies). Constructs for chromosomal complementation were prepared by cloning the respective WT loci into pJRS233. The various pJRS233 constructs were used for insertion/duplication and excision mutagenesis (14.Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R.

Integration was performed by growth of transformants at 37 °C (non-permissive temperature for the suicide shuttle vector) with erythromycin selection. Excision of the integrated plasmid was performed by serial passages in THB at 30 °C and parallel screening for erythromycin-sensitive colonies on the plate. Mutants were verified by PCR sequencing of the loci. RNA extracts were prepared as described (24.Faralla C. Metruccio M.M. De Chiara M. Mu R. Patras K.A. Muzzi A. Grandi G. Margarit I. Doran K.S.

Bacteria were harvested at two time points, at A600 = 0.4 (log phase) and A600 = 1.7 (early stationary phase). cDNA was prepared using the reverse transcription system (Promega) by using 500 ng of RNA/reaction. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 50 ng of cDNA that was amplified using LightCycler® 480 DNA SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were monitored using a LightCycler® 480 instrument and software (Roche Applied Science). Three technical replicates were monitored for each strain/condition analyzed. To quantify cps operon transcription level, primers annealing on cpsA and cpsE were used for all of the strains with the exception of cpsA mutants, where primers for cpsD and cpsE were used. The transcript amounts in each condition were standardized to an internal control gene (gyrA) and compared with standardized expression in the WT strain (ΔΔCT method). The primers used are listed in Table 1. Alkaline extraction of CPS from GBS bacteria was performed as described previously (25.Wessels M.R. Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. DiFabio J.L. Michon F. Holme K. Jennings H.J. Immunogenicity in animals of a polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine against type III group B Streptococcus.J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were grown in 50 ml of THB at 37 °C for 8 h (stationary phase). Viable counts were performed and confirmed that cfu numbers between the strains were comparable. GBS cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,220 × g at 4 °C; resuspended in PBS, 0.8 n NaOH; and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Samples were neutralized by the addition of HCl and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:10 in distilled H2O, loaded on a Vivaspin 10 tube (Sigma), and centrifuged at 3,220 × g until most of the solution passed through the membrane. After two washes with distilled H2O, the CPS extract was recovered from the membrane by resuspension in water. The amount of CPS present in the extract was estimated by measuring the sialic acid content using the colorimetric resorcinol-hydrochloric acid method (26.Svennerholm L. Quantitative estimation of sialic acids: II. A colorimetric resorcinol-hydrochloric acid method.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 120 μl of extract were mixed with 380 μl of water and 500 μl of resorcinol solution (0.2% resorcinol, 0.3 mm copper sulfate, 30% (v/v) HCl). Samples were boiled for 20 min and cooled to room temperature, and absorbance was measured at 564 nm. The sialic acid content of the samples was then determined by comparison with a concomitantly prepared standard curve using serial dilutions of purified sialic acid. Bacteria were grown in 10 ml of THB at 37 °C for 8 h. GBS cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,220 × g at 4 °C, and the growth medium was collected and filtered using a 0.22-μm Nalgene syringe filter (Thermo Scientific). The amount of capsular polysaccharide in the medium was estimated by dot blot. Serial dilutions (1:2) were prepared in PBS. Two μl of each serial dilution were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was dried for 20 min and blocked by soaking in 5% skim milk in PBS, Tween 20 (0.05%) (PBST). Detection by immunoblotting was performed as described below (see “Immunoblotting Experiments”). Bacteria were grown in 10 ml of THB at 37 °C for 8 h. GBS cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,220 × g at 4 °C and washed in PBS. Extracts of CPS attached to the peptidoglycan were prepared by incubating the bacterial pellet with 200 units of mutanolysin (Sigma) diluted in 50 μl of protoplasting buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, 40% sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at 37 °C. 20 μl of Proteinase K solution (Life Technologies) were added, and samples were incubated at 56 °C for 30 min.

https://openalex.org/W2038758302,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for tuberculosis but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We examined the effects of hyperglycaemia, a hallmark of diabetes, on the cytokine response to and macrophage infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Increasing in vitro glucose concentrations from 5 to 25 mmol/L had marginal effects on cytokine production following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with M. tuberculosis lysate, LPS or Candida albicans, while 40 mmol/L glucose increased production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, but not of IFN-γ, IL-17A and IL-22. Macrophage differentiation under hyperglycaemic conditions of 25 mmol/L glucose was also associated with increased cytokine production upon stimulation with M. tuberculosis lysate and LPS but in infection experiments no differences in M. tuberculosis killing or outgrowth was observed. The phagocytic capacity of these hyperglycaemic macrophages also remained unaltered. The fact that only very high glucose concentrations were able to significantly influence cytokine production by macrophages suggests that hyperglycaemia alone cannot fully explain the increased susceptibility of diabetes mellitus patients to tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2058532554,"Mutations in the Park2 gene, encoding the RING-HECT hybrid E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, are responsible for a common familial form of Parkinson disease. By mono- and polyubiquitinating target proteins, parkin regulates various cellular processes, including degradation of proteins within the 26 S proteasome, a large multimeric degradation machine. In our attempt to further elucidate the function of parkin, we have identified the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn13/ADRM1 as a parkin-interacting protein. We show that the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of parkin binds directly to the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin (Pru) domain within Rpn13. Using mutational analysis and NMR, we find that Pru binding involves the hydrophobic patch surrounding Ile-44 in the parkin Ubl, a region that is highly conserved between ubiquitin and Ubl domains. However, compared with ubiquitin, the parkin Ubl exhibits greater than 10-fold higher affinity for the Pru domain. Moreover, knockdown of Rpn13 in cells increases parkin levels and abrogates parkin recruitment to the 26 S proteasome, establishing Rpn13 as the major proteasomal receptor for parkin. In contrast, silencing Rpn13 did not impair parkin recruitment to mitochondria or parkin-mediated mitophagy upon carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone-induced mitochondrial depolarization. However, it did delay the clearance of mitochondrial proteins (TIM23, TIM44, and TOM20) and enhance parkin autoubiquitination. Taken together, these findings implicate Rpn13 in linking parkin to the 26 S proteasome and regulating the clearance of mitochondrial proteins during mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W1988714047,"To investigate the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes circulating in Uganda’s cattle population, both serological and virological analyses of samples from outbreaks that occurred during 2012–2013 were performed. Altogether, 79 sera and 60 oropharyngeal fluid (OP)/tissue/oral swab samples were collected from herds with reported FMD outbreaks in seven different Ugandan districts. Overall, 61/79 (77%) of the cattle sera were positive for antibodies against FMDV by PrioCHECK FMDV NS ELISA and solid phase blocking ELISA detected titres ≥ 80 for serotypes O, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 in 41, 45, 30 and 45 of these 61 seropositive samples, respectively. Virus neutralisation tests detected the highest levels of neutralising antibodies (titres ≥ 45) against serotype O in the herds from Kween and Rakai districts, against SAT 1 in the herd from Nwoya district and against SAT 2 in the herds from Kiruhura, Isingiro and Ntungamo districts. The isolation of a SAT 2 FMDV from Isingiro was consistent with the detection of high levels of neutralising antibodies against SAT 2; sequencing (for the VP1 coding region) indicated that this virus belonged to lineage I within this serotype, like the currently used vaccine strain. From the Wakiso district 11 tissue/swab samples were collected; serotype A FMDV, genotype Africa (G-I), was isolated from the epithelial samples. This study shows that within a period of less than one year, FMD outbreaks in Uganda were caused by four different serotypes namely O, A, SAT 1 and SAT 2. Therefore, to enhance the control of FMD in Uganda, there is need for efficient and timely determination of outbreak virus strains/serotypes and vaccine matching. The value of incorporating serotype A antigen into the imported vaccines along with the current serotype O, SAT 1 and SAT 2 strains should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1965538471,"Aim To investigate the association between different family history risk categories and prevalence of diabetes in the Chinese population. Methods The family history of diabetes was obtained from each subject, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed for measuring the fasting and postload glucose and insulin levels based on a national representative cross-sectional survey of 46,239 individuals (age ≥ 20 years) in the 2007–2008 China National Diabetes and Metabolism Disorders Study. The family history risk categories of diabetes were high, moderate, and average (FH2 and FH1: at least two generations and one generation of first-degree relatives with diabetes, respectively; FH0: no first-degree relatives with diabetes). Results The age- and gender-adjusted prevalence rates of diabetes were 32.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.4–39.7%) in FH2, 20.1% (95% CI: 18.2–22.1%) in FH1, and 8.4% (95% CI: 7.9–8.9%) in FH0 (P < 0.0001). The calculated homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and insulinogenic index (ΔI30/ΔG30) values showed significant trending changes among the three risk categories, with the most negative effects in FH2. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios of having diabetes were 6.16 (95% CI: 4.46–8.50) and 2.86 (95% CI: 2.41–3.39) times higher in FH2 and FH1, respectively, than in FH0 after adjustment for classical risk factors for diabetes. Conclusions Family history risk categories of diabetes have a significant, independent, and graded association with the prevalence of this disease in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2048347420,"There have been a number of studies on biogeographic patterns of plant leaf functional traits; however, the variations in traits of other plant organs such as twigs are rarely investigated. In this study, we sampled current-year twigs of 335 tree species from 12 forest sites across a latitudinal span of 32 degrees in China, and measured twig specific density (TSD), twig dry matter content (TDMC), and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) contents, to explore the latitudinal and environmental patterns of these twig traits. The overall mean of TSD and TDMC was 0.37 g cm−3 and 41%, respectively; mean twig C, N and P was 472 mg g−1, 9.8 mg g−1 and 1.15 mg g−1, respectively, and mean N:P mass ratio was 10.6. TSD was positively correlated with TDMC which was positively associated with twig C but negatively with twig N and P. There were no significant differences in TSD between conifer, deciduous-broadleaf and evergreen-broadleaf plants, but evergreen-broadleaf plants had the lowest and conifers the highest TDMC. Conifer twigs were lowest in C, N, P and N:P, whereas deciduous-plant twigs were highest in N and P and evergreen-plant twigs were highest in C and N:P. As latitude increased or temperature/precipitation dropped, TDMC and P increased, but N:P ratio decreased. Our results also showed that the patterns of twig P and N:P stoichiometry were consistent with those reported for leaves, but no significant trends in twig N were observed along the gradient of latitude, climate and soils. This study provides the first large-scale patterns of the twig traits and will improve our understanding of the biogeochemistry of carbon and other key nutrients in forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2139758582,"Background Patients with schizophrenia are deficient in multiple aspects of social cognition, including biological motion perception. In the present study we investigated the ability to read social information from point-light stimuli in schizophrenia. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants with paranoid schizophrenia and healthy controls were presented with a biological motion task depicting point-light actions of two agents either engaged in a communicative interaction, or acting independently of each other. For each stimulus, participants were asked to decide whether the two agents were communicating vs. acting independently of each other (task A), and to select the correct action description among five response alternatives (task B). Participants were also presented with a mental rotation task to assess their visuospatial abilities, and with a facial emotion recognition task tapping social cognition. Results revealed that participants with schizophrenia performed overall worse than controls both in discriminating communicative from non-communicative actions (task A) and in selecting which of the 5 response alternatives best described the observed actions (task B). Interestingly, the impaired performance of schizophrenic participants was mainly due to misclassification of non-communicative stimuli as communicative actions. Correlation analysis revealed that visuospatial abilities predicted performance in task A but not in task B, while facial emotion recognition abilities was correlated with performance in both task A and task B. Conclusions/Significance These findings are consistent with theories of “overmentalizing” (excessive attribution of intentionality) in schizophrenia, and suggest that processing social information from biological motion does rely on social cognition abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2030086415,"Fibroblast growth factors 19 and 21 (FGF19 and FGF21) have been implicated, independently, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) but it is not known if their circulating levels correlate with each other or whether the associated hepatic signaling mechanisms that play a role in glucose metabolism are dysregulated in diabetes. We used a cross-sectional, case/control, experimental design involving Class III obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (RYGB), and measured FGF19 and FGF21 serum levels and hepatic gene expression (mRNA) in perioperative liver wedge biopsies. We found that T2D patients had lower FGF19 and higher FGF21 serum levels. The latter was corroborated transcriptionally, whereby, FGF21, as well as CYP7A1, β-Klotho, FGFR4, HNF4α, and glycogen synthase, but not of SHP or FXR mRNA levels in liver biopsies were higher in T2D patients that did not remit diabetes after RYGB surgery, compared to T2D patients that remitted diabetes after RYGB surgery or did not have diabetes. In a Phenome-wide association analysis using 205 clinical variables, higher FGF21 serum levels were associated with higher glucose levels and various cardiometabolic disease phenotypes. When serum levels of FGF19 were 500 mg/mL, 91% of patients had diabetes. These data suggest that FGF19/FGF21 circulating levels and hepatic gene expression of the associated signaling pathway are significantly dysregulated in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2073176530,"In order to retrieve useful information from scientific literature and electronic medical records (EMR) we developed an ontology specific for Multiple Sclerosis (MS).The MS Ontology was created using scientific literature and expert review under the Protégé OWL environment. We developed a dictionary with semantic synonyms and translations to different languages for mining EMR. The MS Ontology was integrated with other ontologies and dictionaries (diseases/comorbidities, gene/protein, pathways, drug) into the text-mining tool SCAIView. We analyzed the EMRs from 624 patients with MS using the MS ontology dictionary in order to identify drug usage and comorbidities in MS. Testing competency questions and functional evaluation using F statistics further validated the usefulness of MS ontology.Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed an adequate performance (F score = 0.73). The MS Ontology retrieved 80% of the genes associated with MS from scientific abstracts and identified additional pathways targeted by approved disease-modifying drugs (e.g. apoptosis pathways associated with mitoxantrone, rituximab and fingolimod). The analysis of the EMR from patients with MS identified current usage of disease modifying drugs and symptomatic therapy as well as comorbidities, which are in agreement with recent reports.The MS Ontology provides a semantic framework that is able to automatically extract information from both scientific literature and EMR from patients with MS, revealing new pathogenesis insights as well as new clinical information."
https://openalex.org/W2064429896,"Bacterial L-asparaginases have been used as anti-cancer drugs for over 4 decades though presenting, along with their therapeutic efficacy, several side effects due to their bacterial origin and, seemingly, to their secondary glutaminase activity. Helicobacter pylori type II L-asparaginase possesses interesting features, among which a reduced catalytic efficiency for L-GLN, compared to the drugs presently used in therapy. In the present study, we describe some enzyme variants with catalytic and in vitro cytotoxic activities different from the wild type enzyme. Particularly, replacements on catalytic threonines (T16D and T95E) deplete the enzyme of both its catalytic activities, once more underlining the essential role of such residues. One serendipitous mutant, M121C/T169M, had a preserved efficiency vs L-asparagine but was completely unable to carry out L-glutamine hydrolysis. Interestingly, this variant did not exert any cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells. The M121C and T169M single mutants had reduced catalytic activities (nearly 2.5- to 4-fold vs wild type enzyme, respectively). Mutant Q63E, endowed with a similar catalytic efficiency versus asparagine and halved glutaminase efficiency with respect to the wild type enzyme, was able to exert a cytotoxic effect comparable to, or higher than, the one of the wild type enzyme when similar asparaginase units were used. These findings may be relevant to determine the role of glutaminase activity of L-asparaginase in the anti-proliferative effect of the drug and to shed light on how to engineer the best asparaginase/glutaminase combination for an ever improved, patients-tailored therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2034615738,"Purpose To investigate the postmenstrual (PMA) age at treatment of severe retinopathy of prematurity (i.e. Type 1 prethreshold or threshold) in infants in a tertiary referral center in China. Principal Findings 76.6% (359/469) of infants were treated for threshold disease. 67.5% (317/469) of infants had a birth weight (BW) of 1250g or above and almost 30% (126) had a gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks or above. There was little difference in the characteristics of infants treated for Type 1 prethreshold or threshold ROP. After controlling for GA, PMA age at treatment was highest in infants with BW ≥2000g (mean PMA 40.3±4.4 weeks, p<0.001); after controlling for BW, higher GA was associated with higher PMA at treatment (mean PMA 41.5 weeks for gestational age >34 weeks, p<0.001). For every three weeks increase in GA there was a two-week increase in PMA at treatment (R2 = 0.20, p<0.001). The time at treatment of Type 1 prethreshold disease was similar to that for threshold disease i.e. chronological age 5.6∓7.4 weeks, or PMA 34.1∓40.2 weeks but the lower end of the 95% confidence interval for chronological age for Type 1 prethreshold disease among infants with BW ≥2000g was 3.7 weeks (i.e. before the recommended interval of 4∓6 weeks after birth). Significance The Chinese guidelines regarding timing of the first examination are appropriate for infants with BW <2000g, but more mature infants should be examined a little earlier, at 3 weeks after birth, in order to detect Type 1 prethreshold disease which has a better prognosis than threshold."
https://openalex.org/W2052594402,"RGS14 contains distinct binding sites for both active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of Gα subunits. The N-terminal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain binds active Gαi/o-GTP, whereas the C-terminal G protein regulatory (GPR) motif binds inactive Gαi1/3-GDP. The molecular basis for how RGS14 binds different activation states of Gα proteins to integrate G protein signaling is unknown. Here we explored the intramolecular communication between the GPR motif and the RGS domain upon G protein binding and examined whether RGS14 can functionally interact with two distinct forms of Gα subunits simultaneously. Using complementary cellular and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that RGS14 forms a stable complex with inactive Gαi1-GDP at the plasma membrane and that free cytosolic RGS14 is recruited to the plasma membrane by activated Gαo-AlF4−. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies showed that RGS14 adopts different conformations in live cells when bound to Gα in different activation states. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that RGS14 is a very dynamic protein that undergoes allosteric conformational changes when inactive Gαi1-GDP binds the GPR motif. Pure RGS14 forms a ternary complex with Gαo-AlF4− and an AlF4−-insensitive mutant (G42R) of Gαi1-GDP, as observed by size exclusion chromatography and differential hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Finally, a preformed RGS14·Gαi1-GDP complex exhibits full capacity to stimulate the GTPase activity of Gαo-GTP, demonstrating that RGS14 can functionally engage two distinct forms of Gα subunits simultaneously. Based on these findings, we propose a working model for how RGS14 integrates multiple G protein signals in host CA2 hippocampal neurons to modulate synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2009087166,"Background and Study Aims Endoscopic diagnosis of esophageal achalasia lacking typical endoscopic features can be extremely difficult. The aim of this study was to identify simple and reliable early indicator of esophageal achalasia. Patients and Methods This single-center retrospective study included 56 cases of esophageal achalasia without previous treatment. As a control, 60 non-achalasia subjects including reflux esophagitis and superficial esophageal cancer were also included in this study. Endoscopic findings were evaluated according to Descriptive Rules for Achalasia of the Esophagus as follows: (1) esophageal dilatation, (2) abnormal retention of liquid and/or food, (3) whitish change of the mucosal surface, (4) functional stenosis of the esophago-gastric junction, and (5) abnormal contraction. Additionally, the presence of the longitudinal superficial wrinkles of esophageal mucosa, “pinstripe pattern (PSP)” was evaluated endoscopically. Then, inter-observer diagnostic agreement was assessed for each finding. Results The prevalence rates of the above-mentioned findings (1–5) were 41.1%, 41.1%, 16.1%, 94.6%, and 43.9%, respectively. PSP was observed in 60.7% of achalasia, while none of the control showed positivity for PSP. PSP was observed in 26 (62.5%) of 35 cases with shorter history < 10 years, which usually lacks typical findings such as severe esophageal dilation and tortuosity. Inter-observer agreement level was substantial for food/liquid remnant (k = 0.6861) and PSP (k = 0.6098), and was fair for abnormal contraction and white change. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for achalasia were 83.8%, 64.7%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion “Pinstripe pattern” could be a reliable indicator for early discrimination of primary esophageal achalasia."
https://openalex.org/W2095220569,"Purpose The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of manganese (Mn) dust exposure on lung functions and evaluate the potential synergistic effect between smoking and Mn dust exposure among refinery workers. Methods A retrospective study including 1658 workers in a ferromanganese refinery was conducted, with subjects who were from the Guangxi manganese-exposed workers healthy cohort (GXMEWHC). Based on the Mn manganese cumulative exposure index (Mn-CEI), all subjects were divided into the low exposure group (n = 682) and the high exposure group (n = 976). A pulmonary function test was performed using an electronic spirometer, including the values and percentages of FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MMEF, PEFR, MVV, respectively. Results No significant effect of Mn dust exposure on the pulmonary function was found in the female workers (all p>0.05). However, there was an obvious decrease in the male workers in the high exposure group compared with those in the low exposure group (FVC -60 ml, FEV1 -120 ml, MMEF -260 ml/s, MVV -5.06 L, all p<0.05). In the high exposure group, the reduction in FVC% predicted, MMEF and MMEF% predicted was 1.0%, 210 mL/s, and 4.9%, respectively. In particular, among the exposed subjects smokers had a statistically significant decrease in lung function compared with non-smokers and the reduction in FVC% predicted, MMEF and MMEF% predicted was 1.0%, 210 mL/s, and 4.9%, respectively (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis showed that there was also negative correlation between Mn-CEI and decreased changes in MMEF (r = -0.159, p = 0.018) and also MMEF% predicted (r = -0.163, p = 0.015). Conclusions Mn dust can impair the pulmonary ventilation function of male workers but not females, and individual smoking habits and manganese exposure had a synergistic effect on the lung function decrease."
https://openalex.org/W2115414184,"Extensive use of Viscum album (VA) preparations in the complementary therapy of cancer and in several other human pathologies has led to an increasing number of cellular and molecular approaches to explore the mechanisms of action of VA. We have recently demonstrated that, VA preparations exert a potent anti-inflammatory effect by selectively down-regulating the COX-2-mediated cytokine-induced secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the important molecular signatures of inflammatory reactions. In this study, we observed a significant down-regulation of COX-2 protein expression in VA-treated A549 cells however COX-2 mRNA levels were unaltered. Therefore, we hypothesized that VA induces destabilisation of COX-2 mRNA, thereby depleting the available functional COX-2 mRNA for the protein synthesis and for the subsequent secretion of PGE2. To address this question, we analyzed the molecular degradation of COX-2 protein and its corresponding mRNA in A549 cell line. Using cyclohexamide pulse chase experiment, we demonstrate that, COX-2 protein degradation is not affected by the treatment with VA whereas experiments on transcriptional blockade with actinomycin D, revealed a marked reduction in the half life of COX-2 mRNA due to its rapid degradation in the cells treated with VA compared to that in IL-1β-stimulated cells. These results thus demonstrate that VA-mediated inhibition of PGE2 implicates destabilization of COX-2 mRNA."

About 10% of the patients reported having taken measures to control their weight for hypertension management. As compared to the other patients, the female patients in the urban areas reported the highest rate of regular BP measurement (52.6%). In addition, the patients who reported taking medication regularly increased among the males and females. Most of the women reported nonsmoking (≥95%) and alcohol abstinence (≥90%). The trend of nonsmoking decreased among the urban males. In contrast, the prevalence of nonsmoking increased among the suburban males, though the trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.055). Further, the patient-reported alcohol abstinence was found to exhibit a decreasing trend among the males.We observed an increase in the hypertension prevalence from 2005 to 2011. The rates remained higher for suburban adults than for urban adults. Females generally had better self-care ability as compared to male patients. Further research is needed to promote self-care behaviors in hypertensive patients, especially for male patients."
https://openalex.org/W1985530512,"Uncertainties about future conditions and the effects of chosen actions, as well as increasing resource scarcity, have been driving forces in the utilization of adaptive management strategies. However, many applications of adaptive management have been criticized for a number of shortcomings, including a limited ability to learn from actions and a lack of consideration of stakeholder objectives. To address these criticisms, we supplement existing adaptive management approaches with a decision-analytical approach that first informs the initial selection of management alternatives and then allows for periodic re-evaluation or phased implementation of management alternatives based on monitoring information and incorporation of stakeholder values. We describe the application of this enhanced adaptive management (EAM) framework to compare remedial alternatives for mercury in the South River, based on an understanding of the loading and behavior of mercury in the South River near Waynesboro, VA. The outcomes show that the ranking of remedial alternatives is influenced by uncertainty in the mercury loading model, by the relative importance placed on different criteria, and by cost estimates. The process itself demonstrates that a decision model can link project performance criteria, decision-maker preferences, environmental models, and short- and long-term monitoring information with management choices to help shape a remediation approach that provides useful information for adaptive, incremental implementation."

We photolabeled a myelin-enriched fraction from rat brain with [3H]AziPm and identified the sirtuin deacetylase SIRT2 as a target of the anesthetic. AziPm photolabeled three SIRT2 residues (Tyr139, Phe190, and Met206) that are located in a single allosteric protein site, and propofol inhibited [3H]AziPm photolabeling of this site in myelin SIRT2. Structural modeling and in vitro experiments with recombinant human SIRT2 determined that propofol and [3H]AziPm only bind specifically and competitively to the enzyme when co-equilibrated with other substrates, which suggests that the anesthetic site is either created or stabilized in enzymatic conformations that are induced by substrate binding. In contrast to SIRT2, specific binding of [3H]AziPm or propofol to recombinant human SIRT1 was not observed. Residues that line the propofol binding site on SIRT2 contact the sirtuin co-substrate NAD+ during enzymatic catalysis, and assays that measured SIRT2 deacetylation of acetylated α-tubulin revealed that propofol inhibits enzymatic function.

Characterizing the molecular interactions between propofol and these proteins should allow the rational design of new hypnotics that specifically target relevant binding sites. Designing ligands with greater selectivity for specific sites should also alleviate side effects caused by propofol binding to off-pathway protein targets that do not contribute to hypnosis. For example, propofol has been reported to cause multiple adverse neurological side effects in mammals (3.Zhang X. Liu Y. Feng C. Yang S. Wang Y. Wu A.-s Yue Y.

We identified sirtuin isoform 2 (SIRT2), a protein deacetylase, as a specific target of propofol and AziPm in mammalian myelin. During enzymatic catalysis, SIRT2 couples deacetylation of acetyl lysine with NAD+ hydrolysis, which results in the formation of nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. We found that clinical concentrations of propofol inhibit this enzymatic function of SIRT2, and we characterized the allosteric protein site that propofol binds.

Recombinant human SIRT2, representing residues 13–319, and recombinant human SIRT1, representing the full-length protein, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the identities of the proteins were confirmed with mass spectrometry. For tissue preparation, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300 g) were used, and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania. Electrophoresis apparatuses, gels, molecular weight markers, and PVDF were from Bio-Rad, and 3H-sensitive Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm MP was used for autoradiography. Developed autoradiographs, Coomassie G-250-stained membranes, and Coomassie G-250-stained gels were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer, and the Quantity One software that accompanies the instrument was used for optical density quantification. Western blots were scanned with a Kodak Image Station 4000MM Pro, and band quantification was performed with the accompanying Carestream molecular imaging software. For liquid scintillation counting, MP Biomedicals EcoLite(+) liquid scintillation cocktail was used with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Tri-Carb 2800TR instrument. A Synergy H1 microplate reader from BioTek was used for fluorescence-based assays. Rats briefly anesthetized with isoflurane were decapitated, and the brains were removed. The brains were washed in ice-cold isolation buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor cocktail), and then the brains were transferred to fresh isolation buffer. After mincing, tissue was homogenized by hand with a glass and Teflon homogenizer to produce total brain homogenate, and the enriched myelin fraction was prepared without detergents as described elsewhere (16.Sims N.R. Anderson M.F. Isolation of mitochondria from rat brain using Percoll density gradient centrifugation.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1228-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). After a protein assay, 200-μg aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. After thawing, myelin samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml with isolation buffer. 4 μm [3H]AziPm was added with 180 μm non-radioactive AziPm, the indicated concentrations of propofol, or DMSO vehicle (all contained 0.5% DMSO). After transferring to a quartz cuvette (1-mm path length), samples were photolabeled for 20 min with a Rayonet photochemical reactor with a 350 nm bulb (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., Branford, CT). Subsequently, the sample was pelleted, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was gently resuspended in 300 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed again by resuspension in 300 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and after recentrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in buffer with detergent (5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Detergent-solubilized protein was separated on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels. For autoradiography, protein was transferred to PVDF, and after drying, the membranes were exposed directly to film for 31 days at 4 °C. After the films were developed, the membranes were stained with Coomassie R-250, and the membranes and films were scanned. For scintillation counting, the gels were stained with Coomassie G-250, and after vertically separating the lanes, these were sliced horizontally into 1-mm pieces. The gel slices were dissolved overnight in sealed scintillation vials containing 350 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide. After cooling, scintillation fluid was added for counting. Myelin diluted to 1 mg/ml with isolation buffer was photolabeled for 20 min with 4 μm non-radioactive AziPm. After photolabeling, the sample was centrifuged and washed twice, as described above, with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the final pellet was solubilized. 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE in adjacent lanes. The gel was stained with Coomassie G-250, and the three gel pieces indicated in Fig. 1C were excised from each lane for either trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion. After digestion, mass spectrometry analysis was performed by microcapillary reverse-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography with online nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Raw data were acquired with Xcalibur, and the spectra were searched with SEQUEST against either a full tryptic or a partial chymotryptic rat proteome database for protein identification. Methionine oxidation was permitted, and filters for protein identification included 10-ppm parent ion tolerance, 1 atomic mass unit fragment ion tolerance, Δ CN of 0.05, and two unique peptides. The sequences of the proteins identified from all three bands were then compiled into a new database. With SEQUEST, we searched the spectra against this new database for an AziPm mass modification (216.07620 atomic mass units) on any amino acid of every full tryptic or partial chymotryptic peptide; only three residue modifications, including methionine oxidation, were permitted on each peptide. Filters for identification of modified peptides included 10-ppm parent ion tolerance, 1 atomic mass unit fragment ion tolerance, Δ CN of 0.05, and Xcorr scores of 1, 2, and 3 for +1 ions, +2 ions, and +3 ions, respectively. All spectra were then inspected manually for verification. For SIRT2 structures, chains A from Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 3ZGO and 3ZGV were used (17.Moniot S. Schutkowski M. Steegborn C. Crystal structure analysis of human Sirt2 and its ADP-ribose complex.J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 182: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the 3ZGO structure, which was re-refined from the dataset of PDB code 1J8F, SIRT2 is bound only to the structural cofactor zinc, and the 3ZGO structure is referred to as “apo-SIRT2” in this work (17.Moniot S.

Donigian J.R. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the histone deacetylase SIRT2.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In the 3ZGV structure, SIRT2 is bound to zinc and ADP-ribose, and the 3ZGV structure is referred to as “ADPr-SIRT2”. Both SIRT2 structures were loaded into SWISS-MODEL via the ExPASy web server (19.Biasini M. Bienert S. Waterhouse A. Arnold K. Studer G. Schmidt T. Kiefer F. Cassarino T.G. Bertoni M. Bordoli L.

This procedure built missing side chains in the structures while keeping all other atoms in the exact coordinates as the available crystal structures. Similar to SIRT2, a SIRT1 structure bound to zinc was used and is referred to as “apo-SIRT1” (PDB code 4IG9, chain A), and a SIRT1 structure bound to zinc and ADP-ribose was used and is referred to as “ADPr-SIRT1” (PDB code 4XKQ) (23.Davenport A.M. Huber F.M. Hoelz A. Structural and functional analysis of human SIRT1.J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). During crystallization, both ADPr-SIRT2 and ADPr-SIRT1 also engaged neighboring molecules in their respective active sites, effectively simulating acetyl peptide substrate binding. For ADPr-SIRT2, the peptide substrate binding groove of the enzyme was engaged by a loop from a neighboring protein molecule, and a leucine side chain pointed into the acetyl lysine binding site (17.Moniot S. Schutkowski M. Steegborn C. Crystal structure analysis of human Sirt2 and its ADP-ribose complex.J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 182: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); for ADPr-SIRT1, the extended C-terminal tail from an adjacent protein molecule was inserted into the peptide substrate binding groove (23.Davenport A.M. Huber F.M. Hoelz A. Structural and functional analysis of human SIRT1.J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structure of human SIRT3 bound to zinc and the inhibitor Ex-527 was from PDB code 4BV3 (24.Gertz M. Fischer F. Nguyen G.T.T. Lakshminarasimhan M. Schutkowski M. Weyand M. Steegborn C. Ex-527 inhibits sirtuins by exploiting their unique NAD+-dependent deacetylation mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E2772-E2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the structure of Thermotoga maritima Sir2 (Sir2Tm) bound to zinc and nicotinamide was from PDB code 1YC5 (25.Avalos J.L.

Cell. 2005; 17: 855-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were removed from all sirtuin structures that were used for modeling. For protein cavity analysis, the program fpocket was used (26.Le Guilloux V. Schmidtke P. Tuffery P.

Schrödinger, LLC, New York2012Google Scholar) were used for other structural analyses and preparation of structural images, and sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW2 (29.Larkin M.A. Blackshields G.

At a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, recombinant human SIRT2 or recombinant human SIRT1 was photolabeled with 4 μm [3H]AziPm ± propofol with and without 2 mm ADP-ribose, 100 mm nicotinamide, and 250 ng/μl of core histones purified from HeLa cell chromatin (histones were purchased form Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Prior to these experiments, histone acetylation was confirmed by Western blot with an acetyl lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The substrates and ligands for photolabeling were mixed in buffer (10 mm KCl and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) and briefly vortexed, and samples were photolabeled in a 1-mm quartz cuvette with a lamp described elsewhere (11.Weiser B.P. Kelz M.B. Eckenhoff R.G. In vivo activation of azipropofol prolongs anesthesia and reveals synaptic targets.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After photolabeling, the substrates were separated with SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie G-250. The protein bands were then excised and dissolved in 350 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and scintillation fluid was added for counting. A rat was briefly anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation. The brain was removed and washed in ice-cold assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 2 μm trichostatin A (from Sigma-Aldrich), and Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor cocktail). The brain was transferred to ∼5 ml of fresh assay buffer and homogenized by hand. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was set aside. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of fresh assay buffer, and after another 15,000 × g centrifugation, the supernatants were combined. This was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the final supernatant was used as the soluble brain extract. For each deacetylase assay, 30 μg of the soluble brain extract protein was used, and the final assay volume was 30 μl. All components were dissolved in the assay buffer described above, and the assays were performed in 0.2-ml PCR tubes. When added to the reaction, final concentrations of 1 mm NAD+, 100 mm nicotinamide, and 3 μg of recombinant human SIRT2 were used. After briefly vortexing the assay mixture, the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with brief mixing every 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli buffer and then placing the tubes in boiling water. SDS-PAGE and Western blots for acetylated α-tubulin were typically performed with both 1 μg and 3 μg of soluble extract protein. Two different microplate- and fluorescence-based sirtuin assay kits were purchased and used. 1) The SIRT2 inhibitor screening assay kit (catalog number EPI010 from Sigma-Aldrich), which is designed for IC50 determination, was used with the manufacturer-recommended dilutions of SIRT2 and the provided acetyl peptide substrate, and with variable concentrations of NAD+. Enzyme reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 h. In this assay, recombinant human SIRT2 deacetylates an acetyl peptide that is conjugated to a fluorescent group. Upon peptide deacetylation, the fluorescent group is released and provides a detectable signal (λEX/λEM ≈ 395/541 (where EX and EM designate excitation and emission)) that should theoretically increase or decrease in the presence of an activator or inhibitor, respectively. As a positive control with this kit, we measured that 10 mm nicotinamide inhibited SIRT2 activity by 91 ± 2%. 2) The SIRTainty class III histone deacetylase assay kit (catalog number 17-10090 from EMD Millipore) was used with recombinant human SIRT2. In this assay, SIRT2 activity is measured through the formation of the enzymatic product nicotinamide, which is converted to nicotinic acid and NH3+ by the enzyme nicotinamidase (co-incubated in the enzyme assay); NH3+ is subsequently reacted with a developing reagent to provide a fluorescent signal (λEX/λEM ≈ 420/460) that should also theoretically increase or decrease in the presence of an activator or inhibitor, respectively. These experiments were performed with 1 μm SIRT2, 0.5 mm NAD+, 40 μm acetylated peptide (provided in the SIRTainty kit), and the recommended dilution of nicotinamidase. Enzyme reactions were performed at 37 °C for 4 min. Based on the mol of nicotinamide produced, ∼15% of the NAD+ was consumed under these conditions during control experiments. Detergent-solubilized protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF. Membranes were blocked with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20). A 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody was applied overnight in TBS-T at 4 °C on a shaker. The anti-SIRT2 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, England), and the immunogen was the synthetic peptide LEDLVRREHANI corresponding to amino acids 341–352 of rat SIRT2; the anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody, clone 6-11B-1, was from Sigma-Aldrich and recognizes acetyl lysine 40. After removing the primary antibody, the membrane was washed with TBS-T, and a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was applied for 1 h. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were developed with Amersham Biosciences ECL Select reagent and scanned. The blots were then washed briefly in TBS-T followed by water before staining with Coomassie R-250 and drying before scanning. Where applicable, mean values with standard error are shown unless noted otherwise. For the Western blot standard curves, the net intensities from acetylated α-tubulin blots of known amounts of soluble brain extract were plotted and curve-fit according to a one-phase, exponential decay, and the resulting coefficients of determination (R2) were equal to 0.9999. To estimate the concentration of propofol that inhibits SIRT2 by 50%, we first plotted relative Western blot intensity versus absolute deacetylase activity using experimental values (SIRT2 assays with 0, 0.3, and 3 μm propofol, and the no activity baseline); R2 of the linear fit was 0.9906. From the regression equation, we calculated absolute deacetylase activities for assays with 30 and 300 μm propofol using experimentally determined relative intensities. The absolute activities were plotted as a percentage of control, and a sigmoidal curve with a variable slope was fit with the minimum and maximum constrained to 0 and 100, respectively. All curve fits and data analyses were performed within the GraphPad Prism version 6.0e software. We isolated a myelin-enriched fraction from rat brain for photolabeling with 4 μm [3H]AziPm, a concentration that approximates the EC99 dose for anesthetizing tadpoles (7.Hall M.A. Xi J. Lor C. Dai S. Pearce R. Dailey W.P. Eckenhoff R.G. m-Azipropofol (AziPm) a photoactive analogue of the intravenous general anesthetic propofol.J. Med.

Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To measure the specificity of anesthetic binding, we also photolabeled with 4 μm [3H]AziPm while co-equilibrating with 400 μm propofol or 180 μm (non-radioactive) AziPm, which are concentrations that approach their maximum aqueous solubility. The protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane for autoradiography. Based on optical density from the radioactivity (Fig. 1B), propofol and AziPm inhibited [3H]AziPm binding to myelin proteins an average of 41 and 53%, respectively, throughout the lanes. [3H]AziPm incorporation was concentrated in four bands shown as peaks at: 1) >250 kDa, 2) 80–95 kDa, 3) 55–70 kDa, and 4) 35–40 kDa, and propofol decreased [3H]AziPm labeling of these peak regions by 50–69%. The >250-kDa band did not enter the resolving gel and was likely aggregated protein; however, the high selectivity of photolabeling in the remaining bands suggested strong binding to few proteins. To identify these proteins, we photolabeled myelin with 4 μm AziPm and excised the bands from a separate SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1C). We then employed a mass spectrometry-based approach whereby we first identified all the proteins in the bands and then searched for an AziPm mass adduct on those proteins. Six unique peptides from trypsin- and chymotrypsin-digested samples of the 35–40-kDa band were identified as photolabeled by AziPm (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1), and these peptides were all assigned to SIRT2. With this approach, we did not identify adducts on proteins from the other bands and therefore pursued the relevance of propofol binding to SIRT2.TABLE 1SIRT2 peptides identified with LC-MS/MS as photolabeled by AziPmPhotolabeled peptideaThe photolabeled peptide is shown between periods. # indicates that a 216.0762-Da modification was detected.

https://openalex.org/W1983137738,"We present a new method for magnetization transfer (MT) ratio imaging in the brain that requires no separate saturation pulse. Interslice MT effects that are inherent to multi-slice balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging were controlled via an interslice delay time to generate MT-weighted (0 s delay) and reference images (5–8 s delay) for MT ratio (MTR) imaging of the brain. The effects of varying flip angle and phase encoding (PE) order were investigated experimentally in normal, healthy subjects. Values of up to ∼50% and ∼40% were observed for white and gray matter MTR. Centric PE showed larger MTR, higher SNR, and better contrast between white and gray matter than linear PE. Simulations of a two-pool model of MT agreed well with in vivo MTR values.

Non-transformed Env-specific T cell lines established from RV144 vaccinees were used to determine the fine epitope mapping of the V2 and C1 responses and the HLA class II restriction. Data showed that there are two CD4+ epitopes contained within the V2 loop: one encompassing the α4β7 integrin binding site (AA179-181) and the other nested between two previously described genetic sieve signatures (AA169, AA181).

https://openalex.org/W1975994270,"We report the structural and biochemical characterization of GLB-33, a putative neuropeptide receptor that is exclusively expressed in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This unique chimeric protein is composed of a 7-transmembrane domain (7TM), GLB-33 7TM, typical of a G-protein-coupled receptor, and of a globin domain (GD), GLB-33 GD. Comprehensive sequence similarity searches in the genome of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, revealed a chimeric protein that is similar to a Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide neuropeptide receptor. The three-dimensional structures of the separate domains of both species and of the full-length proteins were modeled. The 7TM domains of both proteins appeared very similar, but the globin domain of the A. suum receptor surprisingly seemed to lack several helices, suggesting a novel truncated globin fold. The globin domain of C. elegans GLB-33, however, was very similar to a genuine myoglobin-type molecule. Spectroscopic analysis of the recombinant GLB-33 GD showed that the heme is pentacoordinate when ferrous and in the hydroxide-ligated form when ferric, even at neutral pH. Flash-photolysis experiments showed overall fast biphasic CO rebinding kinetics. In its ferrous deoxy form, GLB-33 GD is capable of reversibly binding O2 with a very high affinity and of reducing nitrite to nitric oxide faster than other globins. Collectively, these properties suggest that the globin domain of GLB-33 may serve as a highly sensitive oxygen sensor and/or as a nitrite reductase. Both properties are potentially able to modulate the neuropeptide sensitivity of the neuronal transmembrane receptor.

Both properties are potentially able to modulate the neuropeptide sensitivity of the neuronal transmembrane receptor. Nematodes often inhabit low oxygen environments where parameters such as food supply, temperature, and oxygen pressure vary. These fluctuations force the nematode to adapt its behavior to survive (1Baumgarthl H. Kritzler K. Zimelka W. Zinkler D. Local PO2 measurements in the environment of submerged soil microarthroods.Acta Oecologica. 1994; 15: 781-789Google Scholar). Globins can play a role in this adaptation. The globin family is a heterogeneous group of proteins sharing the globin fold and burying a heme cofactor in a hydrophobic pocket, where diatomic gaseous ligands like O2 can bind to the heme iron atom. In silico analysis of the genome of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans resulted in the identification of a family of 33 globin genes, labeled glb-1 to glb-33, that are all transcribed. The encoded globins, GLB-1 to GLB-33, are localized in a specific subset of cells (2Hoogewijs D. Geuens E. Dewilde S. Moens L. Vierstraete A. Vinogradov S. Vanfleteren J.

Characterization of some of these globins indicated that they are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. For instance, GLB-1 may function in regulating facilitated O2 diffusion in a small subset of cells (6Geuens E. Hoogewijs D. Nardini M. Vinck E. Pesce A. Kiger L. Fago A. Tilleman L. De Henau S.

The role of all other globins in C. elegans remains unknown. One of the C. elegans globin genes, glb-33, is expressed in neuronal cells and has been predicted to code for a 542-amino acid-long chimeric protein, GLB-33. The N-terminal domain of GLB-33 (residues 1–372) is composed of 7 hydrophobic α-helices and represents a 7-transmembrane domain (GLB-33 7TM 6The abbreviations used are: 7TM7-transmembrane domainGDglobin domainRRresonance ramanESEelectron spin echoPDBProtein Data BankBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationswMbsperm whale Mbβ-ARβ-adrenergic. ) typical of a G-protein-coupled receptor domain.

The C-terminal domain of GLB-33 (residues 373–534) displays the major determinants of the globin fold, including eight α-helices (A–H), the proximal His(F8) and the characteristic pattern of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues (33Bashford D.

Despite the occurrence of specific deviations from standard templates like Val(CD1) and Ile(E7), this domain can be considered as a genuine globin (3Hoogewijs D. Geuens E. Dewilde S. Vierstraete A. Moens L. Vinogradov S. Vanfleteren J.R. Wide diversity in structure and expression profiles among members of the Caenorhabditis elegans globin protein family.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To understand the functional role of the GLB-33 neuronal receptor, we have expressed and purified the recombinant GLB-33 GD in Escherichia coli and investigated its spectroscopic characteristics, kinetics, and equilibrium of the binding of the gaseous ligands O2 and CO, and the reactivity with nitrite. We also performed in vitro and in vivo localization studies. Furthermore, models of the three-dimensional structures of the globin domain, as well as of the G-protein-coupled receptor domain, were built and used as templates to search the databases for proteins with similar structures. We have identified a chimeric protein in the nematode Ascaris suum with a similar transmembrane domain but with a structurally different globin domain. From this investigation, we have identified several structural and functional characteristics of the globin domain of GLB-33 that are likely to be involved in the fine-tuning of the neuronal receptor response in C. elegans. The cDNA coding for GLB-33 (glb-33) is 1629 bp long and was cloned in the pEGFP-N1-vector with C-terminal GFP tag (Clontech) using BglII and BamHI restriction enzymes (Biolabs, Westburg, Netherlands) and T4 DNA ligase (Novagen). 1 μg of the expression construct was transfected into human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC® CRL-2266) with 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To obtain detailed images of the subcellular localization of GLB-33, an UltraVIEW Vox ERS microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used, and images were created with the Volocity 6.0.1 software. GFP was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser, and a bandpass filter was used to allow emission light between 500 and 550 nm. The translational reporter for glb-33 was constructed using fusion PCR, as described by Hobert (35Hobert O. PCR fusion-based approach to create reporter gene constructs for expression analysis in transgenic C. elegans.BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The reporter contained the glb-33 target gene and 2.95 kb upstream and 0.653 kb downstream of the target gene to include the endogenous promoter region and 3′UTR gene regulating elements, respectively. The gfp gene was amplified from the pPD95.75 vector and fused at the 3′ side of the glb-33 gene, thereby preceding the 3′UTR region. A coding region for a GA linker between GLB-33 and GFP was also included. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: 5′-TAGACAGTTTGCCACATCTT-3′ (forward primer of the promoter of glb-33); 5′-GGGTACACTCTTCAAAAACA-3′ (nested forward primer of the promoter of glb-33); 5′-TCCAGCGCCTGCACCAGCTCCTGGCATTTGACCAATTGTG-3′ (reverse primer of the glb-33 gene); 5′-GCATGGATGAACTATACAAATGACTTTTTCCTAGATCTCGC-3′ (forward primer of the 3′UTR region of glb-33); 5′-TGTTCTTCTCCCGATATGGTAND-3′ (reverse primer of the 3′UTR region of glb-33); 5′-GACTCCGTGACAATTTCCTC-3′ (nested reverse primer of the 3′UTR region of glb-33); and 5′-GGAGCTGGTGCAGGCGCTGGAGCCGGTGCCTTGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC-3′ (forward primer of gfp), and 5′-TTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′ (reverse primer of gfp). In addition, the unc-119 gene, including a 2.189-kb upstream region and a 1.228-kb downstream region of the unc-119a isoform, was amplified with forward primer 5′-TCAGTAAAAGAAGTAGAAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAATTTTAACAATACTTC-3′. The PCR product was used as a co-injection marker and rescued the locomotion defect of the unc-119(ed3) strain, the strain used for micro-injection. The final PCR products were injected into the gonads of young adult hermaphrodites using an Axiovert 135 (Zeiss) microscope and FemtoJet microinjection system (Eppendorf), at a concentration of 50 ng/μl for the glb-33 reporter and 20 ng/μl for the unc-119 gene. Transformed lines were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000–5 confocal microscope. The protein sequence of GLB-33 (accession number AAK68603) was used to search the nonredundant database of NCBI for orthologs using the protein-protein Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) algorithm (BLASTP) (36Altschul S.F.

To confirm the presence of a globin domain in the A. suum FMRF-amide receptor (accession number ADY45777.1), the cDNA coding for this globin domain was amplified and sequenced. A. suum cDNA (1365 bp) was kindly provided by Peter Geldhof and Edwin Claerebout (University of Ghent, Belgium) and was prepared as follows. Total RNA from L3 larvae was extracted with TRIzol reagent. After treatment with DNase (Invitrogen), cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the cDNA synthesis kit (iScriptTM, Bio-Rad). PCR was then performed with the gene-specific forward and reverse primers 5′-ATGTGGCGTCAAAAACGGCCAC-3′ and 5′-TGGTTTCTTAAGGAAACTCTGTCC-3′, respectively. The PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μl under the following conditions: 1× buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 1 μm of each primer, and 1 unit of Platinum® TaqPCRx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR was started at 4 min at 95 °C, which was followed by 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C. A final step of 10 min at 72 °C was added to the last cycle. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The cDNAs coding for the GLB-33 GD (glb-33 gd, bp 1120 to 1629) and for the A. suum FMRF GD (A. suum fmrf gd bp 991 to 1365) were cloned in the pET23a vector with C-terminal His tag (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes (Biolabs). The sequences of the forward and the reverse primers that were used to amplify the cDNAs were as follows: 5′-CATATGCTTCTCGGAGACAGGTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGGCATTTGACCAATTGTGTC-3′ for glb-33 gd and 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGGCGTCAAAAACGGCCAC-3′ and 5′- CCGCTCGAGTGGTTTCTTAAGGAAACTC-3′ for A. suum fmrf gd, respectively. Ligation of the cDNAs in the pET23a vector was performed using T4 DNA ligase (Novagen). The ligated product was sequenced on both strands using BigDye terminator chemistry and an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). In vitro expression in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells was performed as described previously (44Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. Biochemical characterization and ligand binding properties of neuroglobin, a novel member of the globin family.J. Biol.

GLB-33 GD and A. suum FMRF GD were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Clontech), eluted with 250 μm imidazole in resuspension buffer, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 50 mm NaCl. UV-visible spectra were measured in a 250–700-nm range on a Cary-5 UV-visible NIR spectrophotometer (Varian). Expressed GLB-33 GD was dialyzed against different buffers with pH values ranging from 4 to 8.5 (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 100 mm BisTris, pH 6, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5). Ferrous CO-bound and reduced deoxy protein samples were prepared by flushing 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 15 min with CO and N2 gas, respectively, in a sealed cuvette. After addition of 10 μl of a saturated solution of sodium dithionite, highly concentrated recombinant purified protein was added to obtain a final concentration of 50 μm. The ferrous oxy derivative of GLB-33 GD was prepared by reducing the protein with 10 μl of a saturated sodium dithionite solution, prior to loading the sample onto a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the dithionite and allow O2 to bind. Resonance Raman (RR) measurements were carried out on an 80-cm Dilor XY-800 Raman scattering spectrometer consisting of a triple spectrograph operating in normal mode and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. The excitation source was a Kr ion laser (Spectra Physics 2020) at 413.1 nm. The protein solution was stirred at 6000 rpm to avoid local heating. Five spectra (120-s recording time) were acquired and averaged after the removal of cosmic ray spikes by a program developed in-house. Laser powers of 1 and 50 milliwatts were used. X band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed on a Bruker EleXsys instrument equipped with a helium cryostat (Oxford Inc.). All measurements were done at 10 K. The continuous wave EPR spectra were obtained with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and a modulation amplitude of 0.5 millitesla. The electron spin echo (ESE)-detected EPR experiments were performed using the π/2-τ- π-τ-echo sequence with tπ/2 = 16 ns, tπ = 32 ns; τ was varied in steps of 8 ns from 88 to 3280 ns. The spectra recorded at the different τ values were subsequently summed. CO-bound GLB-33 GD samples were prepared in a sealed 4 × 10-mm quartz cuvette containing 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.0. The buffer was equilibrated with different mixtures of CO and N2 gas, using a High-Tech system (Bronkhorst, The Netherlands). To obtain the association rate constant for CO binding (kon, CO), CO-ligated ferrous GLB-33 GD was prepared with CO concentrations ranging between 200 and 800 μm. 10 μl of a saturated solution of sodium dithionite was then added to the buffer to scavenge any residual O2. A minimal amount of concentrated protein was injected to obtain a final concentration of ∼5 μm. The heme iron atom was reduced by the added dithionite, and conversion to the CO-ligated form was verified by UV-visible spectroscopy. Flash photolysis experiments were carried out on a laser photolysis system (Edinburgh Instruments LP920) at 20 °C, using a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Spectra Physics Quanta-ray) at 532 nm. CO association was measured by photo-dissociating ligated GLB-33 GD by a short laser pulse (5–8 ns) and then following the recombination of the photo-dissociated CO-ligand at different time scales, ranging from 2000 ns for the geminate recombination of CO to 400 ms for the bimolecular rebinding of the ligand at 421 nm. Exponential decays from the consecutive time scales were joined together to give the complete ligand-rebinding curve. All data were analyzed using the Matlab program (The Math Works Inc.). The rate of geminate rebinding (kgem) was obtained"
https://openalex.org/W1969926190,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that is ubiquitously present in the aerobic biosphere. As an antibiotic-resistant facultative pathogen, it is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections. Its rapid and accurate identification is crucial in clinical and therapeutic environments.In a large-scale MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based screen of the Harvard transposon insertion mutant library of P. aeruginosa strain PA14, intact-cell proteome profile spectra of 5547 PA14 transposon mutants exhibiting a plethora of different phenotypes were acquired and analyzed.Of all P. aeruginosa PA14 mutant profiles 99.7% were correctly identified as P. aeruginosa with the Biotyper software on the species level. On the strain level, 99.99% of the profiles were mapped to five different individual P. aeruginosa Biotyper database entries. A principal component analysis-based approach was used to determine the most important discriminatory mass features between these Biotyper groups. Although technical replicas were consistently categorized to specific Biotyper groups in 94.2% of the mutant profiles, biological replicas were not, indicating that the distinct proteotypes are affected by growth conditions.The PA14 mutant profile collection presented here constitutes the largest coherent P. aeruginosa MALDI-TOF spectral dataset publicly available today. Transposon insertions in thousands of different P. aeruginosa genes did not affect species identification from MALDI-TOF mass spectra, clearly demonstrating the robustness of the approach. However, the assignment of the individual spectra to sub-groups proved to be non-consistent in biological replicas, indicating that the differentiation between biotyper groups in this nosocomial pathogen is unassured."
https://openalex.org/W1972627072,"Background Franchising is a promising and increasingly used organizational form to improve strategic, organizational, professional and client-related results in healthcare. However, evidence is scarce regarding how franchises should be operated to actualize such results. This paper aimed to explore the association between the results achieved by healthcare franchises and the working relationships among actors in these franchises. Methods A sequential mixed methods approach was used to obtain both in-depth and broader quantifiable insights into a little-investigated phenomenon. We first employed a qualitative multiple embedded case study. Data were collected through observations, document analyses, and 96 in-depth semi-structured interviews in three Dutch healthcare franchises. Within-case and cross-case comparative analyses were conducted. Subsequently, a cross-sectional survey was developed based on the qualitative study and disseminated among 19 healthcare franchises. 40 franchisors and 346 unit actors filled in the questionnaire. Findings It seems important to have open, committed, cooperative franchise relationships in which professional franchisees and unit managers feel and trust that they have the opportunity to introduce ideas and articulate their needs to the franchisor. Such relationships help ensure satisfaction, survival, and quality of care, because they serve to foster synergy realization and local fit and prevent reinventing the wheel and professional resistance."
