https://openalex.org/W2059299769,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is a hereditary disease caused by defective DNA repair. Somatic cell genetics and biochemical studies with cell-free extracts indicate that at least 16 polypeptides are required to carry out the repair reaction proper, i.e. the removal of the lesion from the DNA by the dual incisions of the damaged strand. To find out if these proteins are necessary and sufficient for excision repair, they were obtained at a high level of purity in five fractions. The mixture of these five fractions reconstituted the excision nuclease (excinuclease) activity. Using the reconstituted excinuclease, we found that the excised fragment remains associated with the post-incision DNA-protein complex, suggesting that accessory proteins are needed to release the excised oligomer.

The disease is caused by a defect in nucleotide excision repair (2Cleaver J.E. Nature. 1968; 218: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) as a result of mutations in one of several genes, XPA through XPG. In addition to the proteins defined by the XP complementation groups, genetic and biochemical studies in mammalian systems indicate that the ERCC1 protein, the transcription factor TFIIH (which contains the XPB and XPD proteins and six other proteins), and the replication proteins PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and HSSB (human single stranded DNA-binding protein, also known as RPA) are required for excision repair(3Tanaka K.

These studies raised the possibility that additional proteins, not previously identified, may be involved in the initial reaction of excision repair which consists of the incisions of the 22nd through 24th phosphodiester bonds 5′ and the 4th through 6th phosphodiester bonds 3′ to the lesion(5Huang J.C.

In this report, we purified the components known to be required for the incision reaction and here we provide strong evidence that these components are sufficient for this reaction. Moreover, we show that the excised damage-containing fragment is not released by this reconstituted excinuclease system, suggesting that additional helicase activity is required to displace the excised oligomer before repair synthesis can take place. HeLa S3 and mutant cells were from the stock of the Lineberger Cancer Center (University of North Carolina). Mutant cell lines used in this study are: XP-A, XP20S; XP-B, UV24 (rodent counterpart); XP-C, XP1BE; XP-D, UV5 (rodent counterpart); XP-F, UV47 (rodent counterpart); XP-G, UV135 (rodent counterpart); ERCC-1, UV20. Fraction I (recombinant XPA) in the form of MBP-XPA fusion protein was purified as described previously(7Park C.-H. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TFIIH was purified using a procedure modified from Drapkin et al. (8Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and Flores et al.(9Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); HeLa whole cell extract (10Manley J. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P. Gefter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) derived from approximately 1.25 × 1011 cells (250 liters) was used as starting material. The multi-protein complex TFIIH was detected by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide sequence derived from its 89-kDa subunit (XPB), whereas XPC, XPG, and ERCC1 were traced with polyclonal antibodies raised against each recombinant fusion (MBP) protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The first DEAE-52 column (Whatman) and the second Mono S preparative FPLC column (Pharmacia, HR 16/10) were essentially as described by Nichols and Sancar (11Nichols A.F. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and Flores et al.(9Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. ERCC1•XPF was in the flow-through (FT), whereas TFIIH was in the gradient-eluted fractions. The TFIIH-containing fractions (400 mg) were dialyzed in buffer C (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 19% glycerol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4, loaded onto a phenyl-Superose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., HR 10/10), and eluted with a linear 160-ml gradient of 1.2-0 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer C. Fractions containing TFIIH were combined and applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia, HiLoad 26/60) equilibrated in buffer C with 0.8 M KCl. Fractions containing XPB as determined by Western analyses were pooled (0.15 mg) and loaded onto an analytical Mono S (HR 5/5) column and eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0.1-0.4 M KCl. Finally, the TFIIH fractions were chromatographed on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column using a gradient of 0.45-0 M (NH4)2SO4 in 15 ml. For storage, the TFIIH fractions (90 μg) were concentrated in an Amicon 8000 cell, dialyzed in storage buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 16-17% glycerol), and kept at −80°C. A separate batch of highly purified TFIIH, which had been shown to contain XPC (8Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. D. Reinberg (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ). Twenty percent of the TFIIH fractions after the Mono S column was chromatographed on an analytical phenylSuperose column (HR 5/5) and eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of 0.42-0 M (NH4)2SO4. The presence of XPC protein and the absence of TFIIH in the eluted fractions of ∼0.3 M (NH4)2SO4 were confirmed by Western blotting. These fractions were then concentrated with a pressured stirred cell (Amicon, series 8000), dialyzed in storage buffer, and designated “partially purified XPC/Fraction III.” Subsequent to the Mono S preparative column, the flow-through was precipitated using 60% (NH4)2SO4, dialyzed in buffer C with 0.1 M KCl, and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column. Elution was achieved with an initial gradient of 0.1-0.3 M KCl in 200 ml, followed by an 100-ml gradient of 0.3-0.6 M KCl. Fractions containing ERCC1 (∼0.18-0.23 M KCl) were pooled and fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column as described above. As a final step, a glutathione S-transferase-XPA affinity column was used to selectively retain ERCC1•XPF complex according to Park and Sancar(12Park C.-H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The final pool of ERCC1•XPF complex (<1 μg) was concentrated using the pressured stirred cell, dialyzed in storage buffer, and stored at −80°C. Replication protein A (also known as HSSB) was a kind gift from Drs. B. Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and J. Hurwitz (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). This assay measures the excision of radiolabeled fragments carrying the lesions. The substrate is an 140-mer DNA containing a cholesterol instead of a base in the center. It has been found that this “lesion” is one of the best substrates for human excinuclease. ( 2J. Reardon and A. Sancar, unpublished results. )The 32P label is 6 nucleotides 5′ to the lesion, and the substrate is assembled with 6 oligonucleotides as described by Huang et al.(13Huang J.C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The appearance of the 32P-labeled fragments of 23-30-mers was taken as the measure of excinuclease activity. The complementation reaction (excision assay) mixtures contain: 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 80 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 20 μM of each dNTP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 7% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg of mutant cell-free extracts (CFE), the indicated amounts of purified fraction, and ∼1 nM 32P-labeled substrate. After a 60-min incubation at 30°C, the reaction mixtures were deproteinized with proteinase K, phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The reconstitution reaction mixture contained 50 ng of Fraction I, 5 ng of Fraction II, 20 ng of Fraction III, 1 μl (<1 ng) of Fraction IV, and 90 ng of RPA in the same reaction buffer, and the reaction product was processed similarly. Excision assays were performed using the reconstituted excinuclease of Fractions I-V as described above. Following a 60-min incubation at 30°C, M13 single-stranded DNA (0.5 μg) and/or SDS (0.4%) were added to the reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 30°C for additional 10 min and then subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol, at a constant voltage of 150 V in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA). The damage recognition factor (3Tanaka K. Wood R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) XPA protein (Fraction I) was purified from an E. coli strain expressing it as a fusion protein in the form of MBP-XPA by affinity chromatography on amylose, followed by further purification on heparin-agarose(7Park C.-H. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The biological activity of MBP-XPA was detected by its ability to restore the excinuclease activity in XP-A mutant cell-free extract(7Park C.-H. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The XPB (p89) and XPD (p80) proteins make a tight complex (14Reardon J.T. Thompson L.H. Sancar A. Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) within the transcription factor TFIIH, which contains six other subunits (p62, p50, p44, p41, p38, and p34) of which p62, p44, and p34 are also known to be required for excision repair(15Schaeffer L.

Sci. 1994; 19: 504-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to purify TFIIH and other repair proteins, we followed the purification scheme outlined in Fig. 1. The purified TFIIH (Fraction II) contained the p89 (XPB), p80 (XPD), p62, p50, p44, p41, p38, and p34 subunits visible in silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B) as well as some higher molecular weight proteins also seen in other TFIIH preparations(8Drapkin R.

The identities of the p89, p80, and p62 subunits were confirmed by Western blotting using a mixture of antibodies made against the XPB, XPD, and p62 proteins (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Furthermore, the TFIIH preparation complements the excinuclease activity in the CFEs of XP-B and XP-D mutants as well as the CFE of an XP-G mutant (Fig. 3). This is reminiscent of the findings in yeast, as it is known that the yeast homologs of XPC (Rad 4) and XPG (Rad 2) are loosely associated with the yeast TFIIH counterpart, Factor b(20Bardwell A.J.

This purification procedure yields TFIIH complementing XP-B, XP-D, and XP-C but not any of the other XP complementation groups(8Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A.

Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In this current purification scheme, XPC was separated from TFIIH on the third column and designated reconstitution Fraction III (see below). The ERCC1 and XPF proteins are in a complex (14Reardon J.T. Thompson L.H. Sancar A. Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Biggerstaff M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and can be purified by following ERCC1. The complex was purified as outlined in Fig. 1. After chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, the fractions eluting at approximately 200 kDa were found to contain ERCC1 by Western analysis. Highly purified ERCC1•XPF complex was obtained by passing the sample through a glutathione S-transferase-XPA affinity column. This procedure removed all of the HeLa cell derived contaminants from the preparation (12Park C.-H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D, lanes 1-3). Protein bands were not visible by silver staining using 3% of our last purification fraction (Fig. 2D, lane 3), but immunoblotting (lanes 4-6) using anti-ERCC1 indicated quantitative recovery of ERCC1 in this fraction (lane 6). Furthermore, this fraction complemented both ERCC-1 and XP-F mutant cell-free extracts (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 2D (lane 6), this is our reconstitution Fraction IV. Fraction V is HSSB. This three-subunit protein was purified from E. coli cells co-expressing the three subunits(23Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the results of the reconstitution experiments. Surprisingly, the mixture of Fractions I-IV, which contains XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG, ERCC1, and all of the subunits of repair factor TFIIH, failed to reconstitute the excision nuclease activity (lane 1). A previous study had implicated HSSB (RPA) in the early steps of excision repair(24Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In that study the repair synthesis assay was used, and thus it was uncertain whether HSSB was required for incision. However, the study did raise the possibility that HSSB might be needed for steps prior to repair synthesis. Hence, we decided to add homogeneous HSSB (Fraction V) to our reaction mixture (Fig. 4, lane 2). This addition resulted in excinuclease activity at a level comparable to that obtained with HeLa cell-free extract (lane 3), providing the first direct evidence that HSSB is required for the dual incision reactions, in addition to its potential function in repair synthesis. Since the XPC protein (Fraction III) used in reconstitution (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2) was an early purification fraction, we tested another XPC preparation purified as part of the TFIIH factor to a high level of purity by a different scheme (8Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) to ascertain that only XPC in Fraction III was needed for reconstitution. Fig. 4(lane 4) shows that this substitution also led to reconstitution of the excinuclease activity, whereas no signal was detected with the mixture lacking the highly pure TFIIH/XPC fraction (lane 5). In addition, we have obtained highly purified XPC free of any of the other XP proteins by the method of Masutani et al. (25Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and have reconstituted the excinuclease activity with this protein (data not shown). The results in Fig. 4 thus lead us to propose that these five fractions are necessary and sufficient for the excision step of human nucleotide excision repair. Of special note, none of these five fractions complemented an XP-E mutant cell extract (which has residual excision activity), suggesting that the XPE protein is not necessary for making the dual incisions. ( 3A. Kazantsev and A. Sancar, unpublished results. )Thus, we hypothesize that XPE and the proteins defined by the moderately UV-sensitive rodent complementation groups 6-11 (see (26Thompson L.H. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1989; 14: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Stefanini M. Collins A.R. Riboni R. Klaude M. Botta E. Mitchell D.L. Nuzzo F.

Nature. 1993; 365: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the subunits of TFIIH, as well as TFIIH (15Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) have helicase activities. Thus, it has been postulated that TFIIH is responsible for unwinding DNA and releasing the excised fragment from the complementary strand(31Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Bootsma D. Nature. 1994; 371: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the highly defined system, we wished to test this proposal by analyzing the excision assay mixture using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Under our experimental conditions, all of the DNA including the excised fragment was retained in the origin, presumably bound to HSSB and other DNA-binding proteins in a nonspecific manner (Fig. 5, lane 2). Addition of competitor M13 single-stranded DNA dissociated most of the substrate from these nonspecific complexes, but only a very small fraction of the excision product was released (lane 3). In contrast, treating the reaction mixture with SDS quantitatively released the excised oligomer (lane4). Heat denaturation at 95°C for 2 min did not increase the level of released excision product (lane5), suggesting that the oligomer does not remain bound to the duplex following the SDS-induced dissociation of the excinuclease. Taken together, these results indicate that the excised oligomer remains in the post-incision complex and that additional proteins are required to release the damage-containing oligomers following dual incisions. In conclusion, we have reconstituted the human excinuclease in a highly defined system. We believe that the proteins known to exist in our system (XPA, TFIIH (XPB and XPD), XPC, XPF, XPG, ERCC1, and HSSB) constitute a minimal set necessary for dual incision. The possibility that some of the other proteins that exist in our system as “contaminants” participate in excision cannot be eliminated until the entire system is reconstituted with recombinant proteins. However, the availability of this highly defined system now makes it possible to investigate the roles of individual XP proteins in excision and to dissect the individual steps of human excision repair. Indeed, this system has enabled us to determine that proteins in addition to those known to exist in our system are required to dissociate the post-incision complex and release the excised oligomer."

The role of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders was investigated by expressing the catalytic subunit in lymphocytes of transgenic mice. Adult transgenic mice displayed a stochastic propensity to develop lymphoma; co-expression of a c-myc transgene in addition to casein kinase II resulted in neonatal leukemia. Thus, the casein kinase II gene can serve as an oncogene, and its dysregulated expression is capable of transforming lymphocytes in a two-step pathway with c-myc."
https://openalex.org/W2079726617,Plasmids carrying gene pairs encoding type II DNA restriction endonucleases and their cognate modification enzymes were shown to have increased stability in Escherichia coli. The descendants of cells that had lost these genes appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzyme molecules. The capacity of these genes to act as a selfish symbiont is likely to have contributed to the evolution of restriction-modification gene pairs.
https://openalex.org/W2016696388,"We studied the interactions of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides and heparin-binding growth factors. By means of a gel mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that phosphodiester and phosphorothioate homopolymers bound to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Binding of a probe phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide could also be shown for other proteins of the FGF family, including acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), Kaposi's growth factor (FGF-4) as well as for the bFGF-related vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF. No binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was observed. In addition, using a radioreceptor assay, we have shown that phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine blocked binding of not only 125I-bFGF, but also of 125I-PDGF to NIH 3T3 cells, whereas phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides were ineffective. The extent of blockade of binding was dependent on the chain length of the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides of different sequences on 125I-bFGF binding to low and high affinity sites on both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Despite the fact that we have observed inhibition of bFGF binding by the 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides for both the high and low affinity classes of bFGF receptor, the inhibition was sequence-selective only for the high affinity receptors. We have also demonstrated that phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine release bFGF bound to low affinity receptors in extracellular matrix (ECM). Finally, the most potent phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in these experiments (e.g. SdC28) were inhibitors of bFGF-induced DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. We studied the interactions of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides and heparin-binding growth factors. By means of a gel mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that phosphodiester and phosphorothioate homopolymers bound to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Binding of a probe phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide could also be shown for other proteins of the FGF family, including acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), Kaposi's growth factor (FGF-4) as well as for the bFGF-related vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF. No binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was observed. In addition, using a radioreceptor assay, we have shown that phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine blocked binding of not only 125I-bFGF, but also of 125I-PDGF to NIH 3T3 cells, whereas phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides were ineffective. The extent of blockade of binding was dependent on the chain length of the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides of different sequences on 125I-bFGF binding to low and high affinity sites on both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Despite the fact that we have observed inhibition of bFGF binding by the 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides for both the high and low affinity classes of bFGF receptor, the inhibition was sequence-selective only for the high affinity receptors. We have also demonstrated that phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine release bFGF bound to low affinity receptors in extracellular matrix (ECM). Finally, the most potent phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in these experiments (e.g. SdC28) were inhibitors of bFGF-induced DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. INTRODUCTIONPhosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides are isoelectronic congeners of phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides that retain the property of aqueous solubility and Watson-Crick base pair hybridization, but which are also nuclease-resistant (Stein et al., 1988). These materials have found wide application as both in vitro and in vivo sequence-specific, or antisense, inhibitors of gene expression (for a review, see Stein and Cheng(1993)). However, it has been recognized for some years that these compounds may have non-sequence-specific effects on cellular function. These may result, at least in part, from their ability to bind to cellular proteins. For example, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides appear to bind non-sequence specifically to rsCD4 (Yakubov et al., 1993), gp120 (Stein et al., 1993), and to protein kinase C β1, α, δ, and ε isoforms. Other polyanions, including pentosan polysulfate (Wellstein et al., 1991) and suramin (Stein, 1993), can also bind to these proteins. Furthermore, these latter polyanions also bind to heparin-binding growth factors, including bFGF ( 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factoraFGFacidic fibroblast growth factorFGF-4fibroblast growth factor-4PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorSdC2828-mer phosphorothioate homopolymer of cytidineECMextracellular matrixBSAbovine serum albuminDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )(Moscatelli and Quarto, 1989) and other growth factors as well (Coffey et al., 1987). We hypothesized that oligodeoxynucleotides, which are also polyanions, might, similar to suramin and pentosan polysulfate, interact with bFGF and other heparin-binding proteins. In this report, we demonstrate direct binding of a phosphodiester probe oligodeoxynucleotide to bFGF by means of a mobility shift assay in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. We also demonstrate that phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides can block the binding of human 125I-labeled bFGF to both low and high affinity receptors on the surface of NIH 3T3 and DU-145 cells. We further show that phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides, similar to heparin, can remove 125I-labeled bFGF from its low affinity binding sites on subendothelial extracellular matrix. In addition, on the basis of our data, we suggest that the ability of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides to block the binding of 125I-labeled bFGF to its cell surface receptors may be sequence-selective.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled bFGF (human, recombinant), 125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled PDGF, and 125I-EGF (murine) were obtained from NEN Research Products. Unlabeled EGF, VEGF, aFGF, bFGF, and FGF-4 were obtained from R and D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Basic fibroblast growth factor (human, recombinant) was also obtained from Promega or as a generous gift from Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma. Heparin sodium, Mr = 14,000, was obtained from Hepar Industries (Franklin, OH).Synthesis of OligodeoxynucleotidesPhosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 380B synthesizer. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were also synthesized by standard methods (Stein et al., 1988), and sulfurization was performed using the tetraethylthiuram disulfide/acetonitrile reagent (TETD; Applied Biosystems). Following cleavage from the controlled glass support, oligodeoxynucleotides were base-deblocked in ammonium hydroxide at 60°C for 8 h and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (0.1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile, PRP-1 support). Oligomers were detritylated in 3% acetic acid and precipitated with 2% lithium perchlorate/acetone dissolved in sterile water and reprecipitated as the sodium salt from 1 M NaCl/ethanol. Oligodeoxynucleotide concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy.In addition to phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine, we also used five 18-heteromer oligodeoxynucleotides of different sequences to block binding of bFGF to its cell surface receptors. Three oligodeoxynucleotides (1, 2, and 3) were complementary to codons 2-7 of either the rat or mouse c-myb mRNA. In addition, one of the oligodeoxynucleotides (No. 3; antisense rat c-myb) was a chimeric phosphorothioate/diester (two phosphorothioate linkages at the 5′ and five phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′ terminus). One oligodeoxynucleotide (No. 4) was sense rat c-myb, and the other (No. 5) was a scrambled version of the rat antisense c-myb oligodeoxynucleotide. The sequences are: 1, 5′-GTGCCGGGGTCTCCGGGC-3′ (antisense rat c-myb, all phosphorothioate); 2, 5′-GTGTCGGGGTCTCCGGGC-3′ (antisense mouse c-myb, all phosphorothioate); 3, 5′-GSTSGCCGGGGTCTCSCSGSGSGSC-3′ (chimeric phosphorothioate/diester); 4, 5′-GCCCGGAGACCCCGGCAC-3′ (sense rat c-myb, all phosphorothioate); 5, 5′-CGCCGTCGCGGCGGTTGG-3′ (scrambled rat c-myb, all phosphorothioate).Synthesis of Alkylating, Radioactive Phosphodiester Oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-N-Methyl-N-(2-chloroethyl)aminobenzylamine-32P-OdT18 or -32P-OdT12 (RClNH32P-OdT18 or RClNH32P-OdT12)This compound was synthesized by a modification of the method of Knorre et al.(1985). Briefly, after 5′-phosphorylation of OdT18 or OdT12 by Chemical Phosphorylation Reagent (Glen Research, Herndon, VA), a reaction exchanging the 32P of [γ-32P]ATP was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase with ADP as the phosphate acceptor (Sambrook et al., 1989). Then, N-methyl-N-(2-chloroethyl)aminobenzylamine was coupled to the 5′-terminal 32P by reaction with triphenylphosphine/dipyridyl disulfide. The final product was stored at −70°C.Modification of bFGF and Other Heparin-binding Growth Factors by ClRNH32P-OdT18 or ClRNH32P-OdT12This was accomplished by the method of Yakubov et al.(1993). bFGF (10 μg/ml), EGF (3 μg/ml), aFGF (10 μg/ml), FGF4 (10 μg/ml), or VEGF (25 μg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing the appropriate concentration of ClRNH32P-OdT18 or ClRNH32P-OdT12. ( 2ClRNH32P-OdT12 is dodecathymidylate phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide derivative with an alkylator moiety (Fig. ZI) coupled to the 5′ radioactive phosphate through a phosphoroamide bond. )In some experiments, a putative competitor (e.g. phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide) of the binding of the modifying oligomer to bFGF was also added, as indicated in the figure legends. After 1 h, 0.5 volume of a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 0.0001% bromphenol blue was added and SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) was performed. The gels were dried and allowed to expose Kodak x-ray film until bands were visualized. The film was developed, and band densities were quantitated by laser scanning densitometry.CellsContact-inhibited NIH 3T3 cells and the human prostate carcinoma line DU 145 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. NIH 3T3 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 10% (v/v) calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. DU-145 cells were grown and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. For binding experiments, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates (Falcon) or 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates (Corning) and were used for experiments 1 to 3 days later. Cultures of bovine corneal endothelial cells were established from steer eyes as described previously (Gospodarowicz et al., 1977). Stock cultures were maintained in DMEM (1 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 10% CO2-humidified incubators. Partially purified brain-derived bFGF (100 ng/ml) was added every other day during the phase of active cell growth (Gospodarowicz et al., 1977; Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992).Binding of 125I-bFGF to CellsConfluent cultures of cells were used for all experiments. All cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and then incubated in DMEM with 0.1% (w/v) BSA at 37°C for 1 h before the initiation of binding experiments. For the binding test, cells were incubated at 4°C in serum-free medium, containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05 ng/ml (or 0.6 ng/ml) 125I-bFGF, and the desired concentrations of oligodeoxynucleotides. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and cell-bound 125I-bFGF was analyzed by one of two procedures. 1) To determine total bound bFGF, the cells were washed three times with DPBS and were solubilized with 1 M NaOH; 2) in other experiments, cells were washed three times with DPBS and once with 2 M NaCl in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, to remove 125I-bFGF bound to the low affinity binding sites; then the cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.1. The radioactivity thus released represented specific binding to high affinity sites (Moscatelli, 1987). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1000-fold molar excess of nonradioactive bFGF. The amount of radioactivity released in the washes and extracts was determined in a γ-counter (Multi-Prias 1, Packard Instruments).Preparation of Dishes Coated with Extracellular Matrix (ECM)Bovine corneal endothelial cells were dissociated from stock cultures (second to fifth passage) with 0.05% trypsin, 0.01 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 0.02% EDTA and plated into 4-well plates (Nunc; Roskilde, Denmark) at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were maintained as described above except that 5% dextran T-40 was included in the growth medium and the cells were maintained for 10-12 days without addition of bFGF (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992; Vlodavsky et al., 1987). The subendothelial ECM was exposed by dissolving (5 min, room temperature) the cell layer with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mM NH4OH, followed by four washes in PBS. The ECM remained intact, free of cellular debris, and firmly attached to the entire area of the tissue culture dish (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992; Vlodavsky et al., 1987).Displacement of ECM-bound bFGFECM was incubated (3 h, 24°C) with 125I-bFGF (2.5 × 104 cpm/0.25 ml/well) in PBS containing 0.02% gelatin. Unbound bFGF was washed away, and the ECM was incubated with increasing concentrations of either heparin or the desired oligodeoxynucleotide at room temperature for 3 h. The incubation media were collected and counted in a γ counter to determine the amount of released iodinated material. The remaining ECM was incubated (3 h, 37°C) with 1 N NaOH, and the solubilized radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. The percentage of released 125I-bFGF was calculated from the total ECM-associated radioactivity (Ishai-Michaeli et al., 1992). Depending on the batch of ECM, 8-15% of the bound 125I-bFGF was released during incubation with PBS alone. This “spontaneous” release could be markedly reduced by first heating (80°C, 60 min) the ECM to inactivate its intrinsic proteolytic activity. Spontaneous release was subtracted from the experimental values to assess the specifically released 125I-bFGF. Each experiment was performed three to five times, yielding similar results.[3H]Thymidine IncorporationNIH 3T3 cells were plated into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well in culture medium. After 72 h, when cells were at confluence, the culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. The medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 10.0 ng/ml bFGF, and the appropriate concentration of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (0.2, 2.0, 20.0 μM). Control wells contained medium plus 0.1% BSA and 10.0 ng/ml bFGF. After 18-20 h, cells were pulsed for 3 h with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well). The amount of radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was counted on glass filters, using a 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).RESULTSModification of bFGF by the Alkylating PO OligodeoxynucleotideWhen bFGF and the 32P-labeled alkylating, radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide, ClRNH32P-OdT18, were incubated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 1 h, and the reaction products were then subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, a single band was observed on the exposed x-ray film. This band corresponded to the product of chemical modification of the protein by the alkylating group of the oligodeoxynucleotide, as described above. 32P-Labeled oligodeoxynucleotide of identical sequence not containing an alkylating moiety did not strongly associate with bFGF, and, in this case, no gel bands were seen on the x-ray film. No difference in the quantitative modification of bFGF by RClNH32P-OdT18 could be detected in different buffers, including 0.1 M Tris-HCl ± 5 mM CaCl2, in 0.05 M Tris-HCl ± 0.1 M NaCl, or in PBS.We examined the concentration dependence of the modification of bFGF by ClRNH32P-OdT18 (Fig. 1). These results are also depicted in Fig. 2(top), where the concentration of alkylating oligodeoxynucleotide is plotted as a function of gel band intensity, as determined by laser-scanner densitometry. The association of bFGF with the alkylating probe oligodeoxynucleotide exhibits approximate saturation binding. Fig. 2(bottom) depicts the double-reciprocal replot of the data in Fig. 2(top). This plot is not linear, and the fact that it is composite implies that the concentration dependence of bFGF modification cannot be simply described by the Michaelis-Menton equation. However, at low concentrations of ClRNH32P-OdT18, the concentration dependence of the modification is approximately linear and intersects the minus abscissa corresponding to an apparent Kd value of 0.18 μM. At higher concentrations (0.6-5.0 μM), the dependence of modification is also linear and intersects the minus abscissa at apparent Kd = 1.1 μM. These data imply, therefore, that there are at least two binding sites, with different affinities for ClRNH32P-OdT18, on the surface of the bFGF protein.Figure 1Modification of bFGF by the alkylating oligodeoxynucleotide ClRNH32P-OdT18. bFGF (3 μg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with ClRNH32P-OdT18 at the concentration given below for 45 min at 37°C. The mixture containing the bFGF•oligodeoxynucleotide complex was then subjected to 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of ClRNH32P-OdT18 was as follows (lanes 1-9, respectively): 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.25, 2, and 5 μM. Unreacted ClRNH32P-OdT18 ran off the end of the gel and is not seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Top, concentration dependence of modification of bFGF by differing concentrations of ClRNH32P-OdT18.

This gel is shown in Fig. 3, and two bands are clearly visible. On the other hand, unmodified bFGF gave a single sharp band at the appropriate migration rate after Coomassie Blue staining. The slower migrating band near the top of the gel migrates at the position expected for a bFGF dimer.Figure 3Modification of bFGF by the alkylating oligodeoxynucleotide ClRNH32P-OdT18 with gel electrophoresis performed by 6% SDS-PAGE. bFGF (3 μg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with ClRNH32P-OdT18 as described in the text. The concentration of ClRNH32P-OdT18 (lanes 1-5, respectively) was 0.01, 0.04, 0.2, 1, and 5 μM. Unreacted probe is seen at the bottom of the gel. Two bands are clearly seen which migrate at the approximate position of bFGF (Mr = 17,000). The band near the top of the gel migrates at the position expected for a bFGF dimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of the Competition Constant (Kc) for SdT18, a Competitor of Modifying Oligodeoxynucleotide Binding to bFGFWe have examined the ability of several other polyanions, including the phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides OdC15, OdT18, and OdT28 (all 5 μM) to compete with the radiolabeled probe oligodeoxynucleotide for binding to bFGF. All of these polyanions are competitors of binding to bFGF of the modifying, radiolabeled probe oligodeoxynucleotide (concentration of probe = 2.5 μM). Furthermore, suramin, a polyanion long known (Stein, 1993) to be able to bind to heparin-binding growth factors and to block their binding to cell surface receptors, also is a competitor of the binding of RClNH32P-OdT12 to bFGF. ( 3M. Guvakova and C. A. Stein, unpublished results. )We have, in greater detail, examined the ability of a 15-mer phosphorothioate homopolymer of thymidine, SdT15, to inhibit binding of the modifying, radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide to bFGF. We have previously used this method to determine the values of Kc for competitors of modifying oligodeoxynucleotide binding to rsCD4. The value of Kc may be calculated from Equation 1 from Cheng and Prusoff(1973): Kc = IC50(1+ [ClRNH32P-OdT12]/Kd).For the competitor SdT15, we found (Fig. 4, A and B) that the value of IC50 = 0.12 μM. However, the determination of Kc is complicated by the difficulty in accurately determining a value of Kd. This is because the value of the low affinity Kd and the high affinity Kd of the modifying oligodeoxynucleotide binding to bFGF are quite close, and there are significant errors in the determination of each. Thus, we have used an average value (0.5 μM) for the value of Kd. The value of Kc for SdT15, as determined by the Cheng-Prusoff equation, is 60 nM.Figure 4Competition by SdT15 for binding of ClRNH32P-OdT12 to bFGF. Top, SdT15 was used as a competitor of ClNH32P-OdT12 (0.5 μM) binding to bFGF as described in the text (6% PAGE). Bands represent bFGF modified by the oligodeoxynucleotide. The concentration of SdT15 was (lanes 1-9, respectively) 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.31, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 μM. Bottom, determination of the value of Kcfor SdT15 by the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Equation 1). The data from the top panel was quantitated by laser scanner densitometry. Shown is a plot (r2 = 0.96) of normalized counts/min versus the log of the SdT15 concentration (micromolar). The IC50 was 0.12 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of RClNH32P-OdT18 to Other Heparin-binding Growth FactorsThis experiment was performed in a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and is shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, not only bFGF, but acidic FGF, FGF4 (K-FGF/hst), and VEGF can bind to either of the modifying probe oligodeoxynucleotides (RClNH32P-OdT12 or -OdT18; concentration of each = 2.5 μM). In sharp contrast to the behavior with these growth factors, no band is present at the approximate place of migration of EGF, which binds to heparin only weakly. It should be noted that the commercially available preparations of aFGF, FGF4, and VEGF all contain albumin. It has previously been demonstrated (Vlassov et al., 1993) that albumin can bind phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides with low affinity. The modification of the albumin present in these preparations by RClNH32P-OdT18 can be seen at the indicated position in Fig. 5.Figure 5Modification of growth factors by ClRNH32P-OdT18 or -OdT12. The growth factor was incubated with either 2.5 μM ClNH32P-OdT18 (lanes 1-5) or 2.5 μM ClNH32P-OdT12 (lanes 6-10). Lanes 1 and 6, EGF (3 μg/ml); lanes 2 and 7, bFGF (10 μg/ml); lanes 3 and 8, aFGF (10 μg/ml); lanes 4 and 9, FGF4 (10 μg/ml); lanes 5 and 10, VEGF (25 μg/ml). Members of the FGF family migrate at the position labeled 1 on the left. VEGF migrates at the position labeled 2. No binding of either probe oligodeoxynucleotide to EGF was observed. In contrast, bFGF, aFGF, FGF-4, and VEGF all underwent modification. Other slower migrating bands, seen particularly in lanes 2 and 7 (bFGF lanes) probably represent protein multimers. The bands designated by the arrow represent modification of albumin, which is added to the reagent by the manufacturer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Growth Factor Binding to Cells by Homopolymeric OligodeoxynucleotidesIn order to determine whether oligodeoxynucleotides can interact with growth factors and can influence their binding to cell surface receptors, we examined the binding of basic FGF to 3T3 fibroblasts in the presense of different oligodeoxynucleotides. Both phosphodiester and phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine (28- and 25-mers) were initially tested for their ability to affect 125I-labeled bFGF binding (Fig. 6). At a range of oligodeoxynucleotide concentrations between 2.0 and 10.0 μM, we observed slight (<20%) inhibition of bFGF binding by phosphodiester homopolymers. However, phosphorothioate homopolymers of thymidine as well as cytidine inhibited about 60-70% of total binding.Figure 6Effects of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine on total binding of 125I-bFGF to NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1.0 × 106 cells per well. For binding, test cells were incubated at 4°C in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA, 0.05 ng/ml 125I-bFGF, and the indicated concentrations of oligodeoxynucleotides. After 2 h, medium was removed and cells were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 M NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by γ counting. Error bars are the S.E. of three independent experiments. •, SdC28; ▴, SdT28; □, OdC25; ▵, OdT28.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, by use of the same binding assay, we demonstrated that the inhibition of bFGF binding correlated, in general, directly with the oligodeoxynucleotide chain length for homopolymers of cytidine and thymidine; i.e. the longer the oligodeoxynucleotide (3, 15, or 28 bases), the greater its inhibitory activity at any given concentration (Fig. 7). We also examined the ability of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides to affect the binding of another heparin-binding growth factor to cells. In a binding assay using 125I-labeled PDGF, we demonstrated that phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine of different chain length inhibit PDGF binding to fibroblasts. Again, the inhibition is chain length-dependent, with SdC3 and SdC28 being least and most potent, respectively (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, these same phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides did not affect binding of EGF to cell surface receptors of 3T3 cells (Fig. 8B).Figure 7Chain length dependent effects of phosphorothioate homopolymers of cytidine (A) and thymidine (B) on binding of 125I-bFGF to NIH 3T3 cells.

Although such transcriptional activation is commonly attributed to depolarization-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+, zinc represents a viable alternative given its prominent role as a cofactor in DNA-binding proteins coupled with evidence that Zn2+ can enter excitable cells in a voltage-dependent manner. Here it is shown that Zn2+ entry into heart cells depends upon electrical stimulation and occurs via dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The addition of extracellular Zn2+ to spontaneously depolarizing GH3 pituitary tumor cells induced the expression of a reporter gene driven by the metallothionein promoter, an effect that was prevented by exposure to dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers. Thus, Zn2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels can mediate voltage-dependent gene expression. Electrical activity initiates a program of selective gene expression in excitable cells.

https://openalex.org/W2066008662,"The neural basis of sexual orientation in Drosophila was studied by the production of males with regionally feminized brains. Such flies express the female form of the sex determination gene transformer in a limited number of neurons under the control of GAL4 enhancer trap inserts. This method facilitated the creation of lines with a stable pattern of feminization. In tests of sexual preferences, flies that were feminized in a portion of the antennal lobes or in a subset of the corpora pedunculata (mushroom bodies) courted both males and females. These two brain structures, both of which are involved in olfactory processing, may function in the recognition of sex-specific pheromones, in the control of sex-specific behaviors, or both."

Addition of 1 μM retinoic acid to chondrosarcoma cultures resulted in aggrecan proteolysis with the release of greater than 90% of the cell layer aggrecan into the medium within 4 days. NH2-terminal sequencing of chondroitin sulfate-substituted catabolic products gave a single major NH2-terminal sequence of ARGNVILTXK, initiating at Ala374. This showed that the proteinase, commonly referred to as “aggrecanase,” which cleaves the Glu373-Ala374 bond of the interglobular domain of aggrecan (Sandy, J. D., Neame, P. J., Boynton, R. E., and Flannery, C. R.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8683-8685), is active in this cell system.Aggrecan G1 domain, generated by cleavage of the interglobular domain, was also liberated during catabolism and this was characterized with three antipeptide antisera. Anti-CDAGWL was used as a general probe for G1 domain. Anti-FVDIPEN was used to specifically detect G1 domain with COOH terminus of Asn341, the form which is readily generated by cleavage of aggrecan by a wide range of matrix metalloproteinases. Anti-NITEGE antiserum was used to specifically detect G1 domain with COOH terminus of Glu373, the form which is the expected product of “aggrecanase”-mediated cleavage of aggrecan. Western blot analysis indicated that a single form of G1 domain of about 60 kDa was formed. G1 domain of this size reacted with both anti-CDAGWL and anti-NITEGE but not with anti-FVDIPEN. Similar experiments with primary bovine chondrocyte cultures, treated with either retinoic acid or interleukin 1, showed that two forms of catabolic G1 domain, of about 62 and 66 kDa, were formed. Both of these forms reacted on Western blots with anti-CDAGWL and also with anti-NITEGE.It is suggested that cell-mediated catabolism of the aggrecan interglobular domain in these culture systems, whether promoted by retinoic acid or interleukin 1, primarily involves cleavage of the Glu373-Ala374 bond by aggrecanase. The accumulation of G1 domain with a COOH-terminal of Glu373 shows that such aggrecanase-mediated cleavage can occur independent of the cleavage of the Asn341-Phe342 bond by matrix metalloproteinases.

https://openalex.org/W2130886030,"Bet v 1, the major allergen of birch pollen, displays a considerable degree of heterogeneity. Several charge variants have been detected by two-dimensional IgE immunoblots and isoelectric focusing techniques. This heterogeneity has been attributed to glycosylation (or other post-translational modifications) or to isogenes coding for Bet v 1 isoforms and/or allelic variants. However, until now, only limited structural data for Bet v 1 have been published. Recently, we described the expression, purification, and immunological properties of recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1) produced in Escherichia coli as a non-fusion protein (Ferreira, F. D., Hoffmann-Sommergruber, K., Breiteneder, H., Pettenburger, K., Ebner, C., Sommergruber, W., Steiner, R., Bohle, B., Sperr, W. R., Valent, P., Kungl, A. J., Breitenbach, M., Kraft, D., and Scheiner, O.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19574-19580). Here, we present a more detailed structural characterization of Bet v 1 by both cDNA cloning and mass spectrometry. Thirteen different cDNA clones coding for Bet v 1 isoforms were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of birch pollen cDNA with a sequence-specific 5′-terminal primer and a nonspecific 3′-terminal primer or by immunological screening of a birch pollen cDNA library. These isoforms are referred to as Bet v 1b to Bet v 1n, whereas the previously isolated Bet v 1 cDNA (Breiteneder, H., Pettenburger, K., Bito, A., Valenta, R., Kraft, D., Rumpold, H., Scheiner, O., and Breitenbach, M.(1989) EMBO J. 8, 1935-1938) is now referred to as Bet v 1a. High performance liquid chromatography and plasma desorption mass spectrometry of proteolytic fragments of purified natural Bet v 1 (nBet v 1) and rBet v 1a were used to (i) confirm the primary structure of all Bet v 1 isoforms and (ii) to investigate any possible postsynthetic modifications on rBet v 1a or on the natural mixture of isoallergens obtained from birch pollen.

In the temperate climate zone of the world, pollen from trees of the order Fagales (e.g. birch, alder, hazel, oak, and hornbeam) are a major cause of Type I allergies (Ipsen et al., 1985; Jarolim et al., 1989a). Birch pollen contains a single major allergen with a molecular mass of 17 kDa (Ipsen and Loewenstein, 1983), designated Bet v 1. ( 1The abbreviations used are: Bet vBetula verrucosaAln gAlnus glutinosaCar bCarpinus betulusCor aCorylus avellanaHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographynBet v 1natural Bet v 1PCRpolymerase chain reactionPDMSplasma desorption mass spectrometryrBet v 1recombinant Bet v 1. )More than 96% of all tree pollen allergic patients display IgE antibodies to Bet v 1, and 60% react exclusively to this allergen, indicating the importance of this protein in tree pollen allergy (Jarolim et al., 1989a). Betula verrucosa Alnus glutinosa Carpinus betulus Corylus avellana high performance liquid chromatography natural Bet v 1 polymerase chain reaction plasma desorption mass spectrometry recombinant Bet v 1. Previously, we isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone coding for Bet v 1 (Breiteneder et al., 1989), which shows high sequence similarities to the single major pollen allergen from alder, Aln g 1 (Breiteneder et al., 1992), from hornbeam, Car b 1 (Larsen et al., 1992), and from hazel, Cor a 1 (Breiteneder et al., 1993). This is in good agreement with the observation that patients displaying specific IgE to Bet v 1 also show symptoms during the flowering season of other trees of the order Fagales. Interestingly, all of these major tree pollen allergens show significant sequence similarities to a family of plant pathogen-activated genes shown to be induced in somatic tissues by infection with fungi and bacteria. They were identified in pea (Fristensky et al., 1988), parsley (Somssich et al., 1988), potato (Matton and Brisson, 1989), bean (Walter et al., 1990), asparagus (Warner et al., 1992), and soybean (Crowl et al., 1992). Although they have been associated with defense response of plants, the precise role of the respective gene products still remains elusive. Computer-aided sequence comparisons do not point to any known biochemical function. Presently, several families of pathogenesis-related proteins and genes are known (Bowles, 1990), but these families show no similarity to Bet v 1 and homologous proteins. Bet v 1 shows a considerable degree of heterogeneity. Up to 10 charge variants have been observed by two-dimensional IgE immunoblots (Rohac et al., 1991) and isoelectric focusing techniques (Ferreira et al., 1993). Previously, nBet v 1 was described as an acidic glycoprotein (Ipsen and Hansen, 1989; Larsen et al., 1992), and a single consensus site for N-glycosylation is present in the Bet v 1 sequence (Breiteneder et al., 1989). Thus, glycosylation (or other post-translational modifications) could be an explanation for the observed heterogeneity. However, until now, conclusive evidence for the presence, nature, and location of structural modifications of the Bet v 1 molecule is not available. Isogenes coding for Bet v 1 isoforms and/or allelic variants could be another explanation for the heterogeneity observed in two-dimensional IgE immunoblots. Southern blot analysis of birch (Valenta et al., 1991) and differences in the reactivity of two anti-Bet v 1 monoclonal antibodies (Rohac et al., 1991) support this view. To date, only limited structural analysis of Bet v 1 and related proteins has been published. In a previous paper we described the expression, purification, and immunological properties of rBet v 1 produced in Escherichia coli as a non-fusion protein (Ferreira et al., 1993). In the present study, we undertook a more detailed structural characterization of Bet v 1 by both cDNA cloning and mass spectrometry. Total RNA was extracted from birch pollen (Allergon AB, Engelholm, Sweden) according to Chomczynski and Sacchi(1987). The first cDNA strand was synthesized from poly(A)+-enriched RNA with reverse transcriptase (Amersham), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, Cora 1, containing an oligo(dT) tract, a spacer sequence, and a HindIII recognition site (underlined) was used as a primer (5′-GAGAGAGAGAGAAAGCTTT18-3′). First-strand cDNA synthesis products were amplified with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in PCR buffer (Perkin Elmer; 4 mM MgCl2, 0.75 mM of each dNTP, and 0.15 μM each of Cora 2 and Cora 3 primers. The Cora 2 primer was designed to contain an EcoRI site (underlined) followed by the first 19 nucleotides of the Bet v 1a coding region (Breiteneder et al., 1989) (5′-GGGAATTCATGGGTGTTTTCAATTACG-3′). The Cora 3 primer was similar to Cora 1, which was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis, except that it did not contain the oligo(dT) part. Amplification was carried out as described previously (Breiteneder et al., 1993). Amplified PCR products were eluted from an agarose gel, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into a pUCBM20 plasmid. A birch pollen cDNA library was constructed in λZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and screened with serum IgE from an allergic individual selected according to typical case history, positive skin prick test, and RAST (radioallergosorbent test) class > 3.5, as described previously (Breiteneder et al., 1989). Clones coding for Bet v 1 isoforms were isolated, and both strands were sequenced twice according to the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using a T7 Sequencing Kit (Promega). Protein extract from birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen (Allergon AB) was prepared as described previously (Jarolim et al., 1989a). nBet v 1 was purified from pollen extracts by a combination of affinity chromatography on an immobilized anti-Bet v 1 monoclonal antibody (Jarolim et al., 1989b) and reversed phase HPLC on a Hypersil WP300 C8 column, as described previously (Ferreira et al., 1993). rBet v 1a was purified from crude E. coli lysates by chromatofocusing on a PBE-94 exchanger column followed by reversed phase HPLC (Ferreira et al., 1993). Purified Bet v 1 proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli(1970) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentration was determined by the micro-Kjeldahl method, using glycine as standard (Jacobs, 1959). A solution of purified nBet v 1 or rBet v 1a (100 μg in 50 μl of double distilled water) was heated for 20 min at 95°C and diluted with an equal volume of 0.2 M NH4HCO3. One microgram of trypsin (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) was then added and the mixture incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Afterwards, trypsin was added again, and incubation was carried out for an additional 4-h period. The reaction was stopped by adding [1/10] vol of trifluoroacetic acid and dried in vacuo. Digestion of the Bet v 1 proteins with endoproteinase Glu-C (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) was done for 4 h at 37°C using 2 μg of the protease. Peptides resulting from either treatment were separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (solvent A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.07% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; 0-40% B in 120 min; flow rate, 1 ml/min). UV absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Fractions were collected and vacuum dried. Peptide solutions were adsorbed on nitrocellulose-layered targets followed by spin drying (Nielsen et al. 1988). Spectra were obtained on a Bio-Ion 20 K time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Uppsala, Sweden) using accelerating voltages of 18 kV and −15 kV. After washing the targets three times with 20 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, data acquisition was repeated. All data are shown as chemical average masses. This was performed as described previously (Breiteneder et al., 1989). Pollen Bet v 1 isoforms all seem to share the same N-terminal amino acid sequence (Ipsen and Hansen, 1989). We therefore assumed that the DNA sequences at the 5′-end of the coding region of the different isoforms are similar, if not identical. Since the full cDNA sequence of one isoform, Bet v 1a, was already known (Breiteneder et al., 1989), it was possible to design a primer for the specific PCR amplification of the coding and 3′-untranslated region of the different Bet v 1 cDNAs after reverse transcription of birch pollen poly(A)+ RNA. A similar strategy has been successfully used to clone several isoforms of Cor a 1, the Bet v 1 homologue from hazel pollen (Breiteneder et al., 1993). After cloning and sequencing, several PCR-amplified fragments were found to correspond to the original Bet v 1a clone. In addition, 11 different cDNA clones, with lengths ranging from 567 to 756 base pairs, were isolated (Bet v 1b to Bet v1l, respectively). Five of these clones showed 3′-untranslated regions of different lengths and contained poly(A) tails, whereas the other six were truncated at the same position in the 3′-noncoding region (approximately 80 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon) because of a single base exchange (G→A) that created a new recognition site for HindIII, one of the enzymes used for cloning the PCR fragments. Two complete Bet v 1 cDNA clones (Bet v 1 m/n) were isolated by screening a birch pollen cDNA library with human IgE antibodies. All cDNAs contained open reading frames of 480 nucleotides, coding for putative proteins of 160 amino acids, with calculated molecular masses ranging from 17,450 to 17,573 Da. The deduced amino acid sequences compared with that of Bet v 1a are shown in Fig. 1. In three cases (Bet v 1d/h, Bet v 1f/i, and Bet v 1 m/n) differences in the nucleotide sequences did not result in amino acid changes. Since in all PCR clones the first 19 nucleotides were included in the 5′ PCR primer, additional differences at the DNA level could be possible in this region, but these were not detected. Therefore, including Bet v 1a, eleven Bet v 1 protein sequence isoforms have been identified altogether, with amino acid identities ranging from 84.4% (because of differences in 25 amino acids) to 99.4% (a single amino acid exchange) for the different pairs. After reversed phase HPLC, the Bet v 1 preparations (natural and recombinant) migrated as one single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (not shown). Purified natural and recombinant Bet v 1a were each treated with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C. The resulting peptide mixtures were directly analyzed by PDMS (as an example, see Fig. 2). In addition, the total proteolytic digests were fractionated by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 3), and the resulting fractions were reanalyzed by PDMS. This procedure had two advantages that allowed greater coverage of the amino acid sequence: (i) signals for peptides not detected by direct analysis of the complex mixture were frequently observed after HPLC fractionation, and (ii) signals for peptides observed in the complex mixture often were much stronger in the partially purified fractions. Table 1 summarizes the data obtained by PDMS analysis of proteolytic digests of natural and rBet v 1a after HPLC fractionation. The recorded mass signals were mapped onto the cDNA-derived Bet v 1a sequence (Breiteneder et al., 1989) according to their molecular mass and enzyme specificity (Fig. 4).Figure 3Peptide map of Bet v 1 tryptic digests.

Eighteen of the mass signals could be easily matched with the molecular weights of peptides predicted from the amino acid sequence deduced from the published Bet v 1a cDNA sequence (T2-T19). The expected signal at m/z 1987 corresponding to the N-terminal peptide T1 was missing from the spectra. A signal detected at m/z 1856 could be accounted for, assuming that the initial methionine had been removed, leaving glycine as the NH2-terminal amino acid. This signal could also be matched with the expected T10 fragment (m/z 1856). As two different HPLC fractions of tryptic digests produced an ion at m/z 1856, these fractions were each subdigested with endoproteinase Glu-C, and the resulting peptide mixtures (TE peptides) were analyzed by PDMS (Table 1). The two fractions produced (M+H)+ ions at m/z 729/916 and 988, respectively (predicted mass values for endoproteinase Glu-C-subdigested T1 lacking the initial methionine were 729, 249, and 916; for T10 the predicted values were 888 and 987). These fractions were identified as T1 and T10, respectively, thus confirming the above assignment. The removal of initiating methionine was also confirmed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of purified nBet v 1 and rBet v1a (data not shown). Therefore, the amino acid sequence defined in the present study corresponds to residues 2-160 of the published cDNA sequence. To be consistent with the NH2-terminal sequence of the mature Bet v 1 protein, we have renumbered the sequence of Bet v 1a starting with Met0-Gly1-Val2-Phe3… and applied the same numbering system to the new Bet v 1 cDNA sequences presented here. The signal at m/z 1476 was assigned to peptide T9 (69-80) (Fig. 4) originating from an incomplete trypsin cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4, PDMS analysis and HPLC fractionation of nBet v 1 tryptic digests confirmed 100% of the Bet v 1a sequence. Treatment of nBet v 1 with endoproteinase Glu-C yielded the 26 peptides (E peptides) shown in Table 1. These peptides covered about 98% of the Bet v 1a sequence (Fig. 4). Similarly, as observed in the analysis of tryptic digests, the expected mass signal at m/z 860 (corresponding to the NH2-terminal peptide E1) was absent in the spectra. The (M+H)+ ion at m/z 729 was unmatched by any expected fragment according to the published cDNA sequence and, thereupon, assigned to peptide E1 lacking the initiating methionine. The (M+H)+ ions at m/z 959 and 1860 were assigned to E1+E2 and E4 peptides, respectively, originating from incomplete cleavage by endoproteinase Glu-C. According to the Bet v 1a cDNA sequence, peptides T10 (81-97) and E6 (74-87) should contain the only potential Asn-linked glycosylation site (Asn82). The spectra of nBet v 1 digested with either trypsin (Fig. 2) or endoproteinase Glu-C showed strong signals at m/z 1855 (T10) and 1730 (E6), respectively, demonstrating that the asparagine residue at position 82 was unmodified. Fig. 5 shows the mass spectra recorded on HPLC-purified T10 and E6 peptides. As described above, purified T10 was also subdigested with endoproteinase Glu-C, and mass spectra were recorded on the resulting sample (Table 1). Treatment of rBet v 1a with trypsin yielded the 17 peptides shown in Table 1, which covered approximately 95% of the amino acid sequence. The 5% of the rBet v 1a sequence not mapped consisted of small tryptic peptides (one pentapeptide, T16, and one tripeptide, T17). Additional coverage of the rBet v 1a sequence was achieved by digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C, which produced the 13 peptides listed in Table 1. Altogether, 100% of the primary structure of rBet v 1a was confirmed. It should be emphasized that all peptides detected by PDMS of rBet v 1a digests were also detected in nBet v 1 digests. Next, we attempted to analyze peptides originating from nBet v 1, which could not be assigned to the Bet v 1a sequence by their molecular weight and the specificity of the enzyme. According to their molecular weight, these peptides did not correspond to well characterized autolysis products from trypsin (Vestling et al., 1990). Another possible explanation is that these unmatched mass signals could be caused by peptides carrying postsynthetical modifications. However, the differences between any of the observed mass values and the masses of predicted proteolytic peptides were not consistent with the presence of common post-translational modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or O-glycosylation. We speculated that they might have originated from isoforms of Bet v 1a. Hence, the data were specifically searched for signals corresponding to proteolytic peptides predicted from the amino acid sequences deduced from the 13 Bet v 1 cDNA sequences obtained in the present study (Bet v 1b-n). In this way, 22 (M+H)+ ions in tryptic digests and 11 in endoproteinase Glu-C digests could be matched with predicted peptides of Bet v 1 isoforms (see Table 1). Two of those matched peptides, E5 (M+H)+ = 1554 and E7 (M+H)+ = 845, were sequenced by Edman degradation, confirming these assignments. In total, these matched peptides covered approximately 83-91% of the amino acid exchanges in Bet v 1b, c, k, and m/n; 60-70% for Bet v 1j, f/i, e, and d/h; and 44 and 57% for Bet v 1 g and Bet v 1l, respectively. Finally, peptides T19-3/E14-3 and T19-5/E14-5 (see Table 1) suggested the existence of truncated Bet v 1 isoforms, missing 3 or 5 amino acids at the C terminus, respectively. This region shows 100% sequence identity in all cDNA clones. Interestingly, these shorter peptides were not detected in proteolytic digests of rBet v 1a, but only in preparations of nBet v 1. In this case, we estimated that less than 30% of nBet v 1 consisted of truncated forms (based on relative peak heights of the signals corresponding to truncated versus intact peptides), very likely because of proteolysis during the pollen extraction procedure. The aim of the present paper was 2-fold: First, we tried to confirm at the protein level the deduced amino acid sequence of Bet v 1a (formerly referred to as Bet v 1), the major allergen of birch pollen (Breiteneder et al., 1989), and of several other closely related isoallergens that also occur in pollen and whose sequences are presented here. As shown here and by others (Tsarbopoulos et al., 1988; Pedersen et al., 1993), the remarkable detection limit (about 10-100 pmol) and resolving power of PDMS is sufficient to confirm a protein sequence previously determined by cDNA sequencing and to discriminate between closely related isoforms of proteins. Moreover, it is possible to roughly estimate the relative amounts of the isoproteins in the natural mixture by comparing peak areas of isopeptides, which points to the fact that the isoform Bet v 1a represents at least 50% of the total mass of pollen Bet v 1. Second, it was our aim to investigate any possible postsynthetic modifications on rBet v 1a or on the natural mixture of isoallergens obtained from commercially available birch pollen. The correct postsynthetic modifications of a recombinant protein are of utmost importance if such a protein is to be used for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease, as is the case with recombinant allergens. As shown in several cases, such modifications can strongly influence the immunological properties of proteins (Nilsen et al., 1991; Batanero et al., 1994), and therefore, the present study is closely connected with a previous study in which we investigated the immunological equivalence of rBet v 1a with nBet v 1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay competition experiments (Ferreira et al., 1993). The purified rBet v 1a used here revealed all of the predicted peptides (Fig. 2 and Table 1) but no additional peaks. The only postsynthetic modification observed was cleavage of the N-terminal methionine with nearly 100% efficiency, as was expected. nBet v 1 from birch pollen was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography and HPLC. After purification it still showed the same complex pattern of spots in two-dimensional IgE immunoblots as was seen in the starting material (data not shown). Our interpretation is that no immunoreactive material (and, therefore, no specific isoform) was lost in the purification procedure. All of the mass peaks (with one single exception) obtained from nBet v 1 after proteolytic digestion were either identical with the ones obtained from purified rBet v 1a or could be explained by peptides predicted to arise from the isoform sequences presented here. Isoforms b, c, k, and m/n were so similar that we could only confirm them as a group. Isoform j was so similar to Bet v 1a that it could not be discriminated from it. Isoform l did not lead to any diagnostic peptide discriminating it from all other isoforms, and therefore, we cannot be sure that it really exists at the protein level. It should be considered that some of the sequence differences observed between the Bet v 1 isoforms might have originated from PCR artifacts. However, this seems unlikely since most of the cDNA sequences obtained by PCR were also confirmed individually at the protein level by PDMS analysis (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). In the mass spectra of nBet v 1 no peaks were found indicating N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation of the cleavage peptides. This result is in good agreement with earlier work showing that Bet v 1 is a cytoplasmic protein located at or near the place of ER-bound ribosomes in dry pollen (Grote, 1991), since cytoplasmic proteins are frequently unmodified and never have been found to be N-glycosylated (Hirschberg and Snider, 1987). Phosphorylation would have explained the charge differences of nBet v 1 in two-dimensional immunoblots (Rohac et al., 1991) but does not seem to occur. It was previously shown that phosphopeptides are well detected by PDMS (Craig et al., 1991). Because of the absence of covalent modifications, the production of rBet v 1 in a form that is immunologically (and conformationally) similar to nBet v 1 in E. coli is greatly facilitated. Finally, comparison of the 14 cDNA sequences showed that three pairs of sequences (f/i, d/h, and m/n) are each coding for the same protein and are different only through silent exchanges. The 3′-noncoding regions within the d/h pair are nearly identical, and therefore, we assume that these sequences represent alleles of the same gene locus. This is conceivable, since the birch pollen used in this study for mRNA and protein extraction was obtained from a variety of different trees. Sequences a and j are probably not allelic, since they show relatively large insertions, deletions, and sequence deviations in their 3′-noncoding regions. However, it is not generally possible to discriminate with certainty between allelic variants and different isoforms by comparison of cDNA sequences. For this, genomic sequences and restriction maps would be needed. We thank Peter Briza for critically reading the manuscript."

Previous studies suggested that the primary role of TnT is to anchor the TnI•TnC complex to the thin filament, primarily through its interactions with TnI and tropomyosin.

Based on this evidence, we employed an antisense strategy to test the hypothesis that LAR is a specific physiological transmembrane PTPase involved in modulating insulin receptor signal transduction. McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The pMEP4b eukaryotic expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. Mark L. Tykocinski (Case Western Reserve University). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and Syp/SHPTP2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP and 125I-TyrA14 were from DuPont NEN. Other materials were obtained as described previously(9Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% equine serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Since some reports have indicated that the degree of cell confluence can influence LAR levels(14Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M.

The pMEP4b antisense vector was constructed by inserting a 546-nucleotide cDNA fragment consisting of 20 upstream nucleotides and the first 526 coding nucleotides of rat LAR message in an inverted orientation downstream of the metallothionein promoter. Transfection of the antisense vector and a null control vector into the McA-RH7777 cell line was performed by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation(16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Stable non-clonal populations resistant to 125 μg/ml hygromycin B were obtained. The pRc/CMV antisense vector was constructed with the same LAR cDNA fragment described above. After a calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation transfection, stable non-clonal populations of cells were selected with 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Following an overnight starvation in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, subconfluent 24-well plates of null vector- and antisense-expressing cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with 9.0 pM 125I-TyrA14 porcine insulin (2200 Ci/mmol) plus unlabeled insulin competitor as described. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the cell-associated radiolabel quantitated. Each point was performed in triplicate. Subconfluent 10-cm monolayers containing equal numbers of null vector- and antisense-expressing cells were incubated for 15 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Following a 5-min hormone treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4, harvested in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate) and homogenized in a hand-driven glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the clarified supernatants were normalized to protein content (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis of phosphotyrosyl proteins were performed as described previously(9Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After subconfluent 10-cm monolayers containing equal numbers of null vector- and antisense-expressing cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were lysed and normalized to protein content, and insulin receptors were isolated by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. In three experiments, recovery of receptors as determined by tracer binding analysis was within 5% between null vector- and antisense-expressing cells by this technique. Receptors were stimulated with 0 or 100 nM insulin for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mM orthovanadate, 8.75 mM MnCl2, and 22 μM [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Insulin receptors were partially purified on wheat germ agglutinin as described above and then subjected to a tyrosine kinase assay using poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) as an exogenous substrate. Reactions were assayed for 20 min at room temperature and terminated by applying 30-μl aliquots onto Whatman No. 3MM filter papers. The filter papers were washed in a 10% trichloracetic acid, 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate solution, rinsed with ethanol, and dried before counting. Null vector- and antisense-expressing cells were hormone treated and harvested as described above. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described(9Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the transmembrane PTPase LAR is involved in modulating insulin receptor signal transduction in vivo, an antisense expression system was developed. The LAR antisense vector was constructed by inserting, in an inverted orientation, a 546-nucleotide rat LAR cDNA fragment into the eukaryotic expression vector pMEP4b. This antisense vector, as well as a null vector to serve as a control, was stably transfected into the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777. Western blot analysis of the resulting non-clonal subpopulations of cells demonstrated that LAR protein expression was reduced by 63.0 ± 6.4% (mean ± S.D.) in the LAR antisense cells when compared to the null vector cells (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate specificity, null vector and LAR antisense cell lysates were probed with an antibody against the PTPase Syp/SHPTP-2. As shown in Fig. 1B, Syp/SHPTP-2 protein levels were equivalent between the two cell subpopulations. Additionally, in spite of their difference in LAR expression, the null vector- and LAR antisense-expressing cells possessed equivalent morphology, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios, growth rates, and total protein per cell (data not shown). Since the pMEP4b vector contains a metallothionein promoter, maximum LAR suppression was attained with either serum-containing medium or with serum-free medium when the latter was supplemented with 50 μM Zn2+. Culturing the LAR antisense cells in low Zn2+ or Zn2+-free medium allowed LAR protein levels to return to those of null vector control cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the suppression of LAR protein was mediated by the transcriptional product of the antisense construct. The next series of experiments were designed to investigate whether reduced LAR protein levels altered insulin receptor signal transduction. The first parameter examined was insulin binding and affinity. As shown in Fig. 2, insulin binding and affinity were equivalent in the two subpopulations of cells. Scatchard analysis of these data demonstrated approximately 50,000 receptors/cell with a Kd of 0.3 nM. If LAR exerted a negative modulating effect on insulin receptor signal transduction, then suppression of LAR protein levels would be expected to increase cellular responses to insulin. When intact null vector- and LAR antisense-expressing cells were stimulated with insulin, reduced LAR levels resulted in approximately a 150% increase in insulin receptor β subunit (95 kDa) autophosphorylation at all hormone concentrations tested (Fig. 3A). In contrast, basal insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was unaffected by altered LAR levels. An insulin-dependent phosphotyrosyl protein was also observed at 120 kDa. This may be the liver-specific receptor substrate pp120/HA4(17Margolis R.N. Taylor S.I. Seminara D. Hubbard A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7256-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 120-kDa band was increased in cells containing suppressed levels of LAR. Hormone-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1/pp185 was not observed. This may be due in part to a hormone-independent band at approximately 185 kDa. This hormone-independent phosphotyrosyl band was unchanged when LAR levels were reduced. The latter data would suggest that reducing LAR levels does not result in a generalized increase in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the observed difference in receptor autophosphorylation was not due to an irreversible alteration in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors. When insulin receptors from null vector- and antisense-expressing cells were purified by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography and then stimulated with insulin in vitro, autophosphorylation levels were equivalent (Fig. 3B). This control experiment demonstrates that by removing the influence of cellular PTPases from the analysis, the observed effect of LAR antisense expression is abolished. Augmentation of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in cells containing reduced LAR protein levels provides evidence that LAR might be involved in insulin receptor signaling. The increased insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 120-kDa substrate in Fig. 3A suggested that LAR altered in vivo insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. By isolating insulin receptors from insulin-treated cells in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, the in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptors can be preserved and analyzed directly. Using poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) as a substrate, in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptors within LAR antisense-expressing cells was found to be increased by 29 ± 4 and 39 ± 1 at 1 and 100 nM insulin (n = 3), respectively, when compared to the null vector-expressing cells (Fig. 3C). These differences were statistically significant as determined by a Student's t test and demonstrate that the activity of intact cell insulin receptors is increased by reduced LAR levels. No difference in basal insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was detected between null vector- and antisense-expressing cells. As an additional control, insulin receptors were purified from each subpopulation without prior insulin stimulation. When these latter receptors were stimulated with insulin in vitro, they possessed equivalent tyrosine kinase activities (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the number of insulin receptors purified from null vector- and antisense-expressing cells, under the conditions of the tyrosine kinase assay, is the same. Additionally, the results support the interpretation from the autophosphorylation experiments that the observed effect of LAR antisense expression is abolished by removing the influence of cellular PTPases from the analysis. Increases in insulin receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity, both receptor level effects, suggest that LAR is a physiological PTPase that either directly or indirectly acts on the insulin receptor. To determine if LAR is capable of exerting its effect on insulin receptor signaling distal to the receptor, insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation was examined. PI 3-kinase may be involved in insulin stimulation of glucose transport and insulin-dependent anti-lipolysis(18Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in insulin stimulation of mRNA synthesis(19Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, any PTPase that alters PI 3-kinase activity demonstrates a downstream receptor site of action and potentially links that PTPase to a biological response. When this parameter was tested, insulin-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase averaged 350% greater in LAR antisense-expressing cells when compared to null vector-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). This effect was not due to differences in the total cellular pool of PI 3-kinase since these levels were the same between the two subpopulations of cells (data not shown). The increase in PI 3-kinase activity found in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations after insulin stimulation is thought to be due to an association of PI 3-kinase with phosphorylated IRS-1(20Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the presence of phosphorylated IRS-1 was not demonstrated in Fig. 3A, we investigated the role of IRS-1 in PI 3-kinase activation by directly examining PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 4B, reduced LAR levels led to dramatic increases in IRS-1 immunoprecipitable PI 3-kinase activity. This result would suggest that the 350% increase in PI 3-kinase activation described in Fig. 4A is mediated by IRS-1. Depending on LAR's site of action, there are several potential mechanisms by which a 63% reduction in LAR levels can lead to a 150% increase in receptor autophosphorylation and a 350% increase in PI 3-kinase activation but only a 35% increase in receptor tyrosine kinase activity. First, poly(Glu-Tyr) may not be an ideal substrate for the insulin receptor; the use of this substrate in an in vitro assay may not reflect in vivo insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Second, the 350% increase in PI 3-kinase activity could simply represent a downstream amplification of the LAR-dependent 35% increase in receptor kinase activity. Third, tyrosine kinase activity may be lost under the conditions of the assay; the 35% increase may underestimate the difference seen within intact cells. More intriguing, however, is the possibility that LAR could specifically dephosphorylate tyrosine residues on either the insulin receptor itself or a downstream substrate that are critical for PI 3-kinase activation. This latter mechanism would imply that LAR functions as an active component in determining the manner in which a cell responds to insulin. Whether LAR performs this function in a direct or indirect manner remains to be elucidated. To demonstrate the sensitivity and reproducibility of the antisense approach, a second antisense construct was synthesized by inserting the described LAR cDNA fragment into the pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector. As shown in Fig. 5, studies performed with the pRc/CMV antisense vector confirmed the results found with the pMEP4b vector. Suppressed LAR protein levels resulted in an increase in the responsiveness of early insulin receptor signaling, including 100% increases in insulin receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 5A) and increases of up to 250% in insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (Fig. 5B) at all insulin concentrations tested. This work represents the first evidence that manipulation in situ of a natively expressed PTPase can have profound effects on insulin receptor signaling in an intact cell and further supports the hypothesis that LAR is a physiological regulator of insulin action. The fact that a 63% reduction in LAR protein levels results in dramatic increases in early insulin receptor signaling indicates that LAR is a critical component of insulin receptor signaling. Defects in LAR expression and/or activity could have profound effects on a cell's ability to respond to insulin."

To obtain insight in possible functions of the furin propeptide, we have studied biosynthesis, propeptide cleavage, biological activity, and intracellular localization of human and bovine furin. Analysis of autocatalytic cleavage site mutants of furin revealed that efficient propeptide cleavage requires the presence of the complete furin cleavage consensus sequence Arg-X-Lys-Arg. In studies of a mutant in which the P1+P4+P5 residues of the autoproteolytic cleavage site were substituted, no substrate processing activity could be demonstrated, indicating a complete block of maturation. In immunofluorescence analysis, this mutant was found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting ER retention of profurin. This ER retention, however, appeared saturable. Furin proteins encoded by oxyanion hole mutant N188A and negative side chain mutant D248L, which possess autoprocessing activity but lack substrate processing activity, were found in the Golgi and the ER, respectively. Finally, analysis of a furin mutant, in which all three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation were altered, revealed autocatalytic cleavage, substrate processing, and transport to the Golgi.

https://openalex.org/W2081111499,"The region COOH-terminal to the reactive center loop is highly conserved in the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family. We have studied the structural consequences of three substitutions (Val<sup>451</sup>→ Met, Phe<sup>455</sup>→ Ser, and Pro<sup>476</sup>→ Ser) found in this region of C1 inhibitor in patients suffering from hereditary angioedema. Equivalent substitutions have been described in α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III. The mutant C1 inhibitor proteins were only partially secreted upon transient transfection into COS-7 cells and were found to be dysfunctional. Immunoprecipitation of conditioned media demonstrated that in the intact, uncleaved form they all bind to a monoclonal antibody which recognizes specifically the protease-complexed or reactive center-cleaved normal C1 inhibitor. A second indication for an intrinsic conformational change was the increased thermostability compared to the normal protein. Furthermore, gel filtration studies showed that the Val<sup>451</sup>→ Met and Pro<sup>476</sup>→ Ser mutant proteins, and to a lesser extent Phe<sup>455</sup>→ Ser, were prone to spontaneous multimerization. Finally, a reduced susceptibility to reactive center cleavage by trypsin was observed for all three mutants, and the cleaved Val<sup>451</sup>→ Met and Pro<sup>476</sup>→ Ser mutants failed to adopt the conformation recognized by a cleavage-specific monoclonal antibody. Investigation of plasmas of patients with the Val<sup>451</sup>→ Met or Pro<sup>476</sup>→ Ser substitutions showed that these dysfunctional proteins circulate at low levels and are recognized by the complex-specific antibody. These results strongly indicate a conformational change as a result of these carboxyl-terminal substitutions, such that anchoring of the reactive center loop at the COOH-terminal side is not achieved properly. We propose that this results in overinsertion of the loop into β-sheet A, which subsequently leads to multimerization."

https://openalex.org/W1963520696,"Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) occur in the extracellular matrix of land plants and green algae. HRGPs contain from 2 to 95% of their dry weight as carbohydrate, predominantly as oligoarabinosides and/or as heteropolysaccharides which are O-linked to the hydroxyproline residues. A glycosylation code that determines the presence or absence and extent of arabinosylation at each hydroxyproline residue is likely, as each HRGP has a unique arabinosylation profile. Previously we noted a positive correlation between the contiguity of hydroxyproline residues and the extent of HRGP O-arabinosylation (Kieliszewski, M., deZacks, R., Leykam, J. F., and Lamport, D. T. A.(1992) Plant Physiol. 98, 919-926); most arabinosylated hydroxyproline residues and the longer arabinofuranoside chains occur in HRGPs where Hyp residues occur as blocks of tetrahydroxyproline, while those with little or no contiguous Hyp exhibit very little Hyp arabinosylation. In order to test this Hyp contiguity hypothesis, we have for the first time determined the arabinosylation site specifics of an HRGP, namely the proline and hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (PHRGP) isolated from Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Pronase digests of PHRGP yielded a major peptide and three glycopeptides whose structures were determined directly from the unfractionated, underivatized Pronase digest by tandem mass spectrometry using collisionally induced dissociation. We corroborated the peptide and glycopeptide structures by Edman degradation, neutral sugar analyses, hydroxyproline arabinoside profiles, and further mass spectrometric analyses after purification of the major peptide and glycopeptides by a combination of hydrophilic interaction and reverse phase column chromatography. Consistent with the Hyp contiguity hypothesis, the structural analyses indicate that while the sequence Ile-Pro-Pro-Hyp is never arabinosylated and Lys-Pro-Hyp-Val-Hyp is only occasionally monoarabinosylated at Hyp-5, the peptide containing contiguous Hyp, Lys-Pro-Hyp-Hyp-Val, is always arabinosylated at Hyp-3, mainly by a triarabinoside. We also obtained precise molecular masses for both intact and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride-deglycosylated PHRGPs (73.113 and 53.834 kDa) via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, representing the first HRGP to be analyzed by this method."
https://openalex.org/W2061341857,"Although calpain is ubiquitously present in human tissues and is thought to play a role in demyelination, its activity is very low in resting normal lymphocytes.

Our results indicate that activation of lymphoid cells results in de novo synthesis and secretion of calpain. INTRODUCTIONCalpains (EC 3.4.22.17) are neutral proteinases present in all cells. Their activation requires intracellular calcium levels much higher than those found in normal resting cells but similar to those that may be reached by calcium influx accompanying cell activation, suggesting that calpain expression in resting and activated states may be different. Among calpain's many substrates are myelin proteins including myelin basic protein (1Tsubata T. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (2Banik N.L. Chakrabarti A.K. Hogan E.L. Martenson R.E. Myelin Biology and Biochemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 571Google Scholar). We have reported previously that calpain isolated from several human lymphoid cell lines degrades myelin basic protein (3Deshpande R.V. Goust J.M. Banik N.L. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and may therefore play a role in the demyelination observed in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) ( 1The abbreviations used are: EAEexperimental allergic encephalomyelitisMSmultiple sclerosisINFinterferonFBSfetal bovine serumPMAphorbol myristate acetateDRB5,6-dichloro-1b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazoleCHXcycloheximidePBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellsLMEleucyl methyl esterμ-calpainmicro-calpainm-calpainmilli-calpainmAbmonoclonal antibodyPCRpolymerase chain reactionILinterleukinHTLVhuman T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus. )and multiple sclerosis (MS)(4Banik N.L. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1992; 16: 257-271Google Scholar). If calpain participates in lesion development, one of the sources may be the activated mononuclear cells infiltrating the diseased central nervous system, a proposal consistent with the occurrence, in the white matter of animals undergoing EAE, of perivenular monocytic infiltrates prior to demyelination. A remarkable characteristic of lesion-associated lymphoid cells in EAE and MS is their high level of activation, probably resulting from their encounter with myelin antigens(5Raine C.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1991; 17: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activated T cells may participate directly by secreting calpain and/or indirectly by producing interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which activates monocytes and stimulates their proteolytic activity, explaining why IFN-γ can induce relapses in MS patients (6Panich H.S. Hirsch R.L. Schinder J. Johnson K.P. Neurology. 1987; 37: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are no data available on quantitative studies of calpain expression in lymphoid cells. We have shown previously that calpain is present in extremely low levels in nonactivated lymphoid cells and that large numbers of cells are required to purify this enzyme in vitro(3Deshpande R.V. Goust J.M. Banik N.L. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The objective of this work was to study calpain expression at the RNA and protein levels during activation of lymphoid cells by (a) phorbol esters and calcium ionophores, (b) anti-CD3 antibody, and (c) IFN-γ, a physiological activator of monocytes. Our results show that calpain expression increases upon lymphoid cell stimulation and that stimulated lymphoid cells release calpain into the extracellular environment. A preliminary report of this work has been presented(7Deshpande R.V. Goust J.M. Banik N.L. Chakrabarti A.K. Hogan E.L. Trans. Am. Soc. Neurochem. 1992; 23: 158Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and ReagentsAll chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise.Cell LinesCCRF-CEM, MOLT-3, MOLT-4 (T lymphocytes, human leukemia), THP-1 and U-937 (monocyte-like, human histiocytic lymphoma) were obtained from ATCC. The B lymphocyte lines (M.R., D.S.) were established from normal individuals. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories), and gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (1.6 μg/ml). Cell cultures with at least 98% cell viability (tested with trypan blue) were chosen for experimental use. Loss of cell viability at the end of each experiment also was monitored and was less than 3%.Treatment of Cells with PMA and/or A23187Lymphoid cells (1-5 × 106/ml) were treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) (8Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Aller P. Yague E. Bernabeu C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and/or the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 μM) (9Nolfo R. Rankin J.A. Prostaglandins. 1989; 39: 157-165Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for 0.5-4 h in RPMI 1640 medium with or without 10% FBS. After completion of treatment, cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and used for calpain expression studies.Treatment of Cells with 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl Benzimidazole (DRB) and/or Cycloheximide (CHX)At least 107 cells were treated with the reversible inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, DRB (16 μM)(10Tamm I. Sehgal P.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1978; 22: 188-258Google Scholar), alone or in combination with PMA+A23187 in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 0.5-4 h. Cells were also treated with CHX (20 μg/ml) (11Efrat S. Kaempfer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) alone or in combination with either PMA+A23187 or DRB in serum-free medium. Simultaneously, one aliquot of cell suspension was activated with PMA+A23187. Control cells were left untreated. Some cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h; then DRB was added at 1 h and left with cells up to 4 h or was removed after 2 h, and cells were restimulated with PMA+A23187 up to 4 h. Some cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h; CHX was added with or without DRB at 1 h and left with cells up to 4 h or was removed after 2 h, and cells were restimulated with PMA+A23187 up to 4 h.Treatment of Cells with IFN-γ and DexamethasoneCells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and treated with recombinant human IFN-γ (125, 250, 500, 1,000 units/ml) (Cellular Products Inc.) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells were also treated with dexamethasone (50 nM) for 1 h and were left in culture with or without added IFN-γ (125 or 500 units/ml) for 48 h(12Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2863-2867PubMed Google Scholar).Treatment of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) with PMA, A23187, Leucyl Methyl Ester (LME), and Anti-CD3PBMC were isolated by density separation using Lymphoprep (Nyegard). Cells (4 × 106/ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and/or A23187 (5 mM) at 37°C for 24 h. An aliquot of cell suspension was treated with LME (5 mM) at 37°C for 30 min to eliminate monocytes(13Shau H. Golub S.H. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1136-1141PubMed Google Scholar, 14Thiele D.L. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1038-1048PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate experiment, PBMC (4 × 106) were cultured in the serum-free QBSF-51 medium at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Orthoclone OKT-3, a generous gift from the Ortho Corporation) at 37°C for 24 h.Production of Monoclonal AntibodyAn anti-calpain monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a 80-kDa subunit of m-calpain, using procedures described previously (15Wang I.Y. Feng S.H. Pollins S.J. Xu A.Y. Wang A.C. Hybridoma. 1988; 7: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The antibody reacted only with m-calpain and did not react with partially purified μ-calpain from erythrocytes.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for Detection of CalpainCells were lysed by ultrasonication in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4°C for 30 min, with vortexing every 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and diluted to a 0.05% final concentration of Triton X-100. In other experiments, cell supernatants were obtained after stimulation in serum-free medium. Microtiter wells were coated at 4°C for 24 h with cell lysates or supernatants (200 μl/well), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 1 h. The mouse anti-calpain monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) was added to all wells at 4°C for 24 h. After washing the wells, peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000) (ICN Biochemicals) was added at room temperature for 45 min. The substrate, a 0.03% solution of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 4, containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide, was added at room temperature for 30 min, and the color development was read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiscan spectrophotometer. The amount of calpain protein in samples was determined by using a standard curve generated by entering log (OD) versus log (calpain concentration) using serial dilutions (20 ng to 10 μg) of calpain standard antigen. In all experiments, the r2 (correlation coefficient) values of standard curves were 0.95-1.00 and p <0.001 to <0.01. The addition of calpastatin to calpain standards did not change mAb binding, indicating that this mAb was suitable for estimation of calpain protein in cell lysates in which some of the calpain could escape detection if bound to calpastatin.Construction of Calpain cDNA Probe by Reverse Transcriptase-PCRFive μg of rabbit brain RNA was reverse transcribed 42°C for 1 h using 200 units of reverse transcriptase and 50 pmol of the downstream primer (bases 1235-1256 of human m-calpain cDNA sequence)(16Chomczynski P.

Thermal cycling was for 35 cycles, 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 55°C, and 3 min at 72°C. The 650-base pair product was cloned into pBluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene) and sequenced.Slot Blots of Total Cellular RNANytran membrane (0.45-μm pore size) was presoaked in 20 × SSC prior to assembly of the Miniblot II slot blot system (Schleicher and Schuell). RNA samples (15-20 μg) were dissolved in 10 μl of sterile water, 20 μl of 100% formamide, 7 μl of 37% formamide, 20 μl of 20 × SSC, and 10 μg of carrier tRNA, incubated at 68°C for 5 min, and cooled. Four hundred μl of 10 × SSC was added, and the samples were loaded with gentle suction. Each sample was rinsed twice with 10 × SSC. Membranes were air dried, and the RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation (120J) in a Stratalinker model 1800 (Stratagene).Hybridization and AutoradiographyPrehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% and 5 × Denhardt's solution at 42°C. Calpain cDNA probe was radiolabeled (1 × 105 cpm/μl, 7 × 109 cpm/μg) (19Murachi T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 263-294PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hata A. Ohno S. Akita Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol.

Hybridized membranes were washed twice at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, and once in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC at 55°C. Autoradiograms were developed after 48 h. Analysis of the area and density of the bands on the autoradiograms was performed using Applescan and Image software programs. One unit of RNA was defined as a 6.45 × 10-4-cm2 area of a peak representing the intensity and width of a band on the autoradiogram measured by Image software program.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR for μ-Calpain mRNA ExpressionAnti-CD3-treated PBMC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total cellular RNA was isolated. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer). Total cellular RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed at 42°C for 1 h, using oligo(dT)16 (2.5 μM), and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl). Three-fourths of the reverse transcrption product was taken for PCR amplification with μ-calpain primers (0.5 μM each) and the remaining with β-actin primers (0.5 μM each) in a 50-ml reaction mixture containing 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and 0.2 μM [32P]dCTP. The primers used in the PCR reaction were: μ-calpain sense (bases 1514-1527), antisense (bases 2187-2210)(21Aoki K. Imajoh S. Ohno S. Emori Y. Koike M. Kosaki G. Suzuki K.

PCR amplification was performed using the following program: 95°C/1 min (1 cycle), 94°C/1 min, 60°C/1 min 15 s, 72°C/1 min 30 s (35 cycles), and 72°C/7 min (1 cycle). Equal amounts of PCR products were resolved on a 1.3% agarose gel. The PCR products were 697 and 538 base pairs for μ-calpain and β-actin, respectively. The gel was dried and exposed to the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the x-ray film (PDB-1, Kodak). Quantitative densitometry of product bands was performed on the PhosphorImager. Expression of μ-calpain was normalized to that of β-actin as an internal control.RESULTSEffect of PMA and/or A23187 on Intracellular Calpain Protein and mRNA Levels of Cells in Serum-supplemented MediumCalpain expression was first studied in cells stimulated with PMA and/or A23187 from 0.5 to 4 h in serum-supplemented medium (Table 1). A time-dependent increase in mRNA and intracellular calpain protein was observed in all cell lines. PMA and A23187 induced similar levels of calpain mRNA; however, at 4 h the amount of cytosolic calpain protein induced by A23187 was significantly greater (p = 0.028) than that induced by PMA (Table 2). The highest expression of calpain mRNA was observed by costimulation with PMA+A23187, although it was not significantly higher than that due to either reagent alone after 2 h of stimulation. In contrast, the amount of cytoplasmic calpain protein after costimulation with PMA+A23187 was significantly greater than that due to either reagent alone at all time points. The combined effects of PMA+A23187 were additive, not synergistic. In all cell lines, PMA treatment alone resulted in a 0.5-4-fold increase in calpain mRNA and 0.3-5-fold increase in intracellular calpain protein levels. A23187 treatment alone resulted in a 0.7-6-fold increase in calpain mRNA and 0.3-5.7-fold increase in intracellular calpain protein levels. As in most cell types, maximum stimulation (1-13-fold increase in calpain mRNA and 1.3-6.7-fold in intracellular calpain protein levels) was observed with PMA+A23187 costimulation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Strikingly, the increases in calpain mRNA and protein levels were unparallel. In the monocytic line U-937, induction of calpain mRNA was greater than that of intracellular protein for all durations of cell stimulation with PMA+A23187. Similarly, in the lymphocytic lines, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-3, M.R., and D.S., PMA+A23187 costimulation resulted in a greater increase in calpain mRNA when compared with that in intracellular protein within 2 h. The increase in the amount of calpain mRNA was at least 2-fold greater than that of intracellular calpain protein, raising a possibility that a significant amount of newly produced calpain may be released in the extracellular medium.Effect of PMA and A23187 Stimulation on Intracellular and Extracellular Calpain Protein and mRNA Levels of Cells in Serum-free MediumTo test the possibility of whether activated lymphoid cells might secrete calpain in the extracellular environment, cells were stimulated with PMA+A23187 for 0.5-4 h in serum-free culture medium, thereby eliminating reactivity of the mAb with FBS in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell lysates and extracellular media were tested for the presence of calpain protein. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Stimulation of MOLT-3, MOLT-4, M.R., THP-1, and U-937 cells with PMA+A23187 resulted in a time-dependent increase in expression of both calpain mRNA (0.6-18-fold) and intracellular protein (1-18-fold). Calpain (70 ng to 5.54 μg/106 cells) was also detected in the extracellular medium of nonactivated cells, and its levels increased severalfold (170 ng to 36 μg/106 cells) upon stimulation. The increase in extracellular calpain was also time-dependent. MOLT-3, MOLT-4, and M.R. cells showed greater levels of total (intracellular + extracellular) calpain protein than those of calpain mRNA at all time intervals. In contrast, the monocytic lines THP-1 and U-937, when activated, continued to show higher levels of calpain mRNA than protein, similar to what was observed previously with stimulation of these cells in serum-supplemented media.Figure 1Effect of PMA and A23187 on calpain mRNA and protein expression in lymphoid cells in serum-free medium. Cells were treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and A23187 (5 μM) for 0.5-4 h in RPMI 1640 medium devoid of fetal calf serum. Extracellular medium was recovered by centrifugation of the cell pellet and was studied for the presence of calpain protein (•). Cell lysates were examined for calpain mRNA (•) and intracellular protein (•) expression. The sum of calpain protein contents in cell lysates and extracellular media was taken as total calpain protein content (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of DRB on Calpain ExpressionIn nonstimulated MOLT-3, MOLT-4, M.R., and U-937 cells, DRB reduced calpain mRNA expression by 60-67% in 4 h, but by only 10% in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2). In the lymphocytic lines (MOLT-3, MOLT-4, M.R.) and the monocytic line (U-937) DRB reduced calpain protein levels by 63-95% in 4 h. Calpain production in THP-1 cells was inhibited minimally (10-21%) by DRB. In stimulated cells, treatment with DRB for 4 h uniformly reduced calpain mRNA levels by 65-93% and protein levels by 55-80% in all cell lines (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of DRB on calpain mRNA levels was much greater in nonactivated cells, whereas its effect on total calpain protein levels was much greater in activated cells.Figure 2Effect of DRB on calpain expression in lymphoid cells in serum-free medium. Cells were activated with (PMA, 10 ng/ml + A23187, 5 μM) (▄-▄) for 0.5-4 h in RPMI 1640 medium devoid of fetal calf serum. Control cells were left untreated (⊡-⊡). Cells were treated with DRB (16 μM) alone (▄- - - - -▄) or in combination with (PMA+A23187) (•-•). Cells were preactivated with (PMA+A23187) for 1 h, DRB was added 1 h later and left with the cells up to 4 h (▵-▵) or was removed at 2 h, and cells were restimulated with (PMA+A23187) up to 4 h (○-○). Extracellular medium was recovered by centrifugation of the cell pellet and was studied for the presence of calpain protein. Cell lysates were examined for calpain mRNA and intracellular protein expression. The sum of calpain protein contents in cell lysates and extracellular media was taken as total calpain protein content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the cells were first activated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h and then treated with DRB for 1-3 h, DRB reduced the expression of calpain mRNA by 9-64%, intracellular calpain protein by 23-54%, extracellular calpain protein by 11-66%, and total (intracellular + extracellular) calpain protein by 24-58% in comparison with that in PMA+A23187-activated cells that were not treated with DRB. The inhibitory effect of DRB was reversible. After its removal, followed by restimulation with PMA+A23187, calpain mRNA and intracellular calpain protein levels increased again by 2.5-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. The amount of extracellular calpain protein increased by 4.3-fold and that of total (intracellular + extracellular) calpain protein by 1.6-fold. However, in these cells calpain expression did not reach the peak levels seen in activated cells not treated with DRB.Effect of CHX on Calpain ExpressionTHP-1 cells were treated with CHX in the presence or absence of DRB and/or PMA+A23187 in serum-free media for 0.5-4 h. In nonactivated cells, CHX alone reduced calpain mRNA levels by 40% and total (intracellular + extracellular) calpain protein levels by 55% in 4 h (Fig. 3A). This decrease was greater than that observed with DRB treatment alone. CHX, in combination with DRB, reduced calpain mRNA levels by 50% and total calpain protein levels by 65%. When cells were activated with PMA+A23187 during CHX treatment, calpain mRNA expression increased 2.3-fold, and total calpain protein expression increased 3-fold in 4 h compared with that in cells that were not activated with PMA+A23187 during CHX treatment (Fig. 3B). However, in CHX-treated cells, calpain mRNA levels were 22-fold lower and total calpain protein levels were 3-fold lower than those in cells activated with PMA+A23187 but not treated with CHX. CHX treatment did not lead to superinduction of calpain mRNA at any time point. When cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h and then treated with CHX for 1 h, calpain mRNA expression decreased by 36%, and total calpain protein levels decreased by 24% at the end of the 2nd h in comparison with preactivated cells that were not treated with CHX. In another set of experiments, cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h; subsequently, CHX was added to cell culture for 1 h, the inhibitors were then removed, and cells were reactivated with PMA+A23187 for 2 h. Removal of CHX and restimulation of cells resulted in an 11.5% increase in calpain mRNA and 22.3% increase in total calpain protein. Although these levels of calpain expression were lower than those in cells that were not treated with CHX, the increased expression after removal of CHX indicated resumption of calpain synthesis.Figure 3Panel A, effect of CHX on calpain expression in nonactivated THP-1 cells. Cells were treated with CHX (20 μg/ml) alone (▴) or in combination with DRB (16 μM) (○) for 0.5-4 h in RPMI 1640 medium devoid of fetal calf serum. Control cells were left untreated (⊡). Extracellular medium was studied for the presence of calpain protein. Cell lysates were examined for calpain mRNA and intracellular protein expression. The sum of calpain protein contents in cell lysates and extracellular media was taken as total calpain protein content. Panel B, effect of CHX and DRB on calpain expression in activated THP-1 cells. Cells were activated with (PMA: 10 ng/ml + A23187: 5 μM) (▄) in the presence of CHX (20 μg/ml) (•) or of (CHX: 20 μg/ml + DRB: 16 μM) (|) for 0.5-4 h in RPMI 1640 medium devoid of fetal calf serum. Control cells were left untreated (⊡). Cells were preactivated with (PMA+A23187) for 1 h, CHX was added at 1 h and left with cells up to 4 h (○) or was removed at 2 h, and cells were restimulated with (PMA+A23187) up to 4 h (▵). Expression of calpain mRNA and protein was studied as before.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In PMA+A23187-activated cells, CHX alone reduced calpain mRNA levels by 96% and total (intracellular + extracellular) calpain protein levels by 76% in 4 h (Fig. 3B). CHX, in combination with DRB, reduced calpain mRNA levels in these cells by 96% and total calpain protein levels by 81%. When cells were activated with PMA+A23187 during CHX+DRB treatment, calpain mRNA and total protein expression increased 2-fold in 4 h compared with that in cells that were not activated with PMA+A23187 during CHX+DRB treatment (Fig. 3B). However, in CHX-treated cells, calpain mRNA and total calpain protein were much lower (28- and 4-fold, respectively) than in activated cells not treated with inhibitors. When cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h and then treated with CHX+DRB for 1 h, calpain mRNA expression decreased by 78%, and total calpain protein levels decreased by 50% in comparison with preactivated cells that were not further treated with inhibitors. In a separate set of experiments, cells were preactivated with PMA+A23187 for 1 h and subsequently treated with both inhibitors for 1 h which were removed at that time, and the cells were activated again with PMA+A23187 for 2 h. Removal of the inhibitors and restimulation resulted in an 36% increase in calpain mRNA and 10% increase in total calpain protein.Effect of IFN-γ and Dexamethasone on Calpain ExpressionIFN-γ is a direct activator of monocytes. It is known to enhance neopterin secretion by PBMC, a diagnostic indicator of monocyte activation in malignancies, allograft rejection, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases, and dexamethasone augments this effect of IFN-γ(12Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2863-2867PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IFN-γ and/or dexamethasone affects calpain expression, THP-1 and U-937 cells were treated with IFN-γ (125-1,000 units/ml) for 24-72 h. Stimulation of cells with IFN-γ resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in calpain mRNA (Fig. 4). The greatest increase in calpain mRNA levels (7-fold for THP-1 and 8-fold for U-937) was observed in cells stimulated with 1,000 units/ml IFN-γ for 72 h. IFN-γ also increased intracellular calpain protein levels in THP-1 and U-937 cells. In THP-1 cells, these levels increased 4.1-fold in 48 h with 500 units/ml IFN-γ and then dropped for all IFN-γ concentrations. In U-937 cells, these levels increased 11.9-fold in 48 h with 250 units/ml IFN-γ. For both cell lines, calpain protein levels reached peak levels at 48 h.

Similar effects were obtained with serotonin, which in the choroid plexus stimulates phosphoinositide turnover, thereby activating protein kinase C. Serotonin (10 μM) increased by about 10-fold the amount of phosphorylated Na+,K+-ATPase and significantly reduced its activity.

PKR has two distinct kinase activities: 1) an autophosphorylation activity that requires the presence of dsRNA and results in the phosphorylation of several serine residues within PKR and 2) dsRNA-independent phosphorylation of substrates by phosphorylated, activated PKR(4Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best known substrate for PKR is the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) whose phosphorylation results in the global shutdown of protein synthesis(5Farrel P. Balkow K. Hunt T.

Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The PKR genes from human, mouse, and rat all share a high degree of homology within these domains and have the same overall domain structure. Furthermore, several other dsRNA-binding proteins from a wide variety of organisms also share this domain(19St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These include the human TAR-binding protein, Escherichia coli RNase III, Drosophila staufen protein, vaccinia virus E3L protein, Xenopus RNA binding protein A, and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe pac1 protein. These dsRNA binding domains contain many basic amino acids and have a high probability of forming α helices.Domain I in human PKR has been found to be essential for the binding of dsRNA while domain II was not absolutely required(14Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More refined approaches have clarified the dsRNA binding motifs further. Feng et al.(15Feng G.S. Chong K.C. Kumar A. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) utilized block deletion analysis to show that the deletion of amino acids 39-50 or 58-69 resulted in an almost complete loss of dsRNA binding ability (3% of wild type). Green and Mathews (14Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) used linker scanning mutagenesis, in which blocks of 3 amino acids were mutated to Gly-Ala-Leu, to perform a detailed study of the PKR N-terminal region and found that the mutants that had the most deleterious effects to binding were clustered around domain I. McCormack et al.(20McCormack S.J. Ortega L.G. Doohan J.P. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1994; 198: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) found that the mutation of lysine 64 to glutamic acid totally ablated dsRNA binding.While these studies provided a general outline of the dsRNA binding domain, they did not identify the individual residues that may be important for binding dsRNA. In order to more fully understand the structure-function relationship in the binding of PKR to dsRNA, we investigated the contribution of individual amino acids to dsRNA binding. Utilizing both alanine-scanning and random mutagenesis, we found 2 critical residues that were absolutely required for dsRNA binding (glycine 57 and lysine 60). Mutations of 2 additional residues (lysine 64 and leucine 75) resulted in less than 10% binding compared to wild type. We also identified a number of other residues that affected dsRNA binding to various degrees. In vitro and in vivo functional assays of the various mutants using bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell expression systems confirmed the importance of these residues for PKR function.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutagenesis of PKRSite-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of Deng and Nickoloff(21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 selection and 11 mutant oligonucleotides (21-24-mers) were synthesized. The selection oligonucleotide (5′-GATTATCCCTCGGAATTAC-3′) mutates the unique NcoI site 289 base pairs downstream from the PKR ATG and changes methionine 98 to leucine. Each mutant oligonucleotide along with the selection oligonucleotide (50 ng each) was added to 200 ng of PKR cDNA (cloned into pBluescript KS-) and annealed by brief boiling followed by cooling on ice. Following annealing, the DNA strands were elongated and ligated using T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase before being transformed into the E. coli strain mutS (thi, supE, Δ(lac-proAB), [mutS::Tn10][F′proAB, lacq ZΔM15]), which is deficient for mismatch repair. Transformants were pooled and plasmid DNA was digested with NcoI before being transformed into E. coli strain DH5α. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm mutagenesis.For random mutagenesis, a modification of the method of Busby et al.(22Busby S. Irani M. Crombrugghe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, a 1 μg/ml solution of PKR cDNA encoding the first 183 amino acids of PKR cloned into the yeast expression vector pEMBLyex4 was treated with 1 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mM EDTA for 4 h at 75°C. Hydroxylamine reacts with dsDNA to create N-4-hydroxycytosine which, upon plasmid replication, results in cytosine-to-thymine and guanine-to-adenine substitutions. This protocol yielded mutations at a frequency of 3% as measured by uracil auxotrophy. The mutagenized DNA was transformed directly into the yeast strain H86 as described previously(13Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and loss of dsRNA binding was measured as a result of the inability to inhibit PKR activity.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationLinearized plasmid DNA (5 μg) was transcribed in vitro with phage T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and the complementary RNA yield was measured at A260. For in vitro translation, 1 μg of RNA was mixed with 35 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (at 40 units/μl), 1 μl of 1 mM amino acids mixture (minus methionine), 4 μl of [35S]methionine at 10 μCi (370 kBq)/ml, and H2O to 50 μl. The reaction was performed at 30°C for 60 min.Purification of Bacterially Expressed PKRFor wild type PKR, the cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the NdeI/BamHI site of the expression vector pET15b (Novagen Inc). For mutant PKRs, the HindIII/PstI fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of the vector pET15b and transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed bacteria (500 ml) were grown to A600 = 0.6 before gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to 2 mM, and incubation continued for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g and resuspended in 8 ml of binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). Cells were lysed by sonication (5 × 60 s at 20,000 cycles), the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before being loaded upon a nickel-agarose column. The histidine-tagged PKR protein was eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions and concentrated using a Centricon®-3 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon Inc.) prior to gel filtration chromatography on a Superose-12 FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The PKR fractions were pooled, diluted in buffer DBGA (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 20% glycerol, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), concentrated by ultrafiltration as above, and stored at −80°C.Activation AssaysPKR protein (∼400 ng) was brought up to a volume of 30 μl in buffer DBGA before the addition of 20 μl of buffer DBGB (DBGA plus 2.5 mM MnCl2) and [γ-32P]ATP (50 Ci/mmol) to 2 mM for a final volume of 60 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 15 min before the addition of SDS loading buffer and then boiled for 3 min prior to loading on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography.Poly(I):Poly(C) Binding AssayIn vitro translated products were tested for poly(I):poly(C) binding using poly(I):poly(C)-agarose (Pharmacia). In vitro translated protein (5 μl) was added to 50 μl of poly(I):poly(C)-agarose beads, which had previously been washed three times in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). The beads and protein were incubated at 30°C for 60 min with intermittent mixing before being washed three times in 1 ml of binding buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by densitometery of autoradiographs. The percentage of bound protein was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of protein added in the assay (5 μl).Expression of PKR Mutants in YeastMutant PKR cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pEMBLyex4 and expressed in S. cerevisiae as described previously(13Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids were transformed into the haploid yeast strain W303a and grown at 30°C on agar plates containing synthetic medium lacking uracil and with 2% glucose as the sole carbon source. Transformants were then grown to stationary phase in liquid synthetic media containing 0.1% glucose and lacking uracil. Following washing, the cells were resuspended to A600 = 0.1 in synthetic media containing 2% galactose and lacking uracil, and incubation continued at 30°C. At various time intervals, cell growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm and by direct cell counting.Immunopurification of PKR from YeastYeast cells (20 ml) expressing mutant PKR proteins were harvested 24 h after induction of PKR with galactose by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Protein was extracted using the glass bead technique as described(23Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley, New York1994: 13.13.4Google Scholar).Expression in Mammalian CellsThe reporter plasmid used was pBI which contained the NF-κB enhancer site from the human tumor necrosis factor α promotor (positions 635 to 621 as a single copy in the forward orientation) (24Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedopasor S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) upstream of the minimal tk promoter driving the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Mutant PKR cDNAs were cloned into the vector pcDNA1neo (Invitrogen) and expressed constitutively under the cytomegalovirus promoter. The vector RSV-βgal was used to standardize transfection efficiency. The plasmids were transiently transfected into RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage) cells, previously starved for 4 h with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, with the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (8Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of both pBI and pcDNA1neo-PKR plasmid and 5 μg of RSV-βgal plasmid per 5 × 106 cells. Following 24 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium replaced with or without poly(I):poly(C) (100 μg/ml). The cells were incubated for an additional 8 h before being harvested in 1 ml of TEN (40 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl) and centrifuged in a Microfuge at 14,000 × g for 10 s and 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 M Tris, pH 8, and sonicated at 20,000 cycles for 10 s. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were used for both CAT (nonchromatographic) and β-galactosidase assays as described previously(25Kimura A. Israel A. Le Bail O. Kourilsky P. Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).RESULTSAlanine Scanning Mutagenesis of PKRWe and others have previously identified two conserved dsRNA binding motifs located within the N-terminal half of PKR(13Chong K.L.

The most conserved regions of these domains are found in two 20-21 amino acid stretches, comprising residues 55-75 and 145-165 of human PKR. Alignment of the human, mouse, and rat PKR protein sequences identified a core motif within the dsRNA binding domain (Fig. 1A). Among these three proteins, 17 out of 20 amino acids are conserved while 15 out of 20 are identical. Using this information we designed 11 alanine-scanning mutants (Table 1) and tested each for the ability to bind dsRNA. Alanine was chosen as a substitute because it eliminates the amino acid side chain beyond the β-carbon without altering the main chain conformation (as a glycine or proline substitution would). Furthermore, alanine would not impose large steric or electrostatic effects and has an intermediate hydrophobicity.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Mutant proteins were synthesized using in vitro transcription/translation reactions (using [35S]methionine) and then tested for dsRNA binding activity using poly(I):poly(C) agarose in the presence of high salt (300 mM NaCl) as described previously(16Patel R. Sen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were analyzed by taking input protein as 100% and comparing the amount bound as a percentage of input. Interestingly, the mutant G57A migrated with an electrophoretic mobility 5-6 kDa less than that of wild type and all other mutant proteins (Fig. 2A, lane G57A). As with all mutants, sequencing was performed to confirm the correct mutation, and, in the case of G57A, three independent experiments yielded the same result. Green and Mathews (14Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have previously noted a similar phenomenon with a mutant that changed residues 58-60 from Arg-Ser-Lys to Gly-Ala-Lys.Figure 2Poly(I):poly(C) binding assays of PKR mutants.

The mutant kinase proteins from A (5 μl) were added to poly(I):poly(C) agarose beads and incubated at 30°C for 30 min before extensive washing with binding buffer. Bound protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Quantitation is presented in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results of the binding assay showed a marked variation in the dsRNA binding abilities of the mutants (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Two mutants were totally deficient in binding (G57A and K60A) while two others (K64A and L75A) had binding efficiencies below 10% of wild type. Four other mutants had intermediate binding activities (S59A, K61A, E62A, and K69A) ranging from 28-68%, while three mutations had no effect on binding as compared to wild type (G55A, V72A, and E73A). The importance to dsRNA binding of the basic lysine residues at positions 60 and 64, but not 61 or 69, indicates that not all lysine residues contribute equally to binding.Random Mutagenesis of PKRThe region of homology among the various dsRNA-binding proteins extends beyond domains I and II (19St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) although the homologies within these regions are low. Patel et al.(26Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18593-18598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that certain amino acids outside the core domains are important to dsRNA binding, most likely by contributing to protein stability rather than directly to binding. To investigate the possibility that these other conserved residues play a role in dsRNA binding, we randomly mutagenized the entire dsRNA binding region of human PKR. DNA encoding the first 183 amino acids of PKR was cloned into the yeast expression vector pEMBLyex4 and treated with N-4-hydroxycytosine to induce random mutations.Previous work from our laboratory had shown that the expression of PKR in an inducible yeast cell system resulted in a growth suppressor phenotype which could be reversed by co-expressing the N-terminal half of PKR(13Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this dominant-negative phenotype occurs is thought to involve the sequestering of dsRNA, thus depriving wild type PKR of an activating species. Hence, by co-expressing mutant N-terminal PKR with the wild type protein, we could assay for plasmids that no longer suppressed PKR activity. Using this approach, we analyzed 900 colonies, of which 64 gave a growth phenotype, a mutation rate of 7.1%. Sequencing of these 64 mutants revealed 7 which contained detectable amino acid mutations (Table 2).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Two of the 7 random mutations, A63V and L75F, fell within domain I. Both alanine 63 and leucine 75 are highly conserved among dsRNA binding proteins (Fig. 1) and therefore would be expected to be critical to binding. The latter result confirms data from the alanine scanning mutations (Fig. 2) which indicated that leucine 75 is a critical amino acid for dsRNA binding. The other random mutations fall outside the highly conserved core domain, indicating that these regions also contribute to the ability to bind dsRNA. Three of the seven mutants were found to contain the same mutation (R40S). Arginine 40 is conserved among PKR genes but not among the other dsRNA binding proteins, although there appears to be a requirement for a basic amino acid at position 39(19St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The two other random mutant sites (V24G and S83C) are not conserved in the dsRNA binding proteins and perhaps involve changes in secondary structure.Functional Assays of MutantsIn order to test whether the loss of the ability to bind to dsRNA correlated with the loss of activation, three of the most severely affected mutants (G57A, K60A, and K64A) along with wild type PKR were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET15b and expressed as polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. The various PKR proteins were purified from crude bacterial lysates by nickel affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration FPLC using a Superose-12 column and tested in activation assays (Fig. 3). Coomassie staining of the purified proteins confirmed that equal amounts of PKR were present in each sample (Fig. 3A). Wild type PKR was active while the mutant PKRs were all profoundly deficient in their ability to become activated (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the ability to bind dsRNA is directly related to the ability to become activated. It should be noted that no dsRNA was added into this activation assay as it was found to increase activity only marginally. ( 3N. A. J. McMillan, B. W. Carpick, B. Hollis, W. M. Toone, M. Zamanian-Daryoush, and B. R. G. Williams, unpublished observation. )The fact that wild type PKR is activated in the absence of dsRNA is a phenomenon that has previously been observed with GST-PKR fusion proteins expressed in bacteria and may be due to PKR activation by bacterial dsRNA or incorrect folding of the fusion protein(8Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The GST-PKR response to dsRNA was able to be restored by denaturation/renaturation indicating that changes in secondary structure may accompany activation. ( 4A. Kumar and B. R. G. Williams, unpublished observation. )Figure 3Activation assays of bacterially expressed PKR mutants.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that α7 adopts a predominantly α-helical structure in methanol, similar to what has been found for α5, and consistent with its structure in the intact molecule.

Resonance energy transfer measurements between fluorescently labeled pairs of donor (NBD)/acceptor (rhodamine) peptides revealed that, in their membrane-bound state, α5 self-associates but α7 does not, and that α5 coassembles with α7 but not with an unrelated membrane bound α-helical peptide. Furthermore, resonance energy transfer experiments, using α5 segments, specifically labeled in either the N- or C-terminal sides, suggest a parallel organization of α5 monomers within the membranes. Taken together the results are consistent with an umbrella model suggested for the pore forming activity of δ-endotoxin (Li, J., Caroll, J., and Ellar, D.

https://openalex.org/W2032865144,"Uptake of inositol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a specific inositol permease encoded by the ITR1 gene. Removal of inositol from the growth medium results in an increase in ITR1 mRNA abundance. The increase in ITR1 mRNA is accompanied by an increase in de novo synthesis of the Itr1 permease leading to an increased capacity for uptake. When inositol is added to the growth medium inactivation of uptake activity occurs, and both transcription of ITR1 and uptake activity are repressed to a basal level of function. The transcriptional regulation of ITR1 depends on the INO2, INO4, and OPI1 genes. In addition, repression is also achieved by regulation of ITR1 expression at the post-translational level. In this study, we show that there is a change in the stability of the Itr1 permease after the addition of inositol to the growth medium. Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against an epitope attached to the Itr1 permease showed that the addition of inositol causes a dramatic increase in the rate of degradation of the permease. After the repressed (basal) level is achieved, turnover continues to be rapid. The increased rate of degradation was also observed in strains with mutations that block conjugation to ubiquitin. Degradation was not observed in strains defective in the END3/END4 endocytic pathway or in the production of vacuolar proteases (PEP4). Thus, inactivation of the Itr1 permease is accompanied by endocytic internalization followed by degradation in the vacuole. Inactivation may be a separate process that precedes and signals endocytic degradation. Since the end3/end4 mutations did not affect uptake activity under derepressed conditions, endocytosis is not required for normal inositol uptake. Uptake of inositol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a specific inositol permease encoded by the ITR1 gene. Removal of inositol from the growth medium results in an increase in ITR1 mRNA abundance. The increase in ITR1 mRNA is accompanied by an increase in de novo synthesis of the Itr1 permease leading to an increased capacity for uptake. When inositol is added to the growth medium inactivation of uptake activity occurs, and both transcription of ITR1 and uptake activity are repressed to a basal level of function. The transcriptional regulation of ITR1 depends on the INO2, INO4, and OPI1 genes. In addition, repression is also achieved by regulation of ITR1 expression at the post-translational level.

HSF1 exists in unstressed cells in an inactive form, which is converted to the DNA binding form upon exposure of cells to elevated temperature. We have developed a protocol for isolation of the non-DNA binding form of recombinant mouse HSF1, involving expression and affinity purification of HSF1 as a fusion with the glutathione S-transferase protein in Escherichia coli, followed by specific protease cleavage to release pure HSF1 protein. We report here that the purified inactive HSF1 can be converted to the DNA binding form by heat treatment in vitro. Chemical cross-linking analysis demonstrates that this conversion is accompanied by oligomerization of HSF1 from a monomeric to a trimeric native structure, similar to that observed for HSF1 in heat-shocked cells. These results indicate that elements residing in the HSF1 polypeptide are sufficient both for maintenance of this factor in the non-DNA binding form and for its heat-induced conversion to the DNA binding form and support a role for HSF1 as the “molecular thermostat” in eukaryotic cells, which senses adverse environmental conditions and activates the cellular stress response.

One important question regarding the regulation of the cellular stress response is the mechanism by which HSF1 is maintained in the non-DNA binding form in unstressed cells. A C-terminal leucine zipper motif in human HSF1 has been shown to be important for maintaining this factor in the non-DNA binding form, apparently via its interactions with the N-terminal leucine zipper oligomerization domain, thus inhibiting the trimerization of HSF1, which is a prerequisite for DNA binding activity (11Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 12Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism that controls HSF1 DNA binding is inherent in the structure of the HSF1 polypeptide. However, a number of observations have suggested that other molecules may be involved in regulating HSF1 DNA binding activity. Overexpression of HSF1 in mouse NIH 3T3 cells results in constitutive trimerization and DNA binding activity of this factor, supporting a role for a titratable negative regulator in controlling HSF1 activity(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that hsp70 may be involved in regulating HSF1 DNA binding activity, providing support for the existence of a negative feedback loop for the regulation of the cellular stress response (13DiDomenico B.J.

Evidence exists for a similar mechanism for control of bacterial heat shock protein expression, involving interaction of dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE with the bacterial heat shock transcription factor σ-32(19Straus D.

A. 1992; 89: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the results of a recent study, while supporting a role for hsp70 in deactivation of HSF trimers during attenuation of the cellular stress response, failed to observe any effect of hsp70 on either the temperature set point or magnitude of HSF activation(23Rabindran S.K. Wisniewski J. Li L. Li G.C. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A second fundamental question is the identity of the “cellular thermometer” responsible for sensing elevated temperature and the nature of the signal transduction mechanism that converts this sensing event into activation of HSF1 DNA binding (reviewed in Refs. 14 and 15). Although a number of hypotheses have been put forward concerning this mechanism, the central question of whether HSF1 can directly sense elevated temperature or whether another molecule serves as the sensor and then relays the signal to HSF1 has not been answered. In order to directly address these questions, we have devised a protocol for purification of the non-DNA binding form of recombinant mouse HSF1 following expression in Escherichia coli. We have shown that this purified HSF1 can be converted to the trimeric, DNA binding form by heat treatment in vitro. These results indicate that other proteins are not required for maintenance of HSF1 in the inactive form or for its conversion to the active DNA binding form in response to heat treatment. These results implicate HSF1 as the “molecular thermostat” of the cellular stress response, capable of sensing and responding to elevations in cellular temperature by oligomerization to the trimeric DNA binding form. The mouse HSF1 coding sequence was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector(24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 25Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). DH-1 strain E. coli carrying the GST-HSF1 plasmid were grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 33°C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until they reached a density of 0.6 O.D., after which expression of the GST-HSF1 fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to the medium. After growth for an additional 3 h at 33°C, cells were spun down and washed with PBS, recentrifuged, and the pellets (50-ml culture equivalents) quick frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80°C until use. For purification of the GST-HSF1 fusion protein, pellets were removed from −80°C storage and resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold Buffer D (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA). All microcentrifuge tubes used in the purification protocol were silanized by placing them under vacuum with a vial of dimethyldichlorosilane in chloroform for 12 h. Resuspended cells were lysed by 2 × 5-s pulses of sonication at 25% full energy (55 milliwatts) with 30 s of chilling between pulses in an ice/ethanol bath using a model W220 ultrasonic cell disruptor from Heat Systems (Farmingdale, NY). After pelleting insoluble material by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C, a 200-μl aliquot of the extract was diluted with 400 μl of PBS containing 0.2 M NaCl (PBS/0.2 M) and incubated with 200 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sulfo-linked, Sigma) at 4°C for 1 h with constant inversion mixing. The glutathione-agarose beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS/0.2 M and finally resuspended in 100 μl of PBS/0.2 M supplemented with CaCl2 to a concentration of 5 mM. Thrombin (human, Sigma) was then added to a concentration of 7.5 ng/μl (0.02 units/μl), and cleavage was carried out at 20°C for 1 h with constant inversion mixing. Cleavage of the fusion protein yields an HSF1 polypeptide with the N-terminal sequence, N-Gly-Ser-Pro-Met-, where Met is the beginning of the predicted natural HSF1 sequence(25Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cleaved HSF1 polypeptide was separated by centrifugation and used for the experiments described below. We identified several parameters that are important for obtaining purified HSF1 in the non-DNA binding form. The first parameter is the growth temperature of the E. coli in which the GST-HSF1 fusion protein is expressed. From cells grown in an incubator with a chamber temperature of 33°C, we were consistently able to obtain purified HSF1 in the non-DNA binding form, which could be activated to the DNA binding form by heat treatment in vitro. Growth at lower temperatures such as 30°C gave similar results as for 33°C, although lower levels of heat-inducible DNA binding activity were observed, perhaps due to lower amounts of fusion protein expression in these cells. Higher growth temperatures, such as 37°C, typically yielded purified HSF1 that had significant constitutive DNA binding activity. Another important parameter is the method used to lyse the bacteria. The sonication conditions we employ released the highest levels of GST-HSF1 from the bacteria without causing the appearance of constitutive DNA binding activity. Conditions more rigorous than these, employing either higher energy bursts of sonication or bursts of longer duration, yielded significantly higher levels of constitutive DNA binding activity. Purified HSF1 (20 ng/reaction) was incubated at various temperatures for 30 min and then subjected to gel mobility shift analysis as described previously (4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) using a 32P-end-labeled HSE oligonucleotide. Following electrophoresis on native 4% polyacrylamide gels, HSF1-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Purified HSF1 (20 ng/reaction) was incubated at 22 or 32°C for 30 min and then cross-linked using ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS, Pierce) at final concentrations of 0.1 or 0.5 mM EGS. Cross-linking reactions were incubated at 22°C for 30 min and then quenched by addition of glycine to 75 mM. The reactions were run on a SDS-PAGE gel (5% resolving gel), and HSF1 cross-linked products were visualized by Western blot analysis using HSF1 polyclonal antibodies(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). As discussed above, two important questions in the regulation of the cellular stress response are the mechanisms involved in the control and activation of HSF1 DNA binding in unstressed and heat-treated cells, respectively. In order to provide a system with which to directly examine these mechanisms, we set out to devise a protocol for purification of the non-DNA binding form of HSF1. We chose to express HSF1 as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli because this expression system yields high levels of protein in a readily purifiable form(24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The GST-HSF1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli grown at 33°C, purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose, and then cleaved with thrombin while still bound to the glutathione-agarose, in order to release pure HSF1 protein while leaving the 26-kDa GST sequence on the affinity resin. Fig. 1 shows that the purified HSF1 migrates on an SDS-PAGE gel as a single band of approximately 67 kDa. We first wanted to determine whether the purified HSF1 existed in the non-DNA binding form, and if so, whether it could be converted to the DNA binding form by heat treatment in vitro, as has been shown for HSF1 in crude cytosolic extracts of non-heat-shocked mouse and human cells(26Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, purified HSF1 protein was incubated at various temperatures for 30 min and then subjected to gel mobility shift assay. Because we could not predict which temperatures would induce the DNA binding activity of the purified HSF1, the initial analysis examined temperatures over a broad range. Fig. 2A shows the results obtained for HSF1 purified from bacteria grown at 30°C. Little DNA binding activity was observed following incubation of purified HSF1 at 22 or 27°C, but high levels of binding activity were induced by treatment at 32°C, followed by diminishing levels in extracts incubated at 37 and 42°C. Identical results were obtained using HSF1 protein purified from E. coli grown at a chamber temperature of 33°C (Fig. 2B). Since we consistently obtained higher yields of purified protein from cells grown at 33°C than cells grown at 30°C, subsequent experiments were performed using HSF1 purified from bacteria grown at the higher temperature. To precisely determine the threshold temperature for activation of DNA binding, purified HSF1 (from the same cells used for the experiment shown in Fig. 2B) was incubated at temperatures between 30 and 35°C, using 1°C increments, and then subjected to gel shift analysis. Fig. 3 shows that purified HSF1 exhibits a relatively sharp temperature profile of DNA binding activation, with an apparent threshold temperature of 32°C, similar levels of DNA binding activity at 33°C, and diminishing levels at 34°C.Figure 3Threshold temperature for induction of purified HSF1 DNA binding activity. The experiment was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 except that aliquots of purified HSF1 were incubated at temperatures varying by 1°C increments between 30 and 35°C. The closedtriangle indicates HSF1 DNA binding activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of HSF1 DNA binding in heat-treated eukaryotic cells is accompanied by oligomerization of this factor from a monomeric form to a trimeric form(4Sarge K.D.

Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine if purified HSF1 undergoes a similar change in oligomeric state during activation of DNA binding in vitro, purified protein was incubated at 22 or 32°C for 30 min and then subjected to chemical cross-linking analysis using EGS. The results, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrate that no cross-linking products are observed in samples of purified HSF1 incubated at 22°C. Identical results were obtained for HSF1 in extracts of unstressed mouse NIH 3T3 cells(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), suggesting that the non-DNA binding form of purified recombinant HSF1, like its natural counterpart in mouse cells, is comprised primarily of monomeric HSF1. However, cross-linking of purified HSF1 incubated at 32°C yields products whose sizes are consistent with dimeric (0.1 mM EGS) and trimeric (0.5 mM EGS) HSF1 complexes. These results are identical to those obtained for HSF1 in extracts of heat-shocked mouse NIH 3T3 cells(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), indicating that activation of DNA binding of purified HSF1 is also accompanied by oligomerization to a trimeric native structure. The results presented above suggest that elements residing in the primary amino acid sequence of the HSF1 polypeptide are sufficient both for maintenance of HSF1 in the monomeric non-DNA binding form and for activation of this factor to the trimeric DNA binding form in response to heat treatment. These data support a role for HSF1 as the “molecular thermostat” of the cellular stress response, a protein capable of sensing and responding to elevation of cellular temperature by undergoing oligomerization to the trimeric DNA binding form. Our findings are consistent with a previously postulated mechanism for HSF activation involving stress-induced disruption of an interaction between a C-terminally located sequence and the N-terminal oligomerization domain, thus allowing formation of the trimeric DNA binding form(11Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 12Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results do not rule out the potential role of other proteins, most notably hsps, in formation of the inactive HSF1 state, in modulating the temperature set point, kinetics, or magnitude of activation of HSF1 DNA binding in eukaryotic cells, or in converting active trimeric HSF1 back to the inactive monomeric form during attenuation of the cellular stress response(16Abravaya K.A. Myers M. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 17Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In fact, the observed threshold temperature of 32°C for activation of purified HSF1 DNA binding indicates that other factors must be involved in modulating the temperature set point of HSF1 activation in eukaryotic cells, which typically occurs at temperatures above 41°C. One simple explanation is that the protein constituency of eukaryotic cells creates a biochemical environment that stabilizes HSF1 conformation, so that higher temperatures are required to trigger the activation process. This possibility is consistent with results demonstrating that HSF activation temperature is modulated by the biochemical environment of the cell in which it is expressed(29Clos J. Rabindran R. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Nature. 1993; 364: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although our results are consistent with a mechanism in which heat directly acts on the HSF1 protein to activate its DNA binding activity, they are not inconsistent with other potential mechanisms for HSF1 activation in eukaryotic cells. For example, there is substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that stress-induced denaturation of proteins, and not heat perse, is the signal that triggers HSF1 activation(30Kelley P.M. Schlesinger M.J. Cell. 1978; 15: 1277-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 31Hightower L.E. J. Cell.

How could protein denaturation cause HSF1 activation? One possibility is that protein hydrophobic domains exposed during heat-induced protein denaturation directly act on HSF1 to convert it to the DNA binding form. Since leucine zipper interactions such as those proposed to maintain HSF1 in the inactive monomeric form (11Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 12Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are driven by unfavorable interactions of these hydrophobic amino acid sequences with water molecules, the HSF1 zipper interaction could be disrupted by alterations in local water structure surrounding the HSF1 protein caused by reordering of water molecules around nearby exposed protein hydrophobic domains. Alternatively, the HSF1 zipper interaction could be disrupted by transient competitive hydrophobic interactions between the exposed protein hydrophobic domains and either of the two HSF1 leucine zipper sequences. These potential mechanisms are supported by previous results demonstrating that two substances known to strengthen protein hydrophobic interactions, deuterium oxide and glycerol, are able to inhibit induction of the cellular stress response(27Mosser D.D.

Previous studies have shown that HSF1 expressed in E. coli exhibits constitutive trimerization and DNA binding activity(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this result is that the high concentration of recombinant protein being synthesized in these cells allows the oligomerization domains of nascent HSF1 polypeptides to interact before the entire HSF1 protein has time to fold into an inactive, non-DNA binding state. This possibility is consistent with results described above supporting the function of an interaction between a sequence near the C terminus of HSF1 and the N-terminal oligomerization domain in controlling the ability of this factor to trimerize (and, therefore, to bind DNA)(11Rabindran S.K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because we expressed HSF1 in E. coli as a fusion with the GST polypeptide, it may be that the GST protein sequence inhibits premature trimerization by sterically hindering the interaction of nascently translated HSF1 oligomerization domains, thus allowing the entire polypeptide time to fold properly into the non-DNA binding form. Not surprisingly, we found that the growth temperature of the E. coli in which the GST-HSF1 fusion protein is expressed is also an important factor for obtaining HSF1 in the non-DNA binding form. Expression of the protein in cells grown at 33°C yielded the best results, while growth at 37°C consistently yielded HSF1 in the trimeric, DNA binding form. It is possible that the biochemical environment of E. coli is such that HSF1 expressed in cells grown at 33°C, but not 37°C, is able to fold properly into the non-DNA binding form. The ability to activate purified HSF1 by heat treatment in vitro will provide a system with which to perform physical studies on the structural changes that occur in the HSF1 protein as it is converted from the inactive monomeric form to the trimeric, DNA binding form. These studies should yield interesting insights into the mechanism of HSF1 activation and further our understanding of the functional role of the HSF1 protein as both sensor and transcriptional effector in an important pathway of environmental signal transduction, the cellular stress response. We would like to express our thanks to Jim Smith for expert photographic assistance and to Ok-Kyong Park-Sarge for comments on this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2055741808,"Glucocorticoids have been shown to accelerate fetal lung type II cell maturation, and this effect appears, in part, to be mediated via fibroblasts. To identify glucocorticoid induced genes in fetal lung fibroblasts, we screened a cDNA library from cortisol-treated fetal lung fibroblasts with a subtracted cDNA probe which was enriched for sequences specific for cortisol-treated fetal lung fibroblasts. Fifty-seven clones were isolated from the cDNA library. One cDNA represented ≈30% of the 57 clones. Analysis of DNA sequence homology suggested that this cDNA encodes the rat transforming growth factor-β3 (TGFβ3). We found that TGFβ3 mRNA was expressed in fetal lung fibroblasts but not epithelial cells. Expression of message in fetal lung fibroblasts was developmentally regulated. TGFβ3 mRNA levels were low during the pseudoglandular stage (day 18), peaked during the early canalicular stage of lung development (day 19), then fell again at days 20 and 21 (term = 22 days). Exposure of fetal lung fibroblasts to cortisol increased TGFβ3 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Maternal administration of dexamethasone also enhanced mRNA expression of TGFβ3 in fetal lung fibroblasts. These data suggest that glucocorticoids may mediate their stimulatory effect on lung maturation by inducing TGFβ3 expression in fetal lung fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2052463317,"Rel proteins are important intracellular mediators of cytokine-induced signal transduction. To understand how cytokines affect different cell populations in the brain, we have characterized Rel activation in astrocytes. A RelA homodimer is uniquely activated in cytokine-stimulated astrocytes. Cytokine-dependent phosphorylation of the RelA inhibitor MAD-3 occurred on discrete peptides prior to its dissociation from RelA. A transient hyperphosphorylation of RelA was also induced. Antioxidant treatment inhibited both RelA activation and phosphorylation of the RelA.MAD-3 complex. These results demonstrate that cytokine-dependent activation of the RelA homodimer involves phosphorylation of both RelA and its associated inhibitor. The sole activation of a RelA homodimer suggests that cytokines will activate a unique set of Rel-regulated genes in astrocytes."

Their mucin characteristics were indicated by a high carbohydrate content, ranging from 74 to 95%. The carbohydrate compositions indicated the presence of very long fucosylated polylactosamine chains. Amino acid analyses showed high abundance of serine and threonine in all three fractions (19-36%), confirming their mucin-like nature. Immunochemical analyses of deglycosylated samples detected the MUC1 mucin apoprotein in SBG2 and the MUC3 protein in SBG1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a MUC3 mucin being purified. This mucin showed no significant reduction in size upon trypsin treatment or disulfide bond reduction and alkylation. Gel filtration of three samples of secondary bile showed that the size distribution of sialyl-Le(a)-carrying glycoproteins was similar to that found in primary bile, and immunochemical analysis showed that the MUC1 protein was present in all three samples. In one sample an additional fraction was isolated, which was insoluble in 6 M guanidinium chloride, but was solubilized upon reduction and alkylation. mRNAs from gallbladder epithelia were analyzed in Northern blot hybridizations showing that the MUC1 and MUC3 but not the MUC2 mucin apoprotein genes were expressed."

INTRODUCTIONProtein kinase C (PKC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CDAGdiacylglycerolTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. )is the major cellular receptor for phorbol esters(1Ashendel C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and most PKC isotypes can be activated by phorbol esters both in vivo and in vitro(2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters promote the binding of PKC to membranes analogous to the effect of the natural PKC activator, diacylglycerol (DAG)(3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 4Huang K.-P. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1989; 12: 425-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5Bell R.M.

Acta. 1992; 1134: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, phorbol esters differ from DAG primarily by duration of action. DAG production in the membrane (for example, through activation of phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes inositol polyphosphates(7Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is short-lived as the DAG is rapidly metabolized(3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, PKC transiently translocates from the cytosol to the membrane, whereas phorbol esters are not metabolized and cause long term membrane association of PKC (8Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (5741) Google Scholar).One consequence of phorbol ester treatment, correlated with sustained association of PKC with membranes, is the down-regulation of the PKC proteins themselves(9Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Certain natural agonists can also cause the down-regulation of some PKC isotypes(11Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 120-131PubMed Google Scholar, 12Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); down-regulation can follow physiological stimuli, possibly through the sustained production of DAG by phospholipases, including phospholipase D(12Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23761-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism for the down-regulation of PKC has not been described. It has been proposed that Ca2+-activated neutral proteases (calpains) specifically degrade membrane-bound PKC, based on the in vitro sensitivity of PKC to various proteases(14Murray A.W. Fournier A. Hardy S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 53-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S.-I. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mammalian PKC isotypes vary in their susceptibility to down-regulation when expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PKC-ζ protein levels were not affected by phorbol esters. PKC-ζ differs structurally from other isotypes by lacking one of the two usual cysteine repeats (17Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) that correlate with phorbol ester binding(18Kaibuchi K. Fukumoto Y. Oku N. Takai Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13489-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cazaubon S. Marais R. Parker P. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This isotype does not bind, is not activated by phorbol esters in vitro(20Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and does not translocate to the membrane in whole cells after phorbol ester treatment(21Gschwendt M. Leibersperger H. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, it is expected that PKC-ζ does not respond to phorbol esters in S. pombe. PKC-γ, -δ, and -η did down-regulate as they do in mammalian cells(3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, PKC-ε did not down-regulate in S. pombe. PKC-ε binds phorbol esters (2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) and does down-regulate after phorbol ester treatment in mammalian cells, although the rate of down-regulation can be slower than for other PKC isotypes(24Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation showed a PKC isotype specificity in S. pombe that differed from that seen in mammalian cells.Here, it is shown that down-regulation requires kinase function of certain PKC isotypes, and isotypes that cannot themselves initiate the process can be affected by susceptible isotypes. Thus, the process is of a general nature but occurs in response only to certain isotypes. Furthermore, down-regulation parallels the accumulation of vesicles, suggesting an association between these events.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPKC-γ, -δ, and -η down-regulate in response to TPA in both S. pombe and mammalian cells(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, TPA does not cause the down-regulation of PKC-ε in S. pombe(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in contrast to the effect in mammalian cells(24Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All four of these enzymes are phorbol ester-dependent protein kinases when purified from S. pombe(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability to down-regulate does not simply reflect PKC activity or phorbol binding but is specified by the isotype. Most mammalian cells express several PKC isotypes(2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar), and down-regulation of PKC-ε in these cells may result from the function of other isotypes. This hypothesis was tested by expressing additional PKCs with PKC-ε in S. pombe. S. pombe was used because of its low level of endogenous TPA-dependent PKC activity(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which reduces the possible effects of one isotype upon another.A stable strain of S. pombe expressing PKC-ε (16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was supertransformed with vectors to express PKC-δ or -ζ. In vector control cultures, PKC-ε does not down-regulate in response to TPA (Fig. 1, lowerpanels, lanes1-4 and 9-12). Co-expression of PKC-ζ did not lead to PKC-ε down-regulation, and PKC-ζ itself did not down-regulate (Fig. 1, lanes13-16). In contrast, TPA treatment of cells co-expressing PKC-δ with PKC-ε led to a marked decrease in PKC-ε protein levels in parallel with the down-regulation of PKC-δ (Fig. 1, lanes5-8; Table 1). Thus, PKC down-regulation is a consequence of the action of only some PKC isotypes (δ), and other isotypes (ε) can be affected in trans.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab It is unlikely that down-regulation simply follows relocation of the enzyme to the membrane since both PKC-δ and -ε translocate to membranes after TPA treatment in mammalian cells (2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) and both show TPA-dependent kinase activity on extraction from S. pombe(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A function of PKC-δ and not of PKC-ε must drive down-regulation. To establish whether this function involved the active kinase domain of PKC-δ, a kinase-defective form of PKC-δ (PKC-δΔ) was transformed into S. pombe. In contrast to full-length PKC-δ, the inactive form did not efficiently down-regulate in response to TPA (Fig. 2, lanes1-4). However, the kinase-defective mutant did down-regulate when co-expressed with full-length PKC-δ (Fig. 2, lanes5-8; Table 1). Thus, the response requires kinase activity, as distinct from the physical presence, of certain isotypes (e.g. δ). Other isotypes (e.g. ε) or indeed catalytically inactive mutants (e.g. δΔ) can be induced to down-regulate, but isotype-specific kinase function is required to initiate the process.Figure 2PKC-δΔ down-regulates when co-expressed with full-length PKC-δ. A cell line expressing PKC-δΔ was transformed with vector or with full-length PKC-δ. Two isolates are shown for each condition. Western blot analysis, using the PKC-δ antibody, was performed on extracts from cells cultured for 30 h in the presence or absence of TPA (±). The positions of PKC-δΔ and -δ are shown. PKC-δΔ has a molecular mass of 64 kDa. Lanes 1-4, PKC-δΔ+ vector; lanes 5-8, PKC-δΔ+ PKC-δ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to PKC-δ, the γ and η isotypes also down-regulate in S. pombe(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To ascertain if the trans dominant effect on down-regulation was specific to the PKC-δ/-ε combination or applied more generally, the effect of PKC-γ on the down-regulation of PKC-δΔ and -ε was determined. Co-expression of PKC-γ with PKC-δΔ markedly increased the extent of down-regulation of the mutant PKC-δ protein after TPA treatment (Table 1). Similarly, down-regulation of PKC-ε was increased when co-expressed with PKC-γ (Table 1). In both instances, PKC-γ effectively down-regulated after TPA treatment (data not shown). Thus, PKC-γ, like PKC-δ, can drive the down-regulation of other isotypes (PKC-ε and -δΔ). This trans dominant effect, however, does not apply to all isotypes. PKC-ζ does not down-regulate when expressed alone or with PKC-δ in S. pombe (Fig. 3A, lanes1-4 and 5-8, respectively; Table 1). The lack of trans effect of PKC-δ on PKC-ζ also establishes that down-regulation is not due to a repressive effect of PKC-δ on the promoter used to express the PKCs or on PKC translation.Figure 3PKC down-regulation is not due to promoter or growth effects. A, PKC-δ does not cause the down-regulation of PKC-ζ. The PKC-ζ cell line was transformed with vector or PKC-δ. Two isolates are shown for each condition. Extracts were made from cells after culture for 30 h in the presence or absence of TPA (±). Positions of PKC-δ and -ζ are indicated. The two duplicate membranes were analyzed with the PKC-δ and -ζ antibodies, respectively. Lanes 1-4, PKC-ζ+ vector; lanes 5-8, PKC-ζ+ PKC-δ. B, growth arrest does not account for down-regulation. A stable PKC-δ S. pombe cell line (16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was cultured in nitrogen-replete (lanes 1-2) or nitrogen-deficient (lanes 3-4) medium. After 24 h, the cultures were continued for a further 30 h in the presence or absence of TPA (±). Extracts were then made and examined by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Down-regulation correlates with a TPA-dependent growth inhibition(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine that the loss of PKC protein does not simply follow growth arrest. PKC-δ expressing S. pombe were cultured in nitrogen-deficient or nitrogen-replete medium for 54 h. PKC-δ is expressed at similar levels in growth-arrested and growing cells (Fig. 3B, lanes1 and 3). Furthermore, in both instances, treatment of these arrested cells with TPA led to PKC-δ down-regulation (Fig. 3B, lanes2 and 4). Thus, down-regulation does not automatically follow growth arrest but requires TPA treatment of specific isotypes.Three distinct PKC down-regulation responses are identified. PKC-ζ is not affected, as predicted by its unresponsiveness to TPA. PKC-ε translocates to the membrane in mammalian cells but does not trigger down-regulation, at least in S. pombe. Down-regulation can be initiated by both PKC-γ and -δ, and, in addition to causing homologous down-regulation, these isotypes can affect other members of the PKC family (PKC-δΔ and -ε). Furthermore, since PKC down-regulation is initiated by active kinase, the process appears to constitute a direct negative feedback pathway through the destruction of the active PKC. However, whether the ability of PKC to drive this process is a negative or positive signal remains an open issue.Inactive PKC-α and -γ mutants can down-regulate after TPA treatment when expressed in mammalian cells(31Pears C. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Freisewinkel I. Riethmacher D. Stabel S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction with the results shown above for PKC-δΔ can be explained by the presence of endogenous mammalian PKCs (which trigger down-regulation) in the cell types used. Interestingly, others have shown that an inactive PKC-α mutant does not down-regulate when expressed in mammalian cells(33Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different levels of endogenous PKCs capable of triggering and/or sustaining down-regulation in the cell lines used in these experiments could account for the conflicting results(31Pears C. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient down-regulation would not occur in cell lines with low PKC activity, a situation analogous to S. pombe cells that contain low levels of endogenous PKC activity(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).PKC isotype-specific functions are apparent since PKC-ε is clearly distinguished from both PKC-γ and -δ in its inability to down-regulate in isolation, despite these isotypes being similar in terms of TPA regulation of activity. The implication is that the output signals must differ. The specific molecular events have not been elucidated, but a correlation was noted between the ability to down-regulate and a marked vesicle accumulation in S. pombe (of which at least an element was endocytic)(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells expressing PKC-δΔ, -ε, and -ζ did not accumulate vesicles even after TPA treatment(16Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine if down-regulation of PKC-δΔ correlated with vesicle accumulation, PKC-δΔ cells supertransformed with vector, PKC-γ, or PKC-δ, were examined after culture with or without TPA. PKC-δΔ cells transfected with the control vector did not accumulate vesicles at any point. However, cells co-expressing PKC-γ accumulated vesicles in a phorbol ester-dependent fashion with 42% of cells affected 3 h after addition of TPA (Fig. 4). In cells where PKC-δ was co-expressed with PKC-δΔ, vesicles were evident in 8.5% of cells, and this percentage was increased to 31% after treatment with TPA for 3 h (Fig. 4). Electron micrographs of representative cultures are shown in Fig. 5. Thus, TPA treatment of cells co-expressing PKC-γ or -δ with PKC-δΔ led to vesicle accumulation in parallel with PKC-δ mutant down-regulation. It is hypothesized that the up-regulation of membrane transport processes, including endocytosis, is central to the down-regulation of PKC. Activated PKCs associate with membranes; increased endocytic activity would lead to an increased rate of traffic to and from the plasma membrane, and the PKCs are presumably targeted for degradation in vacuoles (or lysosomes) or perhaps exposure to proteasomes(34Gruenberg J. Clague M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Pryer N.K. Wuesthube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev.

PKC-ζ does not down-regulate following TPA treatment, even if co-expressed with PKC-δ, possibly reflecting the fact that PKC-ζ does not translocate to the membrane in response to TPA(21Gschwendt M. Leibersperger H. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, a chimeric molecule containing the regulatory domain of PKC-δ fused to the catalytic domain of PKC-ζ down-regulated when expressed in S. pombe(36Goode N.T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PKC-δ regulatory domain of this chimera would specify membrane localization after TPA treatment. These data support the suggestion that PKC down-regulation is a membrane-driven process.It is noted that vesicles have been seen where down-regulation was not obvious. PKC-δ cells accumulate vesicles (Fig. 4), but down-regulation occurs only after TPA treatment. Since down-regulation by necessity reflects a balance between the rates of synthesis and destruction, the increased rate of breakdown due to increased vesicle traffic after TPA treatment (Fig. 4) would lead to a net loss of PKC-δ protein in these cells. This effect is probably accentuated because phorbol esters cause a tight association of PKC with membranes (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 6Zidovetzki R. Lester D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the PKCs would remain attached to membranes up to and including the time of sorting to degradative compartments. The idea that PKC down-regulation is part of a nonspecific degradative process is supported by recent work showing that specific proteases cannot account for down-regulation(37Junco M. Webster C. Bosca L. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In summary, PKC down-regulation is a function of the kinase activity of certain isotypes. Isotypes that cannot initiate the down-regulation process can be affected in trans, predicting that some PKC isotypes contribute to the control of action of other PKCs. The strict correlation between the up-regulation of vesicle traffic and the ability to down-regulate suggests these two phenomena are related and that PKC down-regulation occurs by the same general process as PKC-mediated receptor internalization and down-regulation. INTRODUCTIONProtein kinase C (PKC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CDAGdiacylglycerolTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. )is the major cellular receptor for phorbol esters(1Ashendel C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and most PKC isotypes can be activated by phorbol esters both in vivo and in vitro(2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters promote the binding of PKC to membranes analogous to the effect of the natural PKC activator, diacylglycerol (DAG)(3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 4Huang K.-P. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1989; 12: 425-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zidovetzki R. Lester D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, phorbol esters differ from DAG primarily by duration of action. DAG production in the membrane (for example, through activation of phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes inositol polyphosphates(7Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is short-lived as the DAG is rapidly metabolized(3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, PKC transiently translocates from the cytosol to the membrane, whereas phorbol esters are not metabolized and cause long term membrane association of PKC (8Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (5741) Google Scholar).One consequence of phorbol ester treatment, correlated with sustained association of PKC with membranes, is the down-regulation of the PKC proteins themselves(9Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Certain natural agonists can also cause the down-regulation of some PKC isotypes(11Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 120-131PubMed Google Scholar, 12Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); down-regulation can follow physiological stimuli, possibly through the sustained production of DAG by phospholipases, including phospholipase D(12Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23761-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism for the down-regulation of PKC has not been described. It has been proposed that Ca2+-activated neutral proteases (calpains) specifically degrade membrane-bound PKC, based on the in vitro sensitivity of PKC to various proteases(14Murray A.W. Fournier A. Hardy S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 53-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S.-I. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J.

Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PKC-ζ protein levels were not affected by phorbol esters. PKC-ζ differs structurally from other isotypes by lacking one of the two usual cysteine repeats (17Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) that correlate with phorbol ester binding(18Kaibuchi K. Fukumoto Y. Oku N. Takai Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13489-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cazaubon S. Marais R. Parker P. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This isotype does not bind, is not activated by phorbol esters in vitro(20Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and does not translocate to the membrane in whole cells after phorbol ester treatment(21Gschwendt M. Leibersperger H. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONThe lung is composed of several distinct cell populations that function to facilitate the exchange of gases between the tissues of the body and the external environment(1Gail D.B. Lenfant C.J.M. Annu. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: 366-387PubMed Google Scholar). This cellular heterogeneity makes the lung an intriguing model to investigate the molecular determinants of pulmonary cell differentiation. One distinct cell type, the nonciliated secretory cells lining the airways of the lung, is the Clara cell(2Reid L. Jones R. Fed. Proc. 1979; 38: 191-196PubMed Google Scholar). The major secretory product of Clara cells is a homodimeric 10-kDa protein known as the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10), Clara cell secretory protein, polychlorobiphenyl binding protein, or uteroglobin(3Phelps D.S.

However, under certain endocrine conditions, CC10 mRNA can also be detected at very low levels in the male and female reproductive tracts(5Hagen G. Wolf M. Katyal S.L. Singh G. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2939-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In lagomorphs, CC10, also called uteroglobin, is expressed at highest levels in the female reproductive tract during implantation of the embryo.

Using the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, which displays a Clara cell phenotype, the H441 cell transient transfection analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the rat and rabbit gene fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene has shown that elements more proximal to the start of transcription were sufficient to direct the cell-specific expression (14DeMayo F.J.

Even though the cellular specificity of these promoters is not as restricted as the CC10 promoter, several of the factors involved in CC10 gene expression are also important for the expression of the surfactant proteins. Specifically, the transcription factors HNF3 (21Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Mendel D.B. Hensen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) seem to be important for the expression of all pulmonary epithelial genes analyzed to date. Therefore, pulmonary cell specificity may be the result of a combination of common and cell-specific transcription factors regulating pulmonary gene transcription.In this study, we report the in vitro and in vivo analysis of the cis-acting elements responsible for tissue-specific expression of the mouse CC10 gene, mCC10. Using H441 cells for transient transfection analysis, the proximal promoter regions necessary for the transcriptional regulation of mCC10 was determined. Using transgenic mouse analysis, the elements involved in cell-specific regulation were determined and compared with the expression of the endogenous gene. The in vivo transgenic analysis verified the findings of the in vitro analysis but also identified additional regions in the 5′-flanking region of mCC10 needed for the full quantitative level of expression of the reporter gene in transgenic mice. Since the mouse has become the model system for investigating genetic regulation of mammalian gene expression, these data will serve as the foundation for future investigations into the elements regulating cell-specific expression of the mCC10 gene in a homologous system. The identification of these elements will be useful for somatic gene therapy of human pulmonary diseases.DISCUSSIONThis analysis demonstrates that 803 bp of the 5′-flanking DNA of the mCC10 gene is capable of driving the expression of a heterologous gene in transgenic mice at the appropriate level and cellular specificity. Although 166 bp of the mCC10 5′-flanking DNA is capable of supporting the appropriate Clara cell-specific expression of transgenes in mice, this fragment is not capable of driving the level of expression to the same magnitude as that of the endogenous gene. Therefore, there must exist enhancer(s) elements between −803 and −166 needed to support full expression. A similar phenomenon was observed when deletion analysis was conducted on the rabbit uteroglobin transgene. Although 0.6 kb of 5′-flanking DNA of the rabbit promoter was capable of directing pulmonary-specific gene transcription, the level of transgene expression was lower than when 3.3 kb of 5′-flanking DNA was used(14DeMayo F.J. Damak S. Hansen T.N. Bullock D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Although the −803-bp and larger fragments of the mCC10 promoter are capable of supporting transgene expression to the appropriate cell type and, on average, to the appropriate level, the expression of transgenes is highly variable and could not be correlated with the number of copies of the transgene. If such integration site and copy number independence in transgene expression can be achieved with mCC10 regulatory regions, then there must exist domains located outside of the regions used in this study that will confer these properties.Analysis of the deletion mutants of the mCC10 gene demonstrated a similar pattern of expression in the H441 cells as previously reported for the rCC10 promoter. In the distal 5′-flanking region, there could be identified positive and negative elements that modulate the basal expression of this gene. This was not observed in the transgenic mouse analysis. The inability to identify these distal elements using the transgenic mouse analysis could have been due to the high degree of variability of transgene expression in the mice. This high degree of variability of transgene expression, due to the influences of the site of transgene integration, made the detection of subtle differences impossible. As observed in the rCC10 gene, elements proximal to the promoter were necessary for expression in H441 cells. The importance of these elements was observed in transgenic mice where 166 bp of the 5′-flanking DNA was capable of directing the appropriate cellular expression of the transgene in mice. However, the transfection analysis in H441 cells was not capable of detecting elements between −803 and −166, which are needed for the full quantitative expression of the gene. The lack of detection of enhancer(s) in this region by the H441 cells may be due to the fact that the CC10 gene is not expressed in this cell line and the trans-acting factors that interact with the DNA sequences in −803 to −166 fragment may not be present in these cells. The lack of expression of hCC10 in H441 cells may be due to the lack of the ability of the in vitro culture conditions to support CC10 expression. Attempts to generate murine-transformed Clara cell lines have resulted in the initial expression of CC10. However there is loss of expression in subsequent cell passages(36Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie M.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).An alternative explanation for the inability of transient transfection analysis of mCC10 promoter to detect regulatory elements upstream of the −166 bp of 5′-flanking DNA may be due to species differences between human and mouse Clara cells. This species heterogeneity in Clara cells can be observed by the level of expression of the reporter gene driven by various CC10 promoters in these cells. The rat promoter drives the expression of the reporter gene to a higher level than the mouse promoter in these cells(33Stripp B.R. Huffman J.A. Bohinski R.J. Genomics. 1994; 20: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the expression of CAT under the control of the rabbit promoter cannot be detected unless heterologous enhancers are added(34Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the elements between −803 and −166, which regulate the mouse gene expression, may not be present in this human cell line. Despite this species variability, at present the H441 cells serve as the only tool to precisely identify the cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of CC10 gene expression. Therefore, the distal elements must be identified by further transgenic analysis.Stripp et al. (15Stripp B.R. Sawaya P.L. Luse D.S. Wikenheiser K.A. Wert S.E. Huffman J.A. Lattier D.L. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 261: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) identified a nonamer sequence at −90, and a perfect copy of the nonamer sequence in reverse orientation is present and centered at −118 in rat CC10 promoter. Interestingly, the same nonamer sequence is present in the rabbit uteroglobin promoter sequence at positions −98 and −127. We identified the nonamer sequence, AAGTAAATA, present at position −93, and the reverse orientation of the same sequence is present at −117 of the mCC10 promoter. These sequences are partially similar to octamer motif (ATGCAAAT) of transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2. The cis-acting elements regulating the expression of the rat gene have been identified. Sawaya and co-workers (16Sawaya P.L. Stripp B.R. Whitsett J.A. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3860-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have dissected the elements required for expression of genes under the control of the rCC10 promoter. DNase 1 footprinting analysis identified two regions in which H441 nuclear proteins interacted with the rCC10 5′-flanking region, region 1 and region 2. Region 1 of the rat gene spanned from −123 to −86. Using linker scanner mutations, an AP1 site and several octamer and HNF3 sites were identified in this region. As previously reported(7Ray M.K. Magdaleno S. O'Malley B.W. DeMayo F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), several potential factor binding sites in mCC10 promoter were identified within this region by computer analysis. Alignment of the mouse and rat region 1 shows a high degree of sequence homology. In designing the deletion construct for this investigation, 123 bp of 5′-flanking DNA was selected because this fragment contained region 1, having the potential transcription factor binding sites. The next construct having 87 nucleotides upstream was designed to delete this region. There were no significant differences between the −123- and −87-bp fragment to confer the expression of CAT in H441 cells. However, addition of the fragment with sequences from −166 to −124 was sufficient to give maximum expression in H441 cells. When DNase 1 footprinting was conducted on the mCC10 promoter with H441 cell nuclear extract, two protected regions were identified(33Stripp B.R. Huffman J.A. Bohinski R.J. Genomics. 1994; 20: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These regions were identified at −137 to −117 and −101 to −84. Thus, the protected regions in the mouse gene extends outside the defined region 1 in the rat gene. Analysis of the sequences in this region revealed the sequence of TATGAAAGA as a potential octamer binding site. This sequence is also found at the identical location in the rat gene, yet linker scanner mutations of this region did not alter rCC10 promoter activity(16Sawaya P.L. Stripp B.R. Whitsett J.A. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3860-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since the mouse gene lacks region 2, this additional octamer site may be important for mCC10 gene expression. The rat gene may not require this region, and transcription factor activity in region 2 may compensate for the mutation of this octamer region.The Clara cell 10-kDa protein represents an interesting model system to identify the elements regulating both tissue- and cell- specific expression. In this report, transgenic mouse technology and transient transfection analysis was used to investigate the elements required for the expression of the murine CC10 gene. The transient transfection experiments represent a functional identification of the boundaries of the core elements regulating cell-specific expression. The transgenic analysis verified the importance of the proximal promoter region in Clara cell-specific expression of this gene and also identified distal regions necessary for the appropriate level of expression of this gene. The analysis of the mouse promoter also showed subtle species differences in the elements required for expression in H441 cells. Transgenic data presented here will be able to dissect the mechanism of mCC10 gene expression in bronchiolar epithelium by identifying the cis-acting elements. The advantage of executing this analysis in the murine gene is that future analysis on the interactions of these factors in the developmental biology of the lung will be accomplished in vivo as well as in vitro using the mouse as a genetically manipulated system. Besides this, identification of cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors has a much more clinical importance in the treatment of genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis and α-antitrypsin using somatic gene therapy(37Collins F.S. Science. 1992; 256: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Thus, these manipulations can be accomplished in a system where the elements regulating the expression of the homologous gene has been identified. INTRODUCTIONThe lung is composed of several distinct cell populations that function to facilitate the exchange of gases between the tissues of the body and the external environment(1Gail D.B. Lenfant C.J.M. Annu. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: 366-387PubMed Google Scholar). This cellular heterogeneity makes the lung an intriguing model to investigate the molecular determinants of pulmonary cell differentiation. One distinct cell type, the nonciliated secretory cells lining the airways of the lung, is the Clara cell(2Reid L. Jones R. Fed. Proc. 1979; 38: 191-196PubMed Google Scholar). The major secretory product of Clara cells is a homodimeric 10-kDa protein known as the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10), Clara cell secretory protein, polychlorobiphenyl binding protein, or uteroglobin(3Phelps D.S.

An anti-inflammatory role for this protein has been hypothesized, but the physiological role of this protein is yet to be defined.

https://openalex.org/W2016161731,"The actin-binding properties of the actin-fragmin complex from Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia were investigated with respect to regulation by Ca2+, phospholipids, and phosphorylation of the actin subunit by the endogenous actin-fragmin kinase. Fragmin possesses two high affinity actin-binding sites and probably also a third, low affinity site. Its nucleating and F-actin severing activities are inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Actin-fragmin specifically binds PIP2 which competes with actin for the Ca2+-sensitive site. However, PIP2 cannot dissociate the actin-fragmin complex nor the actin2-fragmin trimer. Efficient F-actin nucleating activity by actin-fragmin is only observed with unphosphorylated actin-fragmin, in the absence of PIP2 and at high Ca2+ (>μM) concentrations. In the presence of PIP2, actin-fragmin only caps actin filaments when unphosphorylated. The results suggest that in the cell, hydrolysis of PIP2, concomitant with the increase of cytosolic Ca2+, could promote subcortical actin polymerization. The actin-binding properties of the actin-fragmin complex from Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia were investigated with respect to regulation by Ca2+, phospholipids, and phosphorylation of the actin subunit by the endogenous actin-fragmin kinase. Fragmin possesses two high affinity actin-binding sites and probably also a third, low affinity site. Its nucleating and F-actin severing activities are inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Actin-fragmin specifically binds PIP2 which competes with actin for the Ca2+-sensitive site. However, PIP2 cannot dissociate the actin-fragmin complex nor the actin2-fragmin trimer. Efficient F-actin nucleating activity by actin-fragmin is only observed with unphosphorylated actin-fragmin, in the absence of PIP2 and at high Ca2+ (>μM) concentrations. In the presence of PIP2, actin-fragmin only caps actin filaments when unphosphorylated. The results suggest that in the cell, hydrolysis of PIP2, concomitant with the increase of cytosolic Ca2+, could promote subcortical actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1966268977,"Bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V has both pyrimidine dimer-specific DNA glycosylase and abasic (AP) lyase activities, which are sequential yet biochemically separable functions. Previous studies using chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis techniques have shown that the catalytic activities are mediated through the α-amino group of the enzyme forming a covalent (imino) intermediate. However, in addition to the amino-terminal active site residue, examination of the x-ray crystal structure of endonuclease V reveals the presence of Glu-23 near the active site, and this residue has been strongly implicated in the reaction chemistry. In order to understand the role of Glu-23 in the reaction mechanism, four different mutations (E23Q, E23C, E23H, E23D) were constructed, and the mutant proteins were evaluated for DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities using defined substrates and specific in vitro and in vivo assays. Replacement of Glu-23 with Gln, Cys, or His completely abolished DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities, while replacement with Asp retained negligible amounts of glycosylase activity, but retained near wild type levels of AP lyase activity. Gel shift assays revealed that all four mutant proteins can recognize and bind to thymine dimers. The results indicate that Glu-23 is the candidate for stabilizing the charge of the imino intermediate that is likely to require an acidic group in the active site of the enzyme.

The results indicate that Glu-23 is the candidate for stabilizing the charge of the imino intermediate that is likely to require an acidic group in the active site of the enzyme. Bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V (EC 3.1.25.1), encoded by the den V gene, initiates the removal of pyrimidine dimers in DNA and was the first DNA repair enzyme to have its structure solved by x-ray crystallography(1Morikawa K.

This enzyme is a DNA glycosylase with concomitant AP lyase activity, known to be specific for cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, although it has been reported to act on trans-syn-I dimers at extremely low efficiency(2Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been performed to address various structural and functional aspects of the enzyme (reviewed in (3Latham A.K. Lloyd R.S. Ann N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and (4Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). One of the questions concerning the reaction mechanism of endonuclease V that remained unanswered for many years was whether or not the same active center involved in the pyrimidine dimer N-glycosylase activity was also responsible for the AP ( 1The abbreviations used are: APapurinic or apyrimidinicPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidRFreplicative formTHFtetrahydrofuranFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. )lyase reaction. The N-glycosylase and AP lyase activities of endonuclease V have been shown to occur by a two-step process. First, the N-glycosylic bond of the 5′-pyrimidine of the dimer is cleaved(5Radany E.H. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1980; 286: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Seawell P.C. Simon T.J. Ganesan A.K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is followed by the nicking of the phosphodiester bond between the two dimerized pyrimidines(7Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2742-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Seawell P.C. Smith C.A. Ganesan A.K. J. Virol. 1980; 35: 790-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies of endonuclease V by reductive methylation have shown that the α-NH2 group of the enzyme is involved in the chemical mechanism of both glycosylase and AP lyase activities(9Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17631-17639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a primary amine at the amino terminus is required for enzymatic function, but is not necessary for substrate recognition. Furthermore, the exact location of the α-amino group relative to the rest of the enzyme is critical for catalytic activity(10Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 880-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). apurinic or apyrimidinic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid replicative form tetrahydrofuran fast protein liquid chromatography. The proposed reaction mechanism for endonuclease V displays the characteristics of a reaction with an imino enzyme-substrate intermediate. The existence of the imino intermediate has been demonstrated by the following criteria: (a) inhibition of the enzyme by cyanide in a concentration-dependent manner, as cyanide can react with the protein-DNA intermediate forming a reversible tetrahedral complex, (b) reduction of the imino intermediate to a covalent enzyme-substrate product by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and subsequent isolation of the complex, and (c) demonstration that the amino-terminal α-amino group is directly involved in the formation of the imino intermediate(11Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These studies led to the formulation of our current understanding about the chemistry of the catalytic mechanism of T4 endonuclease V which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. A covalent imino intermediate is formed as a result of a nucleophilic attack by the α-NH2 terminus at C-1′ on the 5′ sugar in the pyrimidine dimer (panel B). The phosphodiester bond is cleaved by β-elimination facilitated by the removal of pro-S 2′ hydrogen, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and a 3′-phosphate as shown in panel D(12Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Rabow L. Absalon M.J. Stubbe J. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8029-8030Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme can also dissociate without undergoing the β-elimination reaction thus generating an AP site (panel C). It is believed that the concentration of the nucleophiles in the medium determines the rate of dissociation of the enzyme before β-elimination. The x-ray crystal structure of T4 endonuclease V (1Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Ohtsuka E. Science. 1992; 256: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) shows that the side chain of Glu-23 is positioned close to the enzyme's active site (α-NH2 of T2). Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies of Glu-23 have further demonstrated its importance in enzyme catalysis such that E23Q was shown to completely abolish both glycosylase and AP lyase activity while E23D only abolished the glycosylase activity(13Doi T. Recktenwald A. Karaki Y. Kikuchi M. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. Inaoka T. Hori N. Ohtsuka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9420-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Hori N. Doi T.

Although the above studies have demonstrated the significance of Glu-23, mechanistic analyses have not been provided and the role of the α-NH2 moiety was not taken into consideration for the formalization of the reaction mechanism. In this study, a series of mutants were constructed at Glu-23 to further probe into the biochemical mechanism of catalysis and address specific questions on the role of Glu-23 in the reaction mechanism. The Escherichia coli strains, M13 phage constructs, and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab All of the procedures for creating mutants of endonuclease V by site-directed mutagenesis have been previously described in detail elsewhere(15Latham A.K. Carmical R.J. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9024-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are provided in Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The purification scheme of the mutant endonuclease V proteins is shown in Fig. SI. The mutant endonuclease V proteins were expressed off of the λOLPR hybrid promoter in E. coli strain AB2480. Two-liter cultures were grown at 30°C for 18 h in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g at 4°C and resuspended in 300 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a single-stranded DNA agarose column (80 ml) previously equilibrated with Buffer A. The mutant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient in which KCl concentration was increased from 0.2 M to 1.5 M (200 ml each). Fractions were monitored by immunoblot analysis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Fractions containing the mutant endonuclease V protein were pooled, and a saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution (4.1 M) was added until the final concentration approached 1 M. The sample was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (20 ml), previously equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 M (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). After washing the column with buffer B, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 where the concentration was reduced from 1 M to 0 M. The flow-through and the gradient fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels, and endonuclease V protein was identified by immunoblot analysis and silver staining. The enzyme was further purified and concentrated by FPLC using a Mono S HR 10/10 (8-ml) column (Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were dialyzed against 2 changes of 25 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and loaded onto the Mono S column, previously equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The mutant endonuclease V proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0-1 M KCl. The endonuclease V mutant proteins eluted at ∼600 mM. The peak fractions were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce) assay. In addition to confirming the desired mutations by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant genes(16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar), NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the mutant proteins was also performed to verify the mutations. The purified mutant proteins (5 μg) were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μ) at 50 V for 1 h at room temperature in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell, in CAPS buffer (pH 11) containing 10 mM CAPS and 10% (v/v) methanol. The PVDF membrane was stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% (v/v) methanol and 1% (v/v) acetic acid for 5 min and destained with 50% (v/v) methanol. The bands were excised and submitted to the Protein Chemistry Core, Sealy Center for Molecular Science, UTMB for sequence analysis. E. coli strain AB2480 harboring the expression vector pGX2608, pGX2608-den V+, or the pGX2608 den V+ mutant constructs (E23H, E23C, E23Q, and E23D) were grown to stationary phase at 30°C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested and crude cell lysates were analyzed for the accumulation of endonuclease V protein by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis(17Dowd D.R. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8699-8705Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). E. coli strain AB2480 harboring pGX2608-den V−, pGX2608-den V+, or the mutant constructs (pGX2608-den V+ E23H, E23C, E23Q, E23D) were grown to stationary phase at 30°C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Survival was measured as a function of colony-forming ability relative to the unirradiated cells(17Dowd D.R. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8699-8705Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking assays on plasmids and synthetic oligonucleotides were performed as described previously(15Latham A.K. Carmical R.J. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9024-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A 49-base oligonucleotide containing a single uracil at position 21 was obtained (Midland Research Co.) with the sequence: 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAUTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′. The oligonucleotide containing the uracil was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, annealed to its complementary strand, and then purified with NENsorb cartridges as per the supplier's instructions (DuPont). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was dried in vacuum before resuspending in a buffer containing 70 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. This DNA was reacted with 1 unit of E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (Epicentre Technologies) to create double-stranded DNA containing a site-specific AP site. Wild type and mutant endonuclease V proteins were incubated with the abasic site containing double-stranded DNA at 37°C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the different bands were identified by autoradiography. The 49-base oligonucleotide containing a site-specific cis-syn thymine dimer (0.39 ng) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to its complementary strand, and then allowed to bind with 200 ng of each of the endonuclease V mutants (E23H, E23C, E23Q, and E23D). Binding reactions were for 15 min at 20°C in a buffer containing 0.5 × TBE, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. In a separate experiment, different concentrations of the E23Q mutant or wild type protein were allowed to bind to the same substrate in the presence of either 100 mM NaCl or NaBH4. The reaction conditions were the same as above except for the substitution of NaBH4 for NaCl. NaBH4 is known to covalently trap the wild type enzyme on the DNA. Binding of each of the mutant proteins to the 49-base pair oligonucleotide containing a site-specific thymine dimer resulted in two major complexes. The molecular weights of each of these bound complexes for the E23Q mutant, and thus the stoichiometry of binding, was determined by an adaptation of Ferguson analysis( 2Sigma Technical Bulletin MKR-137. )(18Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The CS 49-mer was 32P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to its complementary sequence. The E23Q mutant (1.2 μg) was reacted with 3.7 ng of this DNA in the binding reaction buffer (0.5 × TBE, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 20°C. The sample was then divided, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis through six different nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with acrylamide concentrations ranging from 4.5 to 9.0% (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 19:1). Native protein standards (Nondenatured Protein Molecular Weight Marker Kit, MW-ND-500 Kit, Sigma) were also subjected to electrophoresis on each of the six gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were analyzed by autoradiography and then by Coomassie Blue staining. The relative mobility (Rf) of each band was determined using the mobility of the bromphenol blue dye as the reference, and the data were analyzed as described previously(18Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Determination of the molecular weight of the complex formed between the E23Q mutant and an oligonucleotide containing a tetrahydrofuran (THF) residue was performed in the same manner. A 30-base oligonucleotide containing a synthetically produced THF residue (AP site analog) was provided by C. Iden, F. Johnson, and A. Grollman, SUNY, Stony Brook with the sequence 5′-ACCATGCCTGCACGAAXTAAGCAATTCGTA-3′ where X is the furan residue(20Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This oligonucleotide (THF 30-mer) was 32P-labeled and annealed to its complementary strand. The E23Q mutant (1.2 μg) was allowed to bind to the radiolabeled double-stranded THF-containing 30-mer (0.34 μg) in the binding reaction buffer, and the complexes were subjected to electrophoresis and Ferguson analysis. Previously, the den V structural gene had been subcloned into M13mp18 RF DNA. The single-stranded DNA from this phage was used as a template to engineer base changes in the den V gene such that the codon for Glu-23 was converted to codons for His-23, Cys-23, Gln-23, or Asp-23 (Table 1). The mutated den V structural genes were subcloned in the correct orientation into the expression vector pGX2608 at a unique ClaI restriction enzyme site, which is located immediately downstream of the hybrid phage λ promoter OLPR. These plasmids were introduced into excision repair-deficient (uvrA−) and recombination-deficient (recA−) E. coli AB2480. Wild type and mutant forms of endonuclease V were expressed in repair-deficient E. coli, and the relative expression levels were compared to wild type. The proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and detected by immunoblot analysis. Intracellular accumulation of each of the mutant enzymes was comparable to or even greater than wild type (Fig. 2A). This steady state accumulation of the respective proteins is important when the biological activity of the mutant enzymes is compared to that of the wild type. The mutant enzymes were purified and their concentration was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations obtained ranged from 50 to 100 μg/ml, and the yield was between 200 and 400 μg of mutant protein from each 2-liter culture. All four mutant endonuclease V proteins were identified by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. There were no discernable contaminants, and each of the mutant proteins appeared as a single discrete band (Fig. 2B). The purified proteins were also subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). Each preparation was found to be free of nonspecific DNA nicking activity on supercoiled pBR322 DNA (data not shown). Mutations at Glu-23 of endonuclease V were also confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing. A total of 25 cycles were run in order to observe the amino acid change at position 23. Consistent with previous results using the wild type enzyme in which the amino-terminal methionine had been removed, all of the mutant proteins had their amino-terminal methionine post-translationally cleaved in E. coli. The amino acid sequence analyses revealed that the desired changes (E23H, E23C, E23Q, and E23D) were accomplished in all four mutant proteins (Table 3). In the case of the E23C mutant, the cysteine residue at position 23 was not detected due to the hydrolysis of the unprotected cysteine side chain.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To assess the survival level after UV irradiation for each of the mutants, E. coli AB2480 (uvrA−, recA−), which had been transformed with plasmids containing the mutant den V genes, were irradiated with UV light for increasing periods of time. Evidence for the in vivo activity of the mutant enzymes can be assessed by measuring the colony-forming ability of these cells following UV exposure, since even one unrepaired pyrimidine dimer can be lethal to the cell(21Howard-Flanders P. Theriot L. Stedeford J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells containing the wild type den V gene exhibited enhanced UV survival, compared to the survival detected in cells containing the mutant den V gene (Fig. 3). The survival of the E23C, E23Q, and E23D mutants was comparable to the levels seen in the parental strain containing only pGX2608 (den V−). However, E23H displayed a better survival, although it was much lower than that observed in the wild type. The pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity of the pure Glu-23 mutant proteins was evaluated using different experimental conditions. Form I pBR322 was UV-irradiated to produce approximately 25 dimers per pBR322 DNA molecule(22Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one assay, UV-irradiated form I DNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of the wild type or mutant enzymes for 30 min at 37°C. Wild type endonuclease V is known to recognize the pyrimidine dimer containing sites and make single-strand nicks that can convert form I (supercoiled) to form II (nicked circular) DNA. Relative enzyme activity was determined as a function of the loss of form I DNA. This assay was performed at different pH values, taking into consideration the E23H and E23C mutants. The imidazole side chain of histidine is unique, in that it has a pKa near neutrality and can therefore gain or lose protons by small changes in the local cellular environment. The pKa of cysteine could also be depressed within the range of pH in this assay. In the reactions performed at pH 6.0, the wild type enzyme showed considerable loss of form I DNA with 1-100 ng of enzyme (Fig. 4A). The only mutant which catalyzed any loss of form I DNA was the E23D mutant. However, the percentage loss of form I DNA in this mutant was much lower than the wild type. The other three mutants (E23H, E23C, and E23Q) were completely deficient in incision, which indicated that these enzymes are catalytically inactive on cyclobutane dimers. The time course nicking assay also revealed a small loss of form I DNA catalyzed by the E23D mutant; however, it took 100 times more of the E23D protein as compared to the wild type to effect the same decrease in form I DNA (Fig. 4B). Similar experiments were carried out at pH 6.8 (Fig. 4C) and pH 8.2 (Fig. 4D), and the trend seen in the loss of form I DNA among the mutant and wild type endonuclease V proteins was similar to that observed in reactions performed at pH 6.0. To further assess the ability of the mutant endonuclease V proteins to nick pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA, a highly sensitive in vitro assay was employed. A 49-base oligonucleotide containing a cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer, annealed to its complementary strand, was used as the substrate in this assay. The ability of the wild type and the various mutant endonuclease V proteins to recognize and nick the thymine dimer-containing DNA was monitored. The enzyme can generate the cleavage product only if it can recognize the thymine dimer and catalyze both the DNA glycosylase and AP lyase reactions. However, if there is only DNA glycosylase activity, treatment of the reaction products with piperidine results in cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at residual AP sites. Four different concentrations of either wild type or mutant enzyme were used in this assay (Fig. 5, A and B). One nanogram of the wild type endonuclease V was able to cleave all of the available substrate. The only mutant which exhibited extremely low levels of nicking activity (less than 1% of the wild type) was the E23D mutant, and this was achieved at a much higher concentration than wild type enzyme. Treating the samples with piperidine after the enzyme reaction did not significantly increase the amount of cleavage products either in the wild type or in the E23D mutant reactions. However, piperidine treatment resulted in δ-elimination, where the C(5)-O-P bond 5′ to the AP site is broken (releasing the deoxyribose sugar moiety), leaving a 3′-phosphate end. As expected, the δ-elimination reaction products migrated with a faster mobility compared to the β-elimination products. To assess the ability of the four mutants to incise DNA at AP sites, an oligonucleotide containing a site-specific AP site was prepared. A 49-base oligonucleotide containing a site-specific uracil was annealed to its complementary strand and reacted with uracil DNA glycosylase to obtain double-stranded DNA with a site-specific abasic site. The wild type and the mutant enzymes were reacted with this substrate. The wild type and the E23D mutant were able to cleave the phosphodiester bond at the AP site (Fig. 6). The amount of AP site-specific nicking by the E23D mutant was approximately 60% that of wild type. However, the E23D mutant seemed to have retained significantly more of the AP lyase activity when compared to its glycosylase activity, as demonstrated in the plasmid and thymine dimer-containing oligonucleotide nicking assays. There was a negligible amount of AP site-specific nicking by the E23Q mutant and no detectable nicking by either the E23H or E23C mutants (data not shown). To ensure that the decrease in nicking activity of the four mutants was not due to a lack of binding to pyrimidine dimers, a gel shift assay was performed. Each of the four mutant proteins was incubated with a thymine dimer-containing 49-mer, which had been prepared as described above. All of the mutants successfully bound to the dimer-containing DNA (Fig. 7A), forming two bands of slower mobility than the free DNA. Since wild type endonuclease V normally nicks this substrate, it is not possible to detect binding of the wild type enzyme by this method. However, the addition of NaBH4 to this reaction reduces the imino intermediate formed between enzyme and DNA (11Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and thus can be used to covalently trap the wild type enzyme to dimer-containing DNA. Fig. 7B shows the binding of both wild type and E23Q proteins to the adducted 49-mer in the presence of either NaBH4 or NaCl. The NaBH4 had no effect on the binding of the E23Q mutant, as would be expected if no imino intermediate were formed between enzyme and DNA (compare lanes 2 and 4 or 3 and 5 of Fig. 7B). The wild type enzyme, on the other hand, bound well to the substrate only when NaBH4 was present (lanes 7-10). In the absence of NaBH4, the wild type enzyme nicked the DNA and only minimally bound to the intact 49-mer (lane 10). We interpret these results to mean that E23Q mutant does not form the imino intermediate with dimer containing DNA. To determine the molecular weight of each of the two bound complexes formed by the mutant proteins interacting with the dimer-containing 49-mer, complexes between E23Q and the 49-mer were separated by electrophoresis through native gels of different polyacrylamide concentrations. The resulting relative mobilities of the complexes and native protein molecular weight standards were then analyzed by an adaptation of Ferguson analysis2(18Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The results of these analyses are displayed in Fig. 8A. Subtracting the molecular weight determined for the DNA alone from the first bound complex results in a molecular weight of 16,000 for the enzyme as bound to the DNA in the faster mobility complex. The slower mobility complex was found to contain an enzyme component of 31 kDa. Thus, the first (faster mobility) complex is the result of one molecule of the E23Q mutant bound to the 49-mer, and the second complex (slower mobility) reflects two enzyme molecules bound to the DNA. Interestingly, wild type endonuclease V covalently trapped to the thymine dimer-containing DNA by NaBH4 forms a single complexed band of the same mobility as the faster mo"

As the IL-2 receptor does not possess intrinsic catalytic activity, the early responses to IL-2 stimulation must be transmitted by receptor-associated cytoplasmic enzymes. One possible candidate for an IL-2 receptor-associated catalytic component is the T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck. Stimulation of T-cells with IL-2 results in serine/threonine phosphorylation of p56lck and induces a transient increase in p56lck kinase activity(5Horak I.D. Gress R.E. Lucas P.J. Horak E.M. Waldmann T.A. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-2 receptor β subunit following IL-2 stimulation(6Mills G.B. May C. McGill M. Fung M. Baker M. Sutherland R. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3561-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence of p56lck involvement in IL-2-mediated signal transduction comes from coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating an in vivo physical association between the IL-2 receptor β subunit and p56lck(7Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).

The association of substrates or other signal transduction components with many cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases is often mediated by src homology (SH) domains found within the amino-terminal half of all known src-like tyrosine kinases(8Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The importance of these motifs in signal transduction networks is also derived from the observation that SH2 and SH3 domains are necessary components of many additional cellular signaling molecules that are not members of the src family of tyrosine kinases, such as the ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP), the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ(9Trahey M. Wong R. Halenbeck B. Rubinfeld G.A. Martin M. Ladner C.M. Long W.J. Crosier K. Watt K. Koths K. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 242: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 10Escobedo J.A.

We have used bacterially expressed p56lck to identify proteins that bind to this protein tyrosine kinase in human T-cells activated by IL-2 or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Our results demonstrate an IL-2 or PHA stimulation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of a 68-70-kDa protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and binding of the tyrosine phosphorylated form of this protein to the SH2 domain of p56lck. Purification and sequence analysis of p70 showed that it was related to the previously described p62, a ras-GAP and nucleic acid-binding protein(15Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction of p70 with p56lck is an important early event in IL-2-induced onset of cell cycle progression in T-lymphocytes. A human lck cDNA clone was used to prepare deleted constructs that were expressed from the bacterial expression vector PGEX-2T (Pharmacia). Each of the cDNA clones was isolated from Blue Script (Stratagene) as an NcoI-EcoRI fragment and ligated into SmaI-EcoRI-digested PGEX-2T or PGEX-3X. The construct designated pG-wt encodes the full-length wild type human lck. Constructs pG-c323, pG-c275, pG-c211, and pG-c117 were all deleted from the 5′ end to codons 323, 275, 221, and 117, respectively, by digestion with exonuclease III. Each of these constructs was ligated into SmaI-EcoI-digested PGEX-2T. Construct pG-st347 was derived from an alternatively spliced lck cDNA clone encoding p56lck SH2 and SH3 domains but not the kinase domain. ( 2L. B. Vogel, D. Fujita, and R. Arthur, manuscript submitted for publication. )All deletions and mutations were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis prior to PGEX subcloning. Expression of fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (Sigma) for 3 h. Harvesting and purification of the fusion proteins by affinity to glutathione agarose was carried out essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Appropriate expression of lck fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting with anti-lck sera 1.7a. Sera 1.7a is an amino-terminal directed rabbit polyclonal antisera that was developed using the fusion protein pG-st347 as antigen. PBLs were isolated from “buffy layer” blood samples obtained from the Canadian Red Cross. Isolation of T-cells from these samples was accomplished in the following manner. White cells were separated from erythrocytes by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The white cell layer was washed several times in 10 × volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove platelets. Finally, T-cell were separated from B-cells, monocytes, and macrophages on a percol gradient(18Guiteirrez C. Berabe R.R. Vega J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1979; 29: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following isolation, PBLs were cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 5 μg/ml PHA (Sigma). After induction with PHA, PBLs were expanded for 48-72 h in the presence of human recombinant IL-2 (Sigma) 20 units/ml. PBLs were grown in the absence of IL-2 for 48 h prior to induction experiments. The human cell line, Molt-4, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 11-day-old C/E chf- embryos (SPAFAS Inc., Norwich, CT) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures of secondary CEFs were transformed by mass infection (multiplicity of infection > 1) with low passage stock of Rous sarcoma virus (strain, SRA). The infected cells were passaged three times within 10 days to ensure complete infection. SRA-transformed CEFs were maintained in the same medium as for CEFs with the addition of 0.6% Me2SO. For experiments, transformed cells or CEFs were seeded and grown to approximately 80% confluent then washed with PBS and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described for T-cells. Cells were lysed at 107/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 3.75 mg/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. In vitro association with immobilized p56lck fusion protein was carried out as follows. Glutathione-agarose-bound fusion protein (50 pmol of fusion protein) was added to 150 μl (300 μg of total protein) aliquots of cell lysate and mixed at 4°C for 1 h in a total volume of 300 μl. The glutathione-agarose-bound fusion protein was then collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40. The washed fusion protein pellets were then boiled in PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with affinity purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Immunoblotted filters were then incubated with 125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit sera (Amersham) then autoradiographed at −80°C. Other sera used for immunoblotting include anti-p62 sera (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-ras-GAP sera (kindly provided by F. McCormick). Filters were also blotted with a biotinylated p56lck fusion protein. Fusion protein construct pG-c221 was coupled at room temperature for 3 h with biotinidocaproate-N-hydroxysuddinimide ester (100 μg/ml, Sigma) at a fusion protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 8.8. Biotinylated fusion protein was purified by extensive dialysis in PBS, 1 mM dithiothreitol and used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20. Biotinylated probes were detected with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20 and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham). Phosphatase treatment of cell lysates was carried out at room temperature for 30 min using alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer) at 25 units/ml in lysis buffer without the addition of Na3VO4 or p-nitrophenylphosphate. Purification of p70 for microsequencing was carried out essentially as for other in vitro association experiments with the following modifications: 2 × 108 Molt-4 cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer. The Molt-4 lysate was then mixed for 1 h at 4°C with 30 μg of glutathione-agarose-bound pG-c221. Following adsorption, the glutathione-agarose pellet was extensively washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schull), stained with ponceau-S (Sigma), and the 70 kDa band excised. Tryptic digestion, HPLC separation and microsequencing of the 70-kDa sample was done by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Boston, MA). To further examine early events during the re-entry of T-cells into the cell cycle, bacterially expressed p56lck fusion proteins (Fig. 1) were employed to assay for p56lck-binding proteins in lysates of IL-2 or PHA-stimulated PBLs. Glutathione-agarose-bound p56lck fusion protein or glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone were incubated with lysates of PBLs, and associated proteins were identified by anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-P-Tyr) immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). No p56lck-associated anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive proteins could be detected in lysates of PBLs that had been deprived of IL-2 for 48 h (Fig. 1B, lane 1 (ST)). However, when PBLs were stimulated with IL-2 or PHA for 5 min prior to lysis, a prominent p56lck-associated anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive protein of approximately 70 kDa was detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 (PHA) and 3 (IL-2)). Experiments using cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate demonstrated that lck-associated p70 became phosphorylated within 2 min following IL-2 stimulation (data not shown). Although less prominent, a 110-kDa p56lck-associated anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive protein was also observed in IL-2- or PHA-stimulated PBLs (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 (PHA) and 3 (IL-2)). Bacterially expressed GST did not bind to any anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive proteins in lysates from the human T-cell line Molt-4 (Fig. 1C, lane 4) or from lysates of PBLs (data not shown). To further assess the growth factor dependence for tyrosine phosphorylation and p56lck binding of p70, we performed p56lck-binding assays using lysates from an IL-2-independent human leukemic T-cell line, Molt-4. Lysates from Molt-4 cells contained a single prominent anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and several fainter signals ranging from 70 to approximately 200 kDa (lane 1, Fig. 1, C and D). Molt-4 cell lysates were mixed with bacterially expressed p56lck or control proteins immobilized on agarose, then separated into bound and unbound fractions. Following incubation with p56lck fusion protein (pG-c211) the unbound fraction of Molt-4 lysate was depleted of an anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive protein at approximately 70 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 3). A 70-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein was observed in the p56lck-bound fraction from Molt-4 lysates but was not observed in the GST-bound fraction (Fig. 1C, lanes 4and 5). In addition, immunoprecipitates of p56lck contained an anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive protein at approximately 70 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 6) indicating that the observed association between p56lck fusion proteins and p70 likely reflects a physiological interaction. The observation that p56lck association or tyrosine phosphorylation of p70 is not dependent on IL-2 or PHA stimulation in Molt-4 lysates, and the absence of a 110-kDa p56lck-associated phosphoprotein (Fig. 1C, lane 5) may represent important differences between leukemic and normal T-cells. An additional phosphotyrosine-containing protein of approximately 85 kDa was observed to associate with p56lck in some experiments (Fig. 1C, lane 5). We have previously demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity from leukemic T-cell lines binds to the SH3 domain of p56lck(19Vogel L.B. Fujita D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the broad anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive band at approximately 85 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 5) represents the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. We are currently investigating this possibility. To identify the p56lck sequences required for association with the 70-kDa phosphoprotein, an overlapping series of carboxyl-terminal-deleted p56lck fusion proteins were mixed with T-cell lysates, and p56lck-bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-tyr sera. The lck fusion proteins pG-c323 and pG-c275 both encode for the amino-terminal half of p56lck including the unique region, the SH3 domain, the SH2 domain, and 122 or 54 amino acids, respectively, of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1A). Deleting either a portion or the entire catalytic domain from p56lck had no effect on the ability of p70 to associate with p56lck (Fig. 1D, lanes 2-4). However, when 104 amino acids comprising the p56lck-SH2 domain were deleted, p70 was not detected in association with p56lck (Fig. 1D, lane 5). These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated form of p70 requires the SH2 domain for association with p56lck. To assess the phosphotyrosine dependence of the association between p56lck and p70, we performed binding experiments using cell lysates prepared in the presence (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1) or absence (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2) of phosphatase inhibitors. In the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, the p56lck-bound fraction from T-cell lysates contained no detectable anti-P-Tyr immunoreactive proteins (Fig. 2A, lane 2). However, when lck-associated proteins were detected by blotting with biotinylated p56lck, a reduced level of dephosphorylated p70 could still be observed in the lck-bound fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Identical results were obtained using cell lysates pretreated with phosphatase (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that p70 is able to interact with p56lck in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner and suggest that a fraction of p70 is cabable of binding to either the unique region or the SH3 domain of p56lck. The p56lck-associated protein (Fig. 2, panel B) with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa has not been identified, but proteolytic digestion and comparison of fragment sizes with p70 indicate that p65 is not a dephosphorylated form of p70 (data not shown). It is possible that p56lck-associated p65 corresponds to the 65-kDa heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K recently identified in src-p68 protein complexes(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Proteins binding to p56lck were isolated from Molt-4 lysates by affinity purification with p56lck fusion protein pG-c221. Two prominent protein bands of 65 and 70 kDa were observed by staining with Coomassie Blue. These two proteins were observed to bind specifically to p56lck fusion proteins and not to GST alone or other GST constructs (data not shown). The 70-kDa p56lck-associated protein was isolated as described under “Materials and Methods,” and two tryptic peptides were sequenced to identify a total of 25 amino acids with a high degree of confidence. Both peptide sequences (Fig. 3) revealed complete identity with the GAP-associated p62 sequence derived from a human placental cDNA(15Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To further characterize the association of p70 with endogenous p56lck, we analyzed anti-p56lck immunoprecipitates and p56lck fusion protein-associated molecules by immunoblotting with anti-p62 sera. Anti-p56lck immunoprecipitates contained a protein at 70 kDa that cross-reacted with anti-p62 sera (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The 70-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein from T-cell lysates that bound to bacterially expressed p56lck was also recognized by the anti-p62 sera (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Whole cell lysates from human leukemic T-cells contained an anti-p62 immunoreactive band (Fig. 4B, lane 2) at approximately 70 kDa that comigrated with the p62 immunoreactive protein associated with bacterially expressed p56lck (Fig. 4B, lane 1). A p62 immunoreactive band was not observed in control immunoprecipitates utilizing non-immune rabbit sera (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Identical results were obtained with IL-2-activated PBLs (data not shown). p62 was first identified as a GAP-associated protein in v-src-transformed fibroblast cell lines(15Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To investigate the apparent difference in molecular weight between GAP-associated p62 and lck-associated p70, we examined p62 immunoreactive proteins in human and mouse fibroblast cell lines and v-src-transformed CEFs. Additionally, to determine if lck-associated p70 could interact with GAP we examined anti-GAP immunoprecipitates from T-cell lysates for the presence of p62 immunoreactive proteins. Three major p62 immunoreactive proteins were observed in lysates from a human fibroblast cell line including a protein of approximately 70 kDa (Fig. 5A, lane 1). In lysates of mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) only one p62 immunoreactive protein at approximately 70 kDa was observed (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Lysates from src-transformed CEFs also contained only one p62 immunoreactive protein, but this protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65-66 kDa (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The p62 immunoreactive protein in CEFs was immunoprecipitated with both anti-p62 serum as well as anti-GAP serum and also associated with p56lck fusion protein (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6). In human leukemic T-cell lysates (Molt-4) (Fig. 5A, lane 8), the most prominent anti-p62 immunoreactive protein was observed at approximately 70 kDa. This 70-kDa protein from Molt-4 whole cell lysates comigrated with the most prominent p62 immunoreactive protein associated with bacterially expressed p56lck (Fig. 5A, lane 7). The p56lck-bound fraction also contained a p62 immunoreactive protein at approximately 65 kDa that comigrated with the p62 immunoreactive protein from anti-GAP and anti-p62 immunoprecipitates from SRA transformed CEFs. Upon longer exposure a p62 immunoreactive protein could also be observed at this position in whole cell lysates from Molt-4 cells (data not shown). However, anti-GAP immunoprecipitates from Molt-4 cells did not contain either a 65- or a 70-kDa p62 immunoreactive protein (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Consequently, the observation of a 65-kDa p62 immunoreactive protein in anti-GAP and anti-p62 immunoprecipitates, as well as in the p56lck-bound fraction from SRA-transformed CEFs and Molt-4 cells, suggests that there is more than one form of p62. Alternatively, these observations may indicate a nonspecific cross-reactivity of the p62 serum. Bovine serum albumin is an obvious contaminant of tissue culture samples that migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa. However, anti-p62 sera was not observed to cross-react with bovine serum albumin (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes are a good source of naturally synchronized cells that have been used to describe the ordered activation of cyclin-dependent kinases during the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle(3Furukawa Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Ernst T.J. Kanakura Y. Griffin J.D. Science. 1990; 250: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell.

Most recently, IL-2 has been shown to down regulate p27kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2(2Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We have found that an early event in IL-2- or PHA-induced cell cycle progression in T-cells involves phosphorylation of p70 and association of phosphorylated p70 with the SH2 domain of p56lck. Recently, a similar molecule has been shown to associate with activated c-Src in mitotic fibroblasts but not in asynchronously growing cells(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D.

Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), indicating that p70 phosphorylation and interaction with src family tyrosine kinases may be a common regulatory feature of cell cycle progression. Amino acid sequence data indicated that p56lck-associated p70 is either equivalent or closely related to the GAP-associated p62. However, we have not observed p70 in association with anti-GAP immunoprecipitates from T-cell lysates. In addition, we have not observed anti-GAP immunoreactive proteins in p56lck immunoprecipitates or associated with p56lck fusion proteins following incubation with T-cell lysates (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the recent observations that src-associated p68 also does not bind to GAP(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge A.S. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is likely that p70 represents the product of an alternatively spliced or post-translationaly modified form of p62 that does not associate with ras-GAP. We have observed that the tyrosine phosphorylated form of p70 binds to the SH2 domain of p56lck. However, we have also observed that a proportion of dephosphorylated p70 remains bound to p56lck and probably interacts with p56lck in an SH2-independent fashion. Although we have not demonstrated binding of dephosphorylated p70 to the SH3 domain of p56lck, we feel that SH3-directed association of dephosphorylated p70 is likely because GAP-associated p62 (15Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) contains proline-rich sequences that may mediate SH3 binding(23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), and because p68 has been shown to interact with the SH3 domains of both src and fyn(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge A.S. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Our observation of SH2-dependent, as well as SH2-independent association between p56lck and p70, together with the recent demonstration of SH3-directed association of p68 to src and fyn(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge A.S. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) suggests that tyrosine kinase-p70 complexes may exist in distinct pools within the cell. It will be interesting to determine if there are separate pools of p56lck-p70 complexes and, if so, to ascertain whether or not the relative size of each fraction is determined by the activation state of p56lck. The identity of the 110-kDa phosphoprotein binding to p56lck in IL-2- and PHA-stimulated PBLs has not been investigated. However, it is possible that this protein is the microtubule-associated GTPase, dynamin, that is known to bind SH3 domains (24Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and has also been observed to coassociate with src-p68 complexes(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined as to why p110 was observed to associated with p56lck in lysates of activated PBLs but not in lysates of leukemic T-cells. It is possible that p110 from leukemic T-cells either did not bind to p56lck or that binding was not detected because p110 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated. In either case this could be an important distinction between normal versus leukemic T-cells. The physiological significance of p70 binding to p56lck in activated lymphocytes is not known. Although GAP-associated p62 has homology to RNA-binding proteins and can bind RNA(15Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), its function is not known. Additionally, it is possible that p70 does not share a functional homology with GAP-associated p62, as p70 and src-associated p68 do not associate with GAP(20Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, evidence is accumulating which links signal transduction through receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases to a family of small GTPase proteins(25Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 26Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R.

Cell. 1992; 69: 389-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although we did not observe association between p70 and GAP, it is possible that p70 binds to additional GTPase-regulating proteins. Others have observed a 32-kDa protein with GTPase activity in association with CD4-p56lck and CD8-p56lck T-cell receptor complexes(28Telfer J.C. Rudd C.E. Science. 1991; 254: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that the p56lck-p70 complex may interact with GAP-like proteins distinct from ras-GAP. In conclusion, several members of the src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in regulating aspects of T-cell signaling by virtue of their ability to interact with the IL-2 receptor (7Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) or components of the T-cell antigen receptor complex(29Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 875-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Bolen J.B. Thompson P.A. Eiseman E. Horak I.D. Adv. Can.

Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Evidence derived from other cell systems also indicates that src-like tyrosine kinases may participate within multi-enzyme signal transduction complexes in which many interactions are regulated by SH2 domains and tyrosine phosphorylation (8Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 16Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Our observation that a 70-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein bound to the SH2 domain of p56lck following IL-2 or PHA stimulation of PBLs may indicate a GTPase-linked component of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling in mitotically activated T-cells. The stimulation-dependent phosphorylation of p70 and association with p56lck in PBLs contrasts with the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck-associated p70 in human leukemic T-cells and may indicate an important difference related to IL-2 independent growth of leukemic T-cell lines."

However, phosphatidylinositol, which is efficiently cleaved by PI-PLC, is a very poor substrate for GPI-PLC. We examined GPI-PLC substrate requirements using glycoinositol analogs of GPI components as potential inhibitors. Glucosaminyl(α1→6)-D-myo-inositol (GlcN(α1→6)Ins), GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate, GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins, and GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate inhibited GPI-PLC. GlcN(α1→6)Ins was as effective as Man(α1→4)GlcN(α1→6)Ins; we surmise that GlcN(α1→6)Ins is the crucial glycan motif for GPI-PLC recognition. Inhibition by GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate suggests product inhibition since GPIs cleaved by GPI-PLC possess a GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate at the terminus of the residual glycan. The effectiveness of GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins indicates that the D-myo-inositol (Ins) 2-hydroxyl is not required for substrate recognition, although it is probably essential for catalysis. GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-L-myo-inositol, unlike GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins, had no effect on GPI-PLC; hence, GPI-PLC can distinguish between the two enantiomers of Ins. Surprisingly, GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate was not a potent inhibitor of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC, and GlcN(α1→6)Ins had no effect on the enzyme. However, both GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate were competitive inhibitors of PI-PLC. These observations suggest an important role for a phosphoryl group at the Ins 1-position in PI-PLC recognition of GPIs. Other studies indicate that abstraction of a proton from the Ins 2-hydroxyl is not an early event in PI-PLC cleavage of GPIs. Furthermore, both GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-L-myo-inositol inhibited PI-PLC without affecting GPI-PLC. Last, the aminoglycoside G418 stimulated PI-PLC, but had no effect on GPI-PLC. Thus, these enzymes represent mechanistic subclasses of GPI phospholipases C, distinguishable by their sensitivity to GlcN(α1→6)Ins derivatives and aminoglycosides.

In the mammalian host, T. brucei is protected by a surface coat composed of a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG).

Thus, the enzyme could be involved in catabolism either of the VSG GPI anchor or of GPI biosynthetic intermediates. Nothing has been reported on the catalytic mechanism of GPI-PLC.

Interestingly, when VSG and PI are present in the same reaction mixture at identical concentrations, GPI-PLC selectively cleaves VSG(6Mensa-Wilmot K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that glycan constituents of GPIs might be important for substrate recognition. Accordingly, we tested synthetic glycan components of EtN-phospho-6Man(α1→2)Man(α1→6)Man(α1→4) GlcN(α1→6)-myo-Ins, the “conserved protein-GPI core,” as potential inhibitors of GPI-PLC. We report that GlcN(α1→6)Ins is probably the major glycan determinant of GPI-PLC specificity. Similar studies with GlcN(α1→6)Ins and its derivatives on B. cereus PI-PLC indicate that steps toward cleavage of the identical GPI phosphodiester are different between GPI-PLC and PI-PLC.

Structures were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy or microanalysis. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a GE QE-300 apparatus. All proton assignments were confirmed by the appropriate coupling J-values.2 Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan gas chromatography/mass spectrometer Model 4600 apparatus using either methane or isobutane positive ion chemical ionizations. PI, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were dried under a stream of nitrogen (to remove the chloroform in which the manufacturer shipped them) and thoroughly resuspended at 20 mM in the appropriate assay buffer immediately before use. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), G418, and glycan components of the conserved protein-GPI core and their analogs were dissolved at 20 mM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −20°C. A GPI-PLC reaction mixture was assembled on ice in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The quantity of GPI-PLC (or PI-PLC; see below) used was determined empirically. Varying amounts of each phospholipase C were added to substrate under the specified standard conditions (see below), and the reaction was terminated after 15 min at 37°C. The amount of enzyme that cleaved ∼60% of [3H]myristate-labeled VSG was used in the kinetic analysis, ensuring that one stayed within the linear range of the assay. GPI-PLC (19 units, 1.19 ng) was first added to 20 μl of assay buffer (1 × assay buffer = 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), following which inhibitors were added to their specified final concentrations (defined for 30 μl), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. [3H]Myristate-labeled membrane-form VSG (2 μg in 10 μl of 1 × assay buffer) was added, and the tubes were incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by chilling the mixture on ice and vortex mixing with 500 μl of water-saturated 1-butanol (at room temperature). Phases were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 1 min, 25°C). Enzyme activity was quantified by measuring the amount of [3H]dimyristoylglycerol released into the upper butanol phase using a Beckman LS 6000TA scintillation counter(3Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13813-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mensa-Wilmot K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Radioactivity from a mock digest (no enzyme addition) of [3H]myristate-labeled VSG using 30 μl of assay buffer was subtracted as background from all counts obtained. Activity of GPI-PLC obtained without the addition of potential inhibitors in a parallel assay was assigned a value of 100%. Compounds that inhibited [3H]myristate-labeled membrane-form VSG cleavage by >70% at 5 mM were investigated further (see “Interfacial Kinetic Analysis”). Average values from duplicate determinations performed in several independent experiments showed a variation of ≤10%. PI-PLC was diluted into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and added (1 × 10-4 units, 0.17 ng) to 20 μl of PI-PLC buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) (10Low M.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 117-154Google Scholar) with or without inhibitor on ice in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The enzyme assay protocol was similar to that described above for GPI-PLC. Although the interaction between PI-PLC, a soluble enzyme(10Low M.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 117-154Google Scholar, 12Griffith O.H. Volwerk J.J. Kuppe A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and substrate in detergent micelles remains to be clarified, catalysis occurs in the scooting mode on PI or PI/PC vesicles(19Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI-PLC is sensitive to high concentrations of Triton X-100 and n-octyl glucoside(12Griffith O.H. Volwerk J.J. Kuppe A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting enzyme interaction with detergent. Additionally, PI-PLC releases GPI-anchored proteins from the plasma membranes of intact cells(10Low M.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 117-154Google Scholar). Scooting can therefore be assumed as an appropriate model for kinetic analysis of membrane-form VSG cleavage at the interface of the deoxycholate micelles present in the PI-PLC reaction buffer. Deoxycholate micelles (238 μM) are in great excess of PI-PLC (one molecule of PI-PLC/106 micelles of deoxycholate, based on a deoxycholate monomer aggregation value of 10), and preliminary analysis (data not shown) indicated that scooting was a valid model. Effective inhibitor concentration at the micelle interface was expressed as a mole fraction (Xi), the ratio of inhibitor concentration to the sum of inhibitor and detergent concentrations(20Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Jain M.K. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plots of Vo/Vi against Xi/(1 - Xi) (Vo = velocity of the reaction in the absence of inhibitor; Vi = reaction velocity in the presence of inhibitor) were used to determine the mole fraction of inhibitor at which reaction velocity is reduced 2-fold (Xi(50))(20Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Jain M.K. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Concurrently, competitive inhibitors were identified in these plots by two features. 1) Data on the graph could be fit by a linear equation (with a coefficient of determination (r2) of >0.90); and 2) when Xi = zero, Vo/Vi is close to unity within limits of experimental error. If either condition was not met, the points were fit with an exponential curve function of Graph III version 1.01 (Computer Associates International, Inc., Islandia, NY), and inhibition was deemed not competitive. We note that this analysis does not distinguish between uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibition. GPI-PLC is presumed to be bound at the surface of Nonidet P-40 micelles with its active site facing bulk medium, a notion supported by the enzyme's ability to cleave GPI biosynthetic intermediates in vivo on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum(22Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The micelle concentration of 1% Nonidet P-40 is ∼118.4 μM, while the concentrations of GPI-PLC and [3H]myristate-labeled VSG are 1 nM and 1.2 μM, respectively, in the assay. Effective inhibitor concentration at the micelle interface was expressed as a mole fraction (Xi)(20Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Jain M.K. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Xi(50) was determined as described above for PI-PLC. For both GPI-PLC and PI-PLC analysis, the concentration of hydrophilic compounds was included in the denominator for calculation of Xi for two reasons. 1) It emphasizes the interfacial nature of the inhibition events under discussion. Assuming that the interaction of hydrophilic compounds with detergent micelles is transient, the compounds still have to bind enzyme-micelle-VSG complexes to exert their inhibitory effects. 2) It makes for consistency in comparison of data from Fig. 2 with Xi(50) values presented in Table 1. The alternative approach of excluding the concentration of hydrophilic compounds from the denominator in Xi determinations produced similar conclusions, except that in examining Xi(50) values, one was restricted to comparing hydrophilic compounds with each other and, likewise, amphipathic inhibitors with each other. The approach used here eliminates this apparent limitation.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The VSG GPI anchor contains EtN-phospho-6Man(α1→2)Man(α1→6)Man(α1→4)GlcN(α1→6)-myo-Ins 1-phosphodimyristoylglycerol(1Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). T. brucei GPI-PLC can cleave this anchor, releasing dimyristoylglycerol. PI per se is a very poor substrate for GPI-PLC(3Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13813-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fox J.A.

Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); therefore, we hypothesized that the “conserved glycan core” of protein-GPIs, EtN-phospho-6Man(α1→2)Man(α1→6)Man(α1→4)GlcN(α1→6)myo-Ins, might be critical for substrate recognition. Reasoning that individual components of the GPI glycan could be inhibitors of GPI-PLC, Ins, GlcN, and Man were tested; at 5 mM, they had no effect on GPI-PLC activity when added alone or in all possible combinations. Furthermore, Ins 1-phosphate, GlcNAc, and EtN had no effect (data not shown). Consequently, synthetic glycoinositols and their analogs were tested. GPI-PLC assay conditions used for these inhibitor studies (see “Experimental Procedures”) were empirically chosen to be linear with respect to enzyme concentration (Fig. 1A) and time (Fig. 1B), thereby ensuring that effects of potential inhibitors were discernible, as illustrated for GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate (compound VP-601L) (Fig. 1C). The glycan 6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-myo-inositol (GlcN(α1→6)Ins; compound VP-606L) (Fig. 2) inhibited GPI-PLC moderately (28.9%). (All percentage inhibitions are quoted at 5 mM glycan. Variability in sets of duplicate determinations performed on different occasions was <10%.) We then explored whether modifications of GlcN(α1→6)Ins could produce better inhibitors. The addition of a phosphate group to the Ins 1-hydroxyl of VP-606L, resulting in GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate (VP-600L), did not increase inhibitory potency (Fig. 2). However, cyclization of the Ins 1-phosphate to the Ins 2-hydroxyl, forming GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate (VP-601L), increased potency 2.3-fold (over that observed for GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate) to 74.6% (Fig. 2). The glycan O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1,4)-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1,6)-D-myo-Ins (Man(α1→4)GlcN(α1→6)Ins), which extends the conserved protein-GPI glycan core components to three, was only as inhibitory as GlcN(α1→6)Ins. Replacing the Ins 1-phosphate of VP-600L (see above) with Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate increased inhibition of GPI-PLC. GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate (VP-604L) was 2.6-fold more inhibitory (81.1%) than GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate. However, GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-hexyl phosphonate (VFT-2) was not significantly better than GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate (VP-602L) inhibited GPI-PLC (60.3%) (Fig. 2), even though Ins 1-phosphate had no effect on the enzyme (data not shown). Modifications of the amino group of GlcN(α1→6)Ins affected inhibitory properties. Acetylation to GlcNAc(α1→6)Ins (VC-105B) caused a 4.5-fold drop in the inhibition originally observed with GlcN(α1→6)Ins (6.4%) (Fig. 2). Inhibitory activity was partially restored when the methyl group of GlcNAc(α1→6)Ins was replaced by the bulkier N,N-dimethylamino group to produce N-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)-GlcN(α1→6)Ins (VC-109B) (19.3%) (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, N-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)-GlcN(α1→6)Ins was less inhibitory than GlcN(α1→6) Ins. Inositol ring modifications were also examined. Elimination of the hydroxyl group at the Ins 2-position of GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-phosphate (VP-600L) to form GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins 1-phosphate (VP-612L) abolished inhibitory activity (Fig. 2). Interestingly, removal of the phosphate group from VP-612L, forming GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins (VP-615L), re-established inhibitory activity (80.5% inhibition) (Fig. 2). This 2-deoxyIns analog is more potent than the parent compound, GlcN(α1→6)Ins (VP-606L). GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-L-myo-inositol (VP-614L), in contrast to GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins, had little effect on GPI-PLC (1.6%) (Fig. 2). Compounds that inhibited GPI-PLC by >70% at 5 mM (except GlcN(α1→6)Ins and Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate (VP-602L)) were analyzed further to determine their inhibitory potency (Xi(50)) (see “Experimental Procedures” for rationale and approach)(21Jain M.K. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Jain M.K. Rogers J. Hendrickson H.S. Berg O.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8360-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate (VP-601L) and GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins (VP-615L) had Xi(50) values of 0.16 and 0.11, respectively (Table 1). The Xi(50) of GlcN(α1→6)Ins (VP-606L) was not approached under the conditions of our assay. GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate (VP-604L) had an Xi(50) of 0.14 (Table 1). Thus, the inhibitory potency of GlcN(α1→6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate (VP-604L), which is amphipathic, is comparable to that of GlcN(α1→6)-2-deoxy-Ins (VP-615L), a hydrophilic compound. The glycoinositol of VSG GPI is attached by a phosphodiester to dimyristoylglycerol. Since the scissile bond links Ins to a glycerolipid, we checked whether phospholipids or free fatty acids affected GPI-PLC activity. Neither palmitate nor myristate (at 5 mM) inhibited GPI-PLC (data not shown). However, PI, PS, and PG inhibited GPI-PLC by 93.3, 76.3, and 86.5%, respectively (Table 1). The Xi(50) of PI was 0.07 (Table 1). PIs containing either stearate and arachidonate or linoleate and palmitate as their acyl groups were equally inhibitory (data not shown). Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine had relatively little effect (2.7 and 16.5%, respectively), indicating that the inhibition by PI, PS, and PG was specific. PI-PLC cleaves PI initially, releasing two products, diacylglycerol and Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate, the latter of which is slowly hydrolyzed to Ins 1-phosphate(24Volwerk J.J. Shashidar M.S. Kuppe A. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8056-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PI-PLC also c"

INTRODUCTIONThree ras genes encode proteins with Mr values of about 21,000, named Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras. Ras exhibits GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activities. They have two interconvertible forms: GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. The GDP-bound form is converted to the GTP-bound form by the GDP/GTP exchange reaction, which is regulated by GDP/GTP exchange protein, whereas the GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by the GTPase reaction, which is regulated by GTPase-activating protein (for review, see (1Bourne H.R.

Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 35Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Although these results strongly suggest that Ras, c-Raf-1, MEK, and ERK function in the same signaling pathway, no evidence has so far been obtained that GTP-Ras directly activates c-Raf-1 in a cell-free system. Mos is a germ cell-specific kinase that is synthesized to initiate maturation of Xenopus oocytes(36Sagata N. Daar I. Oskarsson M. Showalter S.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1989; 245: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mos has also been shown to be a MEK kinase(22Nebreda A.R. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1979-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Posada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The relationship between Mos and Ras has not yet been clarified. On the other hand, the cDNA of the mammalian Ste11 homologue, termed mSte11, has been isolated from NIH/3T3 cells by use of the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and mSte11 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate MEK (20Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that another MEK kinase, immunoprecipitated by an anti-mSte11 antibody, and B-Raf phosphorylate MEK and that the expression of oncogenic Ras in PC12 cells results in the activation of this MEK kinase and B-Raf(24Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase directly interacts with GTP-Ras but not with GDP-Ras (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) and that GTP-Ras slightly activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a cell-free system (38Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, the direct target molecule of Ras in higher eukaryotes still remains to be fully understood.To identify a direct target molecule of Ras, we have established a cell-free assay system using Xenopus oocyte extract in which Ras activates ERK through MEK(39Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By use of this assay system, we have identified a protein factor, tentatively named REKS (Ras-dependent ERK Kinase Stimulator), for the Ras-dependent MEK activation(39Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have modified this cell-free assay system by use of recombinant MEK and recombinant ERK(40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have, moreover, shown that posttranslationally lipid-modified Ras is far more effective on the activation of REKS (41Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3025-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast adenylate cyclase (42Horiuchi H. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura M. Matsuura Y. Suzuki N. Kuroda Y. Kataoka T. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4515-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) than lipid-unmodified Ras in cell-free assay systems. Kataoka's group (43Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has also reported the similar results for the Ras-dependent activation of yeast adenylate cyclase. It has also been reported that lipid modification of Ras is necessary for the activation of c-Raf-1 in insect cells overexpressing Ras and c-Raf-1(44Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In these earlier reports, it has not been examined, however, whether GTP-Ki-Ras or GTP-Ha-Ras directly interacts with REKS, whether REKS is a protein kinase, or whether REKS is the same as or different from other MEK kinases including c-Raf-1, Mos, and mSte11. In the present study, we have first attempted to highly purify REKS and have addressed these important issues by use of the purified sample.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and ChemicalsPost-translationally lipid-modified Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras were purified from the membrane fraction of insect cells, which were infected with baculovirus carrying the cDNAs of Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras, respectively(6Mizuno T.

GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, GDP-Ki-Ras, and GDP-Ha-Ras were prepared as described previously(6Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The kinase-negative MEK was generated by the site-directed mutagenesis of Lys97 to Trp(45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Recombinant wild-type MEK, kinase-negative MEK, ERK2, and Ha-Ras were purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column as described(46Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). An anti-Ras monoclonal antibody (RASK-4) was kindly provided by H.

An anti-mSte11 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-A-Raf and anti-B-Raf polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Myelin basic protein was purchased from Sigma.REKS AssayREKS activity was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by recombinant GST-ERK2 in the presence of recombinant GST-MEK as described(40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, GDP-Ki-Ras, or GDP-Ha-Ras was added as indicated. Namely, a REKS sample to be assayed was incubated for 10 min at 30°C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 120 μM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 6 mM EGTA, 80 nM recombinant GST-MEK, and 100 nM GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, GDP-Ki-Ras, or GDP-Ha-Ras. After the 10-min incubation, 10 μl of 3 μM recombinant GST-ERK2 was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for additional 20 min at 30°C. Then, 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (600 cpm/pmol), 220 μM myelin basic protein, 10 mM MgCl2, and 6 mM EGTA was added. Incubation was continued for another 10 min at 30°C, after which 30 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a phosphocellulose paper sheet. The sheet was washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry.Preparation of the Cytosol of Xenopus EggsEggs were obtained from fully mature Xenopus laevis females as described(39Itoh T.

Eggs, dejellied with cysteine and washed with modified modified Ringer's solution containing 5.0 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 2.0 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgSO4, 2.0 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA were activated by electric shock as described (48Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) to make them enter into interphase and inactivate endogenous ERK and MEK activities(49Ferrell Jr., J.E. Wu M. Gerhart J.C.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3963-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The cytosol of activated eggs was obtained by centrifugation as described previously(40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Partial Purification of REKS from the Cytosol by Mono Q Column ChromatographyThe cytosol of activated eggs (24 mg of protein, 6 ml) was applied to a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 μM (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride. After the column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A, elution was performed with a 15-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.5 M) in Buffer A, and fractions of 1 ml each were collected. An aliquot of each fraction (15 μl) was assayed for the REKS activity.Coimmunoprecipitation of REKS with GTPγS-Ras by an Anti-Ras AntibodyThe peak 2 (67.5 μl) of the Mono Q column chromatography was incubated with an anti-Ras antibody coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in the presence of [35S]GTPγS-Ki-Ras, [35S]GTPγS-Ha-Ras, [3H]GDP-Ki-Ras, or [3H]GDP-Ha-Ras (22.5 μl) at the final concentration of 500 nM. After the incubation for 30 min at 4°C, the immunocomplex was precipitated and washed 3 times with Buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The precipitate and the supernatant were assayed for the REKS activity. The amounts of Ki-Ras or Ha-Ras in the precipitate and the supernatant were determined by measuring the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP bound to Ki-Ras or Ha-Ras.GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled Glutathione-Agarose Column Affinity Chromatography of REKSTo make GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled or GDP-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column, GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras or GDP-GST-Ha-Ras was prepared as described(6Mizuno T.

GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras or GDP-GST-Ha-Ras (5 nmol each) was separately applied to a glutathione-agarose column (200 μl) preequilibrated with 3.6 ml of Buffer B containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA(46Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar), and the column was washed with 5.0 ml of Buffer B. About 95% of GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras or GDP-GST-Ha-Ras was adsorbed to the column. The REKS sample applied to this column was purified by the Mono S column chromatography as described (40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cytosol of activated eggs (160 mg of protein, 40 ml) was applied and that the elution was performed with a 15-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-1.0 M). After MgCl2 and GTPγS or GDP were added to this REKS sample (3 ml) to give the final concentrations of 15 mM and 10 μM, respectively, in order to prevent the dissociation of guanine nucleotides from GST-Ha-Ras during the application of the REKS sample, the REKS sample was applied to the GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column or the GDP-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column. After the column was washed with 4 ml of Buffer B, elution was performed with 600 μl of Buffer B containing 20 mM reduced glutathione. The eluate fraction of the GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column chromatography was used for the experiments as affinity-purified REKS.Phosphorylation of MEK by REKSAffinity-purified REKS (5 μl) was supplemented with 200 ng of each of GST alone, wild-type GST-MEK, or kinase-negative GST-MEK (40 μl each). The reaction was started by adding the mixture (5 μl) containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol), and 15 mM MgCl2 and continued for 10 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer (25 μl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity of 32P incorporated into MEK was detected by bioimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fujix, Tokyo) as described previously (39Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Affinity-purified REKSAffinity-purified REKS (50 μl) was incubated for 2 min at 30°C with the reaction mixture (5 μl) containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 110 μM [γ-32P]ATP (50,000 cpm/pmol), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer (27.5 μl) and was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Other ProceduresSDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli(51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein by the method of Bradford(52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Immunoblot was carried out as described(40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSPartial Purification of REKS by Mono Q Column ChromatographyThe cytosol of activated eggs was subjected to a Mono Q column chromatography. When each fraction was assayed for the REKS activity, three peaks (peaks 1-3) were detected in the presence of both recombinant MEK and recombinant ERK2 (Fig. 1A). The activity of only peak 2 was enhanced by GTPγS-Ki-Ras but not by GDP-Ki-Ras. In the presence of recombinant ERK2 alone, two peaks were detected in the same fractions as those of peaks 1 and 3 of Fig. 1A (Fig. 1B). The activities of both peaks were independent of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. In the absence of recombinant MEK and recombinant ERK2, only one peak was detected at the same position as that of peak 3 of Fig. 1A (Fig. 1C). This peak was also independent of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. The similar results were obtained when Ha-Ras was used instead of Ki-Ras (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of MEK and ERK revealed that the immunoreactivities of MEK and ERK were detected in fractions 4-6 and 10-12, respectively. These results indicate that peaks 1 and 2 are MEK and REKS, respectively, and that peak 3 contains ERK and an unknown myelin basic protein kinase. These results are essentially consistent with our earlier observations that REKS is required for the Ras-dependent activation of ERK2 through MEK(39Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T.

GTPγS-Ki-Ras was incubated with the peak 2 of the Mono Q column chromatography and anti-Ras antibody-coupled Protein A-agarose beads. After the incubation for 30 min at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged. The REKS activity was recovered in the precipitate but not in the supernatant (Table 1). GTPγS-Ki-Ras was also mostly recovered in the precipitate. In contrast, when the similar experiment was done with GDP-Ki-Ras, GDP-Ki-Ras was mostly recovered in the precipitate, whereas the REKS activity was recovered in the supernatant but not in the precipitate. The similar results were obtained when Ha-Ras was used instead of Ki-Ras (data not shown). We have purified REKS by the Mono S column chromatography as described previously(40Shimizu K. Kuroda S.

By use of this sample, we examined whether REKS interacts with GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras coupled to a glutathione-agarose column. In this large scale experiment, 40 ml of the cytosol of activated eggs was subjected to a Mono S column chromatography under the same conditions as described (40Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the elution was performed with a 15-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-1.0 M). In the large scale of the Mono S column chromatography, the REKS activity became mostly Ras-independent for an unknown reason. However, the activity still absolutely required both recombinant MEK and recombinant ERK2. This REKS sample was collected and subjected to the GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column. The column was washed with Buffer B and was eluted by reduced glutathione. About 60% of the REKS activity was adsorbed to the column and was eluted by reduced glutathione (Fig. 2). This eluate fraction was used for the experiments as affinity-purified REKS. About 80% of GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras was also eluted by reduced glutathione (data not shown). About 40% of the REKS activity was detected in the pass fraction. This reason was not known, but REK"
https://openalex.org/W1501062003,"We have determined the fidelity of DNA replication by human cell extracts in reactions containing excess dGTP. Replication errors were scored using two M13 DNA substrates having the replication origin on opposite sides of the lacZ α-complementation gene. The data suggest that the average rates for replication errors resulting from G(template), T•dGTP, and A•dGTP mispairs are 25 × 10−6, 12 × 10−6, and 3 × 10−6, respectively. The data also suggest that error rates for both the (+) and(-) strands differ by less than 2-fold when they are replicated either as the leading or lagging strand. This is in contrast to the 33- and 8-fold differences observed earlier for G•dTTP and C•dTTP mispairs on the (+) strand when replicated by the leading or lagging strand complex (Roberts, J. D., Izuta, S., Thomas, D. C., and Kunkel, T. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1711-1717). Thus, the relative fidelity of the leading and lagging strand replication proteins varies with the mispair and sequence considered. Misincorporation of dGTP preferentially occurs at template positions where dGTP is the next correct nucleotide to be incorporated. This “next nucleotide” effect is characteristic of reduced exonucleolytic proofreading and suggests that these replication errors are normally proofread efficiently. Fidelity measurements performed in the absence or presence of dGMP, an inhibitor of proofreading exonuclease activity, suggest that the leading strand replication complex proofreads some mispairs more efficiently than does the lagging strand replication complex.

Fidelity measurements performed in the absence or presence of dGMP, an inhibitor of proofreading exonuclease activity, suggest that the leading strand replication complex proofreads some mispairs more efficiently than does the lagging strand replication complex. Studies with purified DNA polymerases performed during the last 25 years have been invaluable for understanding the basic principles for accurate DNA polymerization (reviewed in Echols and Goodman(1991), Kunkel(1992), and Johnson(1993)). These studies have shown that several discrimination steps in the reaction cycle determine the selectivity for correct nucleotide incorporation and the efficiency of exonucleolytic proofreading. They have also revealed that the fidelity of polymerization reactions can be highly variable, depending on the DNA polymerase under study, the type of error being considered (e.g. base substitution versus frameshift), the base composition of the mispair or misalignment, the symmetry of the error (e.g. T•dGTP ( 1The abbreviations used are: T•dGTPmisincorporation of dGTP opposite template TG•dGTPmisincorporation of dGTP opposite template GA•dGTPmisincorporation of dGTP opposite template AdNTP(s)deoxynucleoside triphosphate(s). )versus G•dTTP or addition versus deletion intermediate), and the local sequence surrounding the error. misincorporation of dGTP opposite template T misincorporation of dGTP opposite template G misincorporation of dGTP opposite template A deoxynucleoside triphosphate(s). As complex as these model polymerization reactions are, replicating the entire genome of an organism is much more complicated. More than one DNA polymerase and several accessory proteins are required to replicate the two antiparallel strands coordinately. Thus, a full appreciation of how genomes are stably replicated and how instability may arise to generate disease requires a better understanding of the fidelity of this complex replication machinery. An important step toward achieving this understanding has been the development of systems that replicate double-stranded DNA in vitro. One system for studying human genomic replication depends on the SV40 origin of replication (for recent review, see Stillman(1994)). Circular double-stranded DNA substrates containing the SV40 origin can be fully replicated by the proteins present in human cells, with only the addition of SV40 large T antigen needed to initiate replication at the origin. These factors can be supplied either by crude extracts of human cells grown in culture or by reconstitution with purified proteins prepared from such extracts (Waga and Stillman, 1994). At least two DNA polymerases, α and δ, are among the host factors required for complete DNA replication (Lee et al., 1989; Weinberg and Kelly, 1989; Melendy and Stillman, 1991). Additional host proteins are required for specific initiation at the origin, for chain elongation on the leading and lagging strands, and for completion and separation of the daughter molecules. As measured with DNA substrates containing reporter genes for scoring replication errors, SV40 replication in unfractionated cell extracts has been found to be highly accurate (Roberts and Kunkel, 1988; Hauser et al., 1988). Replication is in fact more accurate than DNA synthesis by either the 4-subunit DNA polymerase α-primase complex or DNA polymerase δ with its associated 3′→5′ exonuclease (Thomas et al., 1991). Further investigation of highly accurate replication thus requires reaction conditions that generate replication errors above the background frequencies of existing fidelity assays. One approach has been to replicate damaged DNA (Carty et al., 1992; Thomas and Kunkel, 1993; Thomas et al., 1993, 1994). Another strategy is to replicate undamaged DNA using a damaged dNTP (Pavlov et al., 1994). Still a third approach uses undamaged substrates in reactions containing unequal concentrations of dNTPs to force errors that revert specific pre-existing substitution (Roberts and Kunkel, 1988; Roberts et al., 1991) or frameshift mutations (Bebenek et al., 1992; Roberts et al., 1993). In order to define SV40 replication fidelity with respect to the type, base composition, symmetry, and location of errors, we are performing experiments using a fidelity assay that detects a variety of substitution, deletion, and addition errors in a target sequence of several hundred base pairs. The first such study used reactions containing excess dTTP to force a specific subset of replication errors (Roberts et al., 1994). Two of twelve possible substitutions as well as single-nucleotide frameshifts were induced by this substrate imbalance. Errors were found throughout the 250-base pair target, but they were distributed non-randomly. Two hot spots were observed, one for a G → A transition and one for the loss of a G•C base pair in a homopolymeric run. Examination of the fidelity of replication of the same sequence when copied as the leading or lagging strand suggested that the overall error rates for G•dTTP and C•dTTP mispairs as well as the error rates at the two hot spots depended on whether replication was performed by leading or lagging strand replication proteins. The current study presents two sets of experiments intended to expand our understanding of the fidelity of the human replication apparatus. The first set describes replication fidelity in reactions containing excess dGTP to define a new set of substitution and frameshift error rates on the leading and lagging strands that are forced by this substrate imbalance. This pool bias provides information on 3 more of the 12 possible mispairs, and the observed error specificity further suggests that proofreading contributes to replication fidelity. The analysis also reveals a base substitution hot spot that is detected as a lagging strand error but not as a leading strand error. A similar observation was made in the earlier study with excess dTTP (Roberts et al., 1994), but it was for a different mispair at a different location. In both cases, the error specificity is consistent with the possibility that some mispairs are more effectively proofread during leading strand replication than during lagging strand replication. The second set of experiments was performed to examine this possibility. Bacteriophage, bacterial strains, enzymes, and reagents were from previously described sources (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993; Roberts et al., 1994). Fractions CFI′ and CFII were kindly provided by Thomas J. Kelly (The Johns Hopkins University). All procedures, including performance and processing of replication reactions, transfections, plating, mutant scoring, plaque hybridization assays, and sequencing of mutants, were as described (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993; Roberts et al., 1994). The M13mp2SV Ori left and Ori right vectors have been described (see Fig. 1 in Roberts et al.(1994)). Both contain 7398 base pairs and carry the lacZ α-complementation target, comprising nucleotides −84 to +170 of the lacZ gene, where +1 is the first transcribed nucleotide. As a reference point for the distance from the SV40 origin to the target, we use the transition from discontinuous to continuous replication (nucleotide 5210 in SV40 DNA) (Hay and DePamphilis, 1982). To fully replicate the lacZ target, the closest replication fork emanating from the origin must proceed 594 base pairs for Ori left and 403 base pairs for Ori right. The products of SV40 origin-dependent replication in vitro were introduced into Escherichia coli cells by electroporation to assess replication fidelity by scoring lacZ α-complementation mutant frequencies. Correct replication produces DNA that yields dark blue M13 plaques on indicator plates, whereas errors are seen as lighter blue or colorless plaques. Because the assay measures loss of a gene function that is not essential for phage production, a variety of mutations at different sites can be recovered and scored (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993). These include 482 substitution errors and the loss or gain of any of 174 different base pairs. Mutant frequency results with the Ori left and Ori right vectors can be compared to define fidelity on the leading and lagging strands. The approach has been described in detail elsewhere (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993; Roberts et al., 1994). Briefly, the logic is as follows. The Ori left substrate contains the SV40 origin a few hundred nucleotides to the left of the reporter gene, a distance that is short relative to the size of the vector. Because the rate of replication fork movement is known to be similar in both directions from the origin (Li and Kelly, 1985), the (+) strand of the lacZ gene is likely to be encountered first by the closest fork emanating from the origin and, thus, replicated as the lagging strand (see Fig. 2 in Roberts et al.(1994)). In contrast, because the Ori right vector contains the origin a few hundred nucleotides on the other side of the target, the (+) strand of the lacZ gene is inferred to be replicated as the leading strand. Comparative fidelity measurements (mutant frequency determinations followed by DNA sequence analysis of mutant collections) with the two vectors permit estimation of the fidelity of replication of the same sequence by either leading or lagging strand proteins, so long as the strand on which the error was made can be assigned. In this study, this is inferred to be those mutations consistent with dGTP misincorporation. Replication reactions with M13mp2SV Ori left DNA were performed with HeLa cell extracts in the presence of excess dGTP. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the resulting replication products demonstrated that they were similar to those obtained from reactions containing equimolar dNTPs (not shown, but see Fig. 1 in Roberts and Kunkel(1988)). Mutant frequency determinations for replicated DNA samples demonstrated that reactions containing less than a 100-fold dGTP imbalance did not increase mutant frequencies above that of DNA replicated with equimolar dNTPs (not shown). However, the mutant frequency of DNA replicated in HeLa cell extracts with a 100-fold excess of dGTP was increased (Table 1). We repeated the experiment with the Ori left vector and performed three similar experiments with the Ori right vector. Each time, similar results were obtained (Table 1). The observation that the increases in mutant frequencies were small despite the presence of a 100-fold excess of dGTP is consistent with our previous interpretation that replication in HeLa cell extracts is highly accurate (Thomas et al., 1991).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The reproducible increases in mutant frequency suggest that many of the mutants obtained from replication products may have resulted from incorporation of dGTP during replication. To examine this possibility, the DNA sequences of 104 mutants from excess dGTP-containing reactions with Ori left substrate and 180 mutants from reactions with the Ori right substrate were determined for nucleotides −84 through +170 of the lacZ α-complementation gene. Sequence changes were found in 76 Ori left mutants and 117 Ori right mutants (Table 2). The remainder had no change in the 254-nucleotide target sequence. We have previously reported (Roberts et al., 1994) that, with a dTTP bias, some mutants had changes between positions 170 and 479, the remaining downstream lacZ gene sequence in M13mp2. Although that may be the case here as well, we did not analyze sequences beyond position 170, as this would have more than doubled the sequencing effort.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Sixty-six of the 76 mutants from the Ori left template contained a single-base substitution (Table 2), 54 of which were consistent with misincorporation of dGTP opposite template G (29 mutants), template T (23 mutants), or template A (2 mutants). For the Ori right vector, 101 of 117 mutants contained a single base substitution, 60 of which were consistent with misincorporation of dGTP opposite template G (36 mutants), template T (19 mutants), or template A (5 mutants). This pattern of substitutions is very different from that found in a previous study employing excess dTTP, where most substitutions were inferred to have resulted from dTTP opposite template G and C residues (Roberts et al., 1994). In addition to the substitutions, 7 frameshifts of 1 nucleotide were observed with the Ori left substrate (Table 2), 6 of which were deletions. With the Ori right substrate, 11 frameshift errors of 1 nucleotide were obtained; 6 were deletions, and 5 were additions. The distribution of the 18 single-base frameshifts and of single-base substitutions consistent with dGTP misincorporation is shown in Fig. 1. The mutants are not randomly distributed. For example, with the Ori left substrate (mutants shown above each line of primary sequence in Fig. 1), 9 of 23 mutants consistent with misincorporation of dGTP opposite template T are at one template site, position 121. In contrast, one or no mutants were observed at 39 of the 45 other sites where this transition substitution can be scored (underlined nucleotides in Fig. 1). Also, only one of 19 mutants consistent with misincorporation of dGTP opposite template T was observed at position 121 with the Ori right vector. Similarly, site- and vector-specific non-random mutant distributions were observed using a dTTP bias (Roberts et al., 1994). As would be expected for reactions performed with excesses of different dNTPs, the locations and types of errors found in that earlier study were very different from those shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. The error rates on both the (+) and(-) strands for both vectors were calculated for G•dGTP, T•dGTP, and A•dGTP mispairs (Table 3). Rates are expressed per detectable nucleotide incorporated to correct for small differences in the number of detectable sites for each type of error on each of the two strands. For all three mispairs, note that the same sequence, whether a (+) or(-) strand, is replicated with similar accuracy regardless of the orientation of the origin relative to the lacZ target sequence. This is in marked contrast to previous observations with the same assay for reactions containing excess dTTP (Roberts et al., 1994). In that study, on the (+) strand, there were 33- and 8-fold differences in rates for G•dTTP and C•dTTP errors, respectively, between the Ori left and Ori right vectors.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In order to establish the reproducibility of these observations, we repeated the fidelity analysis by reconstituting replication reactions from fractions (designated CFI′ and CFII) obtained from column chromatography of extracts (Wold et al., 1988). Because reconstituted reactions perform replication but not mismatch repair (Roberts et al., 1994), this analysis has the added advantage of examining replication fidelity in the absence of the mismatch repair that is known to occur in extracts (Thomas et al., 1991). Reconstituted replication reactions with excess dGTP were performed twice with each vector. All four mutant frequencies obtained were between 31 and 37 × 10-4. These values are slightly higher than those obtained with extracts (Table 1). DNA sequence analysis of collections of mutants showed error specificity similar to that observed with the extract (not shown). With both vectors, the majority of substitutions was again consistent with misincorporation of dGTP (29 of 34 with Ori left and 44 of 49 with Ori right) opposite template T or G. As with the extract, when the two vectors were compared, no significant differences in overall substitution error rates on the (+) or(-) strands were detected for either mispair. To see whether substitutions occurred preferentially at template positions where proofreading might be less active, we analyzed the site specificity of misincorporation. A high concentration of dGTP could diminish proofreading at 5′-C-X-3′ positions (where X is the site of the substitution), because misinsertions of dGTP would be fixed by incorporation of the next correct nucleotide (dGTP) prior to exonucleolytic removal. We therefore compared the error rate per detectable site for each of the three mispairs that were consistent with dGTP misincorporation at sites having a cytosine as a 5′ template neighbor with error rates at sites having any of the other three nucleotides as a 5′ template neighbor. Using the mutant collection obtained for reactions in the extract, dGTP was misincorporated opposite template G at 5′-C-G-3′ sites at an 11-fold higher rate than at 5′-T-G-3′, 5′-A-G-3′, or 5′-G-G-3′ sites (compare 5.0 versus 0.45 in Table 4). The same analysis performed for mutants obtained from the reconstituted reactions yielded values of 2.5 versus 0.05 mutants per site for 5′-C-G-3′ and 5′-S-G-3′, respectively (Table 4), which is a 50-fold difference. Likewise, a 3-fold difference in error rate was observed for the T•dGTP mispair in reactions with extract (Table 4); this difference was also observed in the reconstituted reactions (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab These differences are consistent with diminished proofreading at sites having a neighboring 5′ template cytosine under conditions of high dGTP concentration. At one such site, T121 on the (+) strand (Fig. 1), the misincorporation of dGTP is 12-fold more frequent with the Ori left substrate (error rate of 38 × 10-5) than with the Ori right substrate (error rate of 3.1 × 10-5). In an attempt to examine proofreading at this site, we took advantage of a previous observation that SV40 replication fidelity can be reduced by addition of a known inhibitor of exonucleolytic proofreading, dGMP (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993). We performed parallel replication reactions with and without added dGMP. T → C transitions at position 121 were detected by plaque hybridization with a synthetic oligonucleotide (Roberts et al., 1994). The results (Table 5, top) again reveal a different error rate for misincorporation of dGTP at position 121 between the Ori left and Ori right vectors in the absence of dGMP (Ori left, 19 × 10-5; Ori right, 1.6 × 10-5). Moreover, the presence of 2 mM dGMP increases the error rate at position 121 by 6-fold with the Ori left substrate and by 13-fold with the Ori right substrate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the previous study, employing a dTTP pool bias (Roberts et al., 1994), we observed a situation similar to that just described. A template G at position 145 on the (+) strand was found to be a hot spot for misincorporation of dTTP but only when replicated as the lagging strand. The sequence at this site is 5′-A-G-3′ (nucleotide 145 underlined), and the next correct nucleotide to be incorporated is dTTP. This site is thus suitable for a second test of the contribution of proofreading to fidelity but for a mispair having the reciprocal symmetry (G145•dTTP rather than T121•dGTP). Therefore, we performed parallel reactions containing excess dTTP with and without added dGMP, and monitored G → A transitions at position 145. The results in the absence of dGMP (Table 5, bottom) confirm our previous observation that position 145 is replicated less accurately by the lagging strand apparatus (the Ori left substrate) than by the leading strand apparatus (the Ori right substrate). The addition of dGMP to the reaction increased the error rate with both substrates. An independent repeat of this analysis yielded a similar result (data not shown). From this study we can infer error rates during replication in human cell extracts for the three mispairs involving misincorporation of dGTP. These and earlier results with excess dTTP (Roberts et al., 1994) provide replication error rates for 6 of the 12 possible single-base mispairs, in the following order of highest to lowest error rate: G•dTTP ≈ C•dTTP ≈ G•dGTP ≈ T•dGTP >> T•dTTP ≈ A•dGTP. This same relative order and similar error rates are obtained during replication in extracts and in reconstituted reactions known to lack mismatch repair activity (Roberts et al., 1994), demonstrating the reproducibility of the observations and suggesting that this specificity reflects the average base selectivity and proofreading potential of the human replication apparatus. The error specificity pattern is not characteristic of that obtained with DNA polymerase α, δ (plus proliferating cell nuclear antigen), or ϵ during gap-filling synthesis templated by the same (+) strand lacZ sequence used here (Thomas et al., 1991). Also note that the replication error rates for two of the four transversion mispairs examined, C•dTTP and G•dGTP, are similar to those for the two transition mispairs, G•dTTP and T•dGTP. These transition mispairs are among the most common DNA polymerase misinsertion and mispair extension errors (for review, see Echols and Goodman(1991) and Johnson(1993)). Specificity differences between purified DNA polymerases and the multiprotein replication apparatus could reflect modulation of polymerase fidelity by other proteins. For example, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein reportedly increases the accuracy of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase α (Carty et al., 1992), and the 3′→5′ exonuclease of human DNA polymerase δ is regulated by accessory proteins such as human single-stranded DNA-binding protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and replication factor C (Lee, 1993). As in our earlier study of replication fidelity with excess dTTP (Roberts et al., 1994), errors resulting from the presence of excess dGTP do not occur equally at all template positions. This non-random error distribution represents preferential misincorporation of dGTP opposite certain template T and template G nucleotides (Fig. 1) with an overall preference for those sites followed by a template C (incoming correct dGTP, Table 4). This sequence preference is a hallmark of suppression of exonucleolytic proofreading, wherein dGTP misincorporations are not removed because the high concentration of dGTP also favors polymerization of the next correct nucleotide prior to excision of the error. This neighboring nucleotide effect is seen here for both G•dGTP and T•dGTP errors (Table 4) but was not seen in an earlier study of G•dTTP and C•dTTP errors. These data imply that, at least under the reaction conditions used here, which are required to observe errors with the highly accurate replication machinery, proofreading of all replication errors is not suppressed equally by a high concentration of the next correct dNTP. We noted that several 1-nucleotide frameshift errors at repetitive sequence positions were generated in reactions containing excess dGTP. For example, four mutants contained an extra G•C base pair in a three-base run of G•C base pairs at positions 88-90 and another had one fewer G•C base pair (Fig. 1). These mutations in repetitive sequences were not observed in either of two previous replication fidelity studies (Thomas et al., 1991; Roberts et al., 1994) or among background mutations from unreplicated DNA (Thomas et al., 1991), suggesting that they are dGTP-induced replication slippage errors. Models for their generation have been described (Bebenek and Kunkel, 1990; Roberts et al., 1993; Roberts et al., 1994). SV40 replication in vitro is a complex reaction that utilizes a variety of enzymatic activities and accessory proteins (for review, see Stillman(1994)). These studies have shown that there is an enzymological asymmetry at the replication fork. A major objective of comparing error specificity with the two M13mp2SV substrates was to determine if asymmetric replication enzymology on the leading and lagging strands results in unequal error rates. Initial observations revealed that replication errors inferred to result from misincorporation of dTTP opposite template G and C on the (+) strand occurred at 33- and 8-fold higher rates, respectively, when this strand was replicated as the lagging strand as compared with the leading strand (Roberts et al., 1994). In the present study, we were particularly interested in determining if lagging strand replication is also less accurate with a completely different set of replication errors, those resulting from dGTP misincorporation. Here the pattern that emerged is remarkably different from the earlier study. Although average rates for dGTP misincorporation opposite template T and G were slightly higher for the lagging as compared with the leading strand replication complex (Table 4), the differences were 2-fold or less. This suggests that the relative fidelity of the leading and lagging strand replication complexes varies depending on both the template sequence and the mispair considered. The next nucleotide effect shown in Table 4 suggests that exonucleolytic proofreading modulates site-specific misincorporation of dGTP. One possible explanation for a difference in error rates between the leading and lagging strand replication complexes for the same mispair in the same sequence context is a difference in proofreading activity. To determine if this could explain site-specific differences, we looked for deoxynucleoside monophosphate inhibition of exonuclease activity at positions 121 and 145 on the (+) strand, hot spots for two different substitution errors by the lagging strand complex but not the leading strand complex. The addition of dGMP, a known inhibitor of exonucleolytic proofreading (for review, see Kunkel(1988)), increased the error rate at both sites with both the Ori left and Ori right substrates (Table 5). If one assumes that the addition of dGMP does not affect the inherent base selectivity of the insertion step, then the dGMP-dependent increase in error rate suggests that misinsertions are indeed occurring that, in the absence of monophosphate, are removed by the exonuclease. Because fidelity in the absence of dGMP is higher for both errors during leading strand replication, this suggests that leading strand misinsertions are more effectively excised than are the lagging strand errors that are readily detected even when dGMP is absent. This provides one mechanism that can explain site- and mispair-specific differences in the fidelity of leading and lagging strand replication. Because the assignment of the leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases during eukaryotic replication is not yet definitive (for review, see Linn(1991)), proofreading on the two strands could be carried out by the exonucleases tightly associated with DNA polymerase δ or ϵ, by an exonuclease that copurified with DNA polymerase α-primase (Bialek and Grosse, 1993), or by a separate exonuclease.

(This method does underestimate the AHP that is aligned parallel to the optical axis of the microscope because the linear dichroism of AHP aligned in this way is axially symmetric.) These measurements allow the calculation of the ratio of AHP to total Hb at each point, thereby minimizing artifacts induced by light scattering, thus providing a more accurate measurement of the fraction of AHP than birefringence dependent methods, which are influenced by light scattering. A thorough mathematical treatment of this subject has previously been presented by Kim et al.(30Kim M. Ulibarri L. Bustamante C. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 929-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Kim M. Keller D. Bustamante C. Biophys.

Bustamante C. Wells K.S. Foucar K.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using substantially different instrumentation. It must also be pointed out that our method measures the quantity of aligned hemoglobin polymer, where polymer randomly distributed in a given area would not be detected. In solution studies, the initial rise in light scattering associated with the onset of polymerization is followed by a later rise in birefringence(34Basak S. Ferrone F.A. Wang J.T. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 829-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Mitzukami H. Bartnicki D. Burke S. Brewer G. Mizukami I. Am. J. Hematol. 1986; 21: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This indicates that the initial polymer in the given area is partially randomly arranged and that individual polymer fibers within that area subsequently coalesce and become more aligned. We allowed a 30-min period following deoxygenation prior to fixation to assure that as many polymer fibers became aligned as possible. Our goal is to determine how various physical parameters affect the amount and distribution of AHP within individual deoxygenated sickle red blood cells (SRBC). Using this technique, we demonstrated previously that the amount of AHP within deoxygenated sickle cells may have had little relationship to the external cellular morphology but was related to the number of identifiable individual domains of AHP within the cell(27Mickols W.E. Maestre M.F. Tinoco I.J. Embury S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A specific example of the lack of correlation between amount of AHP and external cellular morphology is the homokentrocyte, a rare type of deoxygenated SRBC that has a normal biconcave disc morphology but a large amount of AHP arranged concentrically within(27Mickols W.E. Maestre M.F. Tinoco I.J. Embury S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also showed that the speed of deoxygenation has only a minor effect on the number of AHP domains in SRBC(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the previous report(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have extended our morphological classification system, which is based on AHP arrangement within the cell and other unique visual characteristics, to include new, more detailed classes. We also present images that show not only the amount of AHP but also its orientation at each point within the cell. We utilized this classification system to assess the effect mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) had on the nucleation and distribution of AHP in intact cells after deoxygenation. Cell populations with increasing average MCHC, which were prepared by fractionating SRBC by density on discontinuous Stractan density gradients, showed a concomitant increase in the average number of AHP domains/cell after deoxygenation. After obtaining informed consent, blood samples from two subjects from the Northern California Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center at San Francisco General Hospital were drawn by venipuncture into heparin. Both subjects were homozygous for sickle cell anemia and had fetal hemoglobin levels below 6%. All cell manipulations were performed within 6 h of venipuncture, and fixed cells were imaged within 2 days. Cells were attached to microscope slides with poly-L-lysine (DP = 66) prior to imaging to restrict the motion of the fixed RBC during the course of the measurement. Discontinuous Stractan density gradients (36Mohandas N. Kim Y.R. Tycko D.H. Orlik J. Wyatt J. Groner W. Blood. 1986; 68: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to separate sickle RBC into six different density fractions. Five 2.0 ml aliquots of Stractan, with densities of 1.085, 1.092, 1.101, 1.107, and 1.122 g/ml, were layered on a cushion of density 1.150 g/ml in 15-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. Packed RBC, previously washed 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M NaCl, 5 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mM glucose), were resuspended in five volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, layered on the Stractan gradient, and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Successive RBC fractions were harvested from the gradient using a Pasteur pipette and washed 5 times in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin. RBC from the 1.085-1.092, 1.092-1.101, 1.107-1.122, and 1.122-1.150 g/ml interfaces were used in the imaging experiments. These fractions had median MCHC values of 31.2, 34.5, 38.7, and 42+ g/dl(36Mohandas N. Kim Y.R. Tycko D.H. Orlik J. Wyatt J. Groner W. Blood. 1986; 68: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 42+ g/dl represents all cells that had densities greater than or equal to 42 g/dl. We observed that reversibly sickled cells were the predominant sickle RBC type in the lightest fraction, a mixture of reversibly sickled cells and irreversibly sickled cells were found in the middle densities, and predominantly irreversibly sickled cells were found in the densest fraction. 4.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were deoxygenated by passing humidified nitrogen over the solution for 30 min with stirring at 37°C. 0.5 ml of a solution of density-separated sickle RBC (50% hematocrit) at room oxygen tension was injected into the deoxygenated solution, causing quick deoxygenation of the cells (final hematocrit, 5%). Monitoring of absorbance changes during separate direct mixing experiments (using equivalent fractions of deoxygenated buffer and oxygenated cells) in normal RBC showed that deoxygenation occurred in 4.5 ± 1 s (data not shown). Deoxygenation in SRBC may occur slightly more rapidly or more slowly, depending on MCHC(48Makhijani V.B. Cokelet G.R. Clark Jr., A. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1025-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The suspensions were then gently swirled under nitrogen for 30 min and then fixed by mixing with an equal volume of deoxygenated 3% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) also at 37°C, and the fixed cells were swirled for a further 30 min. This procedure was performed on all density fractions simultaneously. The microscope employed in these experiments was described in detail elsewhere(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, it consists of a Zeiss microscope with strain-free 32× (N.A. = 0.4) Zeiss objectives used to focus the mercury light source (filtered to 415 nm, 10-nm bandwidth) onto the sample slide and the transmitted light onto a 1024-site Thompson CSF linear diode array. A Pockels cell was modulated at 40 Hz to produce alternately horizontally and vertically polarized light. The sample area imaged by one photosite was approximately 0.3 × 0.3 μm. Since the resolution of the optical system was about 0.6 μm, AHP that curved significantly in 2 pixels or less would not be completely resolved and would display a reduced signal. The array was mechanically scanned across the image plane to produce two-dimensional images. The array measures transmitted intensities of two orthogonally polarized beams, arbitrarily defined as parallel (par) and perpendicular (perp). The absorption (A) of these beams can be related to the differences in transmitted intensities divided by their sum as shown below (for small differential signals) and described previously(27Mickols W.E. Maestre M.F. Tinoco I.J. Embury S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Mickols W.E. Tinoco I.J. Katz J.E. Maestre M.F. Bustamante C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1985; 56: 2228-2236Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Apar −Aperp =2/2.303(Iperp −Ipar )/(Iperp +Ipar )(Eq. 1) Combining this measurement with data obtained with each polarization rotated by 45° allowed for the unambiguous determination of the relative amount, distribution, and orientation of AHP in the cells. The images presented here consist of an absorption image, a differential absorption image, and an angle image. These are proportional to total Hb, AHP, and the orientation of the AHP, respectively. This classification scheme is based on a scheme presented previously(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the addition of two new categories. In the images of red blood cells in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4, there are two black and white images. The right-hand image represents absorption, and we used this to calculate the amount of hemoglobin in the cell. The left-hand image is of the same field of cells but with the gray scale representing AHP. The gray scale coding for absorbance of Hb varies from 0 (black) to 0.5 absorbance units (white) and for the absorbance of AHP from 0 (black) to 0.05 (white) for most images. A domain is defined as an isolated area within an RBC where AHP exists in a single continuous area. Visual inspection of the images of AHP determined the number of domains visible within each cell. We and others previously have shown that the number of domains of AHP is related directly to the number of nucleation sites in certain classes of cells(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Asakura T. Mayberry J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1984; 104: 987-994PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Images of Hb, AHP, and the angular orientation of AHP in sickled red blood cells. As explained in Fig. 1, the lowerright-hand image represents absorption, and the lowerleft-hand image is the same field of cells with gray scale intensity representing the amount of AHP. The colored image (topleft) displays the angular orientation of AHP at each point within the cell and represents the same field of cells. Cell 1 is a classic, sickle shaped, single-domain cell, and cells 2 and 3 are multiple domain cells. Of note is the continuous AHP domain in cell 1 where, by utilizing the angle image, the AHP can be seen to bend gently with the curvature of the cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Images representing three of the RBC densities studied including MCHC of 31.2 (A), 38.7 (B), and 42+ g/dl (C). The cells were separated by density on discontinuous Stractan gradients. The right-hand images, which represent Hb level, reveal an increase in hemoglobin concentration from density A to C as indicated by the increase in the average gray level in the cells (angle images have been omitted for clarity). Cells in A had the largest amount of AHP/cell and contained only a few domains. The number of domains of AHP increased in B and C as hemoglobin concentration increased. This AHP image in C is displayed at a 2-fold higher intensity relative to the others to ensure visibility. As a result, the large number of domains may be difficult to discern as reproduced here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The color portion of the image (topleft) in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 represents the angle of orientation of the AHP at each point within the cells. These images are of the same field of cells as the Hb and AHP images. The colorwheel in the upperright can be used to determine the relationship between color and angle of alignment. The angular orientation of a color within the color wheel represents the orientation of the AHP for pixels in the angle image with that color displayed. For example, green areas in the angle image represent AHP oriented with its long axis left to right and red areas represent AHP oriented top to bottom. This allows the determination of the two-dimensional orientation of the AHP within individual AHP domains. Only pixels with a higher level of AHP than that measured in control (nonsickle) cells have a color displayed. This ensures that spurious angles representing edge polarization or other artifacts are not represented. Depictions of the arrangement of intracellular AHP for each class of cells are shown in Fig. 3. The lines within the cell represent AHP segments. Experimentally, the intracellular AHP arrangement of each cell imaged was deduced from visual inspection of images. These cells exhibit continuous AHP in one, two, or three distinct domains. Cell 1 in Fig. 1 and cell 1 in Fig. 2 are examples of single-domain cells. These cells comprise as much as 48% of the total cells in the least dense (31.2 g/dl) RBC fraction. The angle image of the classically sickle shaped cell 1 in Fig. 2 shows that the AHP follows the curvature of the cell in a single continuous domain, as diagrammed in cell A of Fig. 3. Cell 2 of Fig. 1 has three distinct regions of AHP and represents a three-domain cell as diagrammed in cell D of Fig. 3. Two subsets of the one-three-domain class, central constriction cells and spherulite cells, appeared to contain only a single nucleation site and exhibited unusual AHP distributions. These cells (cells 5 and 6 in Fig. 1) had characteristic sickle cell shapes in the absorption image, but the arrangement of AHP was unusual. The center of the cell contained very little AHP, but the amount of AHP increased rapidly in the outer regions along a single axis to form a dumbbell shape, as diagrammed in Cell B of Fig. 3. The central constriction appears to have been the initial point of nucleation for AHP growth. This shape has been seen during solution polymerization of HbS (34Basak S. Ferrone F.A. Wang J.T. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 829-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in simulations of polymerization(38Dou Q. Ferrone F.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2068-2077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As many as 18% of the total cells in the least dense fraction fall into this class. These cells also appeared to have a single central nucleation site with heterogeneous growth of AHP occurring outward in many directions. They resembled the spherulite domains created by the deoxygenation of purified Hb solutions(22Hofrichter J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 553-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The growth was often limited to discreet arms of AHP. Cell 7 in Fig. 1 is a spherulite cell, and the angle image clearly shows that all of the polymer domains are oriented radially from the center of the cell as diagrammed in cell C of Fig. 3. Approximately 1% of all cells in the least dense fraction were spherulite cells. This class includes cells with more than three and less than approximately 10 domains. Cells 2 and 3 in Fig. 2 are multiple domain cells, and a typical domain pattern is diagrammed in cell E of Fig. 3. These RBC usually contained a smaller measured amount of polymer than one-three-domain cells and were often lumpy and deformed. Four domains was chosen as the cutoff between the one-three and the multiple domain classes because the number of domains in cells with three or fewer domains could usually be determined exactly. This class was represented by cells that contained greater than 10 polymer domains. Careful visual inspection was used to differentiate between this and the multiple domain class. This extension of the multiple domain cell class was chosen to provide a more accurate characterization of the cell population. The measured quantity of polymer was often small in myriad domain cells due to extensive crossing of polymer domains or the inability of the polymer to align (see “Imaging,” below). The external morphology of most of these cells was similar to that of an irreversibly sickled cell. Many of the cells in Fig. 4C are myriad domain cells. A zero-domain cell was one in which the linear dichroism image exhibited no discernible polymer (cell 4 in Fig. 1). The small linear dichroism probably resulted from reflection polarization and changes in the index of refraction at the edges of the cell. A base line value of 1.8% AHP has been determined for normal RBC resulting from these phenomena (7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was similar to the value of 1.7-2.4% AHP found in the zero-domain class (Table 1). The fraction of zero domain cells was less than 9% for all cell densities, except for the least dense fraction, where 20% were zero domain cells. In this fraction, we assumed that the cells had polymerization delay times so long that none or only a very small amount of polymer was formed.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A total of 444 cells were analyzed, and cell fields were selected only so that cells were well separated for accurate analysis. Average MCHC of 31.2, 34.5, 38.7, and 42+ g/dl were obtained by fractionation in Stractan density gradients. The data presented were pooled from identical MCHC fractions of the two subjects, thereby obviating differences in the subjects cell density profiles. For each cell, percentages of AHP were calculated, and the number of domains was determined by inspection. Data from each density fraction were averaged. Fig. 4 includes representative images from three of the RBC densities studied with MCHC of 31.2, 38.7, and 42+ g/dl. The top pair of images (31.2 g/dl, A) exhibited the lowest hemoglobin concentration as indicated by the low gray scale intensity in the absorbance (right-hand) image and a relatively large amount of AHP represented by the high gray scale intensity on the left. In the middle images (B), the hemoglobin concentration was higher (38.7 g/dl), and the number of domains had increased significantly. Fig. 4C, with an MCHC of 42+ g/dl, exhibited the highest Hb absorbance and a large number of domains. This AHP image of Fig. 4C is displayed at a 2-fold higher intensity relative to the others, and the large number of domains may be difficult to discern as reproduced here. The percentage of AHP decreased with increasing cell density when cells from all classes were averaged (Table 1). This is somewhat counterintuitive, because with more hemoglobin available for polymerization, a higher level of AHP would be expected. We believe that there was an increase in the total amount of AHP with increasing cell density but that it was masked by the crisscrossing of AHP domains, reducing the total linear dichroism signal. This was supported by the presence of the highest %AHP in single-domain cells and the lowest in myriad domain cells, regardless of cell fraction involved (Table 1). It was also possible that the alignment that occurred following the initial polymerization phase(34Basak S. Ferrone F.A. Wang J.T. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 829-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Mitzukami H. Bartnicki D. Burke S. Brewer G. Mizukami I. Am. J. Hematol. 1986; 21: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which is responsible for the sizable dichroic signals we measure, was not able to proceed fully in the higher density cells. This was supported by the decrease in the %AHP within each class as MCHC increased (Table 1). As the number of domains reached the extreme present in myriad domain cells, the measured signal was nearly extinguished. %AHP was therefore inversely representative of the number of domains (except in the zero domain case). Histograms of the percentage of AHP/cell for each MCHC clearly indicated a shift toward lower percentages as MCHC was increased (Fig. 5). Another influence on the length of AHP fibers and the size of domains is the shear stress to which AHP is subjected during deoxygenation(40Briehl R.W. Blood Cells. 1982; 8: 201-212PubMed Google Scholar, 41Briehl R.W. Mann E.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 565: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We have not yet examined this variable. Higher MCHC resulted in changes in morphological presentation. As the average MCHC increased, the percentage of one-three-domain cells decreased (Fig. 6A). Conversely, the percentage of multiple domain cells over the same range in MCHC increased (Fig. 6B). For the most dense fraction, which contained the largest percentage of irreversibly sickled cells, there was a smaller percentage of multiple domain cells compared with the second densest fraction and a larger number of myriad domain cells. This supports the evidence that the number of polymer domains increases with increasing MCHC as predicted by supersaturation behavior(16Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 611-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 591-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 42Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Intracellular AHP domains probably play an important role in the flow of sickled RBC through the vasculature(43Kaul D.K. Xue H. Blood. 1991; 77: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the factors regulating domain formation, we measured the number of AHP domains in fixed, sickled RBC populations with various intracellular HbS concentrations. In these experiments, SRBC were separated into narrow density fractions and then deoxygenated in about 4.5 s to approximate conditions in the human circulation. The number of AHP domains, the amounts of Hb and AHP, and the orientation of AHP were determined for each cell. The number and arrangement of AHP in the different density cells provided support that our morphological classification scheme was based on nucleation and growth phenomena(7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D.

Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 611-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol.

The average number of domains present in fully deoxygenated sickled SRBC was found to rise in concert with cellular hemoglobin concentration, while the percentage of Hb existing as AHP decreased. The large number of domains seen in higher density cells implied that overlapping of the AHP domains, or the inability of the AHP to align in higher MCHC cells, was responsible for the reduction in the linear dichroism signal. This would have limited the number of multiple or myriad domain cells with a large percentage of aligned HbS. This reversal in expected distribution was previously calculated and found to fit the experimental distribution(28Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Samori B. Thulstrup E.W. Polarized Spectroscopy of Ordered Systems. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1987: 297-312Google Scholar). The supersaturation theory for polymer nucleation, which describes the fraction of Hb that is insoluble compared with the total amount of Hb, predicts an increase in domain number with increasing MCHC(16Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 611-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 591-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Sunshine H.R. Eaton W.A. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 361-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This theory describes two distinct polymerization phases: homogeneous nucleation, where a small number of Hb molecules form a stable cluster that undergoes subsequent elongation, and heterogeneous nucleation, where nucleation occurs on the surface of existing polymer fibers. Heterogeneous nucleation proceeds more rapidly than homogeneous nucleation and can therefore lead to explosive polymer growth. The dumbbell-shaped domains of central constriction cells and the radial domains of spherulite cells may illustrate this process. It appears that the central constriction point may have been a single homogeneous nucleation site and that the domains of polymer grew by heterogeneous nucleation. Simulations by Dou and Ferrone (38Dou Q. Ferrone F.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2068-2077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have shown that this type of 2-fold symmetry predominates initially with radial or spherulite symmetry dominating at later times. Of the two, central constriction cells predominated here, probably because the cellular Hb was exhausted before full spherulite formation could occur. The striking example of a spherulite cell (cell 7 of Fig. 1) shows that symmetry had begun to approach circular, but again the cellular Hb pool appeared to have become exhausted before a full radial domain was formed. Rare examples of spherulite cells were seen where the radial domain was fully formed (data not shown). Single domain cells exhibited the highest measured %AHP in these studies partly because a single continuous domain generates a large signal with no loss of signal from overlap with other domains. The average %AHP for the 2 densest fractions were similar, but the fraction of myriad domain cells was higher in the most dense fraction. This suggested that cells with MCHC above 38.7 g/dl contained a very large number of AHP domains. The difficulty in determining %AHP accurately for the denser fractions was exemplified by the small differences in the %AHP between myriad-domain cells (those that contain greater than 10 AHP domains) and zero-domain cells (Table 1). For this reason, at higher MCHC, the only observed effect of increasing MCHC (from 38.7 to 42+ g/dl) was an increase in the number of myriad domain cells. This morphological shift was indicative of an increase in the number of AHP domains but was not significantly represented by a large change in the %AHP. The plateau in the percentages of multiple + myriad domain cells at high MCHC could also be representative of a saturation in the number of nucleii formed due to limitations in oxygen diffusion out of the cells(48Makhijani V.B. Cokelet G.R. Clark Jr., A. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1025-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Upon closer inspection of cell 2 in Fig. 2, it is possible to imagine that the bottom and the two rightmost pairs of domains were each individual central constrictions with the leftmost quartet either two central constrictions or a near-spherulite domain. All of these apparent domains could then have resulted from only three individual nucleation sites instead of many more. For this reason, our assignment of the number of domains in cells with many domains may be an overestimation of the number of nucleation sites. As MCHC increases, the supersaturation ratio rises as well (up to 70% with fast deoxygenation(44Noguchi C. Torchia D. Schechter A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)), and this increases the probability of homogeneous nucleation, generating more individual domains of polymer. In accordance with this theory, we saw an increase in the number of domains with increasing MCHC. A rigorous comparison between MCHC and the number of AHP domains would require a knowledge of the exact number of domains/cell, which is not possible with this technique. The persistence of preformed nucleation sites at full oxygenation (7Mickols W.E. Corbett J.D. Maestre M.F. Tinoco Jr., I. Kropp J. Embury S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4338-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would also complicate such a calculation. Sickle (Fig. 3A) and holly leaf (Fig. 3B) shaped cells were found to contain mostly single domains of AHP and are known to be highly undeformable in the deoxygenated state(43Kaul D.K. Xue H. Blood. 1991; 77: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sorette M. Lavenant M. Clark M. Blood. 1987; 69: 316-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These rigid cells may be important in vascular occlusion due to their inability to traverse the narrow confines of the microcirculation. It has been shown that reversibly sickled cells and other poorly deformable sickle cells are important to the rheologic impairment that results in vascular occlusions(43Kaul D.K. Xue H. Blood. 1991; 77: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow studies ex vivo have shown that vaso-occlusion is initiated by adherence of low density sickle cells to vascular endothelium and propagated by the trapping of poorly deformable cells behind these niduses(46Kaul D.K. Fabry M.E. Nagel R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3356-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is important to remember that such cells often result from RBC with low intracellular Hb concentrations and thus long delay times would be predicted. These cells would not be expected to sickle during the time spent in the microcirculation(47Mozzarelli A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Science. 1987; 237: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Uncertainties about full reoxygenation in the lungs and the possibility of preformed nucleation sites existing upon the cells reentry into the microcirculation complicate such predictions.

The 59 protein has been recently purified and found to have a specific affinity for both 32 protein (single-stranded DNA-binding protein) and 41 protein (Yonesaki 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1284-1289). We examined the effects of 59 protein on ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity and DNA helicase activity of 41 protein in the presence or absence of 32 protein. The ATPase activity of 41 protein was strongly inhibited by 32 protein over a wide range of amounts from subsaturation to oversaturation of ssDNA. The 32 protein was also inhibitory toward DNA helicase activity. Addition of 59 protein effectively eliminated these inhibitory effects of 32 protein. Moreover, 59 protein facilitated 41 protein to overcome the barrier to initiate the unwinding reaction with a duplex flanking a single-stranded DNA gap. Intriguingly, 32 protein at an amount optimal for saturation of ssDNA stimulated the overcoming of the barrier when 59 protein was present. For the best circumvention of this initiation barrier, only eight monomers of 59 protein/one DNA substrate molecule containing 2900 nucleotides of ssDNA were required. These results strongly suggest that 59 protein modulates 41 protein activities by forming a complex with 41 protein and that 41 protein can produce recombinogenic ssDNA with the aid of 32 and 59 proteins.

INTRODUCTIONThe protein encoded by gene 41 (41 protein) of bacteriophage T4 has a DNA helicase activity. This protein facilitates the unwinding of double-stranded DNA ahead of the advancing DNA polymerase and accelerates the movement of the replication fork (Nossal and Alberts, 1983). Recently, gene 41 has been further disclosed to participate in DNA recombination (Yonesaki, 1994a). T4 DNA recombination that is promoted by uvsX protein, a T4 homolog of the Escherichia coli recA protein, requires ssDNA ( 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNA. )with a free end as a substrate (Yonesaki and Minagawa, 1985, 1989; Formosa and Alberts, 1986). An exonuclease encoded or controlled by 46 and 47 recombination genes can create ssDNA by expansion of a ssDNA nick into a gap on dsDNA (Hosoda and Prashad, 1972). However, the ssDNA in this gap would not be available for strand transfer by uvsX protein because it has no free end. Alternatively, the gapped DNA would offer a good substrate for 41 protein, which could bind to ssDNA in the gap, hydrolyze ATP or GTP, and slide in the 5′ to 3′ direction to progressively unwind the duplex when the protein travels beyond the gap (Liu and Alberts, 1981; Richardson and Nossal, 1989). The additional ssDNA thus created has a free 3′ end. Therefore, 41 protein is suggested to function in production of recombinogenic ssDNA.The 32 protein, a ssDNA-binding protein, has a high affinity for ssDNA and binds to ssDNA with a strong cooperativity (Alberts and Frey, 1971). The synthesis of this protein is self-regulated according to the concentration of intracellular ssDNA (von Hippel et al., 1983). Therefore, inside a T4-infected cell, ssDNA is considered to be covered by 32 protein. Since 32 protein-covered ssDNA is inaccessible to 41 protein or 32 protein inhibits the binding of 41 protein to ssDNA (Barry and Alberts, 1994), another protein should be required for promotion of the function of 41 protein.The 59 protein exists as a monomer and dispersively binds to ssDNA. The protein has a specific affinity for both 32 and 41 proteins and is capable of rapid binding to ssDNA covered with 32 protein (Yonesaki, 1994b). Barry and Alberts(1994) have found that 59 protein rescues the ssDNA-dependent GTP hydrolysis activity of 41 protein from inhibition by 32 protein, suggesting that 59 protein promotes the binding of 41 protein to ssDNA when this is inhibited by 32 protein. In fact, addition of 59 protein to the in vitro DNA replication system reconstituted by seven purified proteins (32, 41, 44/62, 43, 45, and 61 proteins) greatly stimulates DNA synthesis, presumably by helping quick loading of 41 protein onto 32 protein-covered ssDNA (Barry and Alberts, 1994). Besides acting in DNA replication, gene 59 is also involved in DNA recombination. Like a recombination-deficient mutation of gene 41 (Yonesaki, 1994a), a mutation of gene 59 diminishes the frequency of genetic recombination (Shah, 1976), increases UV sensitivity (Wakem and Ebisuzaki, 1981), and impairs the formation of ssDNA longer than one unit length of T4 genome, which is produced by DNA recombination (Wu and Yeh, 1974). These facts suggest that the 59 protein is necessary for the normal functioning of 41 protein in DNA recombination.Here, we characterize the functional interactions of 32, 41, and 59 proteins in terms of the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity and DNA helicase activity of 41 protein. Our results strongly suggest that 59 protein modulates activities of 41 protein by forming a binary complex of these proteins. Our results also reveal that 59 protein has an essential role in the helicase activity with a single strand-gapped DNA as a substrate.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteinsThe 32 and 59 proteins were purified and stored as described previously (Yonesaki and Minagawa, 1985; Yonesaki, 1994a). The 41 protein was purified according to the method of Hinton et al.(1985) from E. coli ER22 cells (su−endI−) harboring pNT203, which encodes temperature-sensitive repressor of λ phage (Shigesada et al., 1984) and pDH518 (a gift of Dr. Alberts at University of California, San Francisco), which encodes 41 protein (Hinton et al., 1985). The concentration of protein was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For dilution of each protein, we used the following buffers: 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 25 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml DNase-free bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50% (v/v) glycerol for 32 and 59 proteins, and the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM magnesium acetate for 41 protein.Substrate DNAs for Helicase ReactionThe ssDNAs, 50 nucleotides long and 80 nucleotides long, were chemically synthesized with a GENE ASSEMBLER PLUS (Pharmacia LKB). The former ssDNA had a sequence complementary to pBluescript II KS+ DNA. The latter one had the same sequence in 5′-50 nucleotides as the former and the unrelated sequence to pBluescript II KS+ DNA in 3′-30 nucleotides (Fig. 1). After these DNAs had been labeled with 32P at their 5′-end by use of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara shuzo), 14 μmol of each DNA was mixed with 14 μmol of pBluescript II KS+ DNA in a buffer of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 500 mM NaCl, followed by annealing for 2 h at 65°C. Under these conditions, almost all short DNAs were annealed to the long circular pBluescript II KS+ DNA, resulting in substrate A or substrate B as shown in Fig. 1. Another substrate DNA, used in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 6, had the same structure as substrate A except that a 125 nucleotide long DNA was annealed to pBluescript II KS- DNA. The short DNA was prepared by digestion of pBluescript II KS- dsDNA with restriction enzyme HaeIII, purified by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, denatured by heat, and labeled with 32P at its 5′-end.Figure 6Effects of preincubation. Two 30-μl reaction mixtures were prepared; one contained 60 fmol of substrate A and 27 pmol of 32 protein without ATP (32/DNA mixture) and the other contained 8.4 pmol of 41 protein and 4 mM ATP (41/ATP mixture). These mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 min, and 5.3 pmol of 59 protein was then added to the 32/DNA mixture (○) or to the 41/ATP mixture (▵). Following a 3-min incubation with 59 protein, the two mixtures were combined at time 0. Alternatively, after 32/DNA and 41/ATP mixtures had been incubated for 2 min, they were combined and incubated for 3 min. Then 59 protein was added to the mixture at time 0 (•). A 10-μl aliquot was withdrawn at each time point indicated on the abscissa to measure released 50 mer ssDNA as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction Conditions for 41 Protein ActivitiesOtherwise stated, the reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37°C in a solution containing 25 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 60 mM potassium acetate, 6 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml DNase-free bovine serum albumin. The concentrations of DNA and proteins are indicated in each figure legend. When proteins were included, the order of addition was as follows: 32 protein first, 59 protein second, and 41 protein last.To measure ATPase activity, we added [γ-32P]ATP (ARC, 7000 Ci/mmol) to the reaction mixture. After the reaction, radioactivity of the inorganic phosphate released was measured as described previously (Yonesaki and Minagawa, 1985). To measure DNA helicase activity, we monitored the release of short ssDNA fragments as follows. After the reaction, 0.1% SDS and 500 μg/ml proteinase K were added, and incubation was continued for a further 5 min. The DNAs were electropho-resed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel (160 × 130 × 1 mm) in a buffer of 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), at a constant current of 20 mA for 2 h, and the product DNAs were detected by exposing the gel to an x-ray film or an image plate of a Fujix Bas 2000 image analyzer. The radioactivity found in a DNA band was quantified with an image processor installed in the Fujix Bas 2000 image analyzer.RESULTSInhibition of ATP Hydrolysis Activity of 41 Protein by 32 Protein and Rescuing Effect of 59 ProteinHydrolysis of ATP or GTP by 41 protein is stimulated 8-9-fold by ssDNA (Nossal, 1979; Morris et al., 1979; Liu et al., 1981). When all ssDNA is covered with 32 protein, the ssDNA-dependent GTP hydrolysis by 41 protein is eliminated, and addition of 59 protein saves the activity (Barry and Alberts, 1994). We confirmed these observations with the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction. In the presence of a fixed amount (50 fmol) of pBluescript II KS- circular ssDNA (2961 nucleotides), 32 protein had a strong inhibitory effect on the reaction (Fig. 2). Since 32 protein cooperatively binds to ssDNA (Alberts and Frey, 1971; Newport et al., 1981) and 32 protein saturates ssDNA when mixed at a ratio of one monomer to seven nucleotides under the present conditions, 22.5 pmol of 32 protein is just the saturating amount, and the highest amount tested, 54 pmol, is more than 2-fold over the saturation level. The plateau level of ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of more than saturating amounts of 32 protein was approximately 10% of the control activity. Since 41 protein showed the same level of ATPase activity in the absence of ssDNA (data not shown), the inhibition by high amounts of 32 protein may be attributable to exclusion of 41 protein from binding to ssDNA.Figure 2Effects of 32 and 59 proteins on ATPase activity of 41 protein. The measurement of ATP hydrolysis by 41 protein was described under “Materials and Methods.” Fifty fmol of pBluescript II KS- ssDNA, 7.0 pmol of 41 protein, and various amounts of 32 protein as indicated on the abscissa were included in a 10-μl reaction mixture with or without 4.6 pmol of 59 protein. ○, with 59 protein; •, without 59 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Even with a lower than saturating amount, 32 protein was also highly inhibitory. For example, 4.5 pmol of 32 protein, which corresponds to 20% of the saturating amount, inhibited 80% of the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity. Since 80% of the ssDNAwas 32 protein-free at this subsaturating level, the observed inhibition cannot be explained by the inhibition of 41 protein binding to ssDNA (see “Discussion”). The 59 protein had no detectable ATP hydrolysis activity. However, when 59 protein was added together with 32 protein, the inhibitory effect of the latter over the whole range of amounts tested was completely eliminated.Helicase Activity Toward DNA Substrates of Different StructureWe prepared two substrates to assess the DNA helicase activity of 41 protein (Fig. 1). One substrate (A) had a 50-base pair long duplex on a circular pBluescript II KS+ ssDNA, representing a duplex flanking a ssDNA gap. The other substrate (B) had the same 50-base pair long duplex except that the duplex had an extra 30-base long ssDNA tail at the 3′-end of the annealed DNA fragment. Since 41 protein binds to ssDNA, slides in the 5′ to 3′ direction along ssDNA, and unwinds a duplex when encountered on the ssDNA (Richardson and Nossal, 1989), substrate B mimics a duplex in which the unwinding reaction has been initiated. These substrates A and B are thus useful to discriminate between the initiation of unwinding and the following progressive unwinding.The two substrates were simultaneously added to a reaction mixture, and the fragments released from large circular ssDNA by unwinding of the duplex were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 shows the efficiencies of fragment release with various combinations of 32, 41, and 59 proteins. A duplex in substrate B was much more efficiently released by 41 protein than that in substrate A. This result is consistent with the result of Richardson and Nossal(1989) and strongly suggests that a duplex flanking an ssDNA gap represents a barrier for 41 protein to initiate unwinding.Figure 3DNA helicase activity with a set of substrates. Each reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 10 fmol each of substrates A and B. Proteins included in various combinations as indicated on the figure were 4.5 pmol of 32 protein, 1.2 pmol of 41 protein, and 1.7 pmol of 59 protein. The reaction conditions and detection of DNA products are described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under the present conditions, neither 32 nor 59 protein had detectable helicase activity. Instead, 59 protein stimulated the helicase activity of 41 protein; the release of fragments from substrate A was undetectable with 41 protein alone, but it was discernible when both 41 and 59 proteins were included. Although the stimulatory effect of 59 protein with substrate B was not clear in this autoradiogram, experiments in which these substrates were separately assessed revealed that 59 protein also stimulated the helicase activity (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, 32 protein showed an inhibitory effect on the helicase activity with both substrates A and B (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).Figure 4Differential effects of 32 protein on DNA helicase activity in the presence of 59 protein. A, a 10-μl reaction mixture contained 10 fmol of substrate A, 1.2 pmol of 41 protein, and various amounts of 32 protein as indicated on the abscissa, with (○) or without (•) 110 fmol of 59 protein. B, a 10-μl reaction mixture contained 10 fmol of substrate B, 0.3 pmol of 41 protein, and various amounts of 32 protein as indicated on the abscissa, with (○) or without (•) 110 fmol of 59 protein. DNA fragment released by unwinding was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An intriguing effect of 32 protein was found by the observation that 32 protein further stimulated the helicase activity with substrate A in the copresence of 59 protein (Fig. 3). The stimulation was significant over a limited range of amounts of 32 protein (Fig. 4). As described under the Introduction, 32 protein is considered to cover ssDNA inside a T4-infected cell. This consideration led us to examine the quantitative requirement for the 32 protein stimulation. When substrate A was increased from 10 to 30 fmol in the presence of the same amounts of 41 and 59 proteins as indicated in Fig. 4, the amount of 32 protein required for maximal activity was shifted about 3-fold, or from 3.0 to 4.5 pmol for 10 fmol DNA (Fig. 4) to 13.5 pmol for 30 fmol DNA (data not shown). Since 450 monomers of 32 protein were necessary to saturate one monomer of pBluescript ssDNA, these results suggest that the DNA helicase activity is maximally stimulated when all ssDNA is just covered by 32 protein. Fig. 4 also suggests that excess 32 protein is inhibitory to the reaction even with 59 protein. This inhibition could be explained by the possibility that free 32 protein binds to 59 protein and sequesters 59 protein molecules available for interaction with 32 protein•ssDNA complex (see below), inasmuch as these proteins have an affinity for each other (Yonesaki, 1994b). In this context, the lack of apparent inhibition of ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity by 32 protein in the presence of 59 protein, as shown in Fig. 2, would be attributable to the abundant presence of 59 protein.In the reaction including substrate B, 32 protein over a wide range of amounts was always inhibitory to the reaction regardless whether or not 59 protein was present. However, the stimulatory effect of 59 protein was still remarkable, and the inhibition of the reaction in the presence of 59 protein was much weaker than that in its absence (Fig. 4). The contrasting effects of 32 protein on substrates A and B in the presence of 59 protein should be a reflection of the difference in DNA structure.The Stimulation of Helicase Activity by 59 Protein with a Gapped DNAThe 59 protein stimulated helicase activity with substrate A in a reaction containing a wide range of 41 protein amounts (Fig. 5). The helicase activity of 41 protein alone showed a nearly linear increase as the protein concentration was increased, but it was so weak that even 2.4 pmol of 41 protein versus 10 fmol of substrate DNA (40 hexamers of 41 protein over one DNA molecule) released only 7% of the annealed 50-mer ssDNA. Addition of 55 fmol of 59 protein remarkably enhanced the release of the annealed fragment. While the stimulation was found over a wide range of amounts of 41 protein, it was more prominent in the range of lower amounts (0.4-1.0 pmol), with the stimulation fold of 6-10. Addition of 32 protein further increased the activity up to 2-fold in the reaction with 59 protein but not without 59 protein. Thus the stimulatory effect of 32 protein depends on the presence of 59 protein. Either in the presence of 32 protein or its absence, 59 protein increased the initial rate of release of the 50-mer fragment (data not shown).Figure 5Effects of 32 and 59 proteins on DNA helicase activity with a gapped DNA as a substrate. A 10-μl reaction mixture contained 10 fmol of substrate A and various amounts of 41 protein as indicated on the abscissa, with or without 4.5 pmol of 32 protein and 55 fmol of 59 protein. DNA fragment released by unwinding was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Proteins included were as follows: •, 41 protein alone; ▴, 32 and 41 protein; ○, 41 and 59 proteins; ▵, 32, 41, and 59 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Preincubation of 59 Protein with 41 Protein or 32 Protein•ssDNA ComplexThe 59 protein is suggested to mediate the rapid loading of 41 protein onto 32 protein-covered ssDNA (Barry and Alberts, 1994). This action of 59 protein must require interactions with both 32 protein•ssDNA complex and 41 protein. Indeed, 59 protein has a specific affinity for both 32 and 41 proteins and is capable of rapid binding to ssDNA covered with 32 protein (Yonesaki, 1994b). If a precise order of interactions is important for the stimulation by 59 protein, an incubation of 59 protein with either 41 protein or 32 protein•ssDNA complex separately would affect the activity of DNA helicase. In fact, such an experiment showed striking differential effects of preincubation (Fig. 6). When 59 protein was incubated with 41 protein prior to the addition of 32 protein and ssDNA, the helicase activity was found to be fairly low in comparison with that found in the other two cases in which the 59 protein was initially incubated with 32 protein•ssDNA complex or was the last component to be added. In addition, a preincubation of 41 and 59 proteins in the absence of 32 protein and ssDNA was found to diminish the helicase activity (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that an interaction of 41 and 59 proteins in the absence of 32 protein and ssDNA yields an inactive complex and that an interaction of 59 protein with 32 protein•ssDNA complex must precede an interaction of 41 and 59 proteins for the maximal stimulation of helicase activity.Stoichiometry of 32 Protein-covered ssDNA and 59 ProteinThe results in the previous section prompted us to examine the quantitative requirement of 59 protein versus 32 proteincovered ssDNA. In this experiment, 32 protein versus substrate DNA was fixed at the molar ratio of 450 to 1, so that the amount of 32 protein was always optimal for the stimulation. In the presence of 10 fmol of substrate DNA and 4.5 pmol of 32 protein, the helicase reaction was stimulated as the amount of 59 protein was increased and reached a plateau (Fig. 7). In this case, the saturation point was approximately at 80 fmol of 59 protein. When substrate DNA and 32 protein were increased by 3-fold, the minimal amount of 59 protein required for the maximal helicase activity was found at 240 fmol. Therefore, these results indicate that for the maximal stimulation, eight monomers of 59 protein are required per one monomer of substrate DNA containing 2900 nucleotides of ssDNA covered by 32 protein.Figure 7Stoichiometry of 32 protein-covered ssDNA and 59 protein. A 10-μl reaction mixture contained 0.8 pmol of 41 protein and one of various amounts of 59 protein as indicated on the abscissa. Substrate A and 32 protein included were respectively 10 fmol and 4.5 pmol (○) or 30 fmol and 13.5 pmol (•). DNA fragment released by unwinding was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The percentage of fragment released in the absence of 59 protein was subtracted for the correction of each series of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we examined the effects of 59 protein on ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity and DNA helicase activity of 41 protein in the presence or absence of 32 protein. The results show that 59 protein has profound effects on these activities, particularly in the presence of 32 protein, and thereby that it may act as an enhancer of 41 protein. Since 59 protein has a specific affinity for both 32 and 41 proteins and can rapidly bind to ssDNA covered by 32 protein (Yonesaki, 1994), 59 protein would have a central role in the interactions of 32, 41, and 59 proteins.The ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity was completely suppressed by 32 protein at concentrations sufficient to saturate ssDNA, and 59 protein completely saved the activity (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the observation of Barry and Alberts(1994) with ssDNA-dependent GTPase activity and follows their suggestion that 59 protein mediates the rapid loading of 41 protein onto 32 protein-covered ssDNA. However, their results were inconclusive about whether 59 protein is also necessary for the translocation of 41 protein on 32 protein-covered ssDNA once the 41 protein has been bound. As shown in Fig. 2, even a partial coverage of ssDNA by 32 protein exerted strong inhibition of ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity; one-fifth of the saturation amount of 32 protein on circular pBluescript II ssDNA inhibited 80% of the activity. Since up to 80% of the ssDNA region is free from 32 protein under these conditions, this 80% inhibition cannot come from the inhibition of 41 protein binding to ssDNA. Rather, clustered 32 protein molecules bound to ssDNA could conceivably slow down or block the movement of 41 protein along the ssDNA strand, and such interference might either halt the ATP hydrolysis by 41 protein or cause 41 protein molecules to fall off the DNA. The overcoming of such interference caused by the 32 protein would require a continuous action of 59 protein until the 41 protein passed over the region covered by a cluster of 32 proteins. This would be achieved by formation of a binary complex of 41 and 59 proteins and migration of this complex along the ssDNA strand.In Barry and Alberts(1994), the effects of 59 protein on 41 protein helicase activity was measured indirectly, by measuring the rate of replication fork movement. In the present experiments, we have measured the DNA helicase activity directly, using helicase substrates, and the results have shown several important aspects of the functional interactions of three proteins. A set of substrate DNAs are helpful to distinguish the steps of the helicase reaction (Fig. 1). The 41 protein alone can efficiently cause progression of the unwinding of a duplex in which initiation of unwinding has already been initiated. Addition of 32 protein to the reaction is quite inhibitory. Similar to its effect on the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction, 59 protein has a stimulatory effect on unwinding and largely suppresses the inhibition by 32 protein (Fig. 4). These effects also support the hypothesis that 59 protein promotes the binding of 41 protein when this is inhibited by 32 protein (Barry and Alberts, 1994).By contrast, the initiation of unwinding by 41 protein alone is so weak that a duplex flanking a ssDNA gap must be a barrier for 41 protein to initiate the reaction. Addition of 59 protein, but not 32 protein, is stimulatory to the reaction. However, addition of 32 protein in the presence of 59 protein can further drive the reaction forward (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Thus, the initiation barrier seems to be best circumvented by the synergistic action of 32 and 59 proteins, suggesting a novel role for each of these proteins. Since a stoichiometric amount of 32 protein that just saturates ssDNA is required to sustain the maximal stimulation in the reaction, we propose that the 32 protein in the vicinity of the border of the duplex helps 41 protein to initiate unwinding, or that the binding of 32 protein to complementary ssDNA produced by unwinding keeps the strands from reannealing. The complex formation of 59 protein with 41 protein, as suggested from the results of the experiment on the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction, may help 41 protein activity to overcome the initiation barrier. For the maximal activity of the 41 protein, eight monomers of 59 protein were calculated to be required per one 2900-nucleotide long ssDNA molecule covered with 32 protein (Fig. 7). The extremely low stoichiometry of the protein to ssDNA nucleotides supports the idea that 41 and 59 proteins comigrate after they form a complex on ssDNA.Preincubation of 41 protein with 59 protein in the absence of DNA and 32 protein was found to inactivate the helicase activity (Fig. 6). We also found that insoluble complexes were formed when 41 and 59 proteins at high concentrations (1.2 μM each) were incubated together (data not shown). These facts strongly suggest that 59 protein stably binds to 41 protein and may support the ability of 41 and 59 proteins to form a binary complex on ssDNA.Our present study reveals that 59 protein has an essential role in production of ssDNA when 41 protein reacts with a gapped DNA as a substrate. This feature is favorable to the suggestion that 41 protein functions in in vivo production of recombinogenic ssDNA and may account for involvement of"

Through deletion-transfection analysis, we identified a 79-base pair enhancer from the β-enolase gene that leads to high level expression of a reporter gene in myoblasts, but not in fibroblasts. Following myoblast differentiation into myotubes, the activity of the enhancer declined, indicating that β-enolase gene expression in myotubes is mediated by other regulators, possibly the myogenic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that proteins present in myoblast nuclear extracts specifically bind to the 3′ half of the 79-base pair enhancer. This region contains an ets DNA-binding motif which is required not only for high level activity in myoblasts, but also for repressing activity in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the β-enolase myoblast-specific enhancer shows limited similarity to the myoblast-specific enhancer associated with the human desmin gene, suggesting that gene expression in adult myoblasts may be coordinately regulated.

Furthermore, the β-enolase myoblast-specific enhancer shows limited similarity to the myoblast-specific enhancer associated with the human desmin gene, suggesting that gene expression in adult myoblasts may be coordinately regulated. In adult muscle, activation of myoblasts, called satellite cells, is one mechanism for maintaining skeletal muscle mass. Although quiescent in normal muscle, satellite cells proliferate and differentiate in response to muscle damage or degeneration, thereby regenerating muscle fibers. We reported previously that the muscle-specific β-enolase gene is expressed in proliferating myoblasts of adult, but not fetal human muscle(1Peterson C.A. Cho M. Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The appearance of β-enolase mRNA in myoblasts prior to birth may be indicative of the emergence of adult satellite cells in humans, although they arise somewhat later during development than the population of myoblasts resistant to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate reported previously to represent the emergence of satellite cells(2Cossu G. Cicinelli P. Fieri C. Coletta M. Molinaro M. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). β-Enolase expressing myoblasts emerge at a comparable stage to the distinct population of adult myoblasts that appear during mid to late fetal development in avian embryos(3Feldman J.L.

Although fetal and adult myoblasts can be distinguished based on β-enolase mRNA accumulation, this difference disappears following differentiation so that myotubes derived from both cell types accumulate comparable levels of β-enolase transcript(1Peterson C.A. Cho M. Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A.

Thus, not only do the regulatory mechanisms that control β-enolase gene expression change with developmental stage, but also with the differentiated state of the cell. It is likely that the helix-loop-helix (HLH) ( 1The abbreviations used are: HLHhelix-loop-helixDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay(s). )family of myogenic regulators (MyoD, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF4) are involved in controlling β-enolase gene expression following differentiation (for review, see (11Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) and (12Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts encoding βenolase are detectable in the somites (from which skeletal myoblasts are derived) of 8.75-day postcoitum mouse embryos shortly after the first myogenic HLH factors are detected(13Keller A. Ott M.O. Lamandé N. Lucas M. Gros F. Buckingham M. Lazar M. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, the HLH myogenic regulators have been shown to activate muscle-specific gene expression, including β-enolase(14Lamandé N. Mazo A.M. Lucas M. Montarras D. Pinset C. Gros F. Legault-Demare L. Lazar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4445-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), when expressed in non-muscle cells. In adult muscle fibers in vivo, β-enolase gene expression is also linked to the contractile and metabolic properties of muscle fibers. β-Enolase transcripts accumulate to high levels in fast twitch relative to slow twitch muscle(1Peterson C.A. Cho M. Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alteration of the exogenous stimuli which control fiber type such as innervation and hormone levels results in changes in β-enolase expression(15Shackelford J.E. Lebherz H.G. J. Biol.

The myogenic HLH regulators are not likely to control βenolase gene expression in proliferating myoblasts. Although present in myoblasts, the myogenic HLH proteins appear inactive as transcription factors for muscle-specific genes(17Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Growth factors necessary to maintain myoblasts in a proliferative, undifferentiated state, such as basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor β, appear to inhibit the activity of the myogenic HLH proteins(18Vaidya T.B. Rhodes S.J. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Brennan T.J. Edmondson D.G. Li L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3822-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with this data, β-enolase mRNA accumulation was unchanged in myoblasts in which the expression of the entire family of HLH myogenic regulators had been abolished(1Peterson C.A. Cho M. Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is likely that the transcription factor(s) that control myoblast-specific gene expression are activated by growth factors, perhaps in a manner analogous to activation of serum response factor that controls expression of many cellular immediate-early genes(20Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a cis-regulatory DNA sequence that controls expression of the β-enolase gene specifically in adult myoblasts. As this enhancer did not activate transcription following differentiation, distinct regulatory factors control β-enolase gene expression in proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that an ets motif within the enhancer is required for transcriptional activation in myoblasts and repression in fibroblasts, suggesting that Ets domain proteins activate or repress transcription of the β-enolase gene depending on the cellular context. Human genomic DNA was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify different regions of DNA flanking the βenolase gene. The original set of primers was designed based on the sequence of the human β-enolase gene reported by Peshavaria and Day(21Peshavaria M. Day I.N.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all primers contained a HindIII restriction site to facilitate cloning of the PCR products. A 979-bp PCR product (−917 to +62) was subcloned into the Bluescript vector (Stratagene), sequenced using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and was used as a template for further PCR amplifications. PCR products were cloned in both orientations either into luciferase vectors lacking a promoter, pOluc (22de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) or pGL2-basic (Promega), or into the pGL2-promoter vector (Promega) which encodes the luciferase reporter gene fused downstream of the SV40 minimal promoter. Using the megaprime technique, a double point mutation in the ets motif within the β-enolase promoter was generated. A 5′ megaprimer was generated by Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the mutant single-stranded oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 5, the pGL2 vector sequencing primer 1, and pJC13 (see Fig. 4) as template. The resulting 145-bp DNA fragment was gel purified and used as described above to generate a PCR product (−628 to +62) containing the mutation. This PCR product was directionally cloned following digestion with KpnI and HindIII into the pGL2-basic vector. The wild type and mutant oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 5 were also cloned into the pGL2-promoter vector. Equal quantities of single-stranded oligonucleotides were kinased, annealed, and ligated. Gel-purified trimeric oligonucleotide was then ligated into the BglII site to generate a plasmid consisting of three head-to-tail ligated oligonucleotides. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis as described above. Sequences were analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group Program Package(23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). As controls, a 225-bp fragment generated by HindIII digestion of λ DNA and a 500-bp BamHI fragment containing the enhancer from the rat myosin light chain 1/3 gene (24Donoghue M. Ernst H. Wentworth B. Nadal-Ginard B. Rosenthal N. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were also cloned into pGL2-promoter.Figure 4An ets motif within the 79bp myoblast-specific enhancer (−628 to −549) is important for activity. Schematic representation of constructs pJC13-pJC16 in A, and pJC3 and pJC17-pJC19 in B is shown on the left and the relative luciferase activity produced by each following transient transfection into C2C12 myoblasts and 10T1/2 fibroblasts is shown on the right. Hatched boxes represent regions of β-enolase 5′-flanking DNA, and the thin line represents the SV40 minimal promoter, cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (LUC). The ets motif is represented by the stippled box in B. The double point mutation (GA → CT) within the ets motif of pJC18 is indicated. Numbers denote position relative to the start site of transcription of the β-enolase gene. Relative luciferase values from five separate experiments were averaged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C2C12 mouse myoblasts were grown in DMEM with 15% defined/supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). 10T1/2, NIH, and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM with 10% defined/supplemented bovine serum. For differentiation, confluent myoblasts were exposed to DMEM with 2% horse serum for 3 days. Subconfluent cells were transfected on either 60- or 100-mm dishes with 6 or 10 μg of luciferase plasmids, respectively, using a modification of the calcium phosphate precipitation method described by Sternberg et al.(25Sternberg E.A. Spizz G. Perry W.M. Vizard D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The DNA precipitate was allowed to stand on the cells overnight, at which time the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and given fresh media. For transient transfections, a vector expressing the lacZ gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency(26Borrás T. Peterson C.A. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Approximately 48 h following addition of DNA, total protein content in cell extracts was determined (Bio-Rad Protein Assay) and luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay kit and a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs), normalizing values to β-galactosidase activity, quantitated using the Galacto-Light kit (TROPIX, Inc.). For stable transfections, the pSV2neo vector was included at [1/10] the concentration of the test plasmid. Following overnight incubation with DNA, cells were washed and fresh media was added. After allowing the cells to recover for an additional day, cells were split 1:2 and selected in 400 μg of active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.)/ml. As colonies began to appear, several hundred were pooled and the cells were split to maintain myoblasts at low density in high serum. Luciferase assays were performed on myoblasts and on myotubes following 3 days of myoblast differentiation as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Gossett et al.(27Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were generated by PCR using primers into which unique restriction sites had been incorporated. Following digestion, fragments were made blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP. Approximately 10,000 cpm (approximately 1 ng of DNA) and 4 μg of nuclear protein were incubated in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.15 μg/μl poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC) in a reaction volume of 20-25 μl at room temperature for 30 min or several hours at 4°C. Reaction products were separated on a nondenaturing 6% acrylamide gel (75:1, acrylamide:bis) containing 0.5 × TBE at 15°C as described by Carey(28Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA (ranging from 1- to 100-fold molar excess) were added to the reaction mixture prior to addition of extract. The 79-, 58-, and 40-bp competitor DNAs were generated by PCR. Smaller competitor DNAs were synthesized using a 381A DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). The 25-bp DNA containing an Sp1 binding site was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To identify cis-regulatory DNA sequences responsible for controlling the β-enolase gene in myoblasts, we sequenced approximately 1 kilobase upstream of the human β-enolase gene. Using PCR, we constructed plasmids containing serial deletions of 5′-flanking DNA from the β-enolase gene cloned in both orientations upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (pJC1, pJC3, pJC5, pJC7; Fig. 1). Each construct was tested for activity following transient transfection into C2C12 myoblasts and 10T1/2 fibroblasts. Swiss and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts yielded similar results to 10T1/2 cells (data not shown). In all cases, cells were cotransfected with an RSV/lacZ reporter gene plasmid and luciferase activity within each cell extract was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variation due to differences in transfection efficiency. Fig. 1 shows that constructs pJC1, pJC3, pJC5, and pJC7 generated low level luciferase activity in 10T1/2 cells. By contrast, the largest construct, pJC1, containing −917 to +62 of β-enolase DNA cloned in the correct 5′ to 3′ orientation relative to the luciferase gene, produced approximately 9-fold higher luciferase activity in myoblasts than fibroblasts. All DNAs cloned in the reverse orientation produced no luciferase activity above background (data not shown). pJC3 with −628 to +62 from the β-enolase gene generated even higher luciferase activity in myoblasts, greater than 20-fold higher than in fibroblasts, suggesting that a negative regulatory element resides between −917 and −628. Further deletion of 5′-flanking DNA reduced luciferase activity significantly, indicating that a myoblast-specific positive regulatory region is present between −628 and −362 relative to the start site of transcription of the β-enolase gene. The smallest construct tested (−131 to +62) comprises the β-enolase basal promoter and produced low level myoblast-specific expression. To determine if the region of DNA between −628 and −362 will enhance transcription in association with a heterologous promoter, this region was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGL2 vector containing the luciferase reporter gene downstream of the SV40 minimal promoter (pJC10, Fig. 1). Following transient transfection, pJC10 reproducibly demonstrated significantly higher activity in myoblasts than fibroblasts, suggesting that a myoblast-specific enhancer is present within this 266-bp DNA fragment. The activity of the putative myoblast-specific enhancer identified above was tested following differentiation. For these experiments, two control plasmids were constructed utilizing the pGL2 vector. Into one was cloned a 225-bp nonspecific DNA (pJC11) and the other (pJC12) contained the 500-bp myotube-specific enhancer from the myosin light chain 1/3 gene(24Donoghue M. Ernst H. Wentworth B. Nadal-Ginard B. Rosenthal N. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene constructs were cotransfected into C2C12 myoblasts with the pSV2neo plasmid, and stable transfectants were selected by resistance to G418. Approximately 200 neomycin-resistant myoblast clones were pooled, and luciferase activity was assayed in extracts derived from subconfluent cultures in high serum or following three days of confluence in low serum, conditions under which fully differentiated myotubes had formed. Pooled clones were analyzed to avoid possible position effects due to the site of integration. Analysis of activity in myoblasts and myotubes following stable transfection demonstrated that the ability of the 266-bp DNA fragment from the β-enolase gene to enhance transcription specifically in myoblasts was unique to this region of DNA (Fig. 2). Following differentiation, luciferase activity from both pJC3 and pJC10 dropped dramatically, suggesting that the cis-regulatory element present in these constructs is active only in undifferentiated myoblasts. As expected, pJC11 produced similar low level luciferase activity in both myoblasts and myotubes, whereas expression of pJC12 increased following differentiation. The sequence of the 266-bp region of DNA between −628 and −362 is shown in Fig. 3. Consensus binding sites for known transcription factors are indicated(29Church G.M. Ephrussi A. Gilbert W. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1985; 313: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tijan R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 31Lillie J.W. Hai T. Coukos W.J. Lee K.A. Martin K.J. Green M.R. Curr. Top. Microb.

Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the relative importance of the different sites in promoting myoblast-specific gene expression, the 266-bp DNA fragment was subdivided into a 79-bp fragment (−628 to −549, pJC13 and pJC14) and a 187-bp fragment (−549 to −362, pJC15 and pJC16) by PCR and cloned in both orientations into the pGL2 vector (Fig. 4A). Following transient transfection into myoblasts and fibroblasts, the 79-bp region, in either orientation, retained the ability to enhance myoblast-specific expression of the luciferase gene (Fig. 4A). Analysis of luciferase activity in myoblasts or myotubes derived from them following stable transfection of pJC13 and pJC14 demonstrated that the ability of the 79-bp fragment to enhance transcription declined following differentiation (data not shown). pJC15 and pJC16 produced some luciferase activity over background in both myoblasts and fibroblasts (Fig. 4A), likely due to the presence of Sp1 sites within this region (see Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, deletion of the 79-bp DNA fragment from pJC3 (−549 to +62; pJC17, Fig. 4B) reduced luciferase activity in myoblasts by over 20-fold compared with pJC3. Surprisingly, pJC17 was 3-fold more active in 10T1/2 cells than pJC3 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the 79-bp DNA is involved in repressing the β-enolase promoter in fibroblasts. The 79-bp enhancer contains consensus binding sites for GATA and Ets domain transcription factors. In addition, the ets motif within the enhancer showed some homology (10 of 14 bp) with a region within the myoblast-specific enhancer from the human desmin gene shown to be important for activity ((34Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Fig. 5). We examined the role of the ets motif by mutating 2 base pairs within the GGA core consensus from GA to CT within pJC3 to generate pJC18. Similar to pJC17, this construct was nearly 15-fold less active in myoblasts than pJC3 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that an Ets domain protein may be involved in controlling high level myoblast-specific expression of the β-enolase gene. However, a construct with three copies of the ets motif upstream of the SV40 minimal promoter (pJC19) was inactive in myoblasts, indicating that this site alone is not sufficient for myoblast-specific activity (Fig. 4B). The ets motif also appeared important for inhibiting activity in fibroblasts as pJC18 containing the mutated ets motif was consistently more active than pJC3 in 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 4B). In fact, pJC17 and 18 were more active in 10T1/2 cells than in C2C12 myoblasts. Thus, the ets motif appears to be involved in controlling tissue-specific expression by enhancing promoter activity in myoblasts and repressing activity in fibroblasts. To characterize the proteins that specifically bind to the 79-bp enhancer from the β-enolase gene, EMSA were performed. The 79-bp DNA fragment (−628 to −549) was radiolabeled, mixed with nuclear extracts, and DNA bound by proteins was resolved from unbound DNA by electrophoresis through native polyacrylamide gels. Two major shifted bands were observed with nuclear extracts from C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 6, complexes A and B) and from myotubes and 10T1/2 cells (data not shown). The specificity of these protein-DNA interactions was demonstrated by competition analysis with 100-fold molar excess unlabeled competitor DNAs. The unlabeled 79-bp fragment competed for protein binding, resulting in the disappearance of complex A and reduction in complex B (Fig. 6, lane 3). A 25-bp fragment containing an Sp1 binding site failed to compete for protein binding (Fig. 6, lane 4). Overlapping subfragments of the 79-bp DNA varied in their ability to compete for protein binding (Fig. 7). A 40-bp fragment from the 5′ end (−628 to −588) was unable to compete (Fig. 6, lanes 6-8), whereas a 58-bp fragment from the 3′ end containing the ets motif (−607 to −549; Fig. 7, lanes 9-11) competed efficiently for protein binding. Labeling the 58-bp fragment and using it directly in EMSA confirmed the above results (Fig. 8). The 58-bp fragment produced shifted complexes A and B which were specifically competed with excess unlabeled DNA of the same sequence (Fig. 8, lane 3). Neither the 40-bp DNA fragment (Fig. 8, lane 4) nor a 25-bp DNA fragment containing an Sp1 DNA binding site (Fig. 8, lane 5) competed for protein binding. Furthermore, a double-stranded wild type oligonucleotide including the ets motif (−583 to −563, Fig. 5) abolished complex A (Fig. 8, lane 7), whereas an oligonucleotide containing the double point mutation (GA → CT, Fig. 5) had no affect in EMSA (Fig. 8, lane 8). Complex B appeared unaffected by either oligonucleotide competitor, suggesting that in addition to binding to the ets motif, proteins interact with other DNA sequences within the 58-bp DNA fragment.Figure 7Localization of protein binding within the 79-bp DNA. EMSA were performed using 32P-labeled 79-bp DNA (−628 to −362) and nuclear extracts derived from C2C12 myoblasts (lanes 2-11). Increasing concentrations (1-, 10-, and 100-fold molar excess) of three different unlabeled DNAs were used as competitors: the 79-bp DNA and two overlapping subfragments of the 79-bp DNA, 40-bp (−628 to −588) and 58 bp (−607 to −549) in length. Whereas the 40-bp DNA did not compete (lanes 6-8), the 79-bp fragment (lanes 3-5), and the 58-bp fragment (lanes 9-11) competed efficiently for protein binding in complexes A and B.

Regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression in myoblasts have not been defined, but appear to change with the age of the muscle donor, so that myoblasts from embryonic, fetal, and adult muscle have distinct phenotypes. As a first step to isolating regulators of the adult myoblast phenotype, we identified an enhancer responsible for controlling the adult myoblast-specific expression of the human β-enolase gene. β-Enolase mRNA is undetectable in fetal myoblasts which instead accumulate the ubiquitous isoform α-enolase(1Peterson C.A. Cho M. Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The switch to the muscle-specific isoform occurs prior to birth so that myoblasts derived from postnatal muscle tissues accumulate predominantly β-enolase. Previous analysis of the DNA sequence flanking the human β-enolase gene (21Peshavaria M. Day I.N.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Giallongo A. Venturella S. Oliva D. Barbieri G. Rubino P. Feo S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of potential binding sites for several general (Sp1, AP1, and 2) and muscle-specific transcription factors (E box for myogenic HLH factors, CArG box, MEF2 site, and M-CAT site(11Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 27Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The latter sites have been shown to be involved in controlling the expression of genes induced during differentiation, such as myosin light chain 1/3 (MLC1/3). The MLC1/3 enhancer contains two E boxes and a MEF2 binding site (38Wentworth B.M. Donoghue M. Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and promotes low level expression in myoblasts and high level expression in myotubes(24Donoghue M. Ernst H. Wentworth B. Nadal-Ginard B. Rosenthal N. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our analysis showed that a myoblast-specific enhancer is present between −628 and −549 upstream of the transcription start site of the β-enolase gene and that the activity of this enhancer dropped dramatically following removal of serum which induces differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, in marked contrast to the MLC1/3 enhancer. An ets motif within the enhancer was important for myoblast-specific activity and was bound by proteins present in myoblast nuclear extract. Ets domain proteins comprise a family of transcription factors that bind to purine-rich DNA sequences with a GGA core consensus(39Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). They have been shown to be involved in regulating gene expression and controlling growth in a variety of biological systems(32Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 221: 7-18Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The subfamily of Ets domain proteins, including Elk-1 and SAP-1, which bind DNA autonomously and as part of the serum response factor ternary complex, are activated by phosphorylation following growth factor stimulation(20Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that growth factor stimulation may also be required for activation of Ets-dependent β-enolase gene expression in myoblasts. In addition to acting as an enhancer in myoblasts, the 79-bp DNA fragment we identified appeared to mediate repression of the β-enolase gene in fibroblasts. Deletion of the 79-bp enhancer or mutation of the ets motif resulted in elevated transcriptional activity in fibroblasts relative to the parental construct. In fibroblasts, it is possible that an Ets domain protein bound to DNA acts to repress transcription. Net, another member of the Elk/SAP Ets subfamily has negative effects on transcription and Ras expression switches Net activity to positive(40Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is possible that the same Ets domain protein is acting on the enhancer in myoblasts and fibroblasts, but that activity is modified in response to different signal transduction pathways in the two cell types. The ets motif alone did not display enhancer function in myoblasts, suggesting that additional cis elements within the enhancer are involved in regulating β-enolase gene expression. We found that protein complexes formed on the 79-bp DNA outside the ets motif, supporting the idea that multiple DNA-binding proteins must interact for enhancer activity. A common feature of Ets domain proteins is that they interact with other proteins to form multisubunit complexes(20Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 32Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 221: 7-18Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Some Ets domain proteins can bind to DNA autonomously, as is the case for Ets1 and the TCRα enhancer, but transcriptional activation requires a second non-Ets protein(41Ho I.C. Bhat N.K. Gottschalk L.R. Lindsten T. Thompson C. Papas T.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have, as yet, been unable to identify additional cis-regulatory elements within the 79-bp DNA (data not shown). Sequences outside the enhancer also appear important for β-enolase gene expression. Several potential Sp1 sites are located downstream of the enhancer and Sp1 may act alone or cooperatively with the Ets domain protein to produce maximal transcriptional activity. Sp1 sites present within the enhancer of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene have been proposed to regulate the expression of that gene in myoblasts(42Darville M.I. Isabelle A.V. Rousseau G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3575-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the myoblast-specific enhancer was most effective in association with its endogenous promoter, the β-enolase initiation complex may play an important role in regulating expression. It is significant that the β-enolase promoter (−131 to +62) demonstrated considerable myoblast-specific activity. Several studies have suggested that relatively short promoter regions can generate tissue-specific transcription. For example, 133 bp of 5′-flanking DNA from the myogenin gene promotes appropriate temporal and spatial expression of a reporter gene in transgenic animals(43Yee S.-P. Rigby P.W.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Finally, β-enolase gene expression may also be influenced by a negative regulatory element located upstream of the myoblast-specific enhancer between −917 and −628. The vimentin gene, which is expressed in many cell types, including myoblasts, is down-regulated during myogenesis (44Sax C.M. Farrell F.X. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 78: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The silencer located upstream of the promoter (45Rittling S.R. Coutinho L. Amram T. Kolbe M.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) may participate in this process. Further characterization of the putative negative regulatory region associated with the β-enolase gene is required to determine what, if any, role it plays in regulating its expression. The regulators that bind to the β-enolase myoblast-specific enhancer may also control the expression of other muscle-specific gene products. Like β-enolase, carbonic anhydrase III, the integral membrane protein H36 (α7 integrin), the intermediate filament desmin, and MyoD are muscle-specific gene products expressed in proliferating myoblasts (48Davis R.L.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4994-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). No significant homology was found between the β-enolase and MyoD enhancers. The desmin gene is regulated by separate myotube- and myoblast-specific enhancers that are adjacent to one another between −973 and −693 relative to the transcription start site(34Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ets motif within the β-enolase enhancer shares limited homology with the Mb sequence within the desmin myoblast-specific enhancer, shown to be important for activity. The enhancers associated with the human desmin and β-enolase genes must be examined in greater detail to determine whether they are recognized by similar regulatory factors.

https://openalex.org/W2077067048,"Chemical modification of specific amino acid residues in a protein has been a valuable tool in identifying amino acid residues that are responsible for ligand binding of a protein. In the present investigation, we targeted Trp and His residues in human serum vitamin D-binding protein (hDBP) by modifying them with specific chemical modifiers. We also evaluated the results of these modifications in the binding of 25-hydroxy[26(27)-3H]vitamin D3 ([3H]25-OH-D3) to hDBP. We observed a dose-dependent loss of binding activity by N-bromosuccinimide (specific for Trp). Similar results were observed with diethylpyrocarbonate (specific for His). Furthermore, loss of [3H]25-OH-D3-binding was protected by preincubation of hDBP samples with an excess of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. These results strongly emphasized the importance of Trp (single residue at position 145) and 1 His residue (out of a total of 6) in the vitamin D sterol-binding by vitamin D-binding protein."

INTRODUCTIONThe second component of human complement (C2) is a single chain glycoprotein (molecular mass, ∼100 kDa) (1Polley M.J. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Cooper N.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that carries the serine protease domain of a bimolecular complex enzyme comprised of cleavage products of C2 (C2a) and the fourth (C4) complement protein (C4b). This enzyme is responsible for cleavage of complement protein C3 to its biologically active fragments. C2 is encoded by a single gene that is on human chromosome 6p within the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex(3Carroll M.C. Campbell R.D. Bentley D.R. Porter R.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The C2 protein is synthesized in liver hepatocytes (4Morris K.M. Aden D.P. Knowles B.B. Colten H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10380-10385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in several other cell types in extrahepatic tissues(6Whaley K. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 151: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Katz Y. Cole F.S. Strunk R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Strunk R.C. Eidlen D.M.

J. 1992; 287: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Many years ago, three forms of C2 (84, 79, and 70 kDa) were detected in cell lysates of a metabolically labeled well differentiated human hepatoma cell line (HepG2)(5Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10380-10385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial data indicated that each was derived from a separate primary translation product, that each is glycosylated, but that only the 84-kDa C2 polypeptide is secreted (half-time ∼ 1 h). The other two C2 polypeptides remained cell-associated throughout the observation period (>6 h). Subsequently, these observations were replicated in studies of every cell type that expresses C2 protein(11Perlmutter D.H. Colten H.R. Grossberger D. Strominger J. Seidman J.G. Chaplin D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Johnson C.A. Densen P. Wetsel R.A. Cole F.S. Goeken N.E. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but the origin of the isoforms and the cellular compartment(s) in which the 79- and 70-kDa C2 proteins reside were unknown. Recently, in a study of C2 deficiency type I, we noted that a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). )that should have generated a 786-bp fragment from the 5′ end of both normal and C2-deficient mRNA instead generated two major bands, one of the predicted size and another that was about 400 bp (see Fig. 1 in (13Johnson C.A. Densen P. Hurford Jr., R.K. Colten H.R. Wetsel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9347-9353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The reproducibility and abundance of this ∼400-bp PCR product suggested the possibility that a C2 mRNA not previously recognized was the template for one of the cell-associated C2 proteins. In 1994, Cheng and Volanakis also found multiple C2 transcripts by PCR amplification of mRNA from HepG2, normal liver, and two other cell lines(14Cheng J. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1774-1782PubMed Google Scholar). They speculated that one or several of these transcripts, if translated, would give rise to variant C2 proteins; among them the previously recognized cell-associated C2 isoforms. The current study was undertaken to test that hypothesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA IsolationRNA was isolated from fibroblast cell lines obtained from C2-deficient and normal volunteers, from a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), a normal liver sample obtained at a “reducing” transplant procedure, and from cells obtained at broncho-alveolar lavage. Twice selected poly(A+) mRNA was prepared from these cell types by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (15Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar) and oligo(dT) column fractionation(16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 197-198Google Scholar).Amplification of cDNATwo micrograms of poly(A+) mRNA were incubated with 10 units of reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 1 h using the buffers and dNTPs provided in a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). An oligonucleotide (Fig. 1) (c = CTGTGAGCTTGGAGACATCCAGCATATGTT) made to an antisense sequence within exon 10 and 11 of the normal C2 was used to prime the reverse transcription reaction. The cDNA produced was subsequently amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers for this amplification were constructed to produce a 786-bp fragment whose 5′ end lay upstream of the sequence that encodes the peptide leader and whose 3′ end is within exon 4. Both primers contained artificially engineered restriction sites (Fig. 1) (a = GGGAGATCTAT((G for T)/GA(T for C)CC)TATAGATATATTA (first BamHI site), b = ATTCGAGGAGCAGCGATAGCG((A for G)A(G for C)CT/T)GTC (HindIII)). The mixture containing the cDNA and 1 μg of each oligonucleotide in a 100-μl solution containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 200 μM dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Dr. Wayne Barnes, Washington University), was heated to 94°C for 3 min. Following the initial denaturation, the cDNA was amplified by melting at 94°C for 2 min, annealing at 60°C for 2 min and polymerization at 72°C for 2 min. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed. The amplified cDNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII and purified by trough elution and phenol extraction. The isolated products were subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequencing. All cloning procedures used restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Competent Sure cells (Stratagene) were transformed, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the recombinants using the alkaline lysis procedure(17Birnboim H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar).DNA Sequence AnalysisAll DNA sequencing was performed using double-stranded templates. Two micrograms of template were denatured in 0.2 M NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA, neutralized, annealed with either SK or KS primers, and sequenced employing the dideoxy chain termination method and the modified bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase(18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). All sequencing was performed at least once on both strands of each insert.RNase ProtectionRNA samples were subjected to RNase protection analysis using a standard method(19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 4.7.1Google Scholar). Transfer RNA served as a negative control. Human liver and HepG2 RNA were the test samples. Hybridization was performed with a [32P]CTP-labeled antisense riboprobe spanning 199 bp of C2 sequence, which overlapped in part exons 4 and 3. The riboprobe was generated by in vitro transcription of the 799-bp C2 subclone that was digested with AvaII. Transcription was initiated at a T7 promoter site within the vector (Fig. 3B). Following hybridization overnight at 42°C with the antisense RNA probe, the samples were digested with RNase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 30°C for 1 h, loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and electrophoresed in parallel with a known sequence that served as a marker.Figure 3A, Nuclease protection of C2 mRNA in normal human liver (lane4) and HepG2 (lane5).

These clones extended from an engineered BamHI site (Fig. 1) (d = AGGGA(G/GA(T for C) (C for A)C)CATGGGCCCACTGATGGT) 6 bp upsteam of the translation initiation codon to a naturally occurring PstI site in exon 10. The clones were 1,389 and 993 bp, respectively. Subcloning into pBluescript was achieved by digestion with BamHI and PstI. Subsequently the 3′ fragment obtained by PstI digestion of the clone C2A-long (20Woods D.E. Edge M.D. Colten H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was ligated to the 5′ constructs.Expression of Human C2 Clones in Mouse L-CellsThe two pBluescript C2 clones (C2 short and C2 long) were digested with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The fragments were isolated and ligated to the expression vector pRep10 (Invitrogen). After transformation and plasmid isolation, the two clones were sequenced to assure their fidelity and orientation.Mouse fibroblast L-cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in 24-well plates containing 350 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% bovine calf serum. Transfection of the L-cells was accomplished with 4 μg of DNA/well using the calcium phosphate precipitation method exactly as described(21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). Thirty-six hours following transfection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 250 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (specific activity, ∼1,000 Ci/mmol from ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine in the presence of 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum and then chased for 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and up to 24 h. At each time point, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed as described(5Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10380-10385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were assayed for total protein synthesis by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the balance was used to precipitate human C2 with sheep antiserum (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL) exactly as described(22Cole F.S. Schneeberger E.E. Lichtenberg N.A. Colten H.R. Immunology. 1982; 46: 429-441PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected with excess protein A, washed, released by boiling in sample buffer, and applied to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions(23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, and dried for fluorography.Indirect ImmunofluorescenceTransfectants grown on coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (washing buffer) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized by treatment with 100% methanol at room temperature for 3 min. The cells were incubated with the sheep anti-human C2 antisera (1:640 dilution) or mouse monoclonals (ascitic fluids, 1:100 dilution, kindly provided by J. Volanakis, Birmingham, AL) in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Normal sheep serum (Sigma) or mouse (NS-1MAb) ascites fluid (ICN) served as control. The coverslips were washed thrice with washing buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-sheep IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce; diluted 1:50 each in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. The coverslips were washed and mounted. n-Propyl gallate was included as an anti-fade reagent in the mounting media (24Giloh H. Sedat J.W. Science. 1982; 217: 1252-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Specimens were photographed (4 s exposure time).Synthesis of mRNA in VitroThe C2-short and C2-long cDNAs in pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. Synthesis of mRNA in vitro was carried out on 2 μg of linearized DNA, which was cut by HindIII for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 40 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM each rATP, rCTP, rGTP, and rUTP, and 40 units of T3 RNA polymerase. The size of the mRNA products was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% denatured gel containing formaldehyde.Cell-free Translation and Co-translational Processing in the Presence of Dog Pancreas Microsomal MembranesThe mRNAs coding for the entire C2 short and C2 long were translated in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's (Promega) procedure. In brief, 1 μl of the microsomes (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the translation reaction mixture just before the addition of mRNA, and then it (total 35 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 30°C. After the incubation period, aliquots were incubated with trypsin and chymotrypsin (at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml each) for 90 min at 4°C in the presence or absence of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (30 μg/ml of Bowman-Birk inhibitor from Sigma). As a control, the translation mixture with microsomes was incubated at 4°C in the absence of proteolytic enzymes. Additional controls consisted of the translation mixture with no mRNA. Translation products (15 μl) were analyzed directly or after immunoprecipitation as described above on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol followed by autoradiography.RESULTSAmplification of cDNAcDNA samples were generated by reverse transcription of RNA from liver HepG2, normal fibroblasts, C2-deficient (type I and type II) fibroblasts, and bronchial lavage wash cells. Each was then amplified using primers a and b (see Fig. 1) across a 786-bp region at the 5′ end of C2, which resulted in two products; one of the expected size and another of 390 bp (Fig. 2). These two products were consistently obtained in multiple experiments. Both PCR products were present in all samples from several different individuals and from all the tissues and cells that were sampled.Figure 2PCR fragments of 786 (C2 long) and 390 bp (C2 short) generated from mRNA in normal human liver, HepG2, fibroblasts from normal, C2 deficient type I, C2 deficient type II and bronchoalveolar lavage cells. tRNA served as negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Digestion of the 786- and 390-bp fragments with BamHI and HindIII (sites engineered by primers a and b) generated 748- and 352-bp fragments, respectively, which were subcloned separately and sequenced. The results represented in Fig. 1 show that the 352-bp fragment completely lacked the sequence corresponding to exons 2 and 3. This predicted a translation product that would lack the carboxyl-terminal 5 amino acids of the peptide leader sequence (encoded by the proximal 15 bp of exon 2). Since both exon 2 (210 bp) and exon 3 (186 bp) are in phase, the transcript with this segment deleted could theoretically serve as template for a C2 protein shorter by the 132 amino acids that are encoded by these two exons.RNase ProtectionThe relative abundance of these two message forms of C2 in normal liver and HepG2 mRNA was quantitated by a nuclease protection assay. The antisense probe was constructed as described in Fig. 3. Using the 748-bp clone inserted into the pBluescript vector, T7 RNA polymerase generated an antisense probe containing 32P-cytosine residues. The length of this probe was limited to 266 bp by predigestion at a naturally occurring AvaII site. Protection of C2 long mRNA yielded a protected band of 199 bp and of C2 short mRNA of 72 bp (Fig. 3A). Lanes1 and 2 were loaded with undigested probe. The negative control transfer RNA does not protect as seen in lane3. Quantification of the relative abundance of the two message forms was achieved by an analysis of the signal strength (scintillation spectrometry) of the 72 and 199 bp bands. Abundance was calculated using the following equation: 199 bp band cpm/49 (cytosine residues): 72 bp band cpm/23 (cytosine residues).The results of four separate experiments showed that the C2 short mRNA was present in HepG2 and normal liver at about one-half of the concentration of C2 long.Expression of C2 Long and C2 Short in Murine L CellsTo determine whether the full-length C2 short and C2 long mRNA species could be translated in vivo, each was transfected into murine fibroblasts (L-cells). In order to ascertain the fate of C2 protein generated from each, a pulse-chase experiment was performed (Fig. 4). C2 long cDNA driven by pRep10 generated an 84-kDa C2 protein that disappeared from the intracellular compartment coincident with the appearance of mature C2 protein in the extracellular medium (half time ∼ 1 h) (Fig. 4B). C2 short cDNA under the same conditions generated a ∼70-kDa C2 protein that was still detected in cell lysates after 24 h (Fig. 4A). No extracellular C2 short protein was detected even with a longer (3×) exposure time. Immunofluorescence of the transfectants (Fig. 5) with monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibody (not shown) to C2 revealed a bright, relatively homogenous intracellular staining pattern for C2 short and a much less intense diffuse fluorescence pattern for the C2 long transfectant. No cell surface membrane staining was detected.Figure 4Kinetics of synthesis and secretion of C2 short and C2 long. A, synthesis and secretion of C2-short protein in transfected L-cells. Transfectants were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and chased with unlabeled methionine for intervals up to 24 h. At timed intervals, culture media were harvested and cells were solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Lanes1-6 contain cell lysates, and lanes7-12 contain extracellular media from chase time points 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. Intracellular C2-short protein (molecular mass, ∼69 kDa) but not extracellular C2 protein is identified even on a long exposure (3×) film (data not shown).

Exposure time was 4 s each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell-free Synthesis of C2 Long and C2 ShortResults of the transfection of C2 short cDNA into L-cells suggested that the product of C2 short may be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to determine whether the C2 short leader peptide (which lacks five carboxyl-terminal residues, including the signal peptidase cleavage site) is capable of facilitating transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the following study (Fig. 6) was done. C2 short and C2 long mRNA species were separately translated under cell-free conditions. Direct analysis of the cell-free translation products revealed (lane1) single polypeptides of ∼62 and ∼77 kDa, respectively. These bands were also detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-C2 antibody (data not shown). Calculated molecular weights of translocated C2 short and C2 long proteins are 67 and 82 kDa, respectively(25Bentley D.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the presence of microsomes, the C2 long peptide was protected from proteolysis (B, lane4versuslane3) except if protease was added with detergent (lane6). Detergent alone had no effect on the C2 within the microsomal vesicles (lane5), but the C2 was completely digested by the proteolytic enzymes in the absence of microsomes (lane2). C2 short showed a similar pattern.Figure 6In vitro translation of C2-short and C2-long C2-short (A) or C2 long (B) mRNA translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of dog pancreas microsomes. After translation was completed, aliquots of the translation reactions were treated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. C2 short is translocated into the microsomes.

Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In addition, alternative splicing can govern the destination, size, and function of the protein products derived from a single gene(26Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Abundant evidence has been obtained for alternative initiation and alternative splicing events in the transcription and processing of human (5Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Goldberger G. Colten H.R. J.

Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) mRNA derived from the homologous major histocompatibility complex-linked complement C2 and factor B genes. For example, both murine factor B (30Ishikawa N. Nonaka M. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19040-19046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human C2 (27Horiuchi T. Macon K.J. Kidd V.J. Volanakis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6521-6524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mRNA forms expressed in a tissue-specific pattern vary in length of 5′-untranslated regions. In the case of murine factor B, one of the initiation codons within this 5′ extension has an effect on the rate of translation of factor B protein(32Garnier G. Colten H.R. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30 (abstr.): 11Google Scholar).The cell biological implications have not been ascertained for the several alternatively spliced mRNA species identified in murine and human tissues expressing C2.In the present report, we provide evidence that a relatively abundant transcript lacking exons 2 and 3 (Δex 2, 3) is the template for a previously recognized ∼70-kDa C2 protein that is found in lysates of every cell type that synthesizes and secretes native C2. This conclusion is based on (a) reverse transcriptase PCR identification of a truncated C2 mRNA in several different tissues, (b) quantitation of the truncated C2 by nuclease protection that shows a 1:2 relative abundance compared to full-length C2 mRNA, (c) sequence analysis that shows deletion of exons 2 and 3 at the authentic splice junctions, (d) expression of the truncated isoform in murine L-cells generates a 70-kDa polypeptide in cell lysates but no C2 protein is secreted into the medium. The subcellular location of the product of this truncated C2 mRNA is intracellular as suggested by fluorescent antibody staining of transfected L-cells. No cell surface membrane staining was apparent. Studies of cell-free synthesis in the presence of microsomes clearly establish that the truncated C2 protein can traverse the endoplasmic reticulum membrane even though it lacks 5 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the leader peptide. This deletion would likely make the product resistant to cleavage by the signal peptidase. This C2 protein is also lacking a portion of the amino-terminal domain critical for optimal binding to the C4b protein, which is required for generating the C3 cleaving enzyme of the classical activation pathway(33Oglesby T.J. Accavitti M.A. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar).The present study does not address the biological function of the 70-kDa intracellular C2 protein. It is possible that the 70-kDa C2 protein has no function and/or is simply a vestige of an ancestral protein. On the other hand, its presence in relatively high abundance within cells that express C2 and its regulation by interferon-γ (34Strunk R.C. Cole F.S. Perlmutter D.H. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15280-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that it may play a role in the intracellular traffic of C2 itself or of proteins that can interact with C2. Since the cleavage site that activates the C2 serine proteinase is intact, it is possible that it may serve an enzymatic function within the cell. INTRODUCTIONThe second component of human complement (C2) is a single chain glycoprotein (molecular mass, ∼100 kDa) (1Polley M.J. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Cooper N.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that carries the serine protease domain of a bimolecular complex enzyme comprised of cleavage products of C2 (C2a) and the fourth (C4) complement protein (C4b). This enzyme is responsible for cleavage of complement protein C3 to its biologically active fragments. C2 is encoded by a single gene that is on human chromosome 6p within the class III region of the"
