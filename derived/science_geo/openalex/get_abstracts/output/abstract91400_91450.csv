https://openalex.org/W2075435354,"The biosynthesis of melanin is initiated by the catalytic oxidation of tyrosine to dopa by tyrosinase in a reaction that requires dopa as a cofactor. Tyrosine then catalyzes the dehydrogenation of dopa to dopaquinone. The subsequent reactions can proceed spontaneously in vitro. Tyrosinase, purified from murine melanomas and the skins of brown mice, has now been shown to catalyze a third reaction in mammalian melanogenesis, namely the conversion of 5,6-dihydroxyindile to melanochrome. This reaction requires dopa as a cofactor and is inhibited by tyrosine. Conversely, 5,6-dihydroxyindole inhibits the oxidation of tyrosine to dopa, so that the relative concentrations of tyrosine and 5,6-dihydroxyindole within the mammalian pigment cell are capable of regulating melanogenesis in a previously unrecognized fashion. Tyrosinase has the unusual property of catalyzing three distinct reactions within a single biochemical pathway: the hydroxylation of a monophenol, the dehydrogenation of a catechol, and the dehydrogenation of a dihydroxyindole. The first and third of these reactions require dopa as a cofactor; in the second reaction, dopa is a substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1564857046,"Recently, a protein component of adhesion plaques with a molecular weight of 130,000 (named vinculin) has been purified from smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. As detected by immunological methods, the only vinculin-related polypeptides in fibroblasts are proteins of Mr = 130,000. However, we show here that smooth muscle contains, in addition to vinculin, an apparently distinct protein with a Mr = 152,000 that shares both structural and immunological features with vinculin. Amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, and antibody cross-reaction studies were used to elucidate these similarities. Mr = 152,000 protein seems to be restricted to muscle (mainly or exclusively to smooth muscle). The possibility that vinculin is derived from proteolytic processing of the Mr = 152,000 protein or that the proteins are related by some other type of post-translational modification appears unlikely (although this cannot be completely ruled out) since both proteins are made in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system when mRNA derived from smooth muscle is used as the template. Both proteins are capable of used as the template. Both proteins are capable of lowering the viscosity of F-actin solutions, although the activity of the Mr = 152,000 protein is stimulated by Ca2+ while the activity of smooth muscle vinculin is not."

https://openalex.org/W1993315080,"We have cloned five human immunoglobulin gamma genes from a fetal liver gene library. Four of them encode the known human immunoglobulin gamma chains gamma 1, gamma 2, gamma 3 and gamma 4. A fifth gamma gene seems to be a pseudogene. Nucleotide sequence determination demonstrates that the gamma 3 gene contains four separate hinge exons. Comparison of these hinge exons with those of the other gamma genes indicates that the first hinge exon is homologous to that of the pseudogene, and that the other three hinge exons are homologous to that of the gamma 1 gene, suggesting that the gamma 3 gene ancestor is a hybrid gene created by unequal crossing-over between the ancestral gamma 1 and psi gamma genes. Amplification of the gamma 1-type hinge exon probably followed to complete the gamma 3 gene. This hypothesis inevitably postulates the gene order 5'-gamma 1-gamma 3-psi gamma-3'. Cloning of overlapping chromosomal segments demonstrates that the gamma 2 gene is located 19 kb 5' to the gamma 4 gene. These analyses indicate that the human gamma-gene family has evolved by several types of DNA rearrangemet, including duplication of a complete gene; duplication of a hinge exon; and reassortment of exons by unequal cross-over between two adjacent genes."

https://openalex.org/W1565799270,"We found carbonic anhydrase activity associated with particulate fractions of homogenates of rat, rabbit, human, and bovine lungs. These membrane-associated carbonic anhydrases were remarkably stable in solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The bovine enzyme was dissolved with SDS and purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified enzyme contains glucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid; it is at least 20% carbohydrate. The apparent molecular weight by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (52,000) may be higher than the actual molecular weight due to the presence of carbohydrate. The enzyme contains cystine, an amino acid that is absent in bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. Dithiothreitol greatly accelerated the rate of inactivation of the membrane-associated enzyme in SDS, so disulfide bonds appear to stabilize this enzyme. The specific CO2-hydrating activity was about half that of the erythrocyte enzyme. Acetazolamide inhibits the membrane-associated enzyme (Ki = 10 nM) nearly as well as the erythrocyte enzyme (Ki = 3 nM). Antibody to bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase did not inhibit the membrane-associated enzyme. Other investigators have accumulated a good deal of evidence for carbonic anhydrase on the luminal surface of pulmonary capillaries. The enzyme described here appears to be a new isozyme whose properties are consistent with such a localization."
https://openalex.org/W1519815496,"The dithiothreitol-dependent vitamin K and vitamin K 2,3-epoxide hepatic microsomal reductase activities of warfarin-susceptible and warfarin-resistant rats were compared to gain insight into the role(s) of these activities in vitamin K metabolism and function. In microsomes from resistant rats, 3- to 4-fold more warfarin was required to produce 50% inhibition (I50) of vitamin K reduction to vitamin K hydroquinone than in microsomes from susceptible rats. For the reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K a 6-fold higher warfarin concentration was required. In microsomes from resistant rats, the I50 warfarin concentration required to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of microsomal precursor protein was also 4-fold higher with vitamin K as substrate and was 6-fold higher with the epoxide as substrate than in microsomes from susceptible rats. Collectively, these data suggest that the vitamin K reductase contributes to the metabolism of vitamin K in intact rats and that warfarin inhibition of both the vitamin K and vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductases is involved in its anticoagulant effect."

https://openalex.org/W1498435253,"Abstract The regulation of membrane lipid biogenesis was investigated by measuring the levels of the acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway. In particular, the role of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was assessed by focusing on the size and composition of the long chain acyl-ACP pool. The ACP( pool was specifically labeled in vivo with beta-[3-3H]alanine and the ACP subspecies analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography and conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis. The acyl-ACP pool was found to be a small fraction of the total ACP in normally growing cells and was particularly devoid of chain lengths that could serve as acyltransferase substrates. Inhibition of phospholipid synthesis at the acyltransferase step resulted in a rapid increase in the content of acyl-ACP, and analysis showed the presence of chain lengths that are acyltransferase substrates. Acyl-CoAs were not detected during interruption of acyl transfer activity. These results show that 1) acyl-ACPs are the acyl donors for phospholipid synthesis in vivo, 2) the acyltransferase does not play a role in the regulation of the lipid biosynthetic rate or the composition of phospholipid acyl moieties, 3) the primary regulatory site in phospholipid biosynthesis is at an early step in fatty acid biosynthesis, 4) feedback regulation by long chain acyl-ACP's is not a controlling mechanism for fatty acid synthesis under normal physiological circumstances, and 5) enzymes that utilize acyl-ACPs are involved in kinetic competition for the scarce acyl-ACP substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2028590958,"Both 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) increased the short-circuit current (Isc) in rabbit colonic mucosa mounted in vitro in Ussing chambers. Measurements of chlorine-36 fluxes indicated that the Isc response to 5-HPETE is due to stimulation of active chlorine secretion. 9-, 11-, and 12-HPETE's and leukotrienes C4 and B4 produced either very small increases in Isc or no increase. In contrast to results in rabbit colon, no HPETE, HETE, or leukotriene was effective in rabbit ileal mucosa. The effects of 5-HPETE in the rabbit colon were unaffected by mepacrine, but could be partially blocked by indomethacin. These results suggest that drugs which block both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase may be effective antidiarrheals in patients with colitis."
https://openalex.org/W182377548,"The hormonal regulation of phosphatidylinositol breakdown in isolated rat hepatocytes was studied using isotopic and chemical means. Phospholipids extracted from hepatocytes prepared from rats injected 18-20 h previously with [3H]myo-inositol showed radioactivity almost exclusively confined to phosphatidylinositol. Subsequent incubation of these hepatocytes resulted in the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity, 95% of which was shown to be myo-inositol. M) angiotensin I1 (lo-’ M), and ATP to M) stimulated the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity, whereas glucagon M), the ionophore A23187 (lo-‘ M), and the uncouplers 2,4-dinitrophenol M) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone M) were without effect. Studies with prazosin and yohimbine showed that the effect of epinephrine was mediated by al-adrenergic receptors. Vasopressin and epinephrine were also shown to cause the release of myo-inositol which was identified by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Both hormones produced no significant changes before 5 min, then caused a rapid release for 5 min, followed by a slower release through 45 min. At 30and 45 min, there were associated decreases in lipid radioactivity. Measurements of phospholipids by high performance liquid chromatography showed a decrease in phosphatidylinositol at 30 min with vasopressin.

https://openalex.org/W1602579358,"Leukotrienes are vasoactive arachidonic acid metabolites which are released by mast cells during hypersensitivity reactions. The mechanisms for regulating leukotriene biosynthesis are not well understood. A murine mast/basophil cell line (PT-18) was used to investigate this problem. Exogenously supplied [14C]arachidonic acid is not appreciably converted to leukotrienes by untreated PT-18 cells. However, when the cells were preincubated with the lymphocyte product 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), addition of [14C]arachidonic acid consistently resulted in a dose-dependent synthesis of large amounts of both [14C]leukotriene B4 and [14C]5-HETE. These metabolites were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography, converted to the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives, and the structures confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These findings indicate that 15-HETE induces a direct activation of a cryptic 5-lipoxygenase in these cells. The closely related 12-HETE was ineffective. The activation phenomenon occurs rapidly and is reversible. Furthermore, the activation appears to be highly cell- and enzyme-specific, since lipoxygenases in three primary cell types including one that contains a 5-lipoxygenase and six other cell lines did not show this specific induction of leukotriene biosynthesis by 15-HETE. This report is the first evidence that 15-HETE, a major arachidonate metabolite in lymphocytes, can act as a signal to activate leukotriene production by susceptible mast cells."

https://openalex.org/W2135751156,"The serum amyloid protein (apo-SAA) is a unique high density lipoprotein apoprotein exhibiting dramatic increases in plasma concentration following host injury. The events involved in the secretion of apo-SAA and assembly of apo-SAA-rich lipoprotein particles were studied in primary, serum-free culture of adult BALB/c mouse hepatocytes harvested 3 h following administration of the potent apo-SAA inducer, bacterial endotoxin (50 micrograms of intraperitoneally administered Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide). An approximately 3.5-fold increase in the initial rate of apo-SAA secretion was observed over that of hepatocytes isolated from control mice, whereas the rate of apo-A-I secretion was unchanged by endotoxin administration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of [35S]methionine-labeled cell products indicated the synthesis of both major mouse apo-SAA isotypes by hepatocytes. Essentially all of the secreted apo-SAA chromatographed in Sephadex G-150 with an elution volume corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 12,000. Approximately 90% of the secreted apo-SAA was recovered in fractions (d greater than 1.21 g/ml) following ultracentrifugal fractionation. In media supplemented with human lipoproteins (100 micrograms/ml), approximately 50% of the secreted apo-SAA was recovered in the high density lipoprotein fraction. These results suggest that mouse apo-SAA is secreted in monomeric form and becomes associated with lipoproteins in the intravascular compartment."

https://openalex.org/W75994862,"Osmotic lysis of human erythrocytes creates in each membrane a single large hole which subsequently contracts to a size determined largely by the buffer, typically 7-140 A in radius. Cations, but not anions, stimulated the rate and extent of hole size reduction with simple saturation behavior; the potency of Ca2+ exceeded M&+, which greatly surpassed Na+. The hole size was minimal at pH 5.5. Hole size change was greatly accelerated by increasing temperature between 0 and 50 “C. Whatever its size, the hole radius was stable to 21-2 A over several days at 0 “C. Cationic amphipaths such as chlorpromazine promoted hole closure in a salt-dependent fashion, while anionic amphipaths such as 2,4-dinitrophenolate or hexanoate opposed hole closure. Hole size thus appears to be determined by a balance between the force expanding the hole (electrostatic repulsion among anionic groups on the membrane) and the force driving hole closure (perhaps the hydrophobic effect of the lipid/ water interface at the hole perimeter and/or membrane elasticity). Hole size was initially completely reversible; however, the extent to which holes were able to expand and contract gradually diminished in parallel until the oles became fixed at an ambient size. The rate of this process increased directly with temperature, pH, and the presence of hexanol, and inversely with cation concentration. A 30% reduction in membrane cholesterol greatly accelerated the loss of hole sealing. Glutaraldehyde at 0.5 l ~ l ~ (0.005%) blocked hole closure (but not hole expansion) without cross-linking membrane proteins significantly. Once lost, the ability to expand hole size could be regenerated by osmotically stressing sucrosefilled ghosts. We infer that hole size dynamics. reflect metastable configurations of the membrane bilayer which can be reversibly altered, dissipated, and restored by experimental manipulations. Applications of the hemolytic hole as a continuously tunable molecular filter are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W66242901,"A rapid method for the purification of rat liver phosphorylase kinase 30,000-fold over homogenate values is described. The method allows the isolation of a near homogeneous preparation of phosphorylase kinase initially associated with the glycogen pellet to be accomplished within 24 h. The enzyme has Mr (apparent) = 1.3 million by gel filtration and is composed of subunits similar in size to those of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase. The enzyme is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase: phosphate is incorporated into two of the subunits (Mr = 140,000 and Mr = 116,000) and is closely paralleled by activation of the enzyme. The enzyme is partially inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and is stimulated by 10(-8)-10(-6) M Ca2+. The pH optimum of the nonactivated enzyme is 7.0. Activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase does not appear to alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme. However, it results in a large increase in activity at pH 7 through 8, but not at pH below 6.5. Purified rat liver phosphorylase kinase thus shows many similarities to purified skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase, but differs in respect to its incomplete inhibition by ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and to the effects of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on its pH activity profile and Ca2+ sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W2088306628,"The integumental pigment cells (erythrophores) of the squirrel fish, Holocentrus ascensionis, are specialized for rapid radial transport of the pigment granules contained within their cytoplasm. Pigment granules in isolated denervated erythrophores alternate spontaneously between a centrally aggregated state and a radially dispersed state. In the absence of external calcium, pigment aggregation does not occur spontaneously and cannot be induced by the aggregating agents epinephrine or high concentration of external K+. Pigment aggregation is also impaired in the presence of D600 or papaverine, compounds reported to antagonize calcium influx into the cell. Pigment aggregation can be induced by experimental elevation of the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, with a Ca-EGTA buffer system in conjunction with ionophore A23187. The threshold concentration of Ca2+ required to produce this effect is 5 X 10(-6) M. These results suggest that cytoplasmic free Ca2+ is involved in mediating pigment aggregation and that some, if not all, the Ca2+ is supplied by influx from the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1525829734,"Large unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were prepared by sonication and were fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose Cl-2B in the size range from 180- to 380-A Stokes radii. Negatively stained electron micrographs of these preparations indicated the presence of unilamellar, spheroidal structures of the expected size. Fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, dissolved in the vesicles, revealed progressively broader phase transitions, shifted to lower temperatures for vesicles of decreasing sizes. The fractionated unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles of DPPC were reacted with human apolipoprotein A-I at 41 degrees C for periods from 1 to 120 h. The reaction mixtures were then passed through a Bio-Gel A-5m column to separate unreacted lipid vesicles and protein from micellar complexes of DPPC with apolipoprotein A-I. Smaller vesicles were much more reactive than larger vesicles or multilamellar vesicles with the apolipoprotein. This difference in reactivity was explained by the increasing bilayer curvature of smaller vesicles which changes the packing of DPPC molecules in the bilayer and facilitates its penetration by the apolipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1537731113,"Stimulation of platelets with ionophore A23187 or thrombin indicates the existence of three distinct metabolic fractions of phosphatidylinositol. Two of those pools of phosphatidylinositol are degraded by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and the third one by a phospholipase A2 activity. Low concentrations of ionophore A23187 (100 nM) or thrombin (0.25 units/ml) induce the degradation by phospholipase C of a minor fraction of phosphatidylinositol which is involved in the phosphatidylinositol cycle. In addition, thrombin, but not ionophore A23187, leads to the degradation by phospholipase C of a larger fraction of phosphatidylinositol and the subsequent accumulation of phosphatidic acid. A third fraction of phosphatidylinositol, sensitive to thrombin (0.5-2 units/ml) or ionophore A23187 (0.5-2 microM), can be degraded by phospholipase A2 to lysophosphatidylinositol with the concomitant liberation of arachidonic acid. Degradation of phosphatidylinositol by the phospholipase C pathway precedes that of the phospholipase A2 pathway. The results also suggest that the phosphatidylinositol cycle is sensitive to a small rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. A further mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+ interrupts the phosphatidylinositol cycle by inhibiting conversion of phosphatidic acid to phosphatidylinositol and also activates phospholipases of the A2 type."
https://openalex.org/W1529154217,"The role of albumin has been studied in the plasma-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cultured fibroblasts. Immunoaffinity chromatography of plasma on immobilized anti-albumin antibody decreased by 25-50% total efflux catalyzed by plasma. The remainder of the efflux-promoting capacity of plasma was deleted by immunoaffinity chromatography on antibody to apolipoprotein A-I, the major apoprotein of high density lipoprotein. Both components of efflux were saturable with half-saturation at 0.5-1.0% (v/v) plasma. However, the net transport of sterol from cells to medium catalyzed by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, was not reduced by the deletion of the albumin-catalyzed component of efflux. This finding was confirmed with congenitally analbuminemic plasma. These results indicate that efflux to albumin and to high density lipoprotein in plasma represent independent mechanisms; only the latter is coupled to net transport."

We have previously characterized the endoglycosidase H-releasable oligosaccharides of this enzyme including those which are phosphorylated and involved in targeting to lysosomes. In this study, we report the characterization of the endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides which were released from beta-glucuronidase with anhydrous hydrazine. Approximately 65% of the hydrazine-released oligosaccharides are of the high mannose type, with the predominant species containing 9 mannose residues. The remaining oligosaccharides appear to originate from incomplete complex oligosaccharides. Their basic structures are Man alpha 1,6Man beta 1,4Glc-NAc beta 1,4GlcNAcol, and Man alpha 1,3[Man alpha 1,6]Man beta 1,4Glc-NAc beta 1,4GlcNAcol with roughly half of each species containing an additional fucose linked alpha 1,6 to the N-acetylglucosaminitol (GlcNAcol) residue. The small amount of complex oligosaccharide present bearing 1 sialic acid was heterogeneous in nature with incompletion of the nonsialylated branch. In addition, there was a minor specie of high mannose-type oligosaccharide bearing 5 mannose residues with an alpha 1,6-linked fucose on the GlcNAcol. This structure was not expected since high mannose-type oligosaccharides have been reported to not be substrates for the alpha 1,6-fucosyl transferase."

In systems containing cytochrome and reductase, the rate of NADH oxidation exceeded that of NADPH oxidation, indicating that reduced cytochrome b5 is an effective electron donor for prostaglandin H2 formation, enhancing both the initial rate and the extent of the reaction. The concentrations of reduced pyridine nucleotides and cytochrome b5 employed in these experiments to provide reductants for prostaglandin synthetase are within the concentration ranges that obtain under physiological conditions."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two major bands with molecular weights of 66,000 and 56,000. Judging from the molecular weight of 120,000 estimated by Sephadex gel filtration in Triton X-100 and the above electrophoretic result, the enzyme presumably exists normally as a dimer. It required Mn2+ for its activity and had a pH optimum at 6.7-6.9. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine in alpha 1 leads to 3 linkage to globoside. Neither Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc nor H blood group substance nor deglycosylated mucin were acceptors. This indicates that the enzyme was distinct from both the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases converting the H to the A blood group substance and catalyzing synthesis of the Ser(Thr)-GalNAc linkage. Studies on substrate specificities indicate that the preferred substrates have the general structure GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal-OR in which the nature of the R moiety has relatively little effect on activity. Kinetic analysis indicates UDP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to globoside. These studies demonstrate the first report of the properties of a purified enzyme catalyzing the transfer of sugar residues to glycolipids."

The original cytochrome P-450LM4 fraction catalyzed 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol, 12 alpha-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol, 25-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol, 6 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone, and demethylation of ethylmorphine. Cytochrome P-450LM4 I was inactive in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation, but catalyzed the other hydroxylations. Cytochrome P-450LM4 II catalyzed efficient cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation. It also catalyzed the other hydroxylations, although at lower rates than cytochrome P-450LM4 I. Emulgen inhibited all steroid hydroxylase activities in cytochrome P-450LM4 II except the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Cytochrome P-450LM4 I and cytochrome P-450LM4 II showed the same apparent molecular weight and spectral properties as the original cytochrome P-450LM4 fraction. The two subfractions differed in amino acid composition. They produced similar but not identical one-dimensional peptide maps upon limited proteolysis with papain, chymotrypsin, and trypsin. The results show that cytochrome P-450LM4 from cholestyramine-treated rabbits contains at least two species with different amino acid compositions and different substrate specificities toward C27-steroids involved in biosynthesis of bile acids."

The HDL2 subfraction is markedly reduced, as compared to control subjects; the HDL3 subfraction, on the other hand, shows a marked heterogeneity, being characterized by at least three particle subpopulations, identified as HDL3-I, HDL3-II, and HDL3-III. The HDL3 fraction purified from the AI Milano subjects eluted as a symmetrical peak from a 6% agarose column, corresponding to a unimodal particle size distribution. The content of the different HDL3 particles, detected by cross-linking, varied widely along the elution profile, the tail of the peak being enriched in anomalous particles of very small size (HDL3-III). Apoprotein compositional studies indicated that these small HDL3-III may be enriched in the AIM monomer, the larger particles containing more AIM-AII complexes and AIM dimers. All the anomalous HDL3 particles are triglyceride enriched, with a decreased cholesterol ester content. They may be an intermediate product in the cholesterol transfer chain between HDL and very low density lipoproteins, or be generated during interconversion of HDL. These particles may have a functional role in tissue cholesterol homeostasis; their unusual compositional changes may help explain the protection of the studied subjects from tissue cholesterol deposition, in spite of the marked decrease of the total HDL fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1483023723,"Several aspects of purine metabolism were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and fibroblasts from a patient with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency and compared to cells from normal controls. Intact cells were incubated with radioactive purine bases and all purine metabolites were extracted and analyzed. Incubation of purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient cells with [3H]hypoxanthine and [3H]guanine resulted in the accumulation of large proportions of the incorporated radioactivity into inosine (60-80%) and to lesser extent into guanosine (15-30%), respectively, whereas normal cells accumulated only minor amounts of inosine and guanosine. This observation indicates that purine nucleoside phosphorylase, together with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and nucleoside monophosphate phosphatase, participate in remarkably active inosine and guanosine cycles. These purine nucleoside cycles may play a role in the regulation of intracellular purine nucleotide levels. The absence of these cycles in purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patients may be detrimental to the differentiation of lymphocytes."

We have used this system to characterize the acyl specificity of deacylation. Cells were labeled with either [14C]linoleic, [14C]eicosatrienoic (delta 8,11,14 or delta 5,8,11), or [14C]arachidonic acid and stimulated with 10 nM TPA. We found that TPA stimulated the deacylation of all four acids, primarily from phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine.l Only products from linoleic (presumably through chain elongation and desaturation), eicosatrienoic (delta 8,11,14), and arachidonic acids produced prostaglandins. Those produced from linoleic and eicosatrienoic acid (delta 8,11,14)-labeled cells were determined to be primarily of the 1-series, while arachidonic acid-labeled cells produced prostaglandins of the 2-series. Together these results indicate that the stimulated deacylation of phospholipids is not specific for arachidonic acid and that the membrane acyl composition controls the particular series of prostaglandin which is produced."

Radioactive products were characterized by co-chromatography with chemically synthesized standards, UV-visible spectra, and mass spectrometry of acetate derivatives.

The inclusion of 5 mM 3,3,3-trichloropropene-1,2-oxide, an epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, produced the same products but in a ratio of 1:2.3:1.2. Incubations with purified prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase yielded the three products in a ratio of 1:2.8:0.7. The major nonpolar product was identified as benzo[a]pyrene. The polar products of metabolism, the effects of 3,3,3-trichloropropene-1,2-oxide on their distribution, and the detection of a mutagenic intermediate support the conclusion that H2BP is co-oxygenated during prostaglandin biosynthesis to 9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene."

https://openalex.org/W1598887880,"The protease which initiates the rapid protein degradation during germination of Bacillus megaterium spores was synthesized during sporulation as a Mr = 46,000 polypeptide (P46) which was found in the developing forespore. P46 was processed during sporulation to a Mr = 41,000 species (P41) 2-3 h after P46 synthesis and at the time of or slightly before accumulation of dipicolinic acid. P41 was the predominant form of the protease in the dormant spore, with smaller amounts of unprocessed P46. In the first minutes of spore germination P41 was processed (t1/2 less than 10 min) to a Mr = 40,000 species (P40), which appeared identical to the subunit of the purified active enzyme. The latter processing reaction did not require metabolic energy, but P40 disappeared completely during further germination (t1/2 approximately 40 min) in a reaction which did require metabolic energy. It seems probable that precursors P46 and P41 of the spore protease are involved in the regulation of the activity of this spore enzyme."

The alpha-substituted compounds, alpha, alpha-dimethyl-, and alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone were anticonvulsant compounds with a spectrum of activity similar to that of ethosuximide. In contrast, beta-substituted compounds were convulsant agents similar to picrotoxinin. The alpha-substituted-gama-butyrolactones represent a new class of anticonvulsant drug with experimental and clinical potential."
https://openalex.org/W1512272279,"The citrate synthase of yeast was purified to homogeneity and shown to have a subunit molecular weight of 52,000. Antibodies were prepared to it in rabbits. Translation of total yeast mRNA using a reticulocyte lysate showed that [3H]leucine was incorporated into a protein precipitable by rabbit anti-yeast citrate synthase with a molecular weight of about 54,000. No incorporation of [35S]methionine into an anti-citrate synthase precipitable protein could be detected in a similar experiment. In vivo labeling of cells with 35SO4 did not result in the labeling of citrate synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1524148802,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from the chemolithotrophic hydrogen bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus was maximally active in the presence of 50 mM HCO3- plus 10 mM Mg2+. Deactivation occurred upon removal of these ions. Reactivation was achieved by incubation of the enzymes with HCO3- plus Mg2+. The concentration of HCO3- (CO2) required for half-maximal activation was 1.84 nM (0.064 mM). Sedimentation velocity studies revealed that activation/deactivation is associated with drastic changes in the sedimentation properties of the enzyme. While the inactive form had a sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, of 17.5 S, the s20,w gradually decreased as the enzyme was reactivated and the fully reactivated form exhibited an s20,w of 14.3 S. A structural analogue of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, xylulose 1,5-bisphosphate, caused a deactivation of the enzyme concomitant with an increase in the sedimentation velocity. It is suggested that the alterations in the hydrodynamic properties accompanying the activation/deactivation process are due to considerable conformational changes that affect the molecular volume and/or the shape of the enzyme. Dissociation/association events were not involved in the changes. The s20,w of about 18 S, generally reported for the large hexadecameric ribulose bisphosphate carboxylases, appears to be characteristic of the inactive form."
https://openalex.org/W1753280713,"Rabbit liver glycogen synthase have been purified close to apparent homogeneity in a form dependent on glucose-6-P for full activity. From analyses of the purified enzyme by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, some five polypeptides, apparent molecular weights in the range 79,000 to 90,000, correlated with enzyme activity. The relative abundance of the species varied in different preparations but enzyme could be prepared that was composed almost entirely of a 90,000-dalton polypeptide. Treatment of such enzyme with trypsin generated smaller polypeptides in the sequence 90,000 leads to 85,000 leads to 82,000 leads to 80,000; concomitantly, the enzyme was activated when assayed either in the presence or absence of glucose-6-P. Tryptic proteolysis caused as much as a 16-fold increase in Vmax and a 20-fold increase in the concentration of its substrate, UDP-glucose, necessary for half-maximal activity. The concentration of the activator, glucose-6-P, needed for half-maximal stimulation was decreased 3.5-fold. We propose that rabbit liver glycogen synthase in a glucose-6-P-dependent form has a subunit of apparent molecular weight approximately 90,000, larger than previously reported, and that the enzyme is sensitive to proteolytic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1493266413,"During gluconeogenesis from L-glutamine, 14CO2 is fixed into glucose. Inhibitors of pyruvate transport or pyruvate carboxylase only slightly decrease the 14CO2 incorporation, indicating that a pathway of formation of pyruvate, followed by pyruvate carboxylation, is not primarily involved. These results suggest that 14CO2 fixation is effected by a reverse (exchange) reaction of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. MnCl2 (0.5 mM) stimulates the 14CO2 fixation in glucose from L-glutamine by nearly 50%. This result is in accord with a recent study (Colombo, G., Carlson, G. M., and Lardy, H. A. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 2749-2757) showing that Mn2+ greatly stimulates the reverse reaction (P-enolpyruvate leads to oxalacetate) of purified rat liver P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. Preliminary calculations suggest that 14CO2 is also fixed by reversible P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase activity during gluconeogenesis from L-lactate, in addition to the fixation of H14CO3(-) in the pyruvate carboxylase forward reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1564945191,"Specifically 14C-labeled mevalonic acids were administered to rats in diabetic ketosis, and the distribution of 14C was determined in the hydroxybutyric acid each rat excreted. Also, the distributions of 14C were determined in hydroxybutyric acid formed by slices of livers and kidneys from rats in diabetic ketosis and incubated with the specifically labeled mevalonic acids. The distributions found are in accord with the conversion of mevalonate to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA by the shunt pathway proposed by J. Edmond and G. Popjak ((1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 66-71). That is, carbon 5 of mevalonate was metabolized to form the carboxyl of acetyl-CoA and carbons 2 and 3 of mevalonate were converted in large measure to hydroxybutyric acid without acetyl-CoA as an intermediate, i.e. the bond between carbon 2 and 3 was not cleaved, while the bond between 1 and 2, traced with [1,2-14C]mevalonate, was cleaved. Similar distributions of 14C were found in hydroxybutyric acid excreted by rats in diabetic ketosis administered specifically 14C-labeled isovaleric acids, isovaleric acid having in its metabolism intermediates common to those in the shunt pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1488248869,"An analysis of the peptide maps of the sigma factors and core-associated subunits of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase has revealed that all the sigma factors ad core-associated polypeptides are derived from separate genes and are not proteolytically modified products of the major 55,000-dalton sigma factor. A comparison of the peptide pattern of the major B. subtilis and Escherichia coli sigma factors revealed limited homology between them. Furthermore, antibody prepared against the 55,000-dalton B. subtilis sigma factor cross-reacted against the E. coli sigma factor, but not against any of the other B. subtilis sigma factors and core-associated polypeptides. These results unambiguously demonstrate the independently derived nature of the B. subtilis RNA polymerase core-associated subunits and the partial relationship between the major sigma factors of B. subtilis and E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1523324607,"4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase is inactivated by preincubation with bispyridoxal-5-P (mixing molar ratio, 20:1) at pH 7.0. The reaction with bispyridoxal-5-P under pseudo-first order conditions proceeds at a slow rate (kobs = 0.03 min-1). The extent of chemical modification was determined by measuring the spectroscopic properties of P-pyridoxyl and P-pyridoxine chromophores formed after reduction of the enzyme reacted with P'P2-bis(5'-pyridoxal) diphosphate. Reduction with NaBH4 results in the incorporation of approximately 2.1 P-pyridoxyl residues/dimer. Thus, the blocking of 2 lysyl residues/dimer is needed for inactivation of the aminotransferase. The time course of inactivation is significantly affected by variations in the pH of the reaction mixtures. Plots of Kobs versus pH indicate the reaction of the bifunctional reagent with lysyl residues characterized by low pK values (pK = 7.3). The substrate alpha-ketoglutarate (10 mM) affords complete protection against inactivation, whereas pyridoxal-5-P failed to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme by bispyridoxal-5-P. It is postulated that binding of alpha-ketoglutarate to lysyl residues is the major factor contributing to stabilization of the catalytic site. Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that inactivation of the aminotransferase cannot be related to dissociation of the cofactor from the catalytic site. The bifunctional reagent bispyridoxal-5-P blocks lysyl residues other than those involved in the binding of the cofactor."
