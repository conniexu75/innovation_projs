https://openalex.org/W2030415964,"We have found that injection of bacteriophage lambda DNA into unfertilized Xenopus eggs causes the assembly around the DNA of structures resembling typical eucaryotic cell nuclei. These spherical structures begin to form 60-90 min after injection. They contain lambda DNA and are bounded by a phase-dense envelope. Immunofluorescent staining of the lambda-DNA-containing structures with anti-lamin antibody reveals the presence of the lamin nuclear proteins at the periphery of the structure, a pattern identical to that of embryonic nuclei. Electron microscopy reveals that the injected DNA is surrounded by a double bilayer nuclear membrane containing nuclear pore complexes. The ""nuclei"" containing lambda DNA respond to modulators of the Xenopus cell cycle in a manner that mimics the response of embryonic nuclei to these modulators during mitosis. These results suggest that nuclear reassembly and breakdown occur independently of specific DNA sequence information."
https://openalex.org/W1604033142,"Vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein localized at adhesion plaques, is a phosphoprotein containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Vinculin has been previously shown to be a substrate for pp60src, a phosphotyrosine protein kinase, but the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of the other amino acid residues is unknown. The present report examines the phosphorylation of vinculin by various serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases. Only protein kinase C, the calcium-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates vinculin at a significant rate (24 nmol/min/mg) and displays marked specificity for vinculin. Both calcium and phosphatidylserine were required for vinculin phosphorylation by protein kinase C. In addition, both phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (10 nM) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM) stimulated vinculin phosphorylation by protein kinase C at a limiting calcium concentration (10(-6) M). Tryptic peptide analysis revealed two major sites of phosphorylation. One site contained phosphoserine and the other contained phosphothreonine. When compared with tryptic maps of vinculin phosphorylated by src kinase, no overlapping phosphorylated peptides were found. The present findings coupled with the plasma membrane location of both these proteins suggest that vinculin may be a physiologic substrate for protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1590346152,"Lysosomes were purified approximately 40-fold from rat kidney cortex by differential and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. In a sucrose medium, the lysosomes quenched the fluorescence of the potential sensitive dye diS-C3-(5) (3,3'-dipropylthiocarbo-cyanine iodide) in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the dye accumulates within the lysosomal interior. After treatment of the lysosomes with valinomycin, the dye fluorescence displayed a logarithmic dependence upon the external K+ concentration; thus, the fluorescence signal provides a semiquantitative measure of the lysosomal membrane potential (delta psi). In the absence of valinomycin, lysosomal quenching of diS-C3-(5) fluorescence was partially reversed by agents which collapse the lysosomal pH gradient (ammonium sulfate, chloroquine, and K nigericin), suggesting that the proton gradient across the lysosomal membrane contributes to delta psi. A rapid increase in diS-C3-(5) fluorescence, indicative of an increase in delta psi, was observed upon the addition of Mg-ATP to the lysosomes. The ATP-dependent fluorescence change was inhibited by protonophores, K valinomycin, permeable anions, and N-ethylmaleimide, but was unaffected by ammonium sulfate, K nigericin, or sodium vanadate. Oligomycin had no effect at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml; at higher concentrations, oligomycin partially inhibited the fluorescence response to Mg-ATP, but it also inhibited the fluorescence response to K valinomycin, suggesting that it had modified the permeability of the lysosomal membrane. Dicylohexylcarbodiimide behaved similarly to oligomycin. Mg-ATP also altered the lysosomal distribution of 86Rb+ (in the presence of valinomycin) and S[14C]CN-, consistent with an increase in the potential of the lysosomal interior of 40-50 mV. The results demonstrate that the lysosomal proton pump is electrogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1970516061,"Initiation of DNA replication in plasmid R6K is potentiated by the plasmid-encoded 35 kd replication initiator protein. We had previously reported that the initiator bound to two regions of R6K DNA called Site I and Site II. Using DNAase I footprinting technique we have demonstrated that the initiator bound to seven tandem repeats of a 22 bp long sequence in Site I. In Site II, the initiator bound to a single repeat having the same consensus sequence and to two partial repeats that most likely overlap the promoter of the initiation protein cistron. Using dimethyl sulfate as a chemical probe, we have determined the purine residues of Site I and Site II that make contact with the initiator protein. The results show that eight out of nine contact points per repeat in Site I were located on one of the two strands of the DNA. The binding of the initiator to the Site II sequence could explain the observed autoregulation of the synthesis of the initiator protein by promoter occlusion."
https://openalex.org/W1589033807,"The regulating effect of Ca2+ on the association and dissociation of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex from human platelet membranes was determined both for detergent-solubilized and intact plasma membranes. Glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were solubilized from isolated membranes with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in buffers containing ionized calcium, which resulted in the formation of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. With the addition of EGTA to reduce the ionized calcium content of the solution, the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex dissociated. This dissociation was measured by comparing the sedimentation properties of the glycoproteins and by observing the susceptibility of glycoprotein IIb to thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis. With 10(-3) M Ca2+, glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were resistant to hydrolysis at thrombin concentrations up to 2.4 X 10(-5) M. When the Ca2+ concentration was decreased to less than 10(-4) M by chelation with EDTA or EGTA, glycoprotein IIb was cleaved by thrombin. This increased susceptibility to thrombin hydrolysis at decreasing Ca2+ levels correlated with the increased dissociation of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex as determined by sucrose density centrifugation. Susceptibility to thrombin hydrolysis was also used as a probe to determine the extent to which Ca2+ regulates the formation of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex within membranes. At more than micromolar levels of Ca2+, less than 10% of the membrane-bound glycoprotein IIb was cleaved by thrombin. Increased hydrolysis was observed at decreasing concentrations of Ca2+. Resistance to thrombin hydrolysis was partially regained upon the readdition of Ca2+ to dissociated glycoproteins. These data indicate that micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ exert a direct effect on platelet plasma membrane structure by regulating the intramembranous interactions of glycoprotein IIb."
https://openalex.org/W1488735754,"Human platelets incubated in the presence of 54 microM [1-14C]22:6 produced hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHE) at about half the rate with which 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid is produced from [1-14C]arachidonic acid. More than 90% of the radioactivity in HDHE was distributed among two major isomers, 14-HDHE and 11-HDHE. The production of HDHEs was unaffected by indomethacin but completely inhibited by 5,8,11,14-heneicosatetraynoic acid, which suggests that the hydroxy fatty acids are produced by lipoxygenase. The proportions of HDHE isomers varied with the concentration of 22:6. The ratio 14-HDHE/11-HDHE was higher at 6.8 microM 22:6 than when platelets were incubated with 54 microM 22:6. It is suggested that the amounts of these isomers produced will depend both on the availability of 22:6 as well as by competition of this acid with other acids for lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1673579390,"Reaction of the photoaffinity label 8-azido-[2-3H] ATP with bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase abolishes its enzyme activity; inhibition is prevented by ATP (Wagenvoord, R.J., van der Kraan, I., and Kemp, A. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 460, 17-24). More than 65% of the radioactivity is associated with the beta-subunit and about 25% with the alpha-chains. Radioactivity in the beta-subunit is localized in two specific regions. One corresponds to residues 1-12 (Runswick, M.J., and Walker, J.E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3081-3089), a region which is nonessential for catalysis. Radioactivity in the second region is localized predominantly on three amino acids, lysine 301, isoleucine 304, and tyrosine 311. It seems likely that these residues are found in the vicinity of the ATP binding site of F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2103973831,"In diabetes, certain basement membranes become thicker yet more porous than normal. To identify possible changes in the basement membrane, we have grown the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor, a tissue that produces quantities of basement membrane in normal mice and in streptozotocin-treated, insulin-deficient, diabetic mice. The level of laminin, a basement membrane-specific glycoprotein, and the level of total protein were slightly elevated in the diabetic tissue. In contrast, the level of the basement membrane specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan was only 20% of control. The synthesis of this proteoglycan was also reduced in the diabetic animals, while the synthesis of other proteoglycans by tissues such as cartilage was normal. The synthesis of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan in diabetic animals was inversely related to plasma glucose levels showing an abrupt decrease above the normal range of plasma glucose. Insulin restored synthesis to normal but this required doses of insulin that maintained plasma glucose at normal levels for several hours. Since the heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the basement membrane restricts passage of proteins, its absence could account for the increased porosity of basement membrane in diabetes. A compensatory synthesis of other components could lead to their increased deposition and the accumulation of basement membrane in diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1985295499,The yeast SUP53 gene encodes a leucine-inserting amber suppressor tRNA. We have introduced specific base substitutions into both 5' and 3' elements of the intragenic promoter of this tRNA gene. The influence of these sequence changes on promoter function has been investigated by transcription of the mutant genes in a homologous cell-free system. Our results do not support the idea that tertiary intragenic structure is important in tRNA gene transcription. For one of the SUP53 mutants we are able to suggest a plausible molecular basis for defective transcription: a single base substitution in the 3' element of the intragenic promoter prevents the interaction of this element with a putative transcription factor.
https://openalex.org/W1493924526,"The complete amino acid sequence of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase has been determined by isolating the 11 peptide fragments produced by the cyanogen bromide cleavage reaction and subjecting these to automated sequencing procedures. Products produced by treatment of some of these fragments with hydroxylamine, iodosobenzoic acid, mild acid, cyanogen bromide in formic and heptafluorobutyric acids, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and trypsin (with or without blocking at lysine residues) were used to complete the sequence for each of the cyanogen bromide fragments. The cyanogen bromide fragments were ordered by isolating the four tryptic peptides produced by a limited tryptic digest of the native enzyme in the presence of its substrates and its bivalent metal ion activator, Mg2+, degrading these by means of trypsin, after blocking digestion at lysine residues, and isolating and identifying all fragments thus produced that contained 10 or more residues. The 561-residue sequence thus obtained is one of the longest that has been determined by chemical means. There is excellent agreement between this sequence and published compositions after appropriate normalization. The absorbance of the enzyme is about 7.0 at 278 nm for a 1% solution; this value is 9% lower than that previously used."
https://openalex.org/W1553956082,"Ischemic myocardium was produced by occluding the left circumflex coronary artery in anesthetized dogs for 10 or 20 min. Autolyzed myocardium was produced by incubating transmural samples of canine left ventricle at 37 degrees C for 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 60 min. Tissue pH was recorded continuously in each model using a microcombination pH electrode impaled into the midmyocardium. Mitochondria isolated from both ischemic and autolyzed tissue exhibited marked parallel depressions of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity, Km ATP, and Vmax. All of these parameters dropped more markedly during the zero flow autolytic process than during the low flow ischemia characteristic of the canine left circumflex occlusion model. The changes in the ATPase kinetic parameters paralleled closely the drop in tissue pH in each model. These ATPase kinetic changes were then reproduced in vitro both quantitatively and qualitatively by incubating isolated control mitochondria at the same pH values under nonenergizing conditions. It thus became evident that we had, in effect, utilized the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase as an in situ indicator of cell acidosis. Reperfusion of 15-min ischemic myocardium was accompanied by a complete reversal of the acidosis and of the ATPase activity inhibition. The ATPase inhibition demonstrable in vitro in isolated mitochondria occurred when the pH was lowered, but only when there was a concomitant dissipation of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The ATPase inhibition was then reversed completely during a subsequent state 4 incubation by a carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive process."
https://openalex.org/W1551686180,"ATP hydrolysis with CaATP as a substrate was characterized at 0 degrees C and pH 7.0 using purified ATPase preparations of sarcoplasmic reticulum and compared with that with MgATP as a substrate. The maximal rate of enzyme phosphorylation and the Km value for the phosphorylation were 8 to 10 times less for CaATP than for MgATP. Each substrate appeared to act as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the other in enzyme phosphorylation. The phosphoenzyme formed from CaATP turned over slowly because the conversion rate of the ADP-sensitive (E1P) to ADP-insensitive (E2P) phosphoenzyme was very slow. E2Ps, formed from both CaATP and MgATP, were similar in that KCl, MgCl2, or ATP accelerated their decomposition. Their sensitivity to KCl and/or ATP was retained even after a long incubation with excess EDTA. When the enzyme had been phosphorylated from CaATP, calcium remained bound to the enzyme even in the presence of excess EDTA. The observed parallelism between the amount and behavior of the enzyme-bound calcium and those of E2P strongly suggests that 1 mol of E2P has 1 mol of tightly bound calcium. During steady state ATP hydrolysis with CaATP as a substrate, a significant amount of the enzyme-ATP complex accumulated as a reaction intermediate because of slow dissociation of CaATP from the CaATP-enzyme complex and slow enzyme phosphorylation from the CaATP-enzyme complex. These results indicate that Mg2+ is not essential for the turnover of the calcium pump ATPase. It was proposed that the metal component of the substrate basically determines affinity of the substrate to the enzyme and the catalytic mechanism of subsequent reaction steps."

https://openalex.org/W1536733402,"We have conducted a detailed investigation of in vitro transcription from the bacteriophage lambda PR promoter in order to examine various aspects of the mechanism of rho-dependent termination. In these studies, we have focused particularly on nucleotide sequence specificity, both at the termini and at potential rho-binding sites on the mRNA, and on the relationships between elongation, pausing, and termination. Rho-terminated transcripts from restriction fragment templates have been analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and termination efficiencies have been established by densitometry of autoradiographs. Termination sites on the template have been located by comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of terminated transcripts with those of transcripts of known length that have been artificially terminated by the incorporation of 3‘-O-methyl nucleotides. We have identified five discrete rho-dependent termination sites located between 290 and 450 base pairs downstream from the lambda PR promoter. These rho-dependent 3‘-termini are somewhat heterogeneous in details of sequence and potential RNA secondary structure, but all possess features that appear to be characteristic of RNA polymerase elongation pausing sites (Morgan, W. D., Bear, D. G., and von Hippel, P. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9565-9574). The efficiency of termination at individual sites ranges from 20 to 70% under the usual in vitro transcription conditions; termination is inhibited by increasing the monovalent salt concentration. Lowering nucleoside triphosphate substrate concentrations increases termination efficiency at some sites located 290 or more base pairs downstream from PR, but does not enhance termination at sites closer to PR. The substitution of inosine for guanosine residues in the transcript, which decreases the stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid and of secondary structure in the nascent mRNA, results in strong rho-dependent termination at several new sites located 100 to 260 base pairs downstream from PR. In Morgan et al. (cited above), data on RNA polymerase elongation pausing as a function of reaction conditions are correlated with these termination results, and a general model for rho-dependent termination is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556256043,"The kinetics of elongation of the mRNA that initiates from the lambda PR promoter has been examined using specific restriction fragments as template, and the locations at which significant pausing of the RNA polymerase occurs during in vitro transcription have been established. Major pausing of polymerase, in the absence of rho, occurs at the five rho-dependent termination sites (located between 290 and 450 base pairs downstream from PR) that are described in the accompanying article (Morgan, W. D., Bear, D. G., and von Hippel, P. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9553-9564). The replacement of guanosine by inosine triphosphate in the transcription mix results in the appearance of new pausing sites; these pausing sites correspond, in part, to the new rho-dependent termini between 100 and 260 base pairs from PR identified in the preceding article (cited above) when inosine replaces guanosine in the transcript. The effects of variations in nucleoside triphosphate and salt concentrations on pausing have also been determined. Analysis of the base pair sequences of pausing sites shows that pausing may result from the presence of dyad symmetry, GC-rich sequences, or (for inosine-substituted transcripts) C-rich sequences in the RNA-DNA hybrid region. Quantitation of RNA polymerase pausing at termination loci indicates that pausing sites with relaxation times of 10 to 25 s (at 37 degrees C and 100 to 200 mM KCl) can lead to significant rho-dependent termination. In addition, increasing the length of natural pauses by lowering the concentrations of specific nucleoside triphosphate substrates can lead to increased termination efficiency, but only at sites that correspond to rho-dependent termini in elongation experiments conducted at standard concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. These results, and the findings of the article cited above, are interpreted in terms of a two-component model for rho-dependent termination. Required are: (i) a significant pause in transcript elongation due to sequence and/or structural features at the termination site(s); and (ii) a rho-binding site(s) on the nascent mRNA that is long (70-90 nucleotide residues) and relatively free of secondary structure, and that contains appropriate sequences of cytidine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1573979862,"Vanadate induces the formation of two-dimensional crystalline arrays of Ca2+-ATPase molecules in sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+-ATPase membrane crystals are evenly distributed among the terminal cisternae and longitudinal tubules of sarcoplasmic reticulum, but very few crystals were observed in the T tubules. Tryptic cleavage of the Ca2+ transport ATPase into two major fragments (A and B) did not interfere with the vanadate-induced formation of membrane crystals. The ability of Ca2+-ATPase to crystallize was lost after further cleavage of the A fragment into the A1 and A2 subfragments that is known to be accompanied by loss of Ca2+ uptake. Vanadate (0.1-5 mM) inhibited the secondary cleavage of Ca2+-ATPase by trypsin suggesting that the susceptibility of the tryptic cleavage sites is influenced either by the conformation of the enzyme or by the formation of ATPase crystals."

Zimelidine, an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, reversed this ethanol-induced impairment. The serotonin neurotransmitter system may mediate learning and memory in humans and may determine some of the effects of alcohol on higher mental functions."
https://openalex.org/W1585478607,"The effects of fibrinogen and its plasmic cleavage fragments on the activation of Glu-, Lys-, and Val442- plasminogen by urokinase were investigated. A possible explanation for the large variations in the published steady state parameters for Glu-plasminogen activation is the undetected formation of Lys-plasminogen and its subsequent more rapid activation to plasmin. When Lys-plasminogen formation was avoided, the Km for Glu-plasminogen activation by urokinase was 2.5 microM with or without lysine present and the catalytic rate constant (kcat) was 3.4 min-1 in the absence of lysine, but increased to 49.0 min-1 in its presence. For Lys-plasminogen activation, both the Km of 2.7 microM and the kcat of 57.8 min-1 were only slightly increased by lysine. With Val442-plasminogen, the absence of the first 4 kringle structures of Lys-plasminogen resulted in a 6-fold higher Km and a 3-fold higher kcat, both of which were relatively unchanged by lysine. The specificity of urokinase for Val442-plasminogen, as measured by the quotient kcat/Km was thus half that for Lys-plasminogen. Fibrinogen, Fragment D, and Fragment E enhanced the rate of activation of Glu-plasminogen to Glu-plasmin as measured by the irreversible binding of plasmin to fluorescently labeled bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Both fibrinogen and Fragment D increased the value of kcat/Km about 4-fold whereas Fragment E caused a 2-fold enhancement. In contrast to Glu-plasminogen activation, the urokinase activation of Lys-plasminogen was not affected by fibrinogen or its fragments, yet a marked inhibition of Lys-plasmin autolysis occurred in their presence, with the half-life of plasmin being increased 13-fold by fibrinogen, 5-fold by Fragment D, and 3-fold by Fragment E. The K4 kringle region may be particularly involved in the plasmin-plasmin interaction that results in autolysis, since it significantly reduced degradation when incubated with Lys-plasmin. Val442-plasmin displayed essentially no autolysis, which further implicates the first 4 kringles in the autolytic reactions. In addition to these effects, the rate of Glu-plasminogen conversion to Lys-plasminogen by plasmin was increased 4-fold by fibrinogen or Fragment E, but only 2-fold by Fragment D. This augmentation was not merely due to inhibition of Lys-plasmin autolysis since Fragment D has a greater effect in that regard. The sum of these interactions indicates that Glu-plasminogen binds to the Fragment D region of fibrinogen/fibrin through its low affinity binding site(s) and, as when lysine binds at these sites, the activation to Glu-plasmin is then accelerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1510850749,"Most, if not all, of the DNA polymerase alpha activity in monkey and human cells was complexed with at least two proteins, C1 and C2, that together stimulated the activity of this enzyme from 180- to 1800-fold on low concentrations of denatured DNA, parvovirus DNA, M13, and phi X174 DNA or RNA-primed DNA templates, and poly(dT):oligo(dA) or oligo(rA). These primer-template combinations, which have from 200 to 5000 bases of template/primer, were then 7- to 50-fold more effective as substrates than DNase I-activated DNA. C1C2 specifically stimulated alpha polymerase, and only from the same cell type. Alpha X C1C2-polymerase reconstituted from purified alpha polymerase and the C1C2 cofactor complex behaved the same as native alpha X C1C2-polymerase and C1C2 had no effect on the sensitivity of alpha polymerase to aphidicolin, dideoxythymidine triphosphate, and N-ethylmaleimide. In the presence of substrates with a high ratio of single-stranded DNA template to either DNA or RNA primar, C1C2 increased the rate of DNA synthesis by decreasing the Km for the DNA substrate, decreasing the Km for the primer itself, increasing the use of shorter primers, and stimulating incorporation of the first deoxyribonucleotide. In contrast, C1C2 had no effect on the Km values for deoxyribonucleotide substrates (which were about 150-fold higher than for DNA replication in isolated nuclei), the ability of specific DNA sequences to arrest alpha polymerase, or the processivity of alpha polymerase. Accordingly, C1C2 function as primer recognition proteins. However, C1C2 did not reduce the comparatively high Km values or stimulate DNA synthesis by alpha polymerase on lambda DNA ends and DNase I-activated DNA, substrates with 12 and about 30-70 bases of template/primer, respectively. DNA restriction fragments with 1 to 4 bases of template/primer were substrates for neither alpha nor alpha X C1C2-polymerase. Therefore, we propose that C1C2 enhances the ability of alpha polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis by eliminating nonproductive binding of the enzyme to single-stranded DNA, allowing it to slide along the template until it recognizes a primer."

The rate of cerebral glucose utilization in the frontal lobe of a 51-year-old subject with Down's syndrome was significantly lower than the rate in the young subjects with this syndrome, but approximated the rate in middle-aged controls. Thus glucose utilization by the brain appears to be excessive in young adults with Down's syndrome but may decline with age in some brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W1548628830,"Two-dimensional crystalline arrays of Ca2+-ATPase molecules develop after treatment of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with Na3VO4 in calcium-free medium (Dux, L., and Martonosi, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2599-2603). The formation of Ca2+-ATPase crystals is inhibited by Ca2+ (2 microM), or ATP (5 mM), but not by ADP, 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate, or adenylylmethylenediphosphonate. ATPase crystals did not form at 37 degrees C and exposure of preformed crystals to 37 degrees C for 1 h caused the disappearance of crystal lattice. Inorganic orthophosphate (1 mM at pH 6.0) promoted the formation of a distinct crystal form of Ca2+-ATPase, which was different from that produced by Na3VO4. These observations indicate that Ca2+, ATP, inorganic phosphate, pH, and temperature influence the interactions between ATPase molecules in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1481186182,"Fibroblasts in culture were incubated with [35S]sulfate/[3H]glucosamine or [35S]sulfate/[3H]leucine. Proteoglycans were isolated from the medium and a 4 M guanidinium chloride extract of the cell layer or from a trypsin digest of the cells and an extract of the cell residue. Proteoglycans were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, gel permeation, and ion exchange chromatography after digesting contaminating proteogalactosaminoglycans with chondroitinase ABC. Gel chromatography suggests that the cell-derived protoheparan sulfate had an Mr = 350,000 whereas the trypsin-released and the medium-derived counterparts both had an Mr = 140,000. Reduction and alkylation of the cell-derived proteoglycan gave rise to a component with Mr = 140,000, whilst the medium-derived form was not affected. Degradation of cell-associated proteoheparan sulfate by trypsin followed by papain or alkali suggest that the core protein consists of three types of regions, heparan sulfate-containing regions of Mr = 140,000, oligosaccharide-containing regions, and nonglycosylated peptide regions containing most of the [3H]leucine. The heparan sulfates of the cell- and medium-derived proteoglycans were similar in size distribution and charge density and with regard to the proportions and arrangements of various building blocks."

Samples of cardiac SR were irradiated in the frozen state with increasing doses of high energy electrons from a Van de Graaff accelerator. The loss of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and of ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake (loading) with increasing irradiation dosage paralleled one another. Also, the loss of staining intensity of the predominant polypeptide (Mr = 110,000) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis correlated with the loss of ATPase and loading activities. The target size by all three measurements varied between 213,000 and 229,000 Da. We conclude that the Ca2+ pump protein in canine cardiac SR is a dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1598360490,"The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the Neurospora plasma membrane [H+]-ATPase has been measured over a wide range of Mg2+ and ATP concentrations, and on the basis of the results, a kinetic model for the enzyme has been developed. The model includes the following three binding sites: 1) a catalytic site at which MgATP serves as the true substrate, with free ATP as a weak competitive inhibitor; 2) a high affinity site for free Mg2+, which serves to activate the enzyme with an apparent K1/2 (termed KMgA) of about 15 microM; and 3) a separate low affinity site at which Mg2+ causes mixed type inhibition, lowering the Vmax while raising the KS for MgATP at the catalytic site. The Ki for Mg2+ at the low affinity site (termed KMgI) is about 3.5 mM. The model satisfactorily explains the activity of the enzyme as Mg2+ and ATP are varied, separately and together, over a wide range. It can also account for the previously reported effects of Mg2+ and ATP on the inhibition of the Neurospora [H+]-ATPase by N-ethylmaleimide (Brooker, R. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1982) J. Biol.

In the presence of λ cll protein, which activates PRE, three mutations in the −10 region dramatically reduce k2, the forward rate constant for the isomerization of closed to open complexes, but only slightly affect KB, the equilibrium constant for the initial recognition by RNA polymerase to form closed complexes. In contrast, five −35 region mutations caused decreases of 30 to 150 times in KB with much smaller effects on K2. In the absence of cll protein, the effects of mutations in the −10 region are qualitatively similar to those observed in the presence of cll protein, although the reductions in K2 are much less dramatic. In contrast, none of the mutants with defects in the −35 region is distinguishable from wildtype PRE in the absence of cll protein. Thus RNA polymerase may recognize different sequences in the −35 region in the absence of cll protein than in its presence."
https://openalex.org/W1562997156,"delta 5-3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is a key enzyme for testicular androgen biosynthesis and a marker for the Leydig cells. The hormonal regulation of this enzyme was studied in cultured rat testicular cells. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increased testosterone production in vitro while time course studies indicated a biphasic action of the gonadotropin on 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. An initial stimulation (51%) of the enzyme was detected between 3 and 12 h of culture when medium testosterone was low. This is followed by an inhibition of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity on days 2 and 3 of culture when medium testosterone was elevated. Concomitant treatment with a synthetic androgen (R1881) inhibited 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and testosterone production in hCG-treated cultures while an anti-androgen (cyproterone acetate) increased 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and testosterone biosynthesis. Addition of 10(-5) M spironolactone, an inhibitor of 17 alpha-hydroxylase, blocked the hCG stimulation of testosterone production but increased medium progesterone. In the absence of the secreted androgen, hCG stimulated 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in a time- and dose-related manner. Furthermore, hCG stimulation of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and progesterone accumulation in spironolactone-supplemented cultures was decreased by concomitant treatment with R1881 but was not affected by cyproterone acetate. The inhibitory effect of R1881 was blocked by the anti-androgen. In the absence of hCG, treatment with testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or R1881, but not promegestone, alone also inhibited 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity while the inhibitory effect of testosterone was blocked by cyproterone acetate. Thus, hCG stimulates 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in cultured testicular cells. The androgenic steroidogenic end products, in turn, inhibit this enzyme. The hormonal regulation of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity may be important in the ultrashort loop autoregulation of androgen biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1528087980,"We have shown previously (Brooker, R.J., and Slayman, C.W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12051-12055; Brooker, R. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 222-226) that the plasma membrane [H+]-ATPase of Neurospora crassa is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which reacts at an essential nucleotide-protectable site on the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide. The present study demonstrates that Mg2+ has a biphasic effect on NEM inhibition. At low concentrations (0.01-0.1 mM, Mg2+ decreases the sensitivity of the enzyme to NEM, while at high concentrations (greater than 1 mM), it enhances sensitivity. These effects are seen in the presence or absence of nucleotides (ATP, ADP). Mg2+ also acts in a concentration-dependent way to influence the degradation of the ATPase by trypsin. Low concentrations of Mg2+ have little or no effect on tryptic inactivation of ATPase activity or on the disappearance of the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide and the stepwise appearance of Mr = 100,000 and 91,000 tryptic fragments. High concentrations of Mg2+ decrease the rate of inactivation, and a new fragment of Mr = 98,000 is seen. Taken together, the NEM and trypsin results indicate that the Neurospora [H+]-ATPase possesses high and low affinity Mg2+ binding sites which affect the conformation of the enzyme. The divalent cation specificity of the sites has also been investigated. Co2+, Mn2+, and (to a lesser extent) Ni2+ mimic the behavior of Mg2+, but Ca2+ has a different effect, at least at the high affinity site. It appears to bind to that site, based on its ability to inhibit ATP hydrolysis (in the presence of Mg2+), but does not offer protection against NEM inhibition. The results suggest a way in which Ca2+ may serve as a physiological regulator of the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1576199919,"Na3VO4 promotes the crystallization of Ca2+-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The rate of vanadate-induced crystallization is dramatically increased by inside positive membrane potential generated through ion substitution. Negative potential caused the transient disruption of preformed Ca2+-ATPase crystals, followed by slower reappearance of the lattice after the potential was dissipated. We propose that positive transmembrane potential alters the conformation of the Ca2+-ATPase molecules in a manner that favors ATPase-ATPase interactions, while negative potential would have the opposite effect. Changes in enzyme conformation caused by potential changes during the contraction-relaxation cycle could regulate ATPase interactions in a similar manner in vivo, with effects upon the Ca2+ transport activity and permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2034752256,"The effect of the tumor promoter TPA on the control of DNA replication was assayed by following the regulated replication of DNA microinjected into eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. TPA increases the amount of replication of injected DNA. Both initiation of replication on parental DNA molecules and reinitiation on previously replicated molecules are stimulated. Interaction with the external membrane appears necessary since injections of high concentrations of TPA into the egg are ineffective, whereas nM concentrations are active in the external medium. Related molecules that lack tumor promoting activity do not affect DNA replication. The effect of TPA on DNA replication was detectable only after the first cell cycle, and TPA cannot induce replication in oocytes, the quiescent stage which precedes the egg. When protein synthesis is inhibited TPA still increases initiation of replication, but does not allow detectable reinitiation cycles. The results suggest that interaction of TPA with the cell membrane is sufficient to increase the efficiency of replication initiation by a mechanism that does not require illegitimate reinitiation within a single cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1554775047,"Among the more abundant non-histone proteins is the high mobility group (HMG), with an unknown role in chromatin. We have investigated, by chemical cross-linking, the interaction of the protein HMG 1 with the histone dimer H2A X H2B and the histone tetramer (H3 X H4)2 in free solution. Cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and the cleavable cross-linker dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate, by two-dimensional electrophoresis reveals the existence of an interaction between HMG 1 and the histone dimer, and also between HMG 1 and the histone tetramer. In the case of the H2A X H2B dimer, the analysis of the patterns of the cross-linking products shows the presence of a trimer, (H2A X H2B) X HMG 1, and of another oligomer of higher molecular weight which also contains H2A X H2B and HMG 1. Non-histone HMG 1 has been found to interact with (H3 X H4)2, both by cross-linking kinetics and also by gel permeation chromatography, displaying a stoichiometry of one HMG 1/histone tetramer. The results have been interpreted as indicating the existence of an interaction between HMG 1 and both oligomers through two different binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1580051920,"The bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase is reversibly inhibited by quinacrine. The concentration of quinacrine which causes 50% inhibition at pH 7.0 is estimated to be 580 microM. Lineweaver-Burk plots constructed from kinetic data collected at pH 7.0 with equimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP in the reaction mixtures indicate competitive inhibition by quinacrine. Uncompetitive inhibition by quinacrine is indicated by Lineweaver-Burk plots constructed from kinetic data obtained at pH 7.0 with variable ATP concentrations and a constant Mg2+ concentration of 3.0 mM. A KI of 440 microM was calculated from a replot of 1/Vmaxi versus quinacrine concentration using the intercepts of the Lineweaver-Burk plots constructed from the data obtained at a fixed concentration of 3.0 mM Mg2+. Quinacrine mustard is a potent inactivator of the F1-ATPase. The pseudo-first order rate constant, k1, for the inactivation of the enzyme by 500 microM quinacrine mustard is 0.161 min-1 at pH 7.0 and 23 degrees C. Under the same conditions in the presence of 5.0 mM ATP, 5.0 mM ADP, or 5.0 mM Mg2+ plus 5.0 mM ADP, k1 is, respectively: 0.082 min-1, 0.136 min-1, or 0.075 min-1. In the presence of 1.0 mM chlorpromazine or 5.0 mM quinacrine under the above conditions, k1, is 0.089 min-1 and 0.037 min-1, respectively. Free Mg2+ has no effect on the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by quinacrine mustard. The rate of inactivation of the F1-ATPase by quinacrine mustard as a function of pH revealed an apparent pK alpha of 8.0. Examination of the resolved subunits for fluorescence after inactivating the enzyme with quinacrine mustard demonstrated that only the beta subunit was labeled."
https://openalex.org/W1583577356,"In the presence of DNA, and under conditions which resulted in efficient DNA degradation, the reaction of the neocarzinostatin chromophore with sulfhydryl groups was accompanied by a rapid drop in the oxygen tension of the solution. The total extent of oxygen uptake indicated that, consistently, 1 mol of O2 was consumed/mol of chromophore. The rate of oxygen uptake, however, was strongly dependent on the sulfhydryl concentration, and uptake occurred within a few seconds of the sulfhydryl-induced increase in 420-nm fluorescence of the chromophore. Parallel experiments, in which the sulfhydryl concentration of the solution was monitored, showed that approximately 2 mol of sulfhydryl groups were consumed/mol of chromophore, with kinetics similar to those of O2 uptake. Under anaerobic conditions, only 1 mol of sulfhydryl was consumed, but the sulfhydryl-induced fluorescence increase was not inhibited. These results suggest that (i) a reaction with a single sulfhydryl group converts the chromophore to an activated form, (ii) in the presence of DNA this activated chromophore participates in a subsequent reaction which consumes 1 mol of O2 followed by an additional mole of sulfhydryl, and (iii) each chromophore molecule undergoes only one such reaction cycle. In the absence of sulfhydryl groups, the chromophore slowly degraded, giving a product with intense 490-nm fluorescence. This spontaneous degradation reaction, which does not result in DNA damage, was also accompanied by uptake of nearly 1 mol of O2/mol of chromophore."
https://openalex.org/W1487210188,"We compared the DNase I sensitivity of beta-globin genes in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated and untreated Friend erythroleukemia cells to determine whether the induced globin synthesis in these cells is associated with any change in the chromatin conformation of the globin genes. The beta-globin genes were preferentially sensitive to DNase I digestion in both uninduced and induced cells as compared to the alpha-fetoprotein gene and bulk DNA. Additionally, we detected specific cleavage sites in the region of the beta-major globin gene when nuclei from uninduced cells were digested with DNase I. Following induction, a 2- to 4-fold increase in DNase I digestion at one of these hypersensitive sites was observed while digestion at the other sites was greatly reduced. We have localized this primary hypersensitive site to the 5' end of the beta-major gene. To determine when during induction these observed changes in chromatin structure occur, nuclei were digested with DNase I after 6 to 120 h of induction with dimethyl sulfoxide. Some change in chromatin conformation was detectable by 12 h of induction and the configuration characteristic of the fully induced state was established by 24 h of induction. Since it has been reported that increases in beta-globin mRNA levels are not detected until 18-20 h of induction, it appears that alterations in the chromatin conformation of the globin genes may precede the changes in other biochemical parameters associated with differentiation and may be an early reflection of commitment to the erythroid pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1569006646,"A new procedure has been designed for the purification of nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase from the same baker's yeast extract. Using purified nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, the enzyme-catalyzed formation of nicotinate mononucleotide was analyzed using a new high pressure liquid chromatographic assay (Hanna, L., and Sloan, D. L. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 103, 230-234). Initial velocity measurements and product inhibition studies, with pyrophosphate, were performed. In addition, this assay procedure was used to demonstrate that purified nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase possesses an ATPase activity in the presence of either product (pyrophosphate or nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN] but in the absence of 5-phosphoribosyl alpha-1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP). Moreover, exchanges of radioactivity between specific substrate/product pairs [( 14C]nicotinate/NaMN and [32P]PPi/P-Rib-PP) in the absence of other substrates were not observed when these pairs were incubated with nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, and binding of [14C] nicotinate to nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase was not detected in the presence of ATP. In contrast, an exchange of label between ATP and [14C]ADP was characterized in the absence of other substrates and in the presence of either P-Rib-PP or PPi. These results indicate that nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase proceeds through the use of an ordered Uni Uni Bi Ter Ping Pong kinetic mechanism during which ATP reacts with nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase to form ADP and a previously described phosphorylated enzyme (Kosaka, A., Spivey, H. O., and Gholson, R. K. (1977) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 179, 334-341). Thereafter, P-Rib-PP and nicotinate bind in order to the active site, to produce PPi and NaMN which are released in a random order followed by Pi. The Km values for ATP, P-Rib-PP, and nicotinate were calculated to be 70 +/- 10, 24 +/- 3, and 23 +/- 4 microM, respectively, whereas a value for Ki(PRPP) of 5 +/- 1 microM was determined."
https://openalex.org/W1511469829,"Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) heavy chains were prepared from chicken muscle S1 by immunoadsorption in NH4Cl and from rabbit muscle S1 by ion exchange chromatography at 37 degrees C in MgATP. Both heavy chain preparations contained some intact S1, and the ATPase activities of both preparations were less than those of control S1. Recombinations of these heavy chains with alkali light chains prior to removing NH4Cl or MgATP lessened the decreases in ATPase activities. However, once NH4Cl or MgATP was removed, alkali light chain recombination did not result in any increase in ATPase activity. Thus, the lower activities appear to result from the instability of the S1 heavy chain in the absence of alkali light chain. When incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of radiolabeled alkali light chains for 1 h under approximately physiological conditions, almost all of the alkali light chains of S1 but only 8% of those of myosin or myofibrils were exchanged. Aggregation of myosin into filaments accounts for part of this difference in exchangeability. Removal of 30% of the 19,000-Da 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) light chains from myosin increased 3-fold the amount of alkali light chain exchanged. The exchange of the alkali light chains of S1 is inhibited by the presence of DTNB light chains, and cleavage of the DTNB light chains of heavy meromyosin to 17,000-Da fragments increased the rate of alkali light chain exchange. There was no detectable difference in the exchangeability of the two different alkali light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1607105426,"The influence that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP) has on the aggregation properties of rat liver phosphofructokinase has been studied by observing the fluorescence polarization of the enzyme covalently bound to the fluorescent probe pyrenebutyric acid. Fru-2,6-BP dramatically slows the dissociation of the high molecular weight aggregate forms of the enzyme when the enzyme is diluted to 3.2 micrograms/ml (4 X 10(-8) M subunits). Furthermore, Fru-2,6-BP is a strong promoter of reassociation to tetramer and larger forms if the enzyme has been previously allowed to dissociate to the dimer in its absence. Unlike many other positive effectors of liver phosphofructokinase, Fru-2,6-BP is also able to overcome the tendency of MgATP to promote tetramer formation and instead stabilize a very high degree of high molecular weight aggregate formation even in the presence of MgATP. The apparent affinity of liver phosphofructokinase for Fru-2,6-BP was measured by its ability to promote reassociation and compared to that for Fru-1,6-BP. The apparent dissociation constant for Fru-2,6-BP under these conditions is 36 microM, about 40-fold lower than the value of 1.4 mM measured for Fru-1,6-BP. Both ligands demonstrate synergism with the substrate Fru-6-P, which can lower the dissociation constant for Fru-2,6-BP 9-fold to 4 microM and that for Fru-1,6-BP 5-fold to 0.28 mM. These data are interpreted to suggest that influencing the aggregation state of rat liver phosphofructokinase may be one way in which Fru-2,6-BP achieves its effects on the enzyme in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1565994281,"Abstract In isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, calcium-chelating but non-calcium-precipitating dicarboxylates, such as maleate and succinate, stimulated ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation and its ensuring spontaneous Ca2+ accumulation and its ensuring spontaneous Ca2+ release, and Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity (Chu, A., Tate, C. A., Bick, R. J., Van Winkle, W. B., and Entman, M. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1656-1664). We further examined the effect of dicarboxylates on enzyme turnover. The anionic buffer maleate enhanced the rate of rapid acyl phosphoenzyme hydrolysis compared to that in the zwitterionic buffer piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) but had no effect on the phosphoenzyme formation. The presence of a calcium-precipitating anion, oxalate, or a Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, eliminated the differences observed in the phosphoenzyme decay between the two buffers, but accelerated the rate of decay. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the purified Ca2+-dependent ATPase was not affected by maleate, whether oxalate was present or not. [14C]Succinate was transported into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a manner which was dependent on Ca2+ transport, and occurred over a similar time course as Ca2+ accumulation/release. The net succinate uptake was equivalent to the amount of succinate-stimulated Ca2+ accumulation. Rapid efflux of both [14C]succinate and 45Ca2+ was induced by A23187, whereas the efflux induced by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid was slower and less compared to A23187. Succinate accumulation exhibited saturation kinetics with positive cooperativity (Km congruent to 20 mM; Hill coefficient = 1.70). When maleate and succinate were both present, they were equipotent, and had an additive stimulatory effect on peak 45Ca2+ accumulation at low concentrations. Maleate was a competitive inhibitor of succinate accumulation (Ki approximately equal to 17 mM; Hill coefficient = 1.75). KCl in the presence or absence of valinomycin did not influence succinate accumulation or release. The data suggest that succinate accumulation is Ca2+-dependent, but occurs at a saturable, divalent, anion-specific site. While this carrier or channel requires Ca2+ transport, it may be controlled by additional factors as well."

The transport activity was found to be sensitive to the phospholipid composition of the reconstituted vesicles. Proteoliposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine showed increased transport activity. In addition, incubation of reconstituted vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine with phospholipase D plus ethanolamine resulted in vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine plus phosphatidylethanolamine and increased transport activity. These results indicate that the glucose transport system of LM cells is sensitive to polar head group structure of the phospholipids."

It was shown previously that elevation of dUTP accompanies the gross expansion in intracellular deoxyuridylate pools that results from the methotrexate-induced block in thymidylate synthetase activity (1). dUDP-GlcNAc presumably is formed from dUTP acting in place of UTP in the normal pathway for formation of UDP-GlcNAc. Neither dUTP nor dUDP-GlcNAc has been detected in untreated cells. Inhibition of thymidylate synthetase by treatment of cells with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdUrd) also causes the appearance of dUDP-GlcNAc, and, in addition, 5-FdUDP-GlcNAc, synthesized from 5-FdUTP. The metabolic effects, if any, of these analogues are not known. Synthesis of the analogues may help to limit accumulation of dUTP and 5-FdUTP under circumstances in which the deoxyuridine triphosphatase mechanism is insufficient."

Enzymatic transfer of the analogue to the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues permits the selective recovery of the newly thio-derivatized polypeptide chains by Hg-affinity chromatography, and this acetylated subpopulation can then be analyzed for [32P]phosphate uptake. The histones and high mobility group proteins were extracted from cell nuclei, purified, and finally analyzed for incorporation of [32P]phosphate and 2-mercaptoacetate. Several of the nuclear proteins, in particular histone H2A and the high mobility group proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17, were subjected to organomercurial-agarose chromatography. Significant amounts of these cysteine-free proteins were retained on the affinity column, and by this criterion were shown to have incorporated mercaptoacetate. The mercaptoacetylated proteins were further analyzed and found to contain the 32P label as well. These observations provide incontrovertible evidence that individual molecules of chromosomal proteins can carry postsynthetic modifications in the form of phosphorylation and acetylation at the same time, and also establish that both types of modification must have occurred during the short period in which the cells were exposed to the two precursors."

The number of water molecules coordinated to the metal in Eu3+-ATP was estimated to be 2.6; when this complex is bound to hexokinase, 1 water molecule is displaced. Upon binding to chloroplast reversible ATPase, the metal coordinates 1 water molecule while the Eu3+-ATP complex does not retain any associated solvent. These numbers are in contrast to the 9 solvent molecules coordinated to the naked metal ion. These results are discussed in reference to mechanistic and structural considerations of the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1596078023,"DNase I, trypsin, and micrococcal nuclease are used to further probe the structure of nascent deoxyribonucleoprotein (DNP) fractions which appear after in vivo 20-s pulse labeling of sea urchin embryos with [3H]thymidine. We present evidence that the large nascent DNP which protects the approximately 300-base pair large nascent DNA consists of at least one nucleosome core. This is based on fractionation in denaturing polyacrylamide gels of DNA extracted from large nascent DNP fractions of a micrococcal nuclease + DNase I digest of nuclei. The data also suggest the existence of a DNase I-hypersensitive site(s) within the large nascent DNP; this is consistent with the hypothesis that the latter consists of closely packed dinucleosome cores. Histone H1 and non-histone proteins do not account for the previously reported unusual hyperresistance of the large nascent DNA against micrococcal nuclease. The protection offered this approximately 300-base pair nascent DNA was not eliminated by an 0.2-microgram/ml trypsin pretreatment which removes the above proteins from the chromatin. However, 5-10 micrograms/ml of trypsin, which remove a portion of the NH2 termini of the four core histones of nucleosomes, eliminate the hyperresistance of the large nascent DNA to subsequent micrococcal nuclease digestion, while nascent and bulk monomer DNAs remain unaffected. This indicates histone-histone and/or histone-DNA interactions within the large nascent DNP which differ from those of nascent and bulk mononucleosome cores."
