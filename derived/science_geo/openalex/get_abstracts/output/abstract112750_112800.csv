https://openalex.org/W2070159820,"CNTF is a cytosolic molecule expressed postnatally in myelinating Schwann cells and in a subpopulation of astrocytes. Although CNTF administration prevents lesion-mediated and genetically determined motor neuron degeneration, its physiological function remained elusive. Here it is reported that abolition of CNTF gene expression by homologous recombination results in a progressive atrophy and loss of motor neurons in adult mice, which is functionally reflected by a small but significant reduction in muscle strength."

https://openalex.org/W1643675192,"We report here the presence of a receptor specific for endothelin-3 (termed ETc receptor or ETcR) on Xenopus laevis dermal melanophores. Activation of ETcR causes the dispersion of the pigment granules within the melanophores. The EC50 for ET-3 to induce the pigment dispersion is 24 +/- 7 nM, compared to greater than 10 microM for both ET-1 and -2. This effect desensitizes in a manner that is dependent on both time and the concentration of ET-3 used to stimulate the cells. A cDNA encoding for ETcR was isolated by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification strategy using degenerate oligonucleotides prepared based on conserved regions of other known G-protein-coupled receptor sequences and by the subsequent screening of a frog melanophore cDNA library. The cloned cDNA consists of 2,240 nucleotides, with an open reading frame coding for 444 amino acids containing an initial 20-amino acid signal sequence. The predicted mature peptide consists of 424 amino acids with a heptahelical structure common to the G-protein-coupled receptor surperfamily. Its deduced amino acid sequence is 47 and 52% identical to ETA and ETB receptors, respectively, while ETA and ETB are 48% identical to each other. Expression of cDNA in HeLa cells, which do not contain endothelin receptors, enables the cells to specifically bind [125I]ET-3. Competition binding experiments performed on HeLa cells transiently expressing pETc show that the apparent Ki values for ET-3 and ET-1 to displace [125I]ET-3 are 45.5 +/- 16 and 114 +/- 22 nM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1558096813,"A novel peptidyl inhibitor of K+ channels has been purified to homogeneity from venom of the new world scorpion Centruroides margaritatus. The primary structure of this 39-amino-acid peptide, which we term margatoxin (MgTX), was determined by amino acid compositional analysis and peptide sequencing. Margatoxin potently inhibits binding of radiolabeled charybdotoxin (ChTX) to voltage-activated channels in brain synaptic plasma membranes. Like ChTX, MgTX blocks the n-type current of human T-lymphocytes (Kv1.3 channel), but compared to ChTX, is 20-fold more potent (half-block at approximately 50 pM), has a slower dissociation rate, and has no effect on calcium-activated channels. To demonstrate that these characteristics are due solely to the purified toxin, recombinant MgTX was expressed in Escherichia coli as part of a fusion protein. After cleavage and folding, purified recombinant MgTX displayed the same properties as native peptide. Replacement of the COOH-terminal histidine residue of MgTX with asparagine resulted in a peptide with a 10-fold reduction in potency. This was due to a faster apparent dissociation rate, suggesting that the COOH-terminal amino acid may play an important role in the binding of MgTX to the Kv1.3 channel. MgTX displays significant sequence homology with previously identified K+ channel inhibitors (e.g. ChTX, iberiotoxin, noxiustoxin, and kaliotoxin). However, given its potency and unique selectivity, MgTX represents an especially useful tool with which to study the physiologic role of Kv1.3 channels."

https://openalex.org/W1597749237,"This study describes the effect of starch-synthesizing enzymes on biosynthesis of storage starch in rice amylose-extender mutants, which contain branched D-glucans with abnormal structures. Western blot analysis indicated that two out of five amylose-extender mutant lines lacked an isoform of starch branching enzyme, termed RBE3, although the levels of granule-bound starch synthase and a major form of branching enzyme, RBE1, were normal in these two mutants. Proteins corresponding to the 87-kDa RBE3 molecule were present in the three other amylose-extender mutants as well as in the wild type. However, the level of branching enzyme activity significantly decreased in all amylose-extender mutants, suggesting that the 87-kDa proteins in these three mutants are inactive forms of RBE3. Therefore, we conclude that formation of the abnormal branched glucans in the amylose-extender mutant of rice is due to the lack of the RBE3 activity. The cDNA clones encoding RBE3 have been identified from a normal rice seed cDNA library in lambda gt11, using a synthetic oligonucleotide as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence of RBE3 indicates that this protein is initially synthesized as a precursor of 825 amino acids, including a 65-residue transit peptide at the NH2 terminus. The sequences of the catalytic regions in amylolytic enzymes are highly conserved in the sequence of RBE3. Thus, the branching enzyme isoform belongs to a family of the amylolytic enzymes. RBE3 also shares a noticeable degree of sequence identity with RBE1, especially at the central portion of the protein molecule. However, RBE3 possesses an approximately 70-residue extra sequence at the NH2 terminus and lacks a COOH-terminal sequence of almost 50 residues as compared with RBE1. The structural differences at both termini may explain the distinct role in starch synthesis for RBE1 and RBE3."
https://openalex.org/W1674624604,"Infection of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells with recombinant human androgen receptor (AR) baculovirus results in expression of a 118-kDa phosphoprotein that displays high affinity androgen binding and androgen-dependent targeting to the nucleus. Using the DNA mobility shift assay, specific in vitro binding of full-length AR to androgen response element DNA (ARE) requires intracellular hormone exposure. The ability of a variety of steroids to induce ARE binding paralleled their transcriptional potential. Certain antihormones, cyproterone acetate and RU486, promote ARE binding, but a pure antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, inhibits AR binding to ARE DNA. AR dimerization requires incubation of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells with androgen, but only when one or both components of the dimer contain the NH2-terminal domain. Based on the intensities of ARE binding and lack of binding to an ARE half-site, it appears that, unlike the glucocorticoid receptor, AR binds DNA primarily as a dimer. Thus, full-length baculovirus-expressed AR requires intracellular hormone exposure for dimerization and ARE binding to overcome inhibition imposed by the AR NH2-terminal domain. Antihormones with agonist activity promote dimerization and ARE binding, while a pure antiandrogen blocks AR DNA binding. It is concluded that intramolecular interactions between the NH2-terminal and steroid-binding domains are regulated by the specificity of hormone binding and modulate receptor dimerization and DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1528630840,"Exposure of mouse peritoneal macrophages to oxidative and sulfhydryl-reactive agents in vitro enhances synthesis of a few cellular proteins that may be important in a self-defense system. A cDNA encoding a novel stress-inducible protein, designated MSP23 (macrophage 23-kDa stress protein), was cloned from a cDNA library of the macrophages by differential screening. A 1.0-kilobase mRNA transcript hybridized with the MSP23 cDNA gradually increased in macrophages upon culture in vitro. Treatment with diethylmaleate or glucose/glucose oxidase, which generates H2O2, markedly enhanced the induction of the transcript after several hours. Cadmium chloride and sodium arsenite also induced the transcript. An antiserum raised against recombinant MSP23 reacted with the 23-kDa stress-inducible protein of the macrophages. The amounts of 23-kDa protein in the cells rapidly increased during culture with diethylmaleate. The mRNA was detected in various tissues, and it was especially high in content in the liver. A search of databases revealed that six proteins of various species from bacteria to the mouse have a sequence homology to MSP23. One of the proteins is the C22 component of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, which is induced by hydrogen peroxide in Salmonella typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1912590178,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase, which removes the acetyl moiety at the sn-2 position, has been found in plasma and tissue cytosol. PAF acetylhydrolase in bovine brain cytosol was chromatographically separated into three distinct fractions, all of which exhibited pH optima in the neutral to mild alkaline region and were unaffected by EDTA. We have purified the major fraction of the enzyme to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of about 100 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration chromatography, and gave three distinct bands of 45, 30, and 29 kDa, respectively, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These polypeptides exclusively co-migrated with the activity throughout the purification steps. These data suggest that this set of polypeptides corresponds to the subunits of bovine brain PAF acetylhydrolase. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate completely inhibited the activity at 0.1 mM. [3H]Diisopropyl fluorophosphate labeled only the 29-kDa polypeptide, suggesting that this polypeptide possesses an active serine residue(s). The purified enzyme displayed similar activity against PAF and oxidatively modified phosphatidylcholine, but did not hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine with two long chain acyl groups. Thus, the intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase is likely to be a new member of the calcium-independent phospholipases A2 in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1575151336,"Within the integrin family, there are two groups of receptors that bind laminin. One of these groups comprises the heterodimers alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1, and alpha 7 beta 1, all of which bind the E8 fragment of laminin, and whose alpha subunits show significant homology at the amino acid sequence level. alpha 3 and alpha 6 exist as isoforms with distinct cytoplasmic domains (termed A and B), suggesting that they may couple laminin adhesion to distinct cellular responses. We report the identification of a new alpha 7 mRNA which encodes an alpha 7 protein isoform with an alternative cytoplasmic domain. Based on homology with alpha 3 and alpha 6 isoforms, this new isoform is classified as alpha 7A and the previously published one as alpha 7B. This result extends the similarity between alpha 3, alpha 6, and alpha 7 laminin receptor subunits and suggests a common ancestral gene. The alpha 7 beta 1 laminin receptor was proposed to be involved in myogenic differentiation. However, alpha 7 isoforms were not investigated in that context. We detected the alpha 7B isoform mRNA in all tissues and cell types tested, including myocardial and skeletal muscle. In contrast, the alpha 7A isoform was detectable exclusively in skeletal muscle, not in myocardial muscle or cells or any other tissues or cell lines tested. Furthermore, the differentiating skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 expressed only alpha 7B at the replicating myoblast stage and acquired alpha 7A expression upon induction of differentiation and fusion. Splicing of alpha 7B mRNA in C2C12 occurred shortly after myogenin expression and could be an indicator of progression through the program of skeletal muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1581444291,"Hippocalcin, a recently identified Ca(2+)-binding protein of the recoverin family exclusively expressed in the hippocampus, has a primary structure containing three putative Ca(2+)-binding sites (EF-hands) and a possible NH2-terminal myristoylation site. 45Ca blots demonstrated that every three EF-hand domains, expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, bind Ca2+, indicating that hippocalcin binds 3 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein. To determine whether hippocalcin is myristoylated, hippocalcin mRNA was translated in vitro in the presence of [3H]myristic acid. 3H label was resistant to hydroxylamine treatment, and replacement of NH2-terminal glycine with alanine prevented 3H label incorporation, indicating that in vitro translated hippocalcin covalently bound [3H]myristic acid at the NH2-terminal glycine. In vitro translated hippocalcin is quantitatively myristoylated, as evidenced by an electrophoretic mobility shift of [35S]methionine-labeled protein on two-dimensional gels. Native hippocalcin comigrated precisely with the in vitro translated hippocalcin on two-dimensional gels, suggesting that native hippocalcin is myristoylated. Native and in vitro translated hippocalcins, but not non-myristoylated mutagenic (Gly1-Ala1) hippocalcin, displayed Ca(2+)-dependent membrane association, indicating that myristoylation participates in its Ca(2+)-dependent membrane association properties. In vitro translated hippocalcin bound to phospholipid vesicles somewhat, however, phospholipid association was insufficient for its membrane association properties, suggesting that the NH2-terminal myristoyl moiety on hippocalcin interacts with lipid bilayers and facilitates interaction with other membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1604855628,"The highly glycosylated domains of rat small intestinal mucins were isolated after reduction and trypsin digestion and separated into two populations (A and B) by gel chromatography. The molecular mass values were 650 and 335 kDa, respectively, and the relative yields suggest that the two glycopeptides occur in equimolar proportions. Electron microscopy revealed linear structures with weight average lengths of 230 nm (A) and 110 nm (B) corresponding to a mass/unit length of about 3 kDa/nm. The protein cores (17-19%) contain large amounts of threonine (over 40%), serine (17-24%), and proline (18-19%). Carbohydrate and sulfate account for approximately 80 and 0.5%, respectively, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the patterns of neutral and sialic acid-containing glycans are very similar in the two glycopeptides. Both contain a significant amount (7-10 mol %) of single GalNAc residues, the average oligosaccharide is about 4 sugar residues long, and the largest species observed are heptasaccharides. The major neutral and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides are Fuc1-2Gal1-3GalNAcol and GlcNAc1-6(NeuGc2-Gal1-3)GalNAcol, respectively. Sialic acid is present as both N-acetyl- and N-glycoloyl-neuraminic acid. Repeated extractions of the tissue with guanidinium chloride left approximately 80% of the mucus glycoproteins as an insoluble glycoprotein complex whereas exposure to dithiothreitol or high speed homogenization accomplished complete solubilization. The obtained after reduction with dithiothreitol are larger than glycopeptides A and B, and fragments corresponding in size to the latter are obtained after cleavage with trypsin. Most of the mucins from rat small intestine thus occurs as an insoluble glycoprotein complex composed of subunits joined with disulfide bonds. The subunits contain two highly glycosylated regions with different lengths substituted with very similar oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1485740410,"Abstract Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) mark the recycling system for the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GluT4, in rat adipocytes. Anti-GluT4 and anti-SCAMP antibodies each immunoadsorbed vesicles containing both antigens from a low density microsomal fraction that is enriched in both antigens. The immunoadsorbed vesicles also contain VAMPs (synaptobrevins), synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. All three antigens were colocalized in low density microsomal vesicles from both basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. The SCAMPs have the same electrophoretic mobility as a major polypeptides detected in GluT4 vesicles. During insulin stimulation, 40% each of GluT4 and VAMPs redistribute from low density microsomes to the plasma membrane fraction; however, < 10% of the SCAMPs redistribute. Immunocytochemical staining of adipose tissue shows almost complete coincidence of SCAMPs and GluT4 in the basal state and extensive redistribution of both antigens to the cell periphery during insulin stimulation. Segregation of antigens during stimulation is not as distinct as observed by fractionation, although there are regions at the cell border where the SCAMPs appear more concentrated than GluT4. These data suggest that during insulin stimulation, in contrast to the behaviour of GluT4, SCAMPs remain tightly associated with the recycling system."
https://openalex.org/W1596892984,"Human blood plasma and freshly isolated LDL were exposed to singlet oxygen (1O2) by thermal decomposition of synthetic endoperoxides. Exposure of blood plasma to 20 mM water-soluble 1O2 generator resulted in the depletion of ascorbate (100%), urate (75%), ubiquinol-10 (65%), protein thiols (50%), and bilirubin (25%), whereas under these conditions the levels of alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and lycopene remained unchanged. The following rates of depletion were obtained by kinetic analysis (moles depleted per 100 mol of 1O2 consumed): protein thiols (5), urate (5), ascorbate (4), bilirubin (1), and ubiquinol-10 (0.008). In contrast, the rates of depletion using the lipid-soluble 1O2 generator were faster for bilirubin (13-fold), protein thiols (9-fold), ubiquinol-10 (8-fold), and ascorbate (5-fold), and slower for urate (2-fold). The formation of lipid hydroperoxides, including mostly cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide, was observed in 1O2-treated plasma (0.007-0.009 mol/100 mol 1O2) and LDL solutions (0.086 mol/100 mol 1O2). Based on competition kinetics, we estimate that 98% of 1O2 generated in the aqueous phase of plasma is quenched by components in this phase, mostly by plasma protein (63%; 6% by protein thiols), urate (9%; 5% by chemical quenching), and bilirubin (5%; 1% by chemical quenching). Ascorbate and ubiquinol-10 do not contribute to 1O2 quenching in plasma, and their oxidation is probably mediated secondary species. The remaining 1O2 generated in plasma (2%) diffuses into lipoprotein leading to the formation of lipid hydroperoxides with an efficiency of about 100-fold greater than that compared to aqueous generated 1O2. The principal 1O2 quenchers in LDL include apoB (42%), lycopene and beta-carotene (40%), and alpha-tocopherol (17%). The importance of carotenoids in the quenching of 1O2 in lipoprotein suggest that the beneficial effects of these compounds in health may in part be due to the elimination of this species in biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1537591711,"The human locus control region (LCR) consists of four DNase I hypersensitive sites upstream of the epsilon-globin gene and is intimately involved in globin gene transcription. We have used DNase I footprinting with K562 erythroleukemia cell extracts to identify protein components of the minimal LCR element, hypersensitive site 2. Six major regions of protection were observed, and the occupation of two regions (sites II and V) was strongly temperature-dependent. Fractionation of K562 nuclear proteins revealed a single major protein that bound tightly to site II. An E-box was necessary for high affinity binding to DNA. We used antibodies and recombinant USF protein to prove that the helix-loop-helix transcription factor USF is the only detectable component in K562 cells that binds to this site. Despite significant differences between site II and a canonical USF-binding site, the USF binding affinity was comparable for the two sites. In both cases the interaction with the E-box of either wild-type USF or a approximately 15-kDa minimal USF DNA binding polypeptide displays an unusual positive temperature dependence, consistent with the observed footprinting behavior. The results show that a relatively ubiquitous factor, not confined to erythroid cells, is an important part of the complex of proteins bound at hypersensitive site 2 of the LCR in K562 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569297824,"This study describes the binding of plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin. Plasminogen bound specifically and saturably to both fibronectin and laminin immobilized on microtiter wells, with Kd(app) values of 115 and 18 nM, respectively. Limited proteolysis by endoproteinase V8 coupled with ligand blotting analysis showed that both plasminogen and t-PA preferentially bind to a 55-kDa fibronectin fragment and a 38-kDa laminin fragment. Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that the 5-kDa fragment originates with the fibronectin amino terminus whereas the laminin fragment was derived from the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of the laminin A chain. Ligand blotting experiments using isolated plasminogen domains were also used to identify distinct regions of the plasminogen molecule involved in fibronectin and laminin binding. Solution phase fibronectin binding to immobilized plasminogen was mediated primarily via lysine binding site-dependent interactions with plasminogen kringles 1-4. Lysine binding site-dependent binding of soluble laminin to immobilized plasminogen kringles 1-5 as well as an additional lysine binding site-independent interaction between mini-plasminogen and the 38-kDa laminin A chain fragment were also observed. These studies demonstrate binding of plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator to specific regions of the extracellular matrix glycoproteins laminin and fibronectin and provide further insight into the mechanism of regulation of plasminogen activation by components of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1598871970,"In MALME-3M human melanoma cells the polyamine analog N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BESPM) suppresses the key polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and increases the polyamine catabolizing enzyme, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyl-transferase (SSAT) by more than 200-fold. In the present study increases in SSAT activity in MALME-3M cells treated with 10 microM BESPM were found to be accompanied by a substantial (up to 45-fold) accumulation of SSAT mRNA. By Northern blot analysis three RNA transcripts were found to hybridize with the coding region of human SSAT cDNA: a minor high molecular weight (approximately 3.5 kilobases) species designated form A and two lower molecular weight species designated forms B and C (approximately 1.5 and approximately 1.3 kilobases, respectively). Form A increased uniformly during BESPM treatment and was most obvious in nuclear RNA preparations. On the basis of size similarity to the transcribing region of the gene and hybridization with the coding region of SSAT cDNA and its prevalence in nuclear mRNA preparations, form A is thought to represent precursor SSAT RNA. Form C is present in control cells and increases steadily during treatment, whereas form B increases transiently during early treatment (1-3 h). By RNase H digestion assay, form B was found to have a 200-base pair longer poly(A) tract and as such may represent a precursor to form C. Accumulation of SSAT mRNA was found to be a result of increased gene transcription and stabilization of SSAT mRNA. Nuclear run-on studies indicated a 2-4-fold increase in the transcription rate of the SSAT gene. As indicated by actinomycin D studies, the SSAT mRNA half-life increased with BESPM treatment from 17 to 64 h. The natural polyamine, spermine, also increased SSAT mRNA (5.5-fold at 24 h) and behaved similarly to BESPM in inducing the appearance of the same three transcript forms. The polyamine was much less effective than the analog at increasing enzyme activity. Lowering intracellular polyamine pools with inhibitors of biosynthesis decreased basal SSAT mRNA levels by at least 70% indicating, that the gene can be down-regulated as well as up-regulated by polyamines. These findings indicate that SSAT represents a unique example of gene expression being positively influenced at the RNA level by polyamines and their analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1541838625,"Cys-47, the most reactive cysteine in the homodimeric glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) from human placenta (class Pi), displays peculiar acid base and spectroscopic properties. The thiolate form of this residue is characterized by a sharp UV absorption spectrum centered at 229 nm with an epsilon = 7,500 M-1 cm-1. The dependence of the apparent extinction coefficient on pH indicates that the sulfhydryl group of Cys-47 has a pKa value of 4.2. Moreover the dependence of the reactivity of Cys-47 toward bromopyruvate and iodoacetamide with pH resembles that found for the functional sulfhydryls of thiol proteases, which have very low pKa values and exist mainly as a mercaptide-imidazole ion pair. The apparent pKa value for Cys-47, calculated by this kinetic approach, is in good agreement with that determined spectroscopically. X-ray crystallographic data indicate that the protonated amino group of Lys-54, 4.9 A from the sulfur atom, is probably involved in the deprotonation of Cys-47. Calculation of the electrostatic potential on the sulfur atom of Cys-47 gives a theoretical pKa value of 3.5 for the sulfhydryl group. The simulated neutralization of Lys-54 shifts the pKa value of Cys-47 to a normal value of 9.5. These findings suggest that at physiological pH values, Cys-47 exists as the thiolate ion stabilized by an ion pair formation with the protonated amino group of Lys-54, and this probably accounts for its high reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1548948558,"In potato, cytochrome c reductase, a protein complex of the respiratory chain, exhibits processing activity toward mitochondrial precursor proteins. One of the two cooperating components of the processing peptidase was shown to be identical with subunit III of the complex. Here we report that two additional proteins of the complex (subunit I and II) share 40-50% sequence identity with the processing enhancing protein, the other component of the processing enzyme from fungi and mammals. Thus the composition and structure of the complex integrated processing peptidase seems to be different from its fungal and mammalian counterparts. Cytochrome c reductase from potato is extraordinarily stable, and separation of subunit III from the complex leads to aggregation of the remaining subcomplex and irreversible loss of processing activity. Expression of the three high molecular weight subunits of the complex allowed purification of each individual protein. Neither the individual subunits nor their combinations are active in in vitro processing assays suggesting that they may need the structural support of the complex for activity. In contrast to mitochondrial processing peptidases from other organisms, the purified potato enzyme is active in the presence of high salt (above 1 M NaCl) and works efficiently without addition of metal ions. These data indicate that potato cytochrome c reductase is a bifunctional protein complex with unique features. Possibly, there is a more general evolutionary relationship between cytochrome c reductases and mitochondrial processing peptidases than hitherto assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1551504213,"Cytochromes P450 are inserted into and anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by a hydrophobic signal sequence at the NH2 terminus. To determine whether the NH2-terminal sequence might also have an ER retention function, the NH2-terminal 29 amino acids of cytochrome P450 2C1, with and without an additional 29 amino acids containing an N-glycosylation site, were fused either to a soluble cytoplasmic protein, Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, or to a secreted protein, E. coli alkaline phosphatase, and the hybrid proteins were expressed in COS1 cells. Subcellular fractionation indicated that both the beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase hybrid proteins cosedimented with marker enzymes for ER membranes, and localization by immunofluorescent staining was consistent with an ER location. Hybrid proteins with the NH2-terminal glycosylation site were glycosylated in COS1 cells, and the carbohydrate moiety was sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, providing further evidence that the proteins were retained in the ER. In vitro studies of membrane insertion of the alkaline phosphatase hybrid indicated that fusion to alkaline phosphatase hybrid indicated that fusion to alkaline phosphatase did not alter the topological properties of the cytochrome P450 NH2-terminal sequence. In addition, alkaline phosphatase fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of epidermal growth factor receptor was transported to the plasma membrane in COS1 cells, which establishes that alkaline phosphatase as a cytoplasmic domain does not prevent transport from the ER. These observations indicate that the large cytoplasmic domain of cytochrome P450 is not required for retention in the ER and suggest that a specific sequence or structure within the NH2-terminal 29 amino acids functions as an ER retention signal."
https://openalex.org/W1553565695,"Protein R2, the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase of Escherichia coli, contains an essential free radical localized to tyrosine 122 of its polypeptide chain. When this radical is scavenged by hydroxyurea, the enzyme is transformed into an inactive form, metR2. E. coli contains a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase, named Fre, absolutely required for the regeneration of the radical and the activation of metR2 into R2. Consequently, an E. coli mutant strain lacking an active fre gene is more sensitive to hydroxyurea during growth, demonstrating the physiological protective function of Fre from the loss of the radical. However, this gene is not essential, and we found that E. coli contains a second tyrosyl radical generating activity, also residing in a flavin reductase. The enzyme has been purified 200-fold to homogeneity and found to be identical to sulfite reductase. Pure sulfite reductase has the ability to catalyze the reduction of free riboflavin, FMN, or FAD by NADPH and thus, as Fre, to transfer electrons to the iron center of metR2, a key step during the activation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1567180128,"12(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by the microsomal fraction of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells, and the microsomal 12-lipoxygenase activity is enhanced by about 2-fold by epidermal growth factor (EGF) with a 10-h lag period (Chang, W.C., Ning, C.C., Lin, M.T., and Huang, J.D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3657-3666). The microsomal 12-lipoxygenase in A431 cells was only 3% active with linoleic acid as compared with arachidonic acid. The enzyme was immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody against human platelet 12-lipoxygenase but not by that against porcine leukocyte enzyme. A 3.1-kilobase mRNA was detected in A431 cells by Northern blot analyses using cDNA probe of human platelet 12-lipoxygenase. EGF could increase the 12-lipoxygenase mRNA level by about 2-fold with a lag period of 10 h, which was well parallel with the increase in the enzyme activity. The induction of the 12-lipoxygenase mRNA by EGF was completely blocked by 35 microM cycloheximide, if present in culture medium during EGF treatment, indicating that a de novo protein biosynthesis was essential for EGF-induced 12-lipoxygenase mRNA expression. Our data provide the first evidence for the inducibility of human 12-lipoxygenase gene expression by a growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1604517817,"Normal eukaryotic cells divide only a limited number of times before proliferation ceases due to cellular senescence. We previously reported that a constitutively expressed, non-cell cycle-regulated transcript of unknown identity declines severalfold when human fibroblasts become senescent. We show here, from the sequence of cDNA and genomic clones, that this transcript encodes L7, a structural protein of the large ribosomal subunit. The human L7 protein shares > 90% amino acid identity with the mouse and rat L7 proteins but is shorter than either rodent protein due to fewer basic repetitive motifs at the amino terminus. The position of the first intron is conserved between the mouse and human genes. The L7 mRNA was abundant, stable (t1/2 > 10 h), and polyadenylated in presenescent and senescent human fibroblasts; however, steady state mRNA levels were 5-10-fold lower in senescent cells, whether derived from fetal lung or neonatal foreskin. Quiescent and senescent cells synthesized protein at similar rates, yet only senescent cultures showed a decline in L7 mRNA. The mRNAs encoding five other ribosomal proteins (L5, P1, S3, S6, and S10) behaved similarly. The results suggest that the senescence-associated decline in L7 and other ribosomal protein mRNAs is unrelated to growth state or protein synthetic rate per se and support the view that senescence and quiescence are dissimilar states."
https://openalex.org/W1565293177,"The bovine growth hormone (bGH) receptor and its extracellular domain (bGHBP) bind two protein hormones with high affinity; bGH and bovine placental lactogen (bPL). However, each of these hormones bind with a different stoichiometry. bGH binds to the bGHBP in a 1:2 ratio while bPL binds in a 1:1 ratio. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding yields similar apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for bGH and bPL of 1.4 x 10(-11) M and 3.0 x 10(-11) M, respectively, for the membrane receptor and 6.8 x 10(-11) M and 4.2 x 10(-11) M, respectively, for bGHBP. In competition experiments using either liver membranes or bGHBP, bGH is 2-3-fold more effective than bPL in competing for 125I-bGH-binding sites. In similar experiments using 125I-bPL, bPL is 50-fold more effective than bGH in competing for binding sites. A rat monoclonal antibody raised against bGHBP competes effectively for 125I-bGH-binding sites, but not for 125I-bPL-binding sites. Since bPL cannot dimerize the bGHBP and yet it acts in part as a somatogen in vivo, homodimerization of the growth hormone receptor is apparently not essential for some biological responses signaled through this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1585663282,"An alveolar cell membrane protein acts as a surfactant protein A (SP-A) receptor; it binds SP-A and regulates surfactant secretion. We identified such alveolar cell membrane SP-A-binding proteins using anti-idiotype antibodies directed against the surfactant protein binding region of anti-surfactant antibodies. These monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies, A2C and A2R, also recognize an alveolar cell membrane protein of approximately 30 kDa. A pulmonary protein of approximately 30 kDa binds SP-A. Unique cDNAs encoding this protein were identified in human (4.1-kilobase) and porcine (1.8-kilobase) lung expression libraries. Coding regions of these cDNAs cross-hybridize with each other under stringent conditions. Both cDNAs encode similar approximately 32-kDa proteins that bind SP-A. The human and porcine SP-A recognition (SPAR) proteins resemble each other, as well as other cell membrane receptors. Their projected structures are consistent with cell membrane receptors. Recombinant human and porcine SPAR proteins bind SP-A as well as the two anti-idiotype antibodies just as do native lung proteins of approximately 30 kDa. SPAR transcripts are expressed primarily in lung. The cellular distribution of these transcripts, as determined by in situ hybridization, is similar to that of SPAR protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry; both are found in cells consistent with type II pneumocytes. SPAR-producing cells resemble the alveolar cells expressing SP-B and SP-C transcripts in appearance, location, and distribution. Therefore, cDNAs for pulmonary SP-A-binding proteins from two disparate species have been isolated and sequenced, and the recombinant proteins they encode bind the same ligand. Further structural, functional, and genetic studies of these proteins may help explain how pulmonary surfactant secretion is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1599446163,"The responses elicited by ATP and UTP in macrophages (measured by microfluorescence and in patch-clamp) present marked differences. The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores induced by ATP is due to the activation of P2U receptors. These receptors can be activated by ATP4- and by MgATP2-, with apparent K0.5 values of 0.65 and 6.5 microM, respectively. The release of Ca2+ due to activation of P2U receptors by either ATP or UTP is followed by the opening of ionic channels leading to an influx of Ca2+. A second pathway for Ca2+ influx results from the opening of P2Z receptor channels triggered by adenosine-5'-O(1-thiotriphosphate) or ATP but not by UTP. The form of ATP that activates P2Z receptors is ATP4- (with a K0.5 of 0.5 microM). In voltage-clamped cells, the inward current activated by ATP4- is transient, partly because it inactivates and partly because it is rapidly masked by the development of a quinine-sensitive Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current. In current-clamp, macrophages stimulated by UTP remain normally polarized, whereas ATP depolarizes them. This P2Z-mediated depolarization results in an inhibition of the influx of Ca2+, which explains part of the difference between the time courses of the Ca2+ responses elicited by ATP and UTP."
https://openalex.org/W1497870087,"Photosystem I of barley contains a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa when isolated using the detergent n-decyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside. The 7-kDa polypeptide is lost from the PS I complex isolated using Triton X-100. The 7-kDa polypeptide and a corresponding full-length cDNA clone have been isolated. Based on high sequence similarity to an N-terminal sequence of PSI-K from spinach and to the deduced amino acid sequence of Psak from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the 7-kDa barley polypeptide is identified as PSI-K. The cDNA clone encodes a precursor polypeptide of 131 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 13,726 Da. The transit peptide shows characteristics of polypeptides imported into the chloroplast. PSI-K has two hydrophobic regions predicted to be membrane-spanning alpha-helices. In vitro expressed prePSI-K polypeptide was imported into intact chloroplasts, whereas an in vitro expressed prePSI-K lacking 7 amino acid residues (Met-Ala-Ser-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala) at the N-terminal end of the transit peptide failed to be imported. The mRNA encoding PSI-K increases during illumination. PsaK is located in a single locus in the genome. PSI-K has significant similarity to PSI-G. When comparing the barley PSI-K and PSI-G with the reported PSI-K sequence from Synechococcus vulcanus, the degree of similarity is equal, suggesting that an ancestral gene has been duplicated in a chloroplast progenitor but not in a cyanobacterial."
https://openalex.org/W1589174107,"To further define the role played by protein kinase C (PKC) in the activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, we have utilized a pseudosubstrate of PKC which was myristoylated at the N terminus. In electropermeabilized neutrophils, the myristoylated pseudosubstrate Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln (myr-psi PKC) inhibited PMA-induced protein phosphorylations and activation of the NADPH oxidase, induced either by PMA or by the receptor agonist formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Both the pseudosubstrate lacking the N-terminal myristate (psi PKC) and a myristoylated control peptide (Phe-Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gln, myr-CP) were without effect on these responses. The myristoylated pseudosubstrate was also tested in a cell-free system, in which NADPH oxidase activation can be achieved by addition of SDS and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate in a staurosporine-insensitive manner. Myr-psi PKC, but not psi PKC or myr-CP, proved to be a potent inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity in the cell-free system, indicating that the inhibition observed in permeabilized neutrophils may have been caused by an effect other than PKC inhibition. In the presence of myr-psi PKC, translocation in the cell-free system of the cytosolic oxidase components p47-phox and p67-phox to the plasma membrane was inhibited. From these results we conclude that myristoylation profoundly increases the ability of pseudosubstrates of PKC to inhibit not only PKC-mediated phosphorylations, but also NADPH oxidase activation. The latter effect, however, is most probably not related to PKC inhibition but may indicate a critical role of the membrane surface charge in the translocation of the cytosolic oxidase components p47-phox and p67-phox."
https://openalex.org/W1559191378,"The melanin operon (melC) of Streptomyces antibioticus contains two genes, melC1 and melC2 (apotyrosinase). Our previous studies indicated that MelC1 forms a transient binary complex with the downstream apotyrosinase MelC2 to facilitate the incorporation of copper ion and the secretion of tyrosinase. In this study, we investigated the role of histidine residues in the function of MelC1 by examining a series of substitution or deletion mutants. Of eight mutants only the substitution of His-117 with Asp in the mutant M-117D rendered the complete abolishment of the intracellular tyrosinase activity in both Streptomyces and Escherichia coli. Replacement of His-102 by Leu in the mutant M-102L also caused a 64-70% reduction of tyrosinase activity in Streptomyces and E. coli. These two mutations also affected the secretion of both MelC1 and MelC2 proteins. In vitro copper activation of the purified MelC1.MelC2 binary complex from these two mutants regained only 20-30% tyrosinase activity of the wild type. Biochemical characterization of the tyrosinases from these two mutants revealed that they were different in several aspects. The intracellular tyrosinase activity in M-117D, but not in M-102L, could be partially reactivated by copper ion or by the cell extract containing MelC1. The copper content and the specific activity of the tyrosinase purified from the culture supernatant from M-117D were only 40% of those in wild type and M-102L. Additionally, fast protein liquid chromatography analysis indicated that in these two mutants the copper activation process was defective, very likely due to the incompetent MelC1.MelC2 binary complex formed: reduced association in M-117D and elevated association in M-102L. Furthermore, the conformation of MelC2 in the binary complex or in the mature enzyme form in wild type could be differentiated by the proteinase K digestion pattern, and so did the conformation of MelC2 found in those of M-102L, but not in M-117D mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MelC1 is indispensable in the incorporation of copper ion into MelC2 apotyrosinase via a transient, competent binary complex formation, during which a conformational transition of MelC2 has occurred. This strongly suggests that MelC1 is a chaperone for the apotyrosinase MelC2."
https://openalex.org/W1550638522,"Saposins are a family of four small glycoproteins, all of which are derived from prosaposin, and are involved in the lysosomal hydrolysis of various sphingolipids. Results from this investigation demonstrate that saposins A-D bind to galactosyl- and glucosylceramide. The binding was highly dependent on the solution pH; maximum binding of glucosylceramide to all saposins occurred at pH 7. Maximum binding of galactosylceramide to saposins B and D occurred at a more basic pH (8.5). The binding of glucosylceramide to saposins was significantly inhibited by Mg2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+. Although maximum binding of sulfatide to saposins A, C, and D occurred at acidic pH, the binding to saposin B was maximum at pH 8.5. Saposin A also bound sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholine at neutral pH. No significant binding was evident between these lipids and saposins B-D at any pH value. The existence of saposin-lipid complexes was further confirmed in selected samples by gel filtration, isoelectric focusing, and a TLC binding assay. We have also shown that galactosylceramide bound to saposins A-D was efficiently transported to a rat brain microsomal fraction. This result suggests that saposins and possibly their precursor, prosaposin, may be involved in membrane biogenesis such as the assembly of myelin and plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1573031407,"Asymmetric forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are thought to be the predominant forms of this enzyme at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions where they attach to the synaptic basal lamina via a collagen-like tail. High salt and heparin-containing buffers are capable of solubilizing asymmetric AChE molecules from skeletal muscle; however, detachment of AChE specifically from synaptic basal lamina using these procedures has not been demonstrated. To determine whether AChE can be solubilized from mature neuromuscular junctions, adult quail muscle fibers were extracted with buffered detergent solutions containing either 0.05 M NaCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.5-2 mg/ml heparin, 8 M urea, or 4 m guanidine HCl, and the remaining AChE molecules were localized by indirect immunofluorescence. Analysis of extracted AChE oligomeric forms showed that low salt buffers containing heparin and high salt buffers were capable of solubilizing substantial amounts of catalytically active collagen-tailed AChE, whereas none of these buffers were capable of detaching AChE from synaptic basal lamina. In contrast, digestion with purified collagenase detached asymmetric forms from the non-extractable fraction and removed the AChE from the neuromuscular junctions. Parallel experiments using rat gastrocnemius muscle and enzyme histochemistry to detect AChE gave similar results. These studies indicate that the junctional AChE molecules are firmly attached to the extracellular matrix and that all the conventional extraction buffers used to solubilize the asymmetric collagen-tailed forms of AChE are incapable of detaching this enzyme from the synaptic basal lamina."
https://openalex.org/W1608439885,"Thrombin participates in several regulatory events following injury as a result of its effects on blood coagulation and cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Protease nexin-1 (PN-1) is a potent thrombin inhibitor in the extracellular environment. Since injury-related factors are known to regulate the synthesis and secretion of PN-1, the inhibitor may serve to modulate the actions of thrombin during injury. Here we report the molecular mechanisms that underlie this regulation. In normal human fibroblasts, interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta stimulated the synthesis and secretion of PN-1. The stimulation correlated with an increase in steady-state levels of PN-1 mRNA. Treatment of cells with both cycloheximide and IL-1 reduced the levels of PN-1 mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that IL-1 modestly increased the rate of PN-1 transcription. However, experiments with actinomycin D demonstrated that IL-1 significantly increased the half-life of the PN-1 mRNA. In contrast, dexamethasone (DXM) repressed the synthesis and secretion of PN-1 from fibroblasts. This effect correlated with a decrease in PN-1 mRNA. A sustained decrease in PN-1 mRNA was also seen when cells were treated with cycloheximide and DXM. In nuclear run-on assays, DXM functioned as a transcriptional repressor of PN-1 synthesis. Treatment of cells with actinomycin D showed that DXM did not affect mRNA stability. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that IL-1 and DXM, which function biologically in different fashions, regulate the synthesis of PN-1 by separate molecular mechanisms. While DXM directly regulates PN-1 at the level of transcription, IL-1 in the presence of ongoing protein synthesis regulates PN-1 production predominantly in a post-transcriptional fashion by increasing the half-life of the PN-1 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2383990555,"We have shown previously that treatment of A431 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces desensitization of the EGF receptor. We now show that this desensitization is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of the receptor on Ser-1002. Using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Ser-1002, p34cdc2 was identified as a kinase capable of phosphorylating this serine residue. Purified Xenopus p34cdc2 was found to phosphorylate the synthetic peptide on the serine residue corresponding to Ser-1002. This kinase also phosphorylated purified EGF receptor in vitro on Ser-1002. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by p34cdc2 was associated with a decrease in its tyrosine protein kinase activity. These data indicate that the EGF receptor may be a target for phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent kinase in vivo and imply that receptor function may be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1491414486,"Purified human placental 3 beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-steroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) was affinity radiolabeled by 2 alpha-bromo[2'-14C]acetoxyprogesterone (2 alpha-BAP) in the presence or absence of 3 beta-HSD substrate, pregnenolone. The substrate steroid substantially protects 3 beta-HSD activity from inactivation by 2 alpha-BAP. Tryptic peptides of unprotected and substrate-protected radioalkylated enzyme were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of each radiolabeled peptide was determined and localized within the cDNA-derived primary structure of the enzyme. According to the percent total radioactivity associated with each of four radiolabeled peaks separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, two peptides were protected by substrate from affinity radioalkylation by 2 alpha-BAP. The first, 251GQFYYISDDTPHQSYDNLNYTLSK274, was produced by tryptic cleavage at Arg-250 and Lys-274 (the Arg-250 peptide) and contained radiolabeled His262. The second, 176NGGTLYTCALR186, was produced by tryptic cleavage at Lys-175 and Arg-186 (the Lys-175 peptide) and contained radiolabeled Cys183. Based on amino acid analysis to quantitate radioactivity incorporated per nmol of peptide, substrate steroid decreased the radiolabeling of His262 in the Arg-250 peptide by 3.6-fold and decreased the radiolabeling of Cys183 in the Lys-175 peptide by 3.7-fold. Three minor radiolabeled peptides (the NH2-terminal, Arg-71, and Arg-196 tryptic peptides) were also identified in the primary structure, but pregnenolone did not diminish their affinity radioalkylation. These observations indicate that the Arg-250 and Lys-175 peptides are involved in substrate binding and suggest that His262 and Cys183 are in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2149778573,"The agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK) have been shown to evoke markedly different patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in the same isolated pancreatic acinar cells. ACh induces high frequency sinusoidal oscillations (spiking) associated with activation of Ca2+ influx. CCK evokes longer lasting discrete transients separated by long intervals, and these low frequency transients persist for many minutes in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Using digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence, we have now monitored the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) simultaneously in many individual cells from the same population. In the resting condition [Ca2+]i ranged from about 50 to 300 nM. When the resting [Ca2+]i was below 150 nM, ACh (50-100 nM) invariably evoked typical high frequency spiking. In the majority of cells which had a resting [Ca2+]i higher than 150 nM, ACh also evoked low frequency transients. Although initiated by ACh, these transients displayed the temporal and functional characteristics of the CCK-evoked transients. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ for a few minutes had no effect on this type of oscillation, whereas such a procedure reversibly abolished the ACh-evoked high frequency response. For the response evoked by 10-30 pM Ca2+ signal amplitude and the resting [Ca2+]i. Because the Ca2+ signal amplitude and the resting [Ca2+]i. Because CCK could never induce high frequency spiking there is some receptor specificity in dictating the time course of Ca2+ oscillations, but the resting [Ca2+]i is a major determinant of the Ca2+ signal pattern."
https://openalex.org/W203068383,"Fibronectin is a multidomain adhesive glycoprotein found in plasma, interstitial connective tissue, and basement membrane. Diverse biological activities have been associated with the fibronectin molecule including cell adhesion, cell migration, wound healing, hemostasis, and oncogenic transformation. Binding sites for heparin, fibrin, gelatin/collagen, and cells have been localized to various structural domains of the molecule. In addition, fibronectin also binds both plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) via a 55-kDa amino-terminal fragment (Moser, T.L., Enghild, J.J., Pizzo, S.V., and Stack, M.S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18917-18923). Although intact fibronectin does not enhance the rate of t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation, a mixture of proteolytically degraded fibronectin fragments stimulates the activation reaction, resulting in an 11-fold increase in the kcat/Km. Based on these observations, we have synthesized a variety of peptides derived from the plasminogen/t-PA binding region of fibronectin and determined the effect of these peptides on the initial rate kinetics of plasminogen activation by t-PA as well as on plasmin and t-PA amidolytic activity. Here we report that a specific octapeptide, SRNRCNDQ-NH2, consisting of residues 196-203 of the fibronectin molecule is a potent stimulator of t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation, resulting in a 15-fold increase in the kcat/Km of the activation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1547954166,"Serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) specifically binds to and is internalized by F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. Monolayers of F9 cells were differentiated into a primitive endoderm stage by addition of retinoic acid. Fluorescein-derivatized or radiolabeled RBP associated with F9 cell monolayers at 37 degrees C in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Competition by simultaneous incubation with excess unlabeled RBP indicated that this association was specific and saturable; the apparent dissociation constant was 200-300 nM using either tracer. At 37 degrees C, over 80% of the cell-associated RBP was internalized, and only a small fraction was bound to the cell surface; fluorescence microscopy indicated that internalized RBP was in small vesicles within the cytoplasm. Internalized RBP was subsequently degraded and released from the cell in an acid-soluble form. Parental F9 cells were heterogeneous in their ability to associate with RBP. Random subcloning identified natural variant F9 cell lines which did, or did not, express this biological activity upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation. The clonal nature of the capacity for RBP uptake suggests that this specific internalization is a heritable trait. Together, these observations provide strong evidence that RBP uptake occurs by a receptor-mediated process in F9 cells. The cycle of RBP internalization and degradation by F9 cells bearing specific RBP receptors may provide a regulable mechanism for the cellular accumulation of serum retinol."

In addition, the effect of ATP on the interaction between another cap-binding initiation factor, eIF-4F, and eIF-4A was studied using the same methods. Comparison of the equilibrium association constants (K(eq)) indicate that 1) hydrolyzable ATP affects the affinity of eIF-(iso)4F for eIF-4A, regardless of whether or not mRNA was previously bound to the eIF-(iso)4F; in contrast, ATP had no effect on the eIF-(iso)4F/oligoribonucleotide interaction; 2) in the presence of ATP, the binding of the binary eIF-(iso)4F.eIF-4A complex to the oligoribonucleotide is of similar affinity as the binding of the oligoribonucleotide to the eIF-(iso)4F alone; the stoichiometry of this ternary eIF-(iso)4F.eIF-4A.mRNA complex was found to be 1:1:1; and 3) a similar ATP effect is observed for the eIF-4F/eIF-4A interaction as for the eIF-(iso)4F.eIF-4A complex."
https://openalex.org/W1521505080,"An intimate relationship between protein conformational changes and catalysis has often been suggested. The present study employs ligand-induced ultraviolet difference spectra and kinetic parameters determined for Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase and its site-specific mutants to evaluate the linkage between binding, isomerization, and reaction rate. For the wild-type enzyme, the lead substrate carbamoyl phosphate introduces a large difference absorbance in the enzyme upon binding (delta epsilon max approximately 1,800 M-1 cm-1; Miller, A. W., and Kuo, L. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15023-15027). The spectrum is the same in lineshape as that produced by the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-ornithine and is 80% as intense. Both substrate and analog cause gross protein conformational rearrangements as evident by swift and severe cracking of enzyme crystals in their presence. For the mutants, the difference spectra actuated by the substrate are the same in lineshape as that of the wild type but vary in intensity. A wide range of substrate affinity and steady-state kinetic constants are also observed for the mutants. When the binding energy of carbamoyl phosphate and the activation energy for transcarbamoylation are calculated for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, they are found to be inversely correlated to the intensity of protein difference absorbance elicited by the lead substrate. Together with analyses of steady-state kinetic parameters derived for various plausible reaction schemes, the experimental data suggest that carbamoyl phosphate induces the committed isomerization in ornithine transcarbamoylase for transition state binding. Our results provide a unique demonstration that an induced-fit isomerization, triggered by binding, either controls or contributes significantly to the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1518557478,"The structure of the isolated alpha subunit of F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 was probed using limited proteolysis by four different proteases, and the following results were obtained. 1) Distribution of 21 protease-cleaved sites is similar to that of the beta subunit of F1-ATPase (Tozawa, K., Odaka, M., Date, T., and Yoshida, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16484-16490), thus providing experimental evidence for similar folding topology of the two subunits, and the locations of 11 water-exposed loop regions in the tertiary structure are predicted. 2) Most proteolytic peptides remain associated to maintain the gross structure of the alpha subunit and can reassociate each other after denaturing urea treatment. 3) However, the carboxyl-terminal peptides comprising approximately 80 residues (C1 peptides) are released from other peptide(s) during proteolysis, and those comprising approximately 105 residues (C2 peptides) are released during native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after proteolysis. 4) Inclusion of Mg-ATP in the native electrophoretic system prevents the release of the C2 peptide. Addition of Mg-ATP to the proteolysis mixtures results in an increase of the C2 peptide population and a decrease of the C1 peptide population. Thus, Mg-ATP induces a conformational change at the regions of C1 and C2 peptides of the alpha subunit. 5) Except for the trypsin-treated one, protease-treated alpha subunits are reconstitutable with the native beta subunit into the form of alpha 3 beta 3 complexes, which show significantly higher ATPase activities than the intact alpha 3 beta 3 complex. This activation is attributable to the cleavage of a peptide bond that produces C2 peptides. The carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit is likely to be involved in the regulation of ATPase activity in F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2151739338,"A reductase of Streptomyces fradiae was speculated to catalyze reduction of tylosin to relomycin, an industrially undesirable product. The activity of tylosin reductase was closely related to bacterial growth, suggesting involvement of the enzyme in a primary metabolism. The reductase activity was improved significantly in vivo and in vitro. The enzyme was also partially stabilized in vitro. Using a simple five-step chromatographic procedure, the reductase was purified 480-fold to apparent homogeneity. The purified reductase had a molecular mass of 270 kDa and consisted of two different subunits of 26 and 7 kDa at 1:1 ratio. The enzyme exhibited an absorption maximum at 405 nm and was inhibited by exogenous FAD or FMN, indicating a flavin as its prosthetic group. Tylosin reductase was optimally active at pH 7.0-7.2 and 40 degrees C with NADPH as a preferred electron donor. The Km of the enzyme for tylosin was 1.4 mM and that for NADPH was 0.15 mM. The Vmax for the enzymatic reaction was 917 mumol of tylosin formed/min/mg protein. The enzymatic conversion of tylosin to relomycin was coupled to that of NADPH to NADP+ at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Tylosin reductase showed a broad substrate specificity toward all macrolide aldehydes (as normal and shunt metabolites of tylosin biosynthesis) tested. Thus, the enzyme may have a physiological role of macrolide detoxification for the bacterium."
