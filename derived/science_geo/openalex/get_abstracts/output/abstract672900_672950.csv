https://openalex.org/W3157931697,"Infection by SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals has been related to close contact with humans diagnosed with COVID-19. Objectives: To assess the exposure, infection, and persistence by SARS-CoV-2 of dogs and cats living in the same households of humans that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate clinical and laboratory alterations associated with animal infection.Animals living with COVID-19 patients were longitudinally followed and had nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal and rectal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, blood samples were collected for laboratory analysis, and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) to investigate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Between May and October 2020, 39 pets (29 dogs and 10 cats) of 21 patients were investigated. Nine dogs (31%) and four cats (40%) from 10 (47.6%) households were infected with or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Animals tested positive from 11 to 51 days after the human index COVID-19 case onset of symptoms. Three dogs tested positive twice within 14, 30, and 31 days apart. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in one dog (3.4%) and two cats (20%). In this study, six out of thirteen animals either infected with or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 have developed mild but reversible signs of the disease. Using logistic regression analysis, neutering, and sharing bed with the ill owner were associated with pet infection.The presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified in dogs and cats from households with human COVID-19 cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. People with COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets during the time of their illness."
https://openalex.org/W3159116547,"The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the molecular target for many vaccines and antibody-based prophylactics aimed at bringing COVID-19 under control. Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD? To answer this question, we combined an analysis of the RBD structure-function with an evolutionary modeling framework. Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W3157365046,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. Its intense politicization constantly made headlines, especially regarding the use of face masks as a safety precaution. However, the extent to which public opinion is polarized on wearing masks has remained anecdotal and the verbal representation of this polarization has not been explored. This study examined the types, themes, temporal trends, and exchange patterns of hashtags about mask wearing posted from March 1 to August 1, 2020 by Twitter users based in the United States. On the one hand, we found a stark rhetorical polarization in terms of semantic antagonism between pro- and anti-mask hashtags, exponential frequency increases of both types of hashtags during the period under study, in parallel to growing COVID-19 case counts, state mask mandates, and media coverage. On the other hand, the results showed an asymmetric participatory polarization in terms of a predominance of pro-mask hashtags along with an “echo chamber” effect in the dominant pro-mask group, which ignored the subversive rhetoric of the anti-mask minority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, this study provides a nuanced account of the digital polarization of public opinion on mask wearing. It draws attention to political polarization both as a rhetorical phenomenon and as a participatory process."
https://openalex.org/W3157300533,"Background COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and cardiovascular damage is commonly observed in affected patients. We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. Study design and methods The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. Results Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher AngⅡ level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (AngⅡ) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). Conclusion Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela. Enhancing Ang II signaling, driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, might play an important role in the renin-angiotensin system, and consequently lead to the development of hypertension in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3158699600,"Farmers and farm workers are critical to the secure supply of food, yet this population is potentially at high risk to acquire COVID-19. This study estimates the prevalence of COVID-19 among farmers and farmworkers in the United States by coupling county-level data on the number of farm workers relative to the general population with data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the 13 month period since the start of the pandemic (from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), the estimated cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (deaths) was 329,031 (6,166) among agricultural producers, 170,137 (2,969) among hired agricultural workers, 202,902 (3,812) among unpaid agricultural workers, and 27,223 (459) among migrant agricultural workers. The cases amount to 9.55%, 9.31%, 9.39%, and 9.01% of all U.S. agricultural producers, hired workers, unpaid workers, and migrant workers, respectively. The COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly higher in counties with more agricultural workers; a 1% increase in the number of hired agricultural workers in a county is associated with a 0.04% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases per person and 0.07% increase in deaths per person. Although estimated new cases among farm workers exhibit similar trends to that of the general population, the correlation between the two is sometimes negative, highlighting the need to monitor this particular population that tends to live in more rural areas. Reduction in labor availability from COVID-19 is estimated to reduce U.S. agricultural output by about $309 million."
https://openalex.org/W3159342067,"In recent times, many alarm bells have begun to sound: the metaphorical presentation of the COVID-19 emergency as a war might be dangerous, because it could affect the way people conceptualize the pandemic and react to it, leading citizens to endorse authoritarianism and limitations to civil liberties. The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that, when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people’s reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default. Rather, socio-political individual variables such as speakers’ political orientation and source of information favor the acceptance of metaphor congruent entailments: right-wing participants and participants relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor, thus more inclined to prefer bellicose options."
https://openalex.org/W3159952420,"Background Men are at higher risk for serious complications related to COVID-19 infection than women. More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. Study design and methods We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. Results Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ß 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ß 0.31, SE 0.07, p&lt;0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p&lt;0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04–2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29–19.7, p &lt;0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52–5.18, p = 0.009 in women, P interaction = 0.02). Conclusions In a sample of 781 men and women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, men exhibited more robust inflammatory activation as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers, as well as worse clinical outcomes. Better understanding of sex differences in immune responses to COVID-19 infection may shed light on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3159730753,"Numerous adverse prenatal exposures have been individually associated with risk for psychiatric illness in the offspring. However, such exposures frequently co-occur, raising questions about their cumulative impact. We evaluated effects of cumulative adverse prenatal exposure burden on psychopathology risk in school-aged children.Using baseline surveys from the U.S.-based Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (7,898 non-adopted, unrelated children from 21 sites, age 9-10, and their primary caregivers), we examined 8 retrospectively-reported adverse prenatal exposures in relation to caregiver-reported total and subscale Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores. We also assessed cumulative effects of these factors on CBCL total as a continuous measure, as well as on odds of clinically significant psychopathology (CBCL total ≥60), in both the initial set and a separate ABCD sample comprising an additional 696 sibling pairs. Analyses were conducted before and after adjustment for 14 demographic and environmental covariates.In minimally and fully adjusted models, 6 exposures (unplanned pregnancy; maternal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use early in pregnancy; pregnancy complications; and birth complications) independently associated with significant but small increases in CBCL total score. Among these 6, none increased the odds of crossing the threshold for clinically significant symptoms by itself. However, odds of exceeding this threshold became significant with 2 exposures (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.47-2.36), and increased linearly with each level of exposure (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.31-1.47), up to 3.53-fold for ≥4 exposures versus none. Similar effects were observed in confirmatory analysis among siblings. Within sibling pairs, greater discordance for exposure load associated with greater CBCL total differences, suggesting that results were not confounded by unmeasured family-level effects.Children exposed to multiple common, adverse prenatal events showed dose-dependent increases in broad, clinically significant psychopathology at age 9-10. Fully prospective studies are needed to confirm and elaborate upon this pattern."
https://openalex.org/W3159238992,"In this era of technology development, every business wants to equip its salesforce with a sustainable salesforce automation system to improve sales performance and customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities. This study investigates the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on CRM capabilities and the sales performance of pharmaceutical organizations. A research model was tested based on 416 valid responses collected from pharmaceutical companies through a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed using Smart-PLS3 to confirm the contribution of BDA to improving CRM capabilities and sales performance. The study finds that individual characteristics such as self-efficacy, playfulness, and social norms, along with organizational characteristics such as voluntariness, user involvement, user participation, and management support, are positive predictors of salesforce perception of BDA. This positive perception of BDA increased the person-technology fit in the salesforce, which ultimately increased the CRM capabilities and sales performance."
https://openalex.org/W3159362425,"A recurrent concern in nature conservation is the potential competition for forage plants between wild bees and managed honey bees. Specifically, that the highly sophisticated system of recruitment and large perennial colonies of honey bees quickly exhaust forage resources leading to the local extirpation of wild bees. However, different species of bees show different preferences for forage plants. We here summarize known forage plants for honey bees and wild bee species at national scale in Denmark. Our focus is on floral resources shared by honey bees and wild bees, with an emphasis on both threatened wild bee species and foraging specialist species. Across all 292 known bee species from Denmark, a total of 410 plant genera were recorded as forage plants. These included 294 plant genera visited by honey bees and 292 plant genera visited by different species of wild bees. Honey bees and wild bees share 176 plant genera in Denmark. Comparing the pairwise niche overlap for individual bee species, no significant relationship was found between their overlap and forage specialization or conservation status. Network analysis of the bee-plant interactions placed honey bees aside from most other bee species, specifically the module containing the honey bee had fewer links to any other modules, while the remaining modules were more highly inter-connected. Despite the lack of predictive relationship from the pairwise niche overlap, data for individual species could be summarized. Consequently, we have identified a set of operational parameters that, based on a high foraging overlap (&gt;70%) and unfavorable conservation status (Vulnerable+Endangered+Critically Endangered), can guide both conservation actions and land management decisions in proximity to known or suspected populations of these species."
https://openalex.org/W3158714284,"Introduction Due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 220 million college students in the world had to halt face-to-face teaching and migrate to what has been called Emergency Remote Teaching, using virtual media, but without adequate preparation. The way this has impacted the student body and its satisfaction with the training process is unknown and there are no instruments backed by specific validity and reliability studies for this teaching context. This is why this study aims to analyze the psychometric properties of the Remote Teaching Satisfaction Scale applied to Chilean health sciences students. Method Quantitative study by means of surveys. We surveyed 1,006 health careers undergraduates chosen by convenience sampling. They came from six Chilean universities, located over a distance of 3,020 kilometers and followed 7 different careers. Women comprised the 78.53%. They answered the Remote Teaching Satisfaction Scale online to evaluate their perception of the first Emergency Remote Teaching term in 2020. Results A descriptive analysis of the items showed a moderate to positive evaluation of the teaching. The Confirmatory Factorial Analysis showed an adequate adjustment of the theoretical four factors model to the data obtained (CFI = 0.959; TLI = 0.953; RMSEA = 0.040). Correlations among factors oscillated from r = 0.21 to r = 0.69. The measurement invariance analysis supported the Configural, Metric and a partial Scalar model. Differences were found in three of the four factors when comparing the first-year students with those of later years. Finally, the Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω coefficients were over 0.70. Discussion The results display initial psychometric evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the Remote Teaching Satisfaction Scale to assess academic satisfaction in Chilean health careers students. Likewise, it is seen that first-year students show higher satisfaction levels about the implemented teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3157319724,"This paper presents the research results of detecting gastric polyps with deep learning object detection method in gastroscopic images. Gastric polyps have various sizes. The difficulty of polyp detection is that small polyps are difficult to detect from the background. We propose a feature extraction and fusion module and combine it with the YOLOv3 network to form our network. This method performs better than other methods in the detection of small polyps because it can fuse the semantic information of high-level feature maps with low-level feature maps to help small polyps detection. In this work, we use a dataset of gastric polyps created by ourselves, containing 1433 training images and 508 validation images. We train and validate our network on our dataset. In comparison with other methods of polyps detection, our method has a significant improvement in precision, recall rate, F1, and F2 score. The precision, recall rate, F1 score, and F2 score of our method can achieve 91.6%, 86.2%, 88.8%, and 87.2%."
https://openalex.org/W3157598477,"Projections of the stage of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and local, regional and national public health policies to limit coronavirus spread as well as ""reopen"" cities and states, are best informed by serum neutralizing antibody titers measured by reproducible, high throughput, and statically credible antibody (Ab) assays. To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and FDA authorized for emergency, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this ""first wave"" and suggest that the notion of ""herd immunity"" at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3158413191,"Aristotelia chilensis (Mol.) Stuntz, also known as maqui, is a plant native to Chile without chemical characterization and quantification of the bioactive compounds present in it. HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS/MS studies have shown the presence, at different concentrations, of phenolic and anthocyanin compounds in fruit and leave extracts of the domesticated maqui clones Luna Nueva, Morena, and Perla Negra. The extracts from leaves and unripe fruits of Luna Nueva and Morena clones significantly inhibit platelet aggregation induced by several agonists; the extracts inhibit platelet granule secretion by decreasing the exposure of P-selectin and CD63 at the platelet membrane. Reactive oxygen species formation in platelets is lower in the presence of maqui extracts. Statistical Pearson analysis supports the levels of phenolic and anthocyanin compounds being responsible for the antiaggregant maqui effects. This work is the first evidence of antiplatelet activity from Aristotelia chilensis giving added value to the use of leaves and unripe fruits from this species."
https://openalex.org/W3157354202,"Since 2003 Korea has experienced the highest suicide rate among OECD countries. One of the societal risk factors that triggers suicide is the contagious nature of suicide. This paper empirically examines the effect of celebrity suicide reports on subsequent copycat suicides, using daily suicide data and information of highly publicized suicide stories in Korea from 2005 to 2018. The findings from the Poisson regression model suggest that the number of public suicides soars after media reports on celebrity suicides. On average, the number of suicides in the population increased by 16.4% within just one day after the reports. Further analysis reveals that female and younger subgroups are more likely to be affected by celebrity suicides. Moreover, the public reacts more strongly to suicide incidents of celebrities of the same gender and even imitates the methods of suicide used by celebrities. This paper highlights the significance of careful and responsible media coverage of suicide stories to prevent copycat suicide. For policymakers, it is crucial to implement regulations not only for traditional media but also for new media where younger people can freely access unfiltered information."
https://openalex.org/W3159119891,"A significant body of multi-disciplinary research supports the proposition that women may experience empowerment from microfinance programs. This is based on the assumption that an increase in women’s financial contribution to the household helps to transform gender norms and relations which increases their decision-making power. However, the relationship between the strength and persistence of patriarchal gender norms within the household and women’s financial empowerment needs further exploration. This paper presents the findings of a mixed-method study comprising 331 surveys and 33 in-depth interviews with women receiving microfinance and their husbands in a southern sub-district of Bangladesh; it draws upon gender socialisation and gender performance theory to understand how patriarchal gender norms influence women’s financial empowerment in households receiving microfinance. Findings demonstrate that participation in microfinance programs has not shifted gender norms, nor financially empowered women. Women’s loans were largely controlled by men as prescribed by underlying, unchanged patriarchal gender norms. The inter-generational reproduction of patriarchal gender relations continued to reproduce a strict gendered division of labour that reinforced restrictions on women’s behaviour, mobility, and decision-making domains, and men’s dominance in household and economic decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3159715360,"We developed a novel preparative method for nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel with high drug loading, which was based on improved paclitaxel solubility in polyethylene glycol (PEG) and self-assembly of paclitaxel in PEG with albumin powders into nanoparticles. That is, paclitaxel and PEG were firstly dissolved in ethanol, which was subsequently evaporated under vacuum. The obtained liquid was then mixed with human serum albumin powders. Thereafter, the mixtures were added into phosphate-buffered saline and nab paclitaxel suspensions emerged after ultrasound. Nab paclitaxel was finally acquired after dialysis and freeze drying. The drug loading of about 15% (W/V) were realized in self-made nab paclitaxel, which was increased by approximately 50% compared to 10% (W/V) in Abraxane. Now this new preparative method has been authorized to obtain patent from China and Japan. The similar characteristics of self-made nab paclitaxel compared to Abraxane were observed in morphology, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release, X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and circular dichroism spectra analysis. Consistent concentration-time curves in rats, biodistributions in mice, anti-tumor activities in mice, and histological transmutation in mice were also found between Abraxane and self-made nanoparticles. In a word, our novel preparative method for nab paclitaxel can significantly improve drug loading, obviously decrease product cost, and is considered to have potent practical value."
https://openalex.org/W3157920118,"In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) is increasingly acknowledged as an essential requirement for the construction of sustainable extra-terrestrial colonies. Even with decreasing launch costs, the ultimate goal of establishing colonies must be the usage of resources found at the destination of interest. Typical approaches towards ISRU are often constrained by the mass and energy requirements of transporting processing machineries, such as rovers and massive reactors, and the vast amount of consumables needed. Application of self-reproducing bacteria for the extraction of resources is a promising approach to reduce these pitfalls. In this work, the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis was used to reduce three different types of Lunar and Martian regolith simulants, allowing for the magnetic extraction of iron-rich materials. The combination of bacterial treatment and magnetic extraction resulted in a 5.8-times higher quantity of iron and 43.6% higher iron concentration compared to solely magnetic extraction. The materials were 3D printed into cylinders and the mechanical properties were tested, resulting in a 400% improvement in compressive strength in the bacterially treated samples. This work demonstrates a proof of concept for the on-demand production of construction and replacement parts in space exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3157977246,"Diabetic Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by myocardial dysfunction caused by diabetes mellitus. After-effects of diabetic cardiomyopathy are far more lethal than non-diabetic cardiomyopathy. More than 300 million people suffer from diabetes and cardiovascular disorder which is expected to be elevated to an alarming figure of 450 million by 2030. Recent studies suggested that miRNA plays important role in the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to identify the miRNA that is responsible for the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy using in silico and in vitro approaches. In this study, to identify the miRNA responsible for the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy, in silico analysis was done to predict the role of these circulating miRNAs in type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Shared miRNAs that are present in both diseases were selected for further analysis. Total RNA and miRNA were extracted from blood samples taken from type 2 diabetic patients as well as healthy controls to analyze the expression of important genes like AKT, VEGF, IGF, FGF1, ANGPT2 using Real-time PCR. The expression of ANGPT2 was up-regulated and AKT, VEGF, IGF, FGF1 were down-regulated in DCM patients as compared to healthy controls. The miRNA expression of miR-17 was up-regulated and miR-24, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-214, and miR-320a were down-regulated in the DCM patients as compared to healthy controls. This shows that dysregulation of target genes and miRNA may contribute towards the pathogenesis of DCM and more studies should be conducted to elucidate the role of circulating miRNAs to use them as therapeutic and diagnostic options."

https://openalex.org/W3159757709,"There is a maldistribution of human resources for health globally, with many Lower- and Middle-Income Countries experiencing significant shortages. We examined healthcare workers’ job preferences in South Africa to identify factors which potentially influence employment decisions. A discrete choice experiment was conducted among 855 South African healthcare workers critical to its national HIV testing and treatment programs. Job characteristics included workload, workplace culture, availability of equipment, training opportunities, sector and facility type, location, salary and benefits. Main effects analysis was conducted using fixed effects logistic regression. Interaction effects identified divergence in preferences. Heavy workload (OR = 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.74–0.83), poor workplace culture (odds ratio 0.66; 95% C.I. 0.62–0.69), insufficient availability of equipment (OR = 0.67; 95% C.I. 0.63–0.70) and infrequent training opportunities (OR = 0.75; 95% C.I. 0.71–0.80) had large, significant effects on worker preferences. An increase in salary of 20% (OR = 1.29; 95% C.I. 1.16–1.44) had a positive effect on preferences, while a salary decrease of 20% (OR = 0.55; 95% C.I. 0.49–0.60) had a strong negative effect. Benefits packages had large positive effects on preferences: respondents were twice as likely to choose a job that included medical aid, pension and housing contributions worth 40% of salary (OR = 2.06; 95% C.I. 1.87–2.26), holding all else constant. Although salary was important across all cadres, benefits packages had larger effects on job preferences than equivalent salary increases. Improving working conditions is critical to attracting and retaining appropriate health cadres responsible for the country’s HIV services, especially in the public sector and underserved, often rural, communities. Crucially, our evidence suggests that factors amenable to improvement such as workplace conditions and remuneration packages have a greater influence on healthcare workers employment decisions than employment sector or location."
https://openalex.org/W3157469989,"The accelerated vaccine development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should lead to a vaccine being available early 2021, albeit in limited supply and possibly without full vaccine acceptance. We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs.A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021-2022 period.An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9-40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30-39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination).For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use."
https://openalex.org/W3159331122,"Understanding the response mechanism of ecosystems to climate change and human disturbance can be improved by analyzing the spatial patterns of vegetation phenology and its influencing factors. Because the diverse phenological patterns are impacted by cloud cover contamination issues in the satellite observations, there are few remote sensing phenological research data in subtropical monsoon climate regions. To better understand the horizontal and vertical changes of vegetation phenology in these regions and how it may be affected by climatic factors and topographical features, we first extracted vegetation phenological information (such as start of growth season (SOS), end of growth season (EOS) and length of growth season (LEN)) from a reconstructed MODIS EVI time-series data. We then used geographic detectors to identify the influencing factors of phenology in different elevation zoning areas. We have found that in the Xiangjiang River Basin: 1) gradual changes in the longitudinal or latitudinal gradient of vegetation phenology were not obvious. Instead of horizontal changes, the variation pattern of phenology was similar to the striped river network of the Xiangjiang River. Earlier SOS mainly appeared in the areas far away from the river; later SOS appeared in the midstream and downstream reaches.2) Elevation played an important role in the regional differentiation of phenology. Boundaries at elevations of 320 m and 520 m distinctly separated the region into plain, hilly, and mountain vegetation phenological characteristics. 3) The impacts of climatic factors were quite different in the three vertical zoning areas. Precipitation was the most crucial factor affecting SOS both in plain and mountain areas. There was no significant factor affecting EOS in the plain area, but temperature had an essential effect on EOS in the mountain area. The hilly areas had a concentrated growth period with no significant factors affecting phenology. These findings highlight the importance of elevation in phenology at a watershed scale, enhance our understanding of the impact of climate changes on subtropical ecosystems, and provide a reference for further land-use change monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3157092502,"Background Pregnant women have an increased risk of urinary incontinence (UI), affecting their quality of life (QoL). This study aims to determine UI and its relationship with QoL among incontinent pregnant women. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in a semi-urban primary care clinic in Selangor, Malaysia, among pregnant women aged 18 years old and above. The validated study instruments consisted of questions on socio-demography, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-UI Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) to determine UI and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module (ICIQ-LUTSQoL) to assess their QoL. A generalised linear model was used to determine the association between the continent and incontinent pregnant women with QoL. Results Of the approached 610 respondents, 440 consented to participate in the study, resulting in a response rate of 72.1%. The mean age was 29.8 years old (SD 4.69) with 82.2% (n = 148) having stress UI. Significant independent factors related to the decreased QoL were mid to late trimester (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.48–6.32), stress UI, (OR 6.94, 95%CI 4.00–12.04) and urge UI (OR3.87, 95%CI 0.48–31.28). Non-Malay improved QoL (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16–0.52). Conclusions All types of UI significantly affecting pregnant women’s QoL. This information is useful in enhancing antenatal management at the primary care level, whereby they should be screened for UI and provided with effective early intervention to improve their QoL."
https://openalex.org/W3157959062,"Previous research has shown a consistent association among genetic factors, psychological symptoms and pain associated with fibromyalgia. However, how these symptoms interact to moderate genetic factors in fibromyalgia has rarely been studied to date. The present research investigates whether psychological symptoms can moderate the effects of catechol-O-methyltransferase on pain and fatigue. A total of 108 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia and 77 healthy control participants took part in the study. Pain, fatigue, and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, fear of pain and fear of movement) were measured by self-report questionnaires. Two types of statistical analyses were performed; the first was undertaken to explore the influences of COMT genotypes on clinical symptoms by comparing patients with fibromyalgia and healthy controls. In the second analysis, moderation analyses to explore the role of psychological symptoms as potential factors that moderate the relationship between pain/fatigue and COMT genotypes were performed. The main results indicated that patients carrying the Met/Met genotype reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than heterozygote carriers (i.e., Met/Val genotype) and higher levels of fatigue, but not significantly different, than Val homozygote carriers. Among patients with fibromyalgia carrying methionine alleles (i.e., Met/Met + Met/Val carriers), only those who scored high on medical fear of pain, experienced an intensified feeling of fatigue. Thus, the present research suggests that fear of pain, as a psychological symptom frequently described in fibromyalgia may act as a moderating factor in the relationship between the Met allele of the COMT gene and the increase or decrease in self-reported fatigue. Although further research with wider patient samples is needed to confirm the present findings, these results point out that the use of psychological interventions focused on affective symptomatology might be a useful tool to reduce the severity of fibromyalgia."
https://openalex.org/W3159267781,"How does the participation of students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream education affect their social inclusion? We introduce a single-item pictorial measure, the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS), to compare the social inclusion of SEN students attending mainstream regular schools to social inclusion of SEN students attending special schools. We collected responses from 138 parents of SEN students aged 4–20, to obtain data on the loneliness, friendships and social inclusion of SEN students. The parents of SEN students attending regular schools did not perceive their children to be less included than parents of SEN students attending special schools. School context decreased SEN students’ perceived loneliness independent of the school type. And while most SEN students’ friendships were formed at school, SEN students attending regular schools had more friends, and these were more likely to live in the same neighborhood. Overall, the social inclusion of SEN students across school types was not affected by the school type, only by the school’s inclusive characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3158151119,"Self-evaluations play an important role in various fields of study, specifically in research on metacognition and self-concept. Although the assumption that self-evaluations as known from metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept are related has received wide agreement, the nature of such a relationship has only rarely been investigated. In the current study, the individual-differences approach that has occasionally addressed this association is discussed and extended twofold. For one, a novel way to compare metacognition and self-concept is presented by computing a self-concept bias—analogous to metacognition research. For another, the study targeted a younger population, namely first-grade children. In line with previous studies, the results confirmed a weak relation between metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept when relating the two constructs at the absolute level of confidence. However, relating the constructs by means of the respective biases revealed a more substantial association. Thus, while previous studies have assumed the common thread between metacognition and self-concept to be best explained by a general confidence trait, the present study suggests the accuracy of self-evaluations to be at stake instead. Hence, by introducing a method to quantify a bias in self-concept, the current study proposes a new and promising way to compare and relate the constructs of metacognition and self-concept."
https://openalex.org/W3158914519,"Surgery in humans is continuously evolving and promoted minimally invasive treatment. On the other hand, despite the importance of the 3Rs principles for experimental animals is well documented, no reports describe specific methodologies for implementing ""refinement"" in practice. Here, we describe a new technique, the ""Ohta Method"" for caudal arthrocentesis in the pursuit of the 3Rs for animal experiments and the development of innovative methods for investigating systemic organ arteries through minimally invasive procedures. This procedure requires only a percutaneous puncture of the caudal artery without any injury to the limb or body trunk. In addition, it does not cut down the artery, making hemostasis easier and recovering arterial damage easier. We will show multiple organ artery angiographies in marmoset for the first time in the world. The principle described in this paper could also be applied to many other small animals, such as rats. Moreover, using this method, multiple doses of the drug or cells can be administered to the target organ at the time of therapeutic intervention, thereby enabling the establishment of more sophisticated and complex therapeutic intervention studies as translational research."
https://openalex.org/W3159730526,"Background Healthy lifestyle habits formed during young adulthood may have a sustaining impact on health across later life. The current study aimed to test the theoretical model of factors (selected demographic variables, knowledge of heart disease, health belief related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), self-efficacy, cues to action, and screening intention) influencing health-promoting behaviours among Malaysian university students. Methods In a cross-sectional survey, the undergraduate students in Universiti Sains Malaysia were invited to complete the self-administered questionnaires. Participants were selected using a purposive sampling method. The proposed hypothesised model was analysed using a structural equation modelling with Mplus 7.3 program. A total of 788 (70.7% female) undergraduate students with a mean age of 20.2 (SD = 1.02) participated in the study. The primary outcome of knowledge, health beliefs, and health-promoting behaviours related to CVD were measured by questionnaires namely: Knowledge of Heart Disease, Health Beliefs Related to CVD, and Health Promoting Lifestyle Profiles-II. Results The final hypothetical structural model showed a good fit to the data based on several fit indices: with comparative fit index (CFI) at .921, standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) at .037, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) at .044 (90% CI: .032, .054). The final structural model supported 13 significant path estimates. These variables explained 12% of the total variance in health-promoting behaviours. Through perceived benefits, total knowledge had an indirect effect on health-promoting behaviours. Conclusion The results suggest that perceived barriers, perceived benefits, family history of CVD, and screening intention enable young adults to engage in health-promoting behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3157625866,"Objective This split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial assessed the effect of 10% strontium chloride in combination with photobiomodulation (PBM) for the control of tooth sensitivity (TS) post-bleaching. Methods The upper/lower, right and left quadrants of fifty volunteers were randomized and allocated to four groups (n = 25): PLACEBO—placebo gel + simulation of PBM; Placebo + PBM; STRONTIUM—10% strontium chloride + simulation of PBM; and PBM + STRONTIUM—10% strontium chloride + PBM. All groups received tooth bleaching treatment with 35% hydrogen peroxide. For the PBM treatment, the laser tip was positioned in the apical and cervical regions of the teeth bleached in the respective hemi-arch. The laser system was operated in continuous mode, using 1.7 J of energy. A dose of 60 J/cm 2 was applied to each point for 16 seconds under 808 nm near-infrared light (100mW of power), with a point area of 0.028 cm 2 . TS was assessed during a 21-day follow-up, using the modified visual analogue scale. Results In the intragroup assessment, the Friedman test indicated that PBM + STRONTIUM promoted the greatest reduction in TS after the second week of treatment ( p ≤ 0.05). The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test indicated that the groups Placebo + PBM, STRONTIUM, and STRONTIUM + PBM did not differ statistically ( p ≥ 0.05) in the first and third weeks of treatment The group PLACEBO exhibited the greatest TS in the first three days after each bleaching session. Conclusion The combination of 10% strontium chloride with PBM was effective in reducing post-bleaching TS; however, the combination of 10% strontium chloride with PBM was effective in reducing post-bleaching TS; however, it did not differ from the individual use of Placebo + PBM or STRONTIUM groups assessed after 21 days of follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3158177875,"Spray-dried animal plasma (SDAP) is widely used in diets of domestic animals to improve health status and increase growth and feed efficiency. Individual steps in the SDAP manufacturing process, including spray-drying, have been validated to inactivate potential pathogens. Manufacturing standards have established a minimum exit temperature of 80°C and a minimum post-drying storage period of 14 days at 20°C for production of SDAP. Also, UV-C irradiation has been evaluated as another inactivation step that could be included in the manufacturing process. The aim of this study was to assess the inactivation effectiveness of spray-drying on Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV) and the effect of UV-C inactivation on ASFV as redundant biosafety steps of the manufacturing process for producing spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP). This study demonstrated that UV-C treatment of liquid porcine plasma can inactivate more than 4 Log 10 TCID 50 /mL of ASFV at 3000 J/L. Spray-drying effectively inactivated at least 4 Log 10 TCID 50 /mL of both CSFV and ASFV. Incorporating UV-C technology within the SDAP manufacturing process can add another biosafety step to further enhance product safety."
https://openalex.org/W3158339579,"Objective To assess the risk of severe childhood infections within families, we conducted a sibling analysis in a population-based cohort study with genealogical linkage. We investigated the sibling risk of hospitalization with common infections, a marker of severity. We hypothesized that having siblings hospitalized for infection would increase the proband’s risk of admission with infection. Study design We used population data on Western Australian live-born singletons and their siblings between 1980 and 2014. Measures of infection were infection-related hospitalizations from discharge diagnostic codes. Exposure was having a sibling who had an infection-related hospitalization. Outcomes were infection-related hospitalizations in the child/proband. Probands were followed until an infection-related hospitalization admission (up to the first three), death, 18th birthday, or end of 2014, whichever occurred first. Infection risks were estimated by adjusted Cox proportional hazard models for multiple events. Results Of 512,279 probands, 142,915 (27.9%) had infection-related hospitalizations; 133,322 (26.0%) had a sibling with a previous infection-related hospitalization (i.e. exposed). Median interval between sibling and proband infection-related hospitalizations was 1.4 years (inter-quartile range 0.5–3.7). Probands had a dose-dependent increase in risk if sibling/s had 1, 2, or 3+ infection-related hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.41, 95% CI 1.39–1.43; aHR 1.65, 1.61–1.69; aHR 1.83, 1.77–1.90, respectively). Among siblings with the same clinical infection type, highest sibling risks were for genitourinary (aHR 2.06, 1.68–2.53), gastrointestinal (aHR 2.07, 1.94–2.19), and skin/soft tissue infections (aHR 2.34, 2.15–2.54). Overall risk of infection-related hospitalization was higher in children with more siblings and with older siblings. Conclusion In this population-based study, we observed an increased risk of infection-related hospitalization in children whose siblings were previously hospitalized for infection. Public health interventions may be particularly relevant in families of children hospitalized with infection."
https://openalex.org/W3158626524,"During the COVID-19 lockdown in the US, many businesses were shut down temporarily. Essential businesses, most prominently grocery stores, remained open to ensure access to food and household essentials. Grocery shopping presents increased potential for COVID-19 infection because customers and store employees are in proximity to each other. This study investigated shoppers’ perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks and put them in context by comparing grocery shopping to other activities outside home, and examined whether a proactive preventive action by grocery stores influence shoppers’ perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our data were obtained via an anonymous online survey distributed between April 2 and 10, 2020 to grocery shoppers in New York State (the most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study) and Washington State (the first affected by the pandemic). We found significant factors associated with high levels of risk perception on grocery shoppers. We identified some effective preventive actions that grocery stores implement to alleviate anxiety and risk perception. We found that people are generally more concerned about in-store grocery shopping relative to other out-of-home activities. Findings suggest that a strict policy requiring grocery store employees to use facemasks and gloves greatly reduced shoppers’ perceived risk rating of infection of themselves by 37.5% and store employees by 51.2%. Preventive actions by customers and businesses are critical to reducing the unwitting transmission of COVID-19 as state governments prepare to reopen the economy and relax restrictions on activities outside home."
https://openalex.org/W3158985147,"Billions of birds fatally collide with human-made structures each year. These mortalities have consequences for population viability and conservation of endangered species. This source of human-wildlife conflict also places constraints on various industries. Furthermore, with continued increases in urbanization, the incidence of collisions continues to increase. Efforts to reduce collisions have largely focused on making structures more visible to birds through visual stimuli but have shown limited success. We investigated the efficacy of a multimodal combination of acoustic signals with visual cues to reduce avian collisions with tall structures in open airspace. Previous work has demonstrated that a combination of acoustic and visual cues can decrease collision risk of birds in captive flight trials. Extending to field tests, we predicted that novel acoustic signals would combine with the visual cues of tall communication towers to reduce collision risk for birds. We broadcast two audible frequency ranges (4 to 6 and 6 to 8 kHz) in front of tall communication towers at locations in the Atlantic migratory flyway of Virginia during annual migration and observed birds' flight trajectories around the towers. We recorded an overall 12-16% lower rate of general bird activity surrounding towers during sound treatment conditions, compared with control (no broadcast sound) conditions. Furthermore, in 145 tracked ""at-risk"" flights, birds reduced flight velocity and deflected flight trajectories to a greater extent when exposed to the acoustic stimuli near the towers. In particular, the 4 to 6 kHz stimulus produced the greater effect sizes, with birds altering flight direction earlier in their trajectories and at larger distances from the towers, perhaps indicating that frequency range is more clearly audible to flying birds. This ""acoustic lighthouse"" concept reduces the risk of collision for birds in the field and could be applied to reduce collision risk associated with many human-made structures, such as wind turbines and tall buildings."
https://openalex.org/W3159746582,"In the Caribbean Basin, malvaceous weeds commonly show striking golden/yellow mosaic symptoms. Leaf samples from Malachra sp. and Abutilon sp. plants with these symptoms were collected in Hispaniola from 2014 to 2020. PCR tests with degenerate primers revealed that all samples were infected with a bipartite begomovirus, and sequence analyses showed that Malachra sp. plants were infected with tobacco leaf curl Cuba virus (TbLCuCV), whereas the Abutilon sp. plants were infected with a new bipartite begomovirus, tentatively named Abutilon golden yellow mosaic virus (AbGYMV). Phylogenetic analyses showed that TbLCuCV and AbGYMV are distinct but closely related species, which are most closely related to bipartite begomoviruses infecting weeds in the Caribbean Basin. Infectious cloned DNA-A and DNA-B components were used to fulfilled Koch’s postulates for these diseases of Malachra sp. and Abutilon sp. In host range studies, TbLCuCV also induced severe symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana , tobacco and common bean plants; whereas AbGYMV induced few or no symptoms in plants of these species. Pseudorecombinants generated with the infectious clones of these viruses were highly infectious and induced severe symptoms in N . benthamiana and Malachra sp., and both viruses coinfected Malachra sp., and possibly facilitating virus evolution via recombination and pseudorecombination. Together, our results suggest that TbLCuCV primarily infects Malachra sp. in the Caribbean Basin, and occasionally spills over to infect and cause disease in crops; whereas AbGYMV is well-adapted to an Abutilon sp. in the Dominican Republic and has not been reported infecting crops."
https://openalex.org/W3158371056,"Aimed at the technical problems of low drilling speed and difficult rock-breaking in deep-well and hard rock-stratum, particle waterjet coupled impact rock-breaking technology in rotary drilling is put forward in this paper. Firstly, the working principle of particle jet impact rock-breaking in rotary drilling was introduced, and the acceleration model of particle jet and the damage model of rock were established. The acceleration mechanism of particles and dynamic damage evolution process of rock under particle jet were studied, which showed that the broken pit and rock damage would increase with time gone on, and damage evolution of rock presented the radial expansion. Then, experimental device of particle jet coupled impact rock-breaking in rotary state was developed, and the effect of jet parameters on penetration depth and failure volume was analyzed with comparison of la experiment and numerical simulation. The results showed that drilling speed with particle jet impact is twice that of conventional drilling, and combination nozzles layout of impact angle with 8°and 20° can achieve rock-drilled rapidly, which also demonstrated the correctness of simulation method. The device development and the rock-breaking results analysis would be of great value for engineering application."
https://openalex.org/W3159879834,"Common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus truncatus ) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuarine system along the east coast of Florida are impacted by anthropogenic activities and have had multiple unexplained mortality events. Given this, managers need precise estimates of demographic and abundance parameters. Mark-recapture photo-identification boat-based surveys following a Robust Design were used to estimate abundance, adult survival, and temporary emigration for the IRL estuarine system stock of bottlenose dolphins. Models allowed for temporary emigration and included a parameter (time since first capture) to assess evidence for transient individuals. Surveys ( n = 135) were conducted along predetermined contour and transect lines throughout the entire IRL (2016–2017). The best fitting model allowed survival to differ for residents and transients and to vary by primary period, detection to vary by secondary session, and did not include temporary emigration. Dolphin abundance was estimated from 981 (95% CI: 882–1,090) in winter to 1,078 (95% CI: 968–1,201) in summer with a mean of 1,032 (95% CI: 969–1,098). Model averaged seasonal survival rate for marked residents was 0.85–1.00. Capture probability was 0.20 to 0.42 during secondary sessions and the transient rate was estimated as 0.06 to 0.07. This study is the first Robust Design mark-recapture survey to estimate abundance for IRL dolphins and provides population estimates to improve future survey design, as well as an example of data simulation to validate and optimize sampling design. Transients likely included individuals with home ranges extending north of the IRL requiring further assessment of stock delineation. Results were similar to prior abundance estimates from line-transect aerial surveys suggesting population stability over the last decade. These results will enable managers to evaluate the impact of fisheries-related takes and provide baseline demographic parameters for the IRL dolphin population which contends with anthropogenic impacts and repeated mortality events."

The research efficiency of a clinical specialty is influenced by factors such as the characteristics of the specialty, the organizational atmosphere, and the clinical director’s leadership. The present study aimed to describe the research efficiency of clinical specialties, explore the factors influencing it, and clarify the argument of co-evolution theory regarding the collaborative development of medical services, education, and research. Logistic regression and multiple linear regression were adopted to estimate the correlation between influencing factors and scientific research efficiency. Hospital H, which is representative of research hospitals in China, was taken as an example. Taking three efficiency values—comprehensive technical efficiency (CTE), pure technical efficiency (PTE), and scale efficiency (SE)—as dependent variables, the independent variables affecting research productivity were statistically analyzed. This study also examined the scientific research efficiency of 41 specialties between 2013 and 2017, and found that the independent variables affected CTE, PTE, and SE to various degrees. Collaborative innovation in medical education and research must be based on clinical research; how to balance medical and teaching quality, and research efficiency requires further discussion. While young people play a major role on the research team because of their creativity and initiatives, which improve CTE and PTE, high-level researchers with better research and leadership abilities lead to the rational allocation and effective utilization of resources, thus improving SE. In 2013–2017, discipline construction focused on scale expansion, resulting in the decline of SE in China. Therefore, this study suggests further improvements for the efficiency of clinical specialties in research hospitals."

Methods 34 fatty liver patients aged 30–45 with a body mass index (BMI) of 30–40 kg/m 2 were randomly assigned into two equally numbered groups. Group A received focused ultrasound cavitation and moderate aerobic exercise for three months, while Group B (control group) received moderate aerobic exercise only. Abdominal subcutaneous fat volume, visceral fat volume, liver-to-spleen ratio (L/S ratio), body weight, BMI, and waist circumference were measured both before and after the study period. Results Both groups showed significant improvements in subcutaneous fat volume, visceral fat volume, body weight, BMI, and waist circumference relative to baseline where (P &lt; 0 . 001) , with a higher percentage in group A. L/S ratio only showed a significant improvement in group A. Between-group differences were noteworthy regarding L/S ratio and waist circumference where (P &lt; 0 . 0001) . Conclusion While substantial risky measures in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have been modified by aerobic exercise, its combination with focused ultrasound cavitation causes more notable effects on the reduction of abdominal and intrahepatic fat, making it a superior option.

https://openalex.org/W3157755416,"Critical care medicine has been a field for Bayesian networks (BNs) application for investigating relationships among failing organs. Criticisms have been raised on using mortality as the only outcome to determine the treatment efficacy. We aimed to develop a dynamic BN model for detecting interrelationships among failing organs and their progression, not predefining outcomes and omitting hierarchization of organ interactions. We collected data from 850 critically ill patients from the national database used in many intensive care units. We considered as nodes the organ failure assessed by a score as recorded daily. We tested several possible DBNs and used the best bootstrapping results for calculating the strength of arcs and directions. The network structure was learned using a hill climbing method. The parameters of the local distributions were fitted with a maximum of the likelihood algorithm. The network that best satisfied the accuracy requirements included 15 nodes, corresponding to 5 variables measured at three times: ICU admission, second and seventh day of ICU stay. From our findings some organ associations had probabilities higher than 50% to arise at ICU admittance or in the following days persisting over time. Our study provided a network model predicting organ failure associations and their evolution over time. This approach has the potential advantage of detecting and comparing the effects of treatments on organ function."
https://openalex.org/W3157861462,"In this report, we extend our previous characterization of Dictyostelium discoideum glutathione S-transferase (DdGST) enzymes that are expressed in the eukaryotic model organism. Transcript profiling of gstA1-gstA5 (alpha class) genes in vegetative, log phase cells identified gstA2 and gstA3 with highest expression (6–7.5-fold, respectively) when compared to other gstA transcripts. Marked reductions in all gstA transcripts occurred under starvation conditions, with gstA2 and gstA3 exhibiting the largest decreases (-96% and -86.6%, respectively). When compared to their pre-starvation levels, there was also a 60 percent reduction in total GST activity. Glutathione (GSH) pull-down assay and mass spectroscopy detected three isozymes (DdGSTA1, DdGSTA2 and DdGSTA3) that were predominantly expressed in vegetative cells. Biochemical and kinetic comparisons between rDdGSTA2 and rDdGSTA3 shows higher activity of rDdGSTA2 to the CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) substrate. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous DdGSTA2 caused a 60 percent reduction in proliferation, delayed development, and altered morphogenesis of fruiting bodies, whereas overexpression of rDdGSTA2 enzyme had no effect. These findings corroborate previous studies that implicate a role for phase II GST enzymes in cell proliferation, homeostasis, and development in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W3158120456,"Public involvement is key to closing the gap between research production and research use, and the only way to achieving ultimate transparency in science. The majority of life science research is not public-facing, but is funded by the public and impacts communities. We undertook an exploratory survey of researchers within the life sciences to better understand their views and perceived challenges to involving the public in their research. As survey response rate could not be determined, interpretation of the results must be cautious. We had a valid response cohort of n = 110 researchers, of whom 90% were primarily laboratory based. Using a mixed methods approach, we demonstrate that a top-down approach is key to motivate progression of life scientists from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually engaging in it. Researchers who viewed public involvement as beneficial to their research were more likely to have direct experience of doing it. We demonstrate that the systemic flaws in the way life sciences research enterprise is organised, including the promotion system, hyper-competition, and time pressures are major barriers to involving the public in the scientific process. Scientists are also apprehensive of being involuntarily involved in the current politicized climate; misinformation and publicity hype surrounding science nowadays makes them hesitant to share their early and in-progress research. The time required to deliberate study design and relevance, plan and build relationships for sustained involvement, provide and undertake training, and improve communication in the current research environment is often considered nonpragmatic, particularly for early career researchers. In conclusion, a top-down approach involving institutional incentives and infrastructure appears most effective at transitioning researchers from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually implementing it."

Methods We selected 26,863 women newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2009 and 2018 from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service databases. During the total follow-up period and the first six months after initiation of primary treatments, incidence and risk of VTE were evaluated according to primary treatment as no treatment, surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Results The mean follow-up period was 1285.5±6 days. The VTE incidence was highest in women who underwent chemotherapy (306 per 10,000 women). Among women who underwent surgery, VTE was highest in surgery with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (536 per 10,000 women), followed by surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy (360 per 10,000 women) and surgery alone (132 per 10,000 women). During the first 12 months, monthly incidence of VTE decreased. Compared with women with no treatment, risk of VTE significantly increased in women undergoing chemotherapy (HR 1.297; 95% CI, 1.08–1.557; P = 0.005) during the total follow-up period and decreased in women undergoing surgery (HR 0.557; 95% CI, 0.401–0.775; P&lt;0.001) and radiotherapy (HR 0.289; 95% CI, 0.119–0.701; P = 0.006) during the first six months.

https://openalex.org/W3159757741,"Rocky Mountain elk ( Cervus canadensis ) populations have significant economic implications to the cattle industry, as they are a major reservoir for Brucella abortus in the Greater Yellowstone area. Vaccination attempts against intracellular bacterial diseases in elk populations have not been successful due to a negligible adaptive cellular immune response. A lack of genomic resources has impeded attempts to better understand why vaccination does not induce protective immunity. To overcome this limitation, PacBio, Illumina, and Hi-C sequencing with a total of 686-fold coverage was used to assemble the elk genome into 35 pseudomolecules. A robust gene annotation was generated resulting in 18,013 gene models and 33,422 mRNAs. The accuracy of the assembly was assessed using synteny to the red deer and cattle genomes identifying several chromosomal rearrangements, fusions and fissions. Because this genome assembly and annotation provide a foundation for genome-enabled exploration of Cervus species, we demonstrate its utility by exploring the conservation of immune system-related genes. We conclude by comparing cattle immune system-related genes to the elk genome, revealing eight putative gene losses in elk."
https://openalex.org/W3157074683,"Ever since the web began, the number of websites has been growing exponentially. These websites cover an ever-increasing range of online services that fill a variety of social and economic functions across a growing range of industries. Yet the networked nature of the web, combined with the economics of preferential attachment, increasing returns and global trade, suggest that over the long run a small number of competitive giants are likely to dominate each functional market segment, such as search, retail and social media. Here we perform a large scale longitudinal study to quantify the distribution of attention given in the online environment to competing organisations. In two large online social media datasets, containing more than 10 billion posts and spanning more than a decade, we tally the volume of external links posted towards the organisations’ main domain name as a proxy for the online attention they receive. We also use the Common Crawl dataset—which contains the linkage patterns between more than a billion different websites—to study the patterns of link concentration over the past three years across the entire web. Lastly, we showcase the linking between economic, financial and market data by exploring the relationships between online attention on social media and the growth in enterprise value in the electric carmaker Tesla. Our analysis shows that despite the fact that we observe consistent growth in all the macro indicators—the total amount of online attention, in the number of organisations with an online presence, and in the functions they perform—we also observe that a smaller number of organisations account for an ever-increasing proportion of total user attention, usually with one large player dominating each function. These results highlight how evolution of the online economy involves innovation, diversity, and then competitive dominance."

In this study, a highly charged membrane is hypothesized to form an ion depletion zone (IDZ) without an external power supply. The formation of IDZ was experimentally investigated using membranes with varying surface zeta potential (SZP) values to confirm the hypothesis. The surface zeta potential of the charged membrane was controlled by layer-by-layer deposition method. Our results indicate that indicated that the fluorescent intensity near the charged surface becomes weaker with an increased absolute magnitude of SZP. Ionic surfactants enhance the formation of IDZ by increasing SZP magnitude, and by forming a secondary filtration layer. These findings provide information that is helpful in understanding the ionic behavior near the highly charged surface. In addition, the information provided by the findings would be helpful in fabricating a small-scale water filtration device."
https://openalex.org/W3158067471,"This article examines the relationships between different dimensions of well-being and income inequalities across selected Central Eastern European countries after joining the European Union in 2004. Regarding the multivariety of well-being concept, it explores its 5 dimensions (material dimension, health dimension, education dimension, environmental dimension, happiness). Accounting for the interactions between dimensions of well-being matters for the inequalities, we conducted an in-depth analysis by adopting PMG estimation and panel ARDL model to assess the short-run and long-run links between variables. The results of conducted analysis allowed us to identify the canals through which income inequalities are linked directly or indirectly with the particular dimensions of well-being. In the long run, all the dimensions of well-being significantly affected income inequalities, and income inequality shaped material dimension, health, education, natural environment, and happiness. However, in the short run, the only dimension that shaped income inequalities was education. Income inequalities directly affected both health dimension and happiness."
https://openalex.org/W3159159105,"Micro-endomyocardial biopsy (micro-EMB) is a novel catheter-based biopsy technique, aiming to increase flexibility and safety compared to conventional EMB. The technique was developed and evaluated in healthy swine. Therefore, the ability to detect disease related tissue changes could not be evaluated. The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the ability to detect disease related gene expression changes using micro-EMB. Myocardial infarction was induced in three swine by coronary artery balloon occlusion. Micro-EMB samples (n = 164) were collected before, during, and after occlusion. RNA-sequencing was performed on 85 samples, and 53 of these were selected for bioinformatic analysis. A large number of responding genes was detected from the infarcted area (n = 1911). The early responding genes (n = 1268) were mostly related to apoptosis and inflammation. There were fewer responding genes two days after infarction (n = 6), which were related to extra-cellular matrix changes, and none after 14 days. In contrast to the infarcted area, samples harvested from a non-infarcted myocardial region showed considerably fewer regulated genes (n = 33). Deconvolution analysis, to estimate the proportion of different cell types, revealed a higher proportion of fibroblasts and a reduced proportion of cardiomyocytes two days after occlusion compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively. S5 File). In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates the capabilities of micro-EMB to detect local gene expression responses at an early stage after ischemia, but not at later timepoints."
https://openalex.org/W3157491428,"Global climate change increasingly contributes to large changes in ecosystem structure. Timely management of rapidly changing marine ecosystems must be matched with methods to rapidly quantify and assess climate driven impacts to ecological communities. Here we create a species-specific, classification system for fish thermal affinities, using three quantifiable datasets and expert opinion. Multiple sources of information limit potential data bias and avoid misclassification. Using a temperate kelp forest fish community in California, USA as a test case for this new methodology, we found the majority of species had high classification agreement across all four data sources (n = 78) but also a number of low agreement species (2 sources disagree from the others, n = 47). For species with low agreement, use of just one dataset to classify species, as is commonly done, would lead to high risk of misclassification. Differences in species classification between individual datasets and our composite classification were apparent. Applying different thermal classifications, lead to different conclusions when quantifying ‘warm’ and ‘cool’ species density responses to a marine heatwave. Managers can use this classification approach as a tool to generate accurate, timely and simple information for resource management."
https://openalex.org/W3157800743,"To prevent discrimination, the U.S. Navy enlisted-personnel promotion process relies primarily on objective measures. However, it also uses the subjective opinion of a sailor’s superior. The Navy’s promotion and retention process involves two successive decisions: The Navy decides whether to promote an individual, and conditional on that decision, the sailor decides whether to stay. Using estimates of these correlated decision-making processes, we find that during 1997–2008, Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be promoted than Whites, especially during wartime. The Navy’s decision-making affects Blacks’ differential promotion rates by twice as much as differences in the groups’ characteristics. However, Nonwhite retention probabilities, even when not promoted, are higher than for Whites, in part because they have fewer opportunities in the civilian market. Females have lower promotion rates than males and slightly lower retention rates during wartime."
