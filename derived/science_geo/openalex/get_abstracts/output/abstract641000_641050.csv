https://openalex.org/W2979751059,"Swim-up is a sperm purification method that is being used daily in andrology labs around the world as a simple step for in vitro sperm selection. This method accumulates the most motile sperm in the upper fraction and leaves sperm with low or no motility in the lower fraction. However, the underlying reasons are not fully understood. In this article, we compare metabolic rate, motility and sperm tail length of bovine sperm cells of the upper and lower fraction. The metabolic assay platform reveals oxygen consumption rates and extracellular acidification rates simultaneously and thereby delivers the metabolic rates in real time. Our study confirms that the upper fraction of bull sperm has not only improved motility compared to the cells in the lower fraction but also shows higher metabolic rates and longer flagella. This pattern was consistent across media of two different levels of viscosity. We conclude that the motility-based separation of the swim-up technique is also reflected in underlying metabolic differences. Metabolic assays could serve as additional or alternative, label-free method to evaluate sperm quality."
https://openalex.org/W2979526509,"Stock price prediction is a popular yet challenging task and deep learning provides the means to conduct the mining for the different patterns that trigger its dynamic movement. In this paper, the task is to predict the close price for 25 companies enlisted at the Bucharest Stock Exchange, from a novel data set introduced herein. Towards this scope, two traditional deep learning architectures are designed in comparison: a long short-memory network and a temporal convolutional neural model. Based on their predictions, a trading strategy, whose decision to buy or sell depends on two different thresholds, is proposed. A hill climbing approach selects the optimal values for these parameters. The prediction of the two deep learning representatives used in the subsequent trading strategy leads to distinct facets of gain."
https://openalex.org/W2979653315,"The Mediterranean sesame core collection contains agro-morphologically superior sesame accessions from geographically diverse regions in four continents. In the present investigation, the genetic diversity and population structure of this collection was analyzed with 5292 high-quality SNPs discovered by double-digest restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing, a cost-effective and flexible next-generation sequencing method. The genetic distance between pairs of accessions varied from 0.023 to 0.524. The gene diversity was higher in accessions from Asia than from America, Africa, and Europe. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between accessions collected from America and Europe. Structure analysis showed the presence of three subpopulations among the sesame accessions, and only six accessions were placed in an admixture group. Phylogenetic tree and principal coordinate analysis clustered the accessions based on their countries of origin. However, no clear division was evident among the sesame accessions with regard to their continental locations. This result was supported by an AMOVA analysis, which revealed a genetic variation among continental groups of 5.53% of the total variation. The large number of SNPs clearly indicated that the Mediterranean sesame core collection is a highly diverse genetic resource. The collection can be exploited by breeders to select appropriate accessions that will provide high genetic gain in sesame improvement programs. The high-quality SNP data generated here should also be used in genome-wide association studies to explore qualitative trait loci and SNPs related to economically and agronomically important traits in sesame."
https://openalex.org/W2979887392,"Guided by self-determination theory, we investigated the potential impact of work climate on employee motivation, and pro-environmental behavior (PEB) inside and outside of the workplace. We found that in workplaces with stronger pro-environmental climates and at least moderate levels of autonomy support, employees reported higher levels of autonomous motivation to engage in PEB. In turn, autonomously motivated employees engaged in more PEBs, both inside and outside the workplace. Controlled motivation played a more limited role in predicting employee PEBs. Overall, our findings suggest work climates that support pro-environmental actions and employee autonomy may not only foster PEBs within the workplace but also lay the foundation for PEBs in other non-workplace settings."
https://openalex.org/W2979704507,"Increased use of pesticide is causing detrimental effects on non-target species worldwide. In this study, we examined the lethal and sub-lethal effects of fipronil and imidacloprid, two commonly used insecticides, on juvenile brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus), one of the most commercially and ecologically important species in the United States. The effects of six concentrations of fipronil (0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 3.0 μg/L) and six concentrations of imidacloprid (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 15.0, 34.5, 320.0 μg/L) were tested in a laboratory. We examined five different endpoints: growth, moulting interval, survivorship, behavioral change, and body color change. Growth of shrimp was reduced significantly under higher concentrations of both insecticides. Under fipronil exposure, shrimp in control showed the shortest inter-moult interval (7.57 ± 2.17 day) compared with other treatments; similarly, in the imidacloprid experiment, moulting increased from 8.43 ± 2.52 day in control to 11.95 ± 4.9 day in 0.5 μg/L treatment. Higher concentrations of fipronil (1.0 and 3.0 μg/L) showed a 0.0% survival rate compared with 100% survival in the control and 0.005 μg/L treatment. Under imidacloprid, survivorship decreased from 100% in the control to 33.33% in the 320.0 μg/L treatment. The 96-h LC50 of fipronil was 0.12 μg/L, which makes brown shrimp one of the most sensitive invertebrates to the pesticide. Changes in behavior and body color were observed under both insecticides after different durations of exposures depending on concentrations. We conclude that, at the corresponding EPA benchmark concentrations, fipronil had more lethal effects than imidacloprid, and imidacloprid had more sub-lethal effects than fipronil. Both effects are of serious concern, and we suggest monitoring is necessary in estuaries."
https://openalex.org/W2980020392,"In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to study the effects of synbiotic supplementation on Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis (SE) proliferation, cecal content load, and broiler carcass contamination. Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici culture supernatants decreased (P < 0.05) the in vitro proliferation of SE at 1:1 supernatant: pathogen dilution. A total of 240 Cobb-500 broiler chicks were randomly allotted to three treatment groups (8 replicates/group with 10 birds/replicate): control (basal diet), antibiotic (Virginiamycin at 20 mg/kg feed), synbiotic (PoultryStar® ME at 0.5 g/kg feed containing L. reuteri, E. faecium, B. animalis, P. acidilactici and a Fructooligosaccharide) from day of hatch. At 21 d of age, all birds in experimental groups were orally inoculated with 250 μl of 1 X 109 CFU SE. Antibiotic supplementation increased (P < 0.05) body weight and feed consumption, compared to the control group. Birds in the synbiotic supplementation had intermediate body weight and feed consumption that were not significantly different from both the control and antibiotic group at 42 d of age in SE infected birds. No significant effects were observed in feed efficiency at 42 d of age among the groups. Antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) SE load in cecal contents by 0.90 and 0.85 log units/ g and carcass SE load by 1.4 and 1.5 log units/mL of rinsate compared to the control group at 42 d of age (21 dpi). The relative abundance of IL-10, IL-1, TLR-4, and IFNγ mRNA was decreased (P < 0.05) in the antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation groups compared to the control birds at 42 d of age (21 dpi). It can be concluded that synbiotic supplementation decreased SE proliferation in vitro and decreased SE load in the cecal contents and broiler carcass."
https://openalex.org/W2979565579,"Recent research shows that preschool children born to opioid-dependent mothers are at increased risk for cognitive, psychomotor, attention, and social-emotional adjustment problems. But very little is known about their school-age functioning, particularly their educational achievement. This analysis examined the educational outcomes of a regional cohort of 100 prenatally methadone-exposed children who were prospectively studied from birth to age 9.5 years alongside a comparison group of 110 randomly identified non-exposed children born between 2003 and 2008. At age 9.5, as part of a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation, children’s teachers rated their achievement across the school curriculum, and children completed the Woodcock Johnson-III Tests of Achievement (WJ-III). Detailed information about the birth mother’s social background, pregnancy substance use, and mental health was also collected during pregnancy/at term. Infant clinical data were collected after birth. Methadone-exposed children performed less well than non-exposed children across seven school curriculum areas rated by teachers (ps ≤.001), performed less well than non-exposed children on all reading and mathematics subtests of the WJ-III, and had higher rates of any educational delay on the WJ-III (57% vs. 15%), OR = 7.47 (3.71–15.02). Results were similar when children with severe intellectual impairment were excluded. After adjusting for confounding factors, methadone-exposed children had increased odds of educational delay, but this was only marginally significant (OR = 3.62, [1.01–13.01], p = .049). Maternal educational attainment level (OR = 0.69, [0.50–0.89], p = .006), and maternal benzodiazepine use during pregnancy (OR = 2.70 [1.03–7.12], p = .044) were also associated with later educational risk. Findings suggest that children born to opioid-dependent women enrolled in methadone maintenance are at high risk of educational delay by age 9.5 years. Children’s academic difficulties appeared to reflect the effects of both adverse prenatal exposures and postnatal social risk."
https://openalex.org/W2979792386,"Background Examining body mass index (BMI) change over life course is crucial for cardiovascular health promotion and prevention. So far, there is very few evidence on the long-term change of BMI from childhood to late life. This study aimed to examine the life-course trajectory patterns of BMI and then to link the trajectory patterns to cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood. Methods Based on longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, 5276 participants (aged 6–60) at baseline (in 1989) with up to 7 measurements of BMI during 1989–2009 were selected in this study. Cardiovascular risk factors including high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high blood lipids were assessed in 2411 participants in 2009. Latent growth curve modelling was used to analyse the BMI trajectories, and logistic regression was used to examine the associations between trajectory patterns and cardiovascular risk factors. Results Four trajectories patterns of BMI over life course (age 6–80) were identified: Normal-Stable (22.4% of the total participants), Low normal-Normal-Stable (44.1%), Low normal-Normal-Overweight (27.2%), and Overweight-Obese (4.3%). Compared to those with Normal-Stable pattern, those with Low normal-Normal-Stable pattern, Low normal-Normal-Overweight pattern and Overweight-Obese pattern had higher risk of high blood pressure (odds ratio range = 1.6–6.6), high blood glucose (1.7–9.1), dyslipidemia (2.6–5.9) and having at least two of the three cardiovascular risk factors (3.9–30.9). Conclusions Having a stable BMI within normal range over life course is associated with the lowest cardiovascular risk, whereas remaining overweight and obese over life course is associated with the highest cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W2979338857,"The aim of this study was to examine differences in perceived popularity and social preference of bullying roles and class norms. In total, 1,339 students (48% girls) participated: 674 primary school (M = 10.41 years, SD = 0.49) and 685 secondary school students (M = 12.67 years, SD = 0.80). Peer nominations and perceptions of class norms were collected. The results showed the highest perceived popularity among aggressors and defenders, except in anti-bullying primary school classes, where aggressors had low levels of popularity. In pro-bullying secondary school classes school, female victims had the lowest popularity levels. These findings suggest that class norms and personal variables as gender and school levels are important to understand bullying roles. Practical implications are discussed to guide teachers and practitioners according to the importance to adapt antibullying programs to the characteristics of the group in each school level and gender."
https://openalex.org/W2980258872,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance is essential for tracking the emergence and spread of AMR strains in local, national and international populations. This is crucial for developing or refining treatment guidelines. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) is beneficial for describing the molecular epidemiology of gonococci at national and international levels. Elucidation of AMR determinants to β-lactam drugs, is a means of monitoring the development of resistance. In Ghana, little is known about the current gonococcal AMR prevalence and no characterization of gonococcal isolates has been previously performed. In this study, gonococcal isolates (n = 44) collected from five health facilities in Ghana from 2012 to 2015, were examined using AMR testing, NG-MAST and sequencing of penA. High rates of resistance were identified to tetracycline (100%), benzylpenicillin (90.9%), and ciprofloxacin (81.8%). One isolate had a high cefixime MIC (0.75 μg/ml). Twenty-eight NG-MAST sequence types (STs) were identified, seventeen of which were novel. The isolate with the high cefixime MIC contained a mosaic penA-34 allele and belonged to NG-MAST ST1407, an internationally spreading multidrug-resistant clone that has accounted for most cefixime resistance in many countries. In conclusion, AMR testing, NG-MAST, and sequencing of the AMR determinant penA, revealed high rates of resistance to tetracycline, benzylpenicillin, and ciprofloxacin; as well as a highly diverse population of N. gonorrhoeae in Ghana. It is imperative to continue with enhanced AMR surveillance and to understand the molecular epidemiology of gonococcal strains circulating in Ghana and other African countries."
https://openalex.org/W2980261623,"Four fungi isolated from trunks and branches of European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) from commercial orchards in the Willamette Valley, Oregon were characterized and pathogenicity was tested on potted hazelnut trees. The acreage of hazelnuts in Oregon has expanded greatly in recent years in response to the availability of Eastern filbert blight resistant cultivars. Fungi were characterized using the BLASTn algorithm and the GenBank database with multiple partial gene sequence(s). If BLASTn and GenBank were not sufficient for species-level identification, then a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was performed. The four pathogens were identified as Diplodia mutilla (Fr.) Mont., Dothiorella omnivora B.T. Linaldeddu, A. Deidda & B. Scanu, Valsa cf. eucalypti Cooke & Harkn., and Diaporthe eres Nitschke. All pathogens but D. omnivora have not been previously reported from European hazelnut in the literature. All four pathogens caused lesions on trunks bare root hazelnut trees cv. 'Jefferson' planted in pots in the greenhouse and fungi were re-isolated from inoculated trees. D. mutilla appeared particularly aggressive in repeated inoculation experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2980224591,"Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) play critical roles in the G1 to S checkpoint of the cell cycle and have been shown to be overactive in several human cancers. Small-molecule inhibitors of CDK4/6 have demonstrated significant efficacy against many solid tumors. Since CDK4/6 inhibition is thought to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint, much interest has been focused on combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with cytotoxic agents active against the S or M phase of the cell cycle to enhance therapeutic efficacy. However, it remains unclear how best to combine these two classes of drugs to avoid their potentially antagonistic effects. Here, we test various combinations of highly selective and potent CDK4/6 inhibitors with commonly used cytotoxic drugs in several cancer cell lines derived from lung, breast and brain cancers, for their cell-killing effects as compared to monotherapy. All combinations, either concurrent or sequential, failed to enhance cell-killing effects. Importantly, in certain schedules, especially pre-treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, combining these drugs resulted in reduced cytotoxicity of cytotoxic agents. These findings urge cautions when combining these two classes of agents in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2979466054,"The fragmentation of habitats and hunting have impacted the Asian woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), leading to a serious risk of extinction in Thailand. Programs of active captive breeding, together with careful genetic monitoring, can play an important role in facilitating the creation of source populations with genetic variability to aid the recovery of endangered species. Here, the genetic diversity and population structure of 86 Asian woolly-necked storks from three captive breeding programs [Khao Kheow Open Zoo (KKOZ) comprising 68 individuals, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo (NRZ) comprising 16 individuals, and Dusit Zoo (DSZ) comprising 2 individuals] were analyzed using 13 microsatellite loci, to aid effective conservation management. Inbreeding and an extremely low effective population size (Ne) were found in the KKOZ population, suggesting that deleterious genetic issues had resulted from multiple generations held in captivity. By contrast, a recent demographic bottleneck was observed in the population at NRZ, where the ratio of Ne to abundance (N) was greater than 1. Clustering analysis also showed that one subdivision of the KKOZ population shared allelic variability with the NRZ population. This suggests that genetic drift, with a possible recent and mixed origin, occurred in the initial NRZ population, indicating historical transfer between captivities. These captive stork populations require improved genetic variability and a greater population size, which could be achieved by choosing low-related individuals for future transfers to increase the adaptive potential of reintroduced populations. Forward-in-time simulations such as those described herein constitute the first step in establishing an appropriate source population using a scientifically managed perspective for an in situ and ex situ conservation program in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W2979565009,"Background The function of the pelvic bones is to transfer load generated by body weight. Proper function of the pelvic bones can be disturbed by alignment changes that occur during pregnancy. Further, misalignment of the pelvic bones can lead to pain, urinary incontinence, and other complications. An understanding of the timing and nature of pelvic alignment changes during pregnancy may aid in preventing and treating these complications. Objective To investigate the changes in pelvic alignment during pregnancy and one month after childbirth. Methods This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Pelvic measurements were obtained for 201 women at 12, 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy, and 1 month after childbirth. The anterior and posterior width of the pelvis (the distance between the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines and the bilateral posterior superior iliac spines), the anterior pelvic tilt, and pelvic asymmetry (the mean left and right pelvic tilt degrees and the bilateral difference of the anterior pelvic tilt) were measured. For the change in pelvic alignment, a Friedman test was conducted to determine any significant difference in the measurements over time. Results The anterior and posterior width of the pelvis became significantly wider with pregnancy progress and the anterior width of the pelvis at 1 month after childbirth remained wider than that at 12 weeks of pregnancy (p < 0.001). The anterior pelvic tilt increased during pregnancy and decreased after childbirth (p < 0.05). Conclusion Some changes in pelvic alignment occur continuously during the perinatal period. Changes in the anterior width of the pelvis are not recovered at one month post-childbirth. Understanding these perinatal changes may help clinicians avert complications due to pelvic misalignment."
https://openalex.org/W2980104839,"Nurses encounter children who report of pain of diverse and unknown causes in their professional work. The current study therefore assessed and compared nursing students and nurses' knowledge and attitudes pertaining to children's pain in the Ghanaian context. The goal of this was to have a baseline information to guide the development and implementation of the content for a sustainable educational programme (short-course) for nursing students and nurses in Ghana.Between October and December 2018, a cross-sectional study was carried out among 554 final year nursing students and 65 nurses in Ghana. The Pediatric Nurses Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (PNKAS) was used to collect data from participants who were affiliated to four educational institutions and eight hospitals. Data were descriptively and inferentially analyzed using chi-square test of independence, independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).Our findings revealed that nursing students and nurses generally had unsatisfactory knowledge and attitudes towards pain management in children. Nursing students however, had significantly higher scores than nurses in the total PNKAS score and in 10 out of the 13 identified item-areas. Greater scores were obtained by nursing students in areas which were related to pain physiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology of analgesics and pain perceptions (p < .05). All the participating nurses could not accurately determine: the onset of action of orally administered analgesics, equianalgesia of orally administered morphine, and the right dosage of prescribed morphine for a child who consistently reported of moderate to severe pain.Final year nursing students and nurses have unsatisfactory knowledge and attitudes regarding children's pain; which reiterates the need for urgent and effective educational efforts in this area. Regular in-service training should be offered to post-registration nurses to enhance their pediatric pain knowledge and attitudes for improved pain care in children."
https://openalex.org/W2979332272,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is essential for DNA replication and repair, and cell growth and survival. Previously, we identified a novel class of small molecules that bind directly to PCNA, stabilize PCNA trimer structure, reduce chromatin-associated PCNA, selectively inhibit tumor cell growth, and induce apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the combinatorial effects of lead compound PCNA-I1S with DNA damaging agents on cell growth, DNA damage, and DNA repair in four lines of human prostate and lung cancer cells. The DNA damage agents used in the study include ionizing radiation source cesium-137 (Cs-137), chemotherapy drug cisplatin (cisPt), ultraviolet-C (UV-C), and oxidative compound H2O2. DNA damage was assessed using immunofluorescent staining of γH2AX and the Comet assay. The homologous recombination repair (HRR) was determined using a plasmid-based HRR reporter assay and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) was indirectly examined by the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). We found that PCNA-I1S inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and significantly enhanced the cell growth inhibition induced by pretreatment with DNA damaging agents Cs-137 irradiation, UV-C, and cisPt. However, the additive growth inhibitory effects were not observed in cells pre-treated with PCNA-I1S, followed by treatment with cisPt. H2O2 enhanced the level of chromatin-bound PCNA in quiescent cells, which was attenuated by PCNA-I1S. DNA damage was induced in cells treated with either PCNA-I1S or cisPt alone and was significantly elevated in cells exposed to the combination of PCNA-I1S and cisPt. Finally, PCNA-I1S attenuated repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by HRR and the removal of CPD by NER. These data suggest that targeting PCNA with PCNA-I1S may provide a novel approach for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treatment of human prostate and lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2980074976,"Pseudomonas syringae is a taxon of plant pathogenic bacteria that can colonize and proliferate within the interior space of leaf tissue. This process requires P. syringae to rapidly upregulate the production of virulence factors including a type III secretion system (T3SS) that suppress host defenses. GacS/A is a two-component system that regulates virulence of many plant and animal pathogenic bacteria including P. syringae. We recently investigated the virulence defect of strain AC811, a Tn5::gacA mutant of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that is less virulent on Arabidopsis. We discovered that decreased virulence of AC811 is not caused by loss of GacA function. Here, we report the molecular basis of the virulence defect of AC811. We show that AC811 possesses a nonsense mutation in anmK, a gene predicted to encode a 1,6-anhydromuramic acid kinase involved in cell wall recycling. Expression of a wild-type allele of anmK partially increased growth of AC811 in Arabidopsis leaves. In addition to the defective anmK allele, we also show that the Tn5 insertion in gacA exerts a polar effect on uvrC, a downstream gene encoding a regulator of DNA damage repair. Expression of the wild-type anmK allele together with increased expression of uvrC fully restored the virulence of AC811 during infection of Arabidopsis. These results demonstrate that defects in anmK and uvrC are together sufficient to account for the decreased virulence of AC811, and suggest caution is warranted in assigning phenotypes to GacA function based on insertional mutagenesis of the gacA-uvrC locus."
https://openalex.org/W2980163537,"Streptococcus suis is an important porcine bacterial pathogen and a zoonotic agent responsible for sudden death, septic shock and meningitis, of which serotype 2 is the most widespread, with serotype 14 also causing infections in humans in South-East Asia. Knowledge of its pathogenesis and virulence are almost exclusively based on these two serotypes. Though serotype 9 is responsible for the greatest number of porcine cases in Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, very little information is currently available regarding this serotype. Of the different virulence factors, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is required for S. suis virulence as it promotes resistance to phagocytosis and killing and masks surface components responsible for host cell activation. However, these roles have been described for serotypes 2 and 14, whose CPSs are structurally and compositionally similar, both containing sialic acid. Consequently, we evaluated herein the interactions of serotype 9 with host cells and the role of its CPS, which greatly differs from those of serotypes 2 and 14. Results demonstrated that serotype 9 adhesion to but not invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was greater than that of serotypes 2 and 14. Furthermore serotype 9 was more internalized by macrophages but equally resistant to whole blood killing. Though recognition of serotypes 2, 9 and 14 by DCs required MyD88-dependent signaling, in vitro pro-inflammatory mediator production induced by serotype 9 was much lower. In vivo, however, serotype 9 causes an exacerbated inflammatory response, which combined with persistent bacterial presence, is probably responsible for host death during the systemic infection. Though presence of the serotype 9 CPS masks surface components less efficiently than those of serotypes 2 and 14, the serotype 9 CPS remains critical for virulence as it is required for survival in blood and development of clinical disease, and this regardless of its unique composition and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2979598601,"We examined the influence of linear perspective cues and texture gradients in the perceptual rescaling of stimuli over a highly-salient Ponzo illusion of a corridor. We performed two experiments using the Method of Constant Stimuli where participants judged the size of one of two rings. In experiment 1, one ring was presented in the upper visual-field at the end of the corridor and the other in the lower visual-field at the front of the corridor. The perceived size of the top and bottom rings changed as a function of the availability of linear perspective and textures. In experiment 2, only one ring was presented either at the top or the bottom of the image. The perceived size of the top but not the bottom ring changed as a function of the availability of linear perspective and textures. In both experiments, the effects of the cues were additive. Perceptual rescaling was also stronger for the top compared to the bottom ring. Additional eye-tracking revealed that participants tended to gaze more in the upper than the lower visual-field. These findings indicate that top-down mechanisms provide an important contribution to the Ponzo illusion. Nonetheless, additional maximum likelihood estimation analyses revealed that linear perspective fulfilled a greater contribution in experiment 2, which is suggestive of a bottom-up mechanism. We conclude that both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms play important roles. However, the former seems to fulfil a more prominent role when both stimuli are presented in the image."
https://openalex.org/W2980052070,"Background Persons who inject drugs (PWID) have high HIV incidence and prevalence, and may have limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in some settings. We evaluated HIV drug resistance in PWID in a randomized clinical trial (HPTN 074). The study intervention included ART at any CD4 cell count with enhanced support for ART and substance use treatment. Methods HPTN 074 enrolled HIV-infected PWID (index participants) with viral loads ≥1,000 copies/mL and their HIV-uninfected injection-network partners in Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam; the study limited enrollment of people who reported being on ART. HIV drug resistance testing and antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed using samples collected from index participants at study enrollment. Results Fifty-four (12.0%) of 449 participants had HIV drug resistance; 29 (53.7%) of the 54 participants had multi-class resistance. Prevalence of resistance varied by study site and was associated with self-report of prior or current ART, detection of ARV drugs, and a history of incarceration. Resistance was detected in 10 (5.6%) of 177 newly diagnosed participants. Participants with resistance at enrollment were less likely to be virally suppressed after 52 weeks of follow-up, independent of study arm. Conclusions In HPTN 074, many of the enrolled index participants had HIV drug resistance and more than half of those had multi-class resistance. Some newly-diagnosed participants had resistance, suggesting that they may have been infected with drug-resistant HIV strains. Behavioral and geographic factors were associated with baseline resistance. Baseline resistance was associated with reduced viral suppression during study follow-up. These findings indicate the need for enhanced HIV care in this high-risk population to achieve sustained viral suppression on ART."
https://openalex.org/W2979560382,"Cetacean stranding records can provide vital information on species richness and diversity through space and time. Here we collate stranding records from Victoria, Australia and assess them for temporal, spatial and demographic trends. Between 1920 and 2016, 424 stranding events involving 907 individuals were recorded across 31 Cetacea species from seven families, including five new species records for the state. Seven of these events were mass strandings, and six mother and calf strandings were recorded. Importantly, 48% of the species recorded are recognised as data deficient on the IUCN Red List. The most commonly recorded taxa were Tursiops spp. (n = 146) and Delphinus delphis (common dolphins, n = 81), with the greatest taxonomic richness (n = 24) and highest incidence of stranding events documented within the Otways mesoscale bioregion. We found no seasonal stranding patterns anywhere in the state. While our findings improve understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of cetacean diversity within Victoria, we suggest greater effort to collect demographic data at stranding events in order to better study state-wide patterns through time. We conclude with guidelines for minimum data collection standards for future strandings to maximise information capture from each event."
https://openalex.org/W2979660240,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have commonly been used to identify candidate genes that control economically important traits in livestock. Our objective was to detect potential candidate genes associated mainly with muscle development traits related to dimension of hindquarter in cattle. A next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset to imputed to 12 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (from 1252 Simmental beef cattle) were used to search for genes affecting hindquarter traits using a linear, mixed model approach. We also used haplotype and linkage disequilibrium blocks to further support our identifications. We identified 202 significant SNPs in the bovine BTA4 chromosome region associated with width of hind leg, based on a stringent statistical threshold (p = 0.05/ effective number of SNPs identified). After exploring the region around these SNPs, we found candidate genes that were potentially related to the associated markers. More importantly, we identified a region of approximately 280 Kb on the BTA4 chromosome that harbored several muscle specific candidate genes, genes to be in a potential region for muscle development. However, we also found candidate gene SLC13A1 on BTA4, which seems to be associated with bone disorders (such as chondrodysplasia) in Simmental beef cattle."

We also aimed to investigate these immunological responses among SCD individuals according to their treatment (hydroxyurea (HU), chronic blood transfusions (CT), both HU and CT or none of them).Seventy-two SCD patients (49 receiving HU, 9 on CT, 7 with both and 7 without treatment) and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects received the tetravalent influenza α-RIX-Tetra® vaccine from the 2016-2017 or 2017-2018 season.Protective anti-influenza HAI titers were obtained for the majority of SCD patients one month after vaccination but seroconversion rates in patient groups were strongly decreased compared to controls. Immune cell counts, particularly cellular memory including memory T and memory B cells, were greatly reduced in SCD individuals. Functional activation assays confirmed a poorer CD8+ T cell memory. We also document an imbalance of cytokines after influenza vaccination in SCD individuals with an INFγ/IL-10 ratio (Th1-type/Treg-type response) significantly lower in the SCD cohort.SCD patients undergoing CT showed altered immune regulation as compared to other treatment subgroups. Altogether, the cytokine imbalance, the high regulatory T cell levels and the low memory lymphocyte subset levels observed in the SCD cohort, namely for those on CT, suggest a poor ability of SCD patients to fight against influenza infection. Nevertheless, our serological data support current clinical practice for annual influenza vaccination, though immunogenicity to other vaccines involving immunological memory might be hampered in SCD patients and should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2979481789,"Background Pancreatic islets are heavily vascularized in vivo yet lose this vasculature after only a few days in culture. Determining how to maintain islet vascularity in culture could lead to better outcomes in transplanting this tissue for the treatment of type 1 diabetes as well as provide insight into the complex communication between beta-cells and endothelial cells (ECs). We previously showed that islet ECs die in part due to limited diffusion of serum albumin into the tissue. We now aim to determine the impact of hypoxia on islet vascularization. Methods We induced hypoxia in cultured mouse islets using the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride (100 μM CoCl2). We measured the impact on islet metabolism (two-photon NAD(P)H and Rh123 imaging) and function (insulin secretion and survival). We also measured the impact on hypoxia related transcripts (HIF-1α, VEGF-A, PDK-1, LDHA, COX4) and confirmed increased VEGF-A expression and secretion. Finally, we measured the vascularization of islets in static and flowing culture using PECAM-1 immunofluorescence. Results CoCl2 did not induce significant changes in beta cell metabolism (NAD(P)H and Rh123), insulin secretion, and survival. Consistent with hypoxia induction, CoCl2 stimulated HIF-1α, PDK-1, and LDHA transcripts and also stimulated VEGF expression and secretion. We observed a modest switch to the less oxidative isoform of COX4 (isoform 1 to 2) and this switch was noted in the glucose-stimulated cytoplasmic NAD(P)H responses. EC morphology and survival were greater in CoCl2 treated islets compared to exogenous VEGF-A in both static (dish) and microfluidic flow culture. Conclusions Hypoxia induction using CoCl2 had a positive effect on islet EC morphology and survival with limited impact on beta-cell metabolism, function, and survival. The EC response appears to be due to endogenous production and secretion of angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF-A), and mechanistically independent from survival induced by serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W2979306211,"Grafting has been widely applied to melon (Cucumis melo L.) production to alleviate obstacles of continuous cropping and control soil-borne diseases. However, grafting often leads to a decline of fruit quality. For example, sometimes bitter fruits are produced on grafted plants. However, the underlying physiological mechanism still remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different rootstocks on the taste of fruits of the Balengcui, an oriental melon cultivar, during summer production. The results showed that all grafted plants with Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks produced bitter fruits, while non-grafted plants and plants grafted onto muskmelon rootstocks produced no bitter fruits. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and metabonomic analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism underlying the occurrence of bitter fruits. Metabolite comparisons of fruits from plants grafted onto Ribenxuesong rootstocks both with non-grafted plants and plants grafted onto muskmelon rootstocks showed that 17 metabolites including phospholipids, cucurbitacins and flavonoids, exhibited changes. The three Cucurbitacins, Cucurbitacin O, Cucurbitacin C, and Cucurbitacin S, increased dramatically. The 10 phospholipids PS(18:1(9Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)), PS(P-18:0/15:0), PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)), PE(16:0/18:0), PS(O-16:0/17:2(9Z,12Z)), PI(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), PA(15:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PS(P-16:0/17:2(9Z,12Z)), PS(22:0/22:1(11Z)), and PA(17:1(9Z)/0:0)) were significantly decreased, while two PA (16:0/18:2 (9Z, 12Z) and 16:0/18:1 (11Z)), two flavonoids (pelargonidin 3-(6''-malonylglucoside)-5-glucoside and malvidin 3-rutinoside) significantly increased in fruits of plants grafted onto Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks. These metabolites were involved in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, the mevalonate pathway, and the phenylpropanoid pathway. In summary, these results showed that the bitter fruits of grafted Balengcui were caused by Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks. Phospholipids, cucurbitacins, and flavonoids were the key contributors for the occurrence of bitter fruits in Balengcui melon after grafting onto Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W2979328694,"Background Episodic memory impairments have been described as initial clinical findings in the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) spectrum, which could be associated with the presence of early hippocampal dysfunction. However, correlates between performances in neuropsychological tests and hippocampal volumes in AD were inconclusive in the literature. Divergent methods to assess episodic memory have been depicted as a major source of heterogeneity across studies. Methods We examined correlates among performances in three different delayed-recall tasks (Rey-Auditory Verbal-Learning Test–RAVLT, Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale) and fully-automated volumetric measurements of the hippocampus (estimated using Neuroquant®) of 83 older subjects (47 controls, 27 Mild Cognitive Impairment individuals and 9 participants with Dementia due to AD). Results Inter-method correlations of episodic memory performances were at most moderate. Scores in the RAVLT predicted up to 48% of variance in HOC (Hippocampal Occupancy Score) among subjects in the AD spectrum. Discussion Tests using different stimuli (verbal or visual) and presenting distinct designs (word list, story or figure learning) may assess divergent aspects in episodic memory, with heterogeneous anatomical correlates. Conclusions Different episodic memory tests might not assess the same construct and should not be used interchangeably. Scores in RAVLT may correlate with the presence of neurodegeneration in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2979380128,"The mammalian embryo displays sexual dimorphism in the preimplantation period. Moreover, competence of the embryo to develop is dependent on the sire from which the embryo is derived and can be modified by embryokines produced by the endometrium such as colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2). The preimplantation period is characterized by large changes in epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. It is possible, therefore, that effects of sex, sire, and embryo regulatory molecules are mediated by changes in epigenetic modifications. Here it was tested whether global levels of two histone modifications in the trophectoderm of the bovine blastocyst were affected by sex, sire, and CSF2. It was found that amounts of immunolabeled H3K27me3 were greater (P = 0.030) for male embryos than female embryos. Additionally, labeling for H3K27me3 and H3K18ac depended upon the bull from which embryos were derived. Although CSF2 reduced the proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst, there was no effect of CSF2 on labeling for H3K27me3 or H3K18ac. Results indicate that the blastocyst trophoctoderm can be modified epigenetically by embryo sex and paternal inheritance through alterations in histone epigenetic marks."
https://openalex.org/W2979385747,"Two recent reports suggested that the less common, less virulent enterococcal species, Enterococcus gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, with low-level vancomycin resistance due to chromosomally encoded vanC1 and vanC2/3, may influence host immunity. We reported that peri-transplant gut colonization with E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus is associated with lower mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Because most acute leukemia patients undergoing HCT have received intensive chemotherapy (usually requiring prolonged hospitalization) for their underlying disease before HCT, we hypothesized that some may have acquired vanC-positive enterococci during chemotherapy. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of the vanC gene cluster using vanC1 and vanC2/3 qPCR in thrice-weekly collected stool samples from 20 acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. We found that an unexpectedly large proportion of patients have detectable vanC1 and vanC2/3 (15% and 35%, respectively) in at least one stool sample. Comparing qPCR results with 16S rRNA gene sequencing results suggested that E. gallinarum may reach high abundances, potentially persisting into HCT and influencing transplant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2980036568,An extended-wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (EWDRS) technique was evaluated for its ability to differentiate between and classify different skin and tissue types in an in vivo pig model.EWDRS recordings (450-1550 nm) were made on skin with different degrees of pigmentation as well as on the pig snout and tongue. The recordings were used to train a support vector machine to identify and classify the different skin and tissue types.The resulting EWDRS curves for each skin and tissue type had a unique profile. The support vector machine was able to classify each skin and tissue type with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. The sensitivity and specificity were between 96.4 and 100.0% for all skin and tissue types.EWDRS can be used in vivo to differentiate between different skin and tissue types with good accuracy. Further development of the technique may potentially lead to a novel diagnostic tool for e.g. non-invasive tumor margin delineation.
https://openalex.org/W2979381409,"The aim of our study was to compare early and long-term outcome of patients undergoing either on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with special focus on impairment of renal function. Five hundred ninety-three consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were retrospectively analyzed. They were assigned either to on-pump (n = 281) or to off-pump (n = 312) group. Early and long-term outcomes were analyzed with special focus on renal function. Basic demographics and preoperative characteristics did not differ between groups (p>0.05) as well as postoperative renal parameters (p>0.05). Postoperative odds ratios (OR) of off-pump group in comparison to on-pump group were higher without reaching significance in terms of incidence of gastrointestinal complications and pneumonia (OR = 2.23 and 1.61, respectively) as well as hazard ratios (HR) on long-term follow-up for mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction (HR = 1.50 and 2.29, respectively). Kaplan-Meier estimation analysis also revealed similar results for both groups in terms of mid- and long-term survival (Breslow p = 0.062 and Log-Rank p = 0.064, respectively) and for incidence of myocardial infarction (Breslow p = 0.102 and Log-Rank p = 0.103, respectively). Our study suggests that use or not use of coronary artery bypass did not influence postoperative renal function. Odds of early outcomes were similar in both groups as well as incidence of myocardial infarction and mortality in long-term follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2979767035,"Many in vivo studies suggest that inhalational anesthetics can accelerate or prevent the progression of neuropathology and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer Disease (AD), but the synaptic mechanisms mediating these ambiguous effects are unclear. Here, we show that repeated exposures of neonatal and old triple transgenic AD (3xTg) and non-transgenic (NonTg) mice to isoflurane (Iso) distinctly increased neurodegeneration as measured by S100β levels, intracellular Aβ, Tau oligomerization, and apoptotic markers. Spatial cognition measured by reference and working memory testing in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) were altered in young NonTg and 3xTg. Field recordings in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus showed that neonatal control 3xTg mice exhibited hypo-excitable synaptic transmission, reduced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and normal long-term potentiation (LTP) compared to NonTg controls. By contrast, the old control 3xTg mice exhibited hyper-excitable synaptic transmission, enhanced PPF, and unstable LTP compared to NonTg controls. Repeated Iso exposures reduced synaptic transmission and PPF in neonatal NonTg and old 3xTg mice. LTP was normalized in old 3xTg mice, but reduced in neonates. By contrast, LTP was reduced in old but not neonatal NonTg mice. Our results indicate that Iso-mediated neuropathologic and cognitive defects in AD mice are associated with synaptic pathologies in an age-dependent manner. Based on these findings, the extent of this association with age and, possibly, treatment paradigms warrant further study."
https://openalex.org/W2979550328,"Blood stream infections rank among the top seven causes of death of the general population. The aim of our study was to better understand the epidemiology of BSI in order to improve diagnostics and patient outcome. We used retrospective aggregated laboratory data of blood samples received from all public hospitals in Tyrol, Austria between 2006 and 2015. Microorganisms were categorized into obligatory, facultative, unusual pathogens and contaminants. The distribution, the cumulative incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were compared between the tertiary (TH) and regional peripheral hospitals (PH). Among 256,364 blood samples, 76.1% were from the TH The incidence of obligatory pathogens was 1.7 fold, and up to 3 times higher for facultative, unusual pathogens and contaminants in the TH and increased mainly due to an increase of E.coli, which was the most common isolated pathogen (n = 2,869), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1,439), Enterococcus sp. (n = 953) and Klebsiella sp. (n = 816). The distribution of obligatory pathogens differed between the hospital settings: In the TH Enterococcus sp. accounted for 40.8% and E.coli for 70.4%, respectively, whereas in the PH for 25.4% (p<0.0001) and 57.8%, respectively (p<0.0001) Antibiotic resistance of Gram negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus did not change during the observation period. Carbapenem resistance of Klebsiella sp. and vancomycin and linezolid resistance of Enterococcus faecium showed a non-significant increase since 2010 in the TH setting. We concluded that the incidence of BSI in TH was higher compared to PH. We observed higher contamination rates in the TH. We could not interpret the data of coagulase negative staphylococci due to lack of clinical data. We strongly recommend enhancement of training on blood culture sampling to decrease the rate of contamination. Due to differences in pathogen distribution and antimicrobial resistance between different hospital settings we recommend separate treatment guidelines for BSI by hospital setting."
https://openalex.org/W2979908051,"Videolaryngoscopy (VL) as a new airway management technique has evolved in recent decades, and a large number of videolaryngoscopes are now available on the market. Most recent major guidelines already recommend the immediate availability and use of VL in difficult airway management scenarios. However, national data on the availability of VL, introduction into practice and patterns of use are rarely published. Therefore, the current study aimed to provide data on VL in Hungary.An electronic survey was designed and popularized with the help of the Hungarian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy to explore the availability, use, and practice of and attitudes toward VL among Hungarian anesthesiologists. The survey was conducted between 01.01.2018 and 31.12.2018.In total, 324 duly completed forms were returned and analyzed. Responders were mainly males (58%), specialists (80%) and those involved mainly in anesthesia practice (68%) in the public sector. Two hundred and ten (65%) responders had access to various videolaryngoscopes and were mainly from surgery, intensive care and traumatology units. No responders reported the availability of eight videolaryngoscopes out of the eighteen listed devices, and 32% of the responders had never used any videolaryngoscope in clinical settings. The most commonly available devices were KingVision, MacGrath Mac and Airtraq. Most of the responders reported using videolaryngoscopes mainly for difficult airway management and reported using a fiberscope as the first alternative device. Popular methods for selecting videolaryngoscopes included the following: short clinical trial (n = 67/324), decision of the departmental lead (n = 65/324) and price (n = 54/324). The majority of responders had some training prior to clinical application, but training was mainly voluntary. Overall, 98% of the responders considered videolaryngoscopes beneficial.Approximately two-thirds of Hungarian anesthesiologists have immediate access to videolaryngoscopes, which are used mainly for difficult airway management. The overall attitude towards VL is positive, and many videolaryngoscopes are known and have been used by Hungarian anesthesiologists. However, only a few devices on the market are used commonly. Based on the results, further improvement might be recommended regarding VL training and availability."
https://openalex.org/W2980121200,"The developmental speed of new antimicrobials does not meet the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria sufficiently. A potential shortcut is assessing the antimicrobial activity of already approved drugs. Intrudingly, the antibacterial action of glatiramer acetate (GA) has recently been discovered. GA is a well-known and safe immunomodulatory drug particular effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which disrupts biological membranes by resembling the activity of antimicrobial peptides. Thus, GA can potentially be included in treatment strategies used to combat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives. One potential application is chronic respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however the safety of GA inhalation has never been assessed. Here, the safety of inhaling nebulized GA is evaluated in a preclinical pig model. The potential side effects, i.e., bronchoconstriction, respiratory tract symptoms and systemic- and local inflammation were assessed by ventilator monitoring, clinical observation, biochemistry, flowcytometry, and histopathology. No signs of bronchoconstriction assessed by increased airway peak pressure, Ppeak, or decreased oxygen pressure were observed. Also, there were no signs of local inflammation in the final histopathology examination of the pulmonary tissue. As we did not observe any potential pulmonary side effects of inhaled GA, our preliminary results suggest that GA inhalation is safe and potentially can be a part of the treatment strategy targeting chronic lung infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2980263499,"The warming trend in the Arctic region is expected to cause drastic changes including permafrost degradation and vegetation shifts. We investigated the spatial distribution of ice content and stable isotopic compositions of water in near-surface permafrost down to a depth of 1 m in the Indigirka River lowlands of northeastern Siberia to examine how the permafrost conditions control vegetation and microtopography in the Taiga–Tundra boundary ecosystem. The gravimetric water content (GWC) in the frozen soil layer was significantly higher at microtopographically high elevations with growing larch trees (i.e., tree mounds) than at low elevations with wetland vegetation (i.e., wet areas). The observed ground ice (ice-rich layer) with a high GWC in the tree mounds suggests that the relatively elevated microtopography of the land surface, which was formed by frost heave, strongly affects the survival of larch trees. The isotopic composition of the ground ice indicated that equilibrium isotopic fractionation occurred during ice segregation at the tree mounds, which implies that the ice formed with sufficient time for the migration of unfrozen soil water to the freezing front. In contrast, the isotopic data for the wet areas indicated that rapid freezing occurred under relatively non-equilibrium conditions, implying that there was insufficient time for ice segregation to occur. The freezing rate of the tree mounds was slower than that of the wet areas due to the difference of such as soil moisture and snow cover depends on vegetation and microtopography. These results indicate that future changes in snow cover, soil moisture, and organic layer, which control underground thermal conductivity, will have significant impacts on the freezing environment of the ground ice at the Taiga–Tundra boundary in northeastern Siberia. Such changes in the freezing environment will then affect vegetation due to changes in the microtopography of the ground surface."
https://openalex.org/W2979451608,"In the pig, intrauterine competition (IUC) greatly affects postnatal traits, such as birth weight, but also locomotor capacities. In a previous study, our group discovered a lower motor performance in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets), compared to piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets). In order to explain the force deficit causing this reduced motor performance, in a subsequent study, we investigated whether this deficit in L piglets was caused by a lower force generating capacity (FGC) of the extensors of the hind limb and/or a lower number of type II (fast-twitch) fibers in m. vastus lateralis. L piglets had a lower absolute FGC, but surprisingly, a higher relative FGC (to birth weight) in the hind limb, compared to N piglets. In addition, we found no differences in fiber composition of m. vastus lateralis. In the present study, we assessed whether this higher relative FGC is a common feature for front and hind limb locomotor muscles of L piglets. To that end, the physiological cross-sectional area of the main extensor muscles of the front limb was calculated from their volume and fiber length, in order to calculate both the absolute and the relative FGC. By immunohistochemical staining of m. triceps brachii caput longum, the percentage of type II (fast-contracting) fibers could be determined. Similar to the results of the hind limb, we found a smaller absolute FGC, but a larger relative FGC in the front limb of L piglets, compared to N piglets. In addition, m. triceps brachii caput longum did not have a different muscle fiber composition in L and N piglets. As such, we can conclude that IUC affects the locomotor muscles in the front and hind limb in a similar way and that the observed force deficit in L piglets cannot be explained by a different force generating capacity or a lower percentage of type II muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2979507385,"We use agent-based computer simulation to test the effect of environmental conditions (available biomass/carrying capacity and environmental risk) on the development of wealth inequality and patron-client herding networks in nomadic pastoral economies. Our results show that 1) wealth inequality reaches very high levels when carrying capacity is high and risk is low, and 2) patron-client contract herding networks increase in size and duration when carrying capacity is high and risk is low. We compare empirical data from the Mongol (1206-1368 CE) and Xiongnu (209 BCE- 48 CE) empires with simulation results to develop an explanatory mechanism for the apparent correlation between nomadic empire creation and positive environmental conditions. We argue that the internal dynamics of nomadic pastoral societies are sufficient to produce high degrees of inequality and hierarchical herding networks. Nomadic empires are more likely to form during key periods of increased biomass and decreased environmental risk."
https://openalex.org/W2979582275,"Breaks filled with different break activities often interrupt cognitive performance in everyday life. Previous studies have reported that both enhancing and deteriorating effects on challenging ongoing tasks such as working memory updating, depend on the type of break activity. However, neural mechanisms of these break-related alterations in working memory performance have not been studied, to date. Therefore, we conducted a brain imaging study to identify the neurobiological correlates of effects on the n-back working memory task related to different break activities. Before performing the n-back task in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, young adults were exposed to break activities in the MRI scanner involving (i) eyes-open resting, (ii) listening to music, and (iii) playing the video game “Angry Birds”. Heart rate was measured by a pulse oximeter during the experiment. We found that increased heart rate during gaming as well as decreased relaxation levels after a video gaming break was related to poorer n-back task performance, as compared to listening to music. On the neural level, video gaming reduced supplementary motor area activation during working memory performance. These results may indicate that video gaming during a break may affect working memory performance by interfering with arousal state and frontal cognitive control functions."
https://openalex.org/W2979731447,"Objective Analyze if in utero exposure to economic downturns is associated with worsened birth outcomes. Methods We used birth records from all live singleton births in the 27 Brazilian state capitals between October 2012 and December 2016 (n = 2,952,430) and linked them to local unemployment rates according to the mother’s residence. We estimated the association between different birth outcomes and the local unemployment rate in the three trimesters before birth. We included maternal characteristics and month, year and municipality fixed effects as covariates. We also estimated the association for different groups of mothers, based on marital status, educational level, age and race. Results A 1 p.p. increase in the local unemployment rate in the trimester before birth is associated with 2.68% higher odds of being born with very low birthweight (< 1500 grams) (OR: 1.0268, 95% CI: 1.0006–1.0536). That result is pushed by the effect among newborns from mothers younger than 24 (OR: 1.0684, 95%CI: 1.0353–1.1024), from mothers with 11 years of schooling or less (OR: 1.0477, 95% CI: 1.0245–1.0714), and from brown or black mothers (OR: 1.0387, 95%CI: 1.0156–1.0624). The associations among children born from younger, less educated and black or brown mothers are robust to the application of a procedure to control for multiple testing, albeit the results considering the whole sample are not. Conclusions Our study shows that there is an association between in utero exposure to higher unemployment rates during the last gestational trimester and the odds of being born with VLBW among children born from mothers younger than 24 years old, with less of 11 years of education and black or brown. These results suggest that children born from women of low socioeconomic status are more vulnerable to in utero exposure to economic downturns."

The comparison between these two runs revealed higher activity for lipreading-only in the SMA and the left IFG.The presence of a visual reference during a lipreading task leads to a decrease in activity in frontal areas."
https://openalex.org/W2979382883,"Objectives Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection, which can potentially develop into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Healthcare systems are struggling to finance costly direct-acting antiviral agents through public funding for uninsured patients, despite the unprecedented high cure rates of these agents. Vulnerable populations are at higher risk of HCV infection. The personal importation scheme is based on the legal right to import any unauthorized generics for personal use. This study was designed to assess the knowledge and perceptions of stakeholders on unauthorized generics. Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey based on the fictitious situation of a patient diagnosed with HCV who lacked mandatory health insurance and personal financial resources. Results We obtained a sample of 781 respondents: 445 physicians, 77 pharmacists, 51 patients and 207 non-healthcare professionals. We found that only 36% and 58% of respondents believe that the quality and efficacy, respectively, of unauthorized generics are equivalent to their corresponding brand. An overwhelming majority (98%) favoured quality control upon arrival, and 31% felt they could recognize fraudulent websites. A total of 79% expressed support for financial assistance for vulnerable patients, and support among physicians was 83%. Conclusions Overall, the limited knowledge of the efficacy and quality of unauthorized generics, despite evidence in peer-reviewed literature, contrasts with the overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward financial assistance for personal import. This finding emphasizes the need for clearer information on imported generics and the potential safety provided by buyers’ club schemes to complete the WHO agenda of eradicating viral hepatitis by 2030 within otherwise excluded vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W2979950578,"Objectives To investigate effects of postural changes and bladder distention on intrabladder pressure whilst estimating intra-abdominal pressure in horses. Design Two-year cohort study. Patients admitted for elective surgical procedures unrelated to gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Setting School of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil. Animals 20 adult horses, 11 males (stallions and geldings) and 9 females; between 3.5 and 12 years, weighing 350 to 500 kg. Interventions Intra-abdominal pressure was directly-recorded through abdominocentesis at the ventral midline with a fluid-filled system. Intrabladder pressure was obtained from a bladder catheter with the fluid-filled system zeroed at the level of the tuber ischia with patients in dorsal recumbency or pubic symphysis if in lateral recumbency. Measurements and main results Body position directly influenced intra-abdominal pressure. In dorsal recumbency, intra-abdominal pressure differed (p < 0.05) from intrabladder pressure at end-inspiration and end-expiration regardless of whether the bladder was empty or distended. There was no correlation nor association between the two pressures in this body position. In lateral recumbency a difference (p <0.05) between intra-abdominal pressure and intrabladder pressure was recorded at end-inspiration with the bladder distended with 25 ml, and at end-expiration for distension volumes of 25 ml and 50 ml. There was a strong correlation between both pressures for left and right lateral recumbency, regardless of the distension volume. Ordinary least product (OLP) regression analysis showed no fixed or proportional bias between both pressures for distension volume of 50 ml, at both end-inspiration and end-expiration. Conclusions Indirect assessment of equine intra-abdominal pressure cannot be made in dorsal recumbency. For that purpose, patients should be in left lateral recumbency with the bladder distended with 50 ml. Values can be recorded at end-inspiration or end-expiration. Restriction Occlusion of the catheter tip by the bladder wall when minimally distended."
https://openalex.org/W2979507946,"A definitive endodermal cell lineage is a prerequisite for the efficient generation of mature endoderm derivatives that give rise to organs, such as the pancreas and liver. We previously reported that the induction of mesenchymal definitive endoderm cells depends on autocrine TGF-β signaling and that pharmacological blockage of TGF-β signaling by Repsox disrupts endoderm specification. The definitive endoderm arises from a primitive streak, which depends largely on TGF-β signaling. If the TGF-β pathway is blocked by Repsox, cell fate after the primitive streak induction is so-far unknown. We report here, that an induced primitive streak cell-population contained many T/SOX2 co-expressing cells, and subsequent inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Repsox promoted neuroectodermal cell fate, which was characterized using single-cell qPCR analysis and immunostaining. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is inherent to the process of definitive endoderm differentiation, was also disrupted upon Repsox treatment. Our findings may provide a new approach to produce neural progenitors."

The CANF seismic broad-band station, part of the Geodyn facility in the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc (LSC), is located in an underground tunnel in the Central Pyrenees, at about 400 m of the Aragón River channel, hence providing an excellent opportunity to explore the possibilities of the seismic monitoring of hydrological events at long term scale. We focus here on the identification and analysis of seismic signals generated by variations in river discharge due to snow melting during a period of six years (2011–2016). During snowmelt episodes, the temporal variations of the discharge at the drainage river result in seismic signals with specific characteristics allowing their discrimination from other sources of background vibrations. We have developed a methodology that use seismic data to monitor the time occurrence and properties of the thawing stages. The proposed method is based on the use of hierarchical clustering techniques to classify the daily seismic spectra according to their similarity. This allows us to discriminate up to four different types of episodes, evidencing changes in the duration and intensity of the melting process which in turn depends on variations in the meteorological and hydrological conditions. The analysis of six years of continuous seismic data from this innovative procedure shows that seismic data can be used to monitor snowmelt on long-term time scale and hence contribute to climate change studies."

Serine protease inhibitors have been described in many species, as well as in plants, including cowpea beans (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp). Here, we purified and characterized a protease inhibitor, named VuEI (Vigna unguiculata elastase inhibitor), from Vigna unguiculata, with inhibitory activity against HNE (human neutrophil elastase) and chymotrypsin but has no inhibitory activity against trypsin and thrombin. VuEI was obtained by alkaline protein extraction followed by three different chromatographic steps in sequence. First, an ion exchange chromatography using Hitrap Q column was employed, followed by two reversed-phase chromatography using Source15RPC and ACE18 columns. The molecular mass of VuEI was estimated in 10.99 kDa by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The dissociation constant (Ki) to HNE was 9 pM. These data indicate that VuEI is a potent inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase, besides to inhibit chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W2979734092,"The Escherichia coli's membrane protein OmpA has been identified as a potential biosurfactant due to their amphiphilic nature, and their capacity to stabilize emulsions of dodecane in water. In this study, the influence of surfactant type, concentration, preservation time and droplet size on the crystallization of n-dodecane and water, in oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with six rationally designed Escherichia coli's OmpA-based peptides was investigated. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) protocol was established using emulsions stabilized with Tween 20® and Tween 80®. A relationship between the surfactant concentration and the crystallization temperatures of n-dodecane and water was observed, where the crystallization temperatures seem to be dependent on the preservation time. A deconvolution analysis shows that the peak morphology possibly depends on the interactions at the interface because the enthalpic contributions of each Gaussian peak remained similar in emulsions stabilized with the same peptide. Adsorption results show that the main driver for adsorption and thus stabilization of emulsions is polar interactions (e.g. H-bonding) through the hydrophilic parts of the peptides. Those peptides with a preponderance of polar interaction groups distribution (i.e. NH2, COOH, imidazole) showed the highest interfacial activity under favorable pH conditions. This suggests that custom-made peptides whose hydrophilic/hydrophobic regions can be fine-tuned depending on the application can be easily produced with the additional advantage of their biodegradable nature."
https://openalex.org/W2979952244,"While wetlands are usually used as a natural approach to remove biodegradable pollutants in surface water, their purification efficiencies coupled with their aesthetic features are of less concern. The water quality, plant landscape, acoustic environment and odour indicators were investigated in the surface water inlet and outlet of the Fujin National Wetland Park (FNWP), restored from farmlands in Northeast China. Major concentrations of pollutants in the inlet and the outlet subjected to surface flow wetland treatment were monitored, and the removal efficiencies were calculated based on 54 water samples (6 sites×3 seasons×3 replicates). The results showed that the total nitrogen (TN) and organic carbon in surface water decreased significantly after the wetland treatment, while the total phosphorus (TP) did not decrease significantly. The removal efficiencies for TN and BOD5 changed seasonally and reached 69.08% and 60.44%, respectively. An ecological aesthetic index (EAI) was developed based on the trophic state index coupled with plant landscape, acoustic and odour indicators, and the calculated EAI showed that the outlet delivered a more aesthetically harmonious appearance than the inlet in spring and autumn, but not in summer. Based on the current aquatic macrophyte species and documented purification efficiencies in FNWP, we recommend an improved ecological aesthetic management approach that utilizes and arranges diverse native plants from the surrounding wetlands (e.g. Scirpus validus) in addition to local Nelumbo nucifera, Nymphaea tetragona and Myriophyllum spicatum, and conserves the indicative and endangered species (Aldrovanda vesiculosa), from the visual appeal of the waterscape."
https://openalex.org/W2980005942,"Biological, ecological, social, and technological systems are complex structures with multiple interacting parts, often represented by networks. Correlation matrices describing interdependency of the variables in such structures provide key information for comparison and classification of such systems. Classification based on correlation matrices could supplement or improve classification based on variable values, since the former reveals similarities in system structures, while the latter relies on the similarities in system states. Importantly, this approach of clustering correlation matrices is different from clustering elements of the correlation matrices, because our goal is to compare and cluster multiple networks-not the nodes within the networks. A novel approach for clustering correlation matrices, named ""snakes-&-dragons,"" is introduced and illustrated by examples from neuroscience, human microbiome, and macroeconomics."
https://openalex.org/W2980089434,"Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease of global importance. It is widespread and endemic practically all over the world, with infection prevalence varying by geographic location. The parasite and the disease are neglected, which is illustrated by the lack of baseline information on the prevalence from many regions. Developed, peaceful regions are in better situation to address toxoplasmosis, while the neglected status is particularly pronounced in regions with other challenges. Due to the lack of baseline data, these regions are rarely mentioned in discussions about the neglected status of the disease. A dramatic manifestation of toxoplasmosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, is the dreaded outcome of vertical transmission of the infection from the mother to the unborn child. For this reason, pregnant women are a key target group for primary prevention of T. gondii infections, and baseline data on the prevalence in pregnant women is important. In this cross-sectional seroepidemiological study, we estimated Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence and evaluated possible risk factors for seropositivity in pregnant women in Kabul, Afghanistan. Altogether 207 of the 431 women included in the study tested positive for immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii, yielding an apparent seroprevalence estimate of 48.03% (95% CI 43.33-52.75). Based on the final multivariable model for T. gondii seropositivity, non-concrete floor in the house and well or river as water source were identified as risk factors for seropositivity, while residence in rural area was a protective factor. The majority of the participants (72.9%) reported that they did not know about T. gondii. Our study is the first to report an estimate of T. gondii seroprevalence in pregnant women in Afghanistan. The high seroprevalence indicates substantial infection pressure, and the results of the risk factor analysis suggest that the environmental route, infection from oocysts, might be the most relevant to address to prevent the infections in the region. Our results contribute to the global discussion on neglected status of toxoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W3000435778,"Cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to evaluate the opportunity cost of health care investments. However, few functions that take equity concerns into account are available for such CEA methods, and these concerns are therefore at risk of being disregarded. Among the functions that have been developed, most focus on the distribution of health gains, as opposed to the distribution of lifetime health. This is despite the fact that there are good reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with a low quality adjusted life expectancy from birth (QALE). Also, an even distribution of health gains may imply an uneven distribution of lifetime health.We develop a systematic and explicit approach that allows for the inclusion of lifetime health concerns in CEAs, by creating a new priority weight function, PW = α+(t-γ)·C·e-β·(t-γ), where t is the health measure. PW has several desirable properties. First, it is continuous and smooth, ensuring that people with similar health characteristics are treated alike. For example, those who achieve 50 QALE should be treated similarly to those who achieve 49.9 QALE. Second, it is flexible regarding shape and outcome measure (i.e., caters to other measures than QALE), so that a broad range of values may be modelled. Third, the coefficients have distinct roles. This allows for the easy manipulation of the PW's shape. In order to demonstrate how PW may be applied, we use data from a previous study and estimated the coefficients of PW based on two approaches.Equity concerns are important when conducting CEAs, which means that suitable PWs should be developed. We do not intend to determine which PW is the most appropriate, but to illustrate how a flexible general PW can be estimated based on empirical data."
