https://openalex.org/W3164573547,"Abstract Fast and reliable detection of patients with severe and heterogeneous illnesses is a major goal of precision medicine 1,2 . Patients with leukaemia can be identified using machine learning on the basis of their blood transcriptomes 3 . However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed, because of privacy legislation 4,5 . Here, to facilitate the integration of any medical data from any data owner worldwide without violating privacy laws, we introduce Swarm Learning—a decentralized machine-learning approach that unites edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination while maintaining confidentiality without the need for a central coordinator, thereby going beyond federated learning. To illustrate the feasibility of using Swarm Learning to develop disease classifiers using distributed data, we chose four use cases of heterogeneous diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, leukaemia and lung pathologies). With more than 16,400 blood transcriptomes derived from 127 clinical studies with non-uniform distributions of cases and controls and substantial study biases, as well as more than 95,000 chest X-ray images, we show that Swarm Learning classifiers outperform those developed at individual sites. In addition, Swarm Learning completely fulfils local confidentiality regulations by design. We believe that this approach will notably accelerate the introduction of precision medicine."

It is also ultimately key to social interactions8, innovation9,10 and productivity11. However, our quantitative understanding of the aggregate movements of individuals remains incomplete. Existing models-such as the gravity law12,13 or the radiation model14-concentrate on the purely spatial dependence of mobility flows and do not capture the varying frequencies of recurrent visits to the same locations. Here we reveal a simple and robust scaling law that captures the temporal and spatial spectrum of population movement on the basis of large-scale mobility data from diverse cities around the globe. According to this law, the number of visitors to any location decreases as the inverse square of the product of their visiting frequency and travel distance. We further show that the spatio-temporal flows to different locations give rise to prominent spatial clusters with an area distribution that follows Zipf's law15. Finally, we build an individual mobility model based on exploration and preferential return to provide a mechanistic explanation for the discovered scaling law and the emerging spatial structure. Our findings corroborate long-standing conjectures in human geography (such as central place theory16 and Weber's theory of emergent optimality10) and allow for predictions of recurrent flows, providing a basis for applications in urban planning, traffic engineering and the mitigation of epidemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3165228583,"Atomically defined assemblies of dye molecules (such as H and J aggregates) have been of interest for more than 80 years because of the emergence of collective phenomena in their optical spectra1–3, their coherent long-range energy transport, their conceptual similarity to natural light-harvesting complexes4,5, and their potential use as light sources and in photovoltaics. Another way of creating versatile and controlled aggregates that exhibit collective phenomena involves the organization of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals into long-range-ordered superlattices6. Caesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals7–9 are promising building blocks for such superlattices, owing to the high oscillator strength of bright triplet excitons10, slow dephasing (coherence times of up to 80 picoseconds) and minimal inhomogeneous broadening of emission lines11,12. So far, only single-component superlattices with simple cubic packing have been devised from these nanocrystals13. Here we present perovskite-type (ABO3) binary and ternary nanocrystal superlattices, created via the shape-directed co-assembly of steric-stabilized, highly luminescent cubic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (which occupy the B and/or O lattice sites), spherical Fe3O4 or NaGdF4 nanocrystals (A sites) and truncated-cuboid PbS nanocrystals (B sites). These ABO3 superlattices, as well as the binary NaCl and AlB2 superlattice structures that we demonstrate, exhibit a high degree of orientational ordering of the CsPbBr3 nanocubes. They also exhibit superfluorescence—a collective emission that results in a burst of photons with ultrafast radiative decay (22 picoseconds) that could be tailored for use in ultrabright (quantum) light sources. Our work paves the way for further exploration of complex, ordered and functionally useful perovskite mesostructures. Through precise structural engineering, perovskite nanocrystals are co-assembled with other nanocrystal materials to form a range of binary and ternary perovskite-type superlattices that exhibit superfluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W3164737459,"Long-term subcellular intravital imaging in mammals is vital to study diverse intercellular behaviors and organelle functions during native physiological processes. However, optical heterogeneity, tissue opacity, and phototoxicity pose great challenges. Here, we propose a computational imaging framework, termed digital adaptive optics scanning light-field mutual iterative tomography (DAOSLIMIT), featuring high-speed, high-resolution 3D imaging, tiled wavefront correction, and low phototoxicity with a compact system. By tomographic imaging of the entire volume simultaneously, we obtained volumetric imaging across 225 × 225 × 16 μm3, with a resolution of up to 220 nm laterally and 400 nm axially, at the millisecond scale, over hundreds of thousands of time points. To establish the capabilities, we investigated large-scale cell migration and neural activities in different species and observed various subcellular dynamics in mammals during neutrophil migration and tumor cell circulation."
https://openalex.org/W3164136038,"Neurons have recently emerged as essential cellular constituents of the tumour microenvironment, and their activity has been shown to increase the growth of a diverse number of solid tumours1. Although the role of neurons in tumour progression has previously been demonstrated2, the importance of neuronal activity to tumour initiation is less clear-particularly in the setting of cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen per cent of individuals with the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome (in which tumours arise in close association with nerves) develop low-grade neoplasms of the optic pathway (known as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)) during early childhood3,4, raising the possibility that postnatal light-induced activity of the optic nerve drives tumour initiation. Here we use an authenticated mouse model of OPG driven by mutations in the neurofibromatosis 1 tumour suppressor gene (Nf1)5 to demonstrate that stimulation of optic nerve activity increases optic glioma growth, and that decreasing visual experience via light deprivation prevents tumour formation and maintenance. We show that the initiation of Nf1-driven OPGs (Nf1-OPGs) depends on visual experience during a developmental period in which Nf1-mutant mice are susceptible to tumorigenesis. Germline Nf1 mutation in retinal neurons results in aberrantly increased shedding of neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) within the optic nerve in response to retinal neuronal activity. Moreover, genetic Nlgn3 loss or pharmacological inhibition of NLGN3 shedding blocks the formation and progression of Nf1-OPGs. Collectively, our studies establish an obligate role for neuronal activity in the development of some types of brain tumours, elucidate a therapeutic strategy to reduce OPG incidence or mitigate tumour progression, and underscore the role of Nf1mutation-mediated dysregulation of neuronal signalling pathways in mouse models of the NF1 cancer predisposition syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W3164758721,"Abstract Patients with cancer are currently prioritized in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs globally, which includes administration of mRNA vaccines. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has not been reported with mRNA vaccines and is an extremely rare immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We present a case of CRS that occurred 5 d after vaccination with BTN162b2 (tozinameran)—the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine—in a patient with colorectal cancer on long-standing anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The CRS was evidenced by raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, elevated cytokine levels (IFN-γ/IL-2R/IL-18/IL-16/IL-10) and steroid responsiveness. The close temporal association of vaccination and diagnosis of CRS in this case suggests that CRS was a vaccine-related adverse event; with anti-PD1 blockade as a potential contributor. Overall, further prospective pharmacovigillence data are needed in patients with cancer, but the benefit–risk profile remains strongly in favor of COVID-19 vaccination in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3165739961,"Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a central paradigm for understanding how membraneless organelles compartmentalize diverse cellular activities in eukaryotes1–3. Here we identify a superfamily of plant guanylate-binding protein (GBP)-like GTPases (GBPLs) that assemble LLPS-driven condensates within the nucleus to protect against infection and autoimmunity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two members of this family—GBPL1 and GBPL3—undergo phase-transition behaviour to control transcriptional responses as part of an allosteric switch that is triggered by exposure to biotic stress. GBPL1, a pseudo-GTPase, sequesters catalytically active GBPL3 under basal conditions but is displaced by GBPL3 LLPS when it enters the nucleus following immune cues to drive the formation of unique membraneless organelles termed GBPL defence-activated condensates (GDACs) that we visualized by in situ cryo-electron tomography. Within these mesoscale GDAC structures, native GBPL3 directly bound defence-gene promoters and recruited specific transcriptional coactivators of the Mediator complex and RNA polymerase II machinery to massively reprogram host gene expression for disease resistance. Together, our study identifies a GBPL circuit that reinforces the biological importance of phase-separated condensates, in this case, as indispensable players in plant defence. A family of plant guanylate-binding protein-like GTPases controls phase separation and assembly of condensates, thereby forming a circuit that regulates transcriptional responses to biotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W3165502800,"Topological-associated domains (TADs) are thought to be relatively stable across cell types, although some TAD reorganization has been observed during cellular differentiation. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which TAD reorganization affects cell fate or how master transcription factors affect TAD structures during cell fate transitions. Here, we show extensive TAD reorganization during somatic cell reprogramming, which is correlated with gene transcription and changes in cellular identity. Manipulating TAD reorganization promotes reprogramming, and the dynamics of concentrated chromatin loops in OCT4 phase separated condensates contribute to TAD reorganization. Disrupting OCT4 phase separation attenuates TAD reorganization and reprogramming, which can be rescued by fusing an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to OCT4. We developed an approach termed TAD reorganization-based multiomics analysis (TADMAN), which identified reprogramming regulators. Together, these findings elucidate a role and mechanism of TAD reorganization, regulated by OCT4 phase separation, in cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W3164945187,"Adaptive behaviour necessitates the formation of memories for fearful events, but also that these memories can be extinguished. Effective extinction prevents excessive and persistent reactions to perceived threat, as can occur in anxiety and ‘trauma- and stressor-related’ disorders1. However, although there is evidence that fear learning and extinction are mediated by distinct neural circuits, the nature of the interaction between these circuits remains poorly understood2–6. Here, through a combination of in vivo calcium imaging, functional manipulations, and slice physiology, we show that distinct inhibitory clusters of intercalated neurons (ITCs) in the mouse amygdala exert diametrically opposed roles during the acquisition and retrieval of fear extinction memory. Furthermore, we find that the ITC clusters antagonize one another through mutual synaptic inhibition and differentially access functionally distinct cortical- and midbrain-projecting amygdala output pathways. Our findings show that the balance of activity between ITC clusters represents a unique regulatory motif that orchestrates a distributed neural circuitry, which in turn regulates the switch between high- and low-fear states. These findings suggest that the ITCs have a broader role in a range of amygdala functions and associated brain states that underpins the capacity to adapt to salient environmental demands. Distinct clusters of inhibitory neurons in the mouse amygdala perform opposing roles in fear extinction."
https://openalex.org/W3164304713,"Van der Waals heterostructures display numerous unique electronic properties. Nonlocal measurements, wherein a voltage is measured at contacts placed far away from the expected classical flow of charge carriers, have been widely used in the search for novel transport mechanisms, including dissipationless spin and valley transport1–9, topological charge-neutral currents10–12, hydrodynamic flows13 and helical edge modes14–16. Monolayer1–5,10,15–19, bilayer9,11,14,20 and few-layer21 graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides6,7 and moiré superlattices8,10,12 have been found to display pronounced nonlocal effects. However, the origin of these effects is hotly debated3,11,17,22–24. Graphene, in particular, exhibits giant nonlocality at charge neutrality1,15–19, a striking behaviour that has attracted competing explanations. Using a superconducting quantum interference device on a tip (SQUID-on-tip) for nanoscale thermal and scanning gate imaging25, here we demonstrate that the commonly occurring charge accumulation at graphene edges23,26–31 leads to giant nonlocality, producing narrow conductive channels that support long-range currents. Unexpectedly, although the edge conductance has little effect on the current flow in zero magnetic field, it leads to field-induced decoupling between edge and bulk transport at moderate fields. The resulting giant nonlocality at charge neutrality and away from it produces exotic flow patterns that are sensitive to edge disorder, in which charges can flow against the global electric field. The observed one-dimensional edge transport is generic and nontopological and is expected to support nonlocal transport in many electronic systems, offering insight into the numerous controversies and linking them to long-range guided electronic states at system edges. Nanoscale imaging of edge currents in charge-neutral graphene shows that charge accumulation can explain various exotic nonlocal transport measurements, bringing into question some theories about their origins."
https://openalex.org/W3164851792,"Objectives Diagnostics are essential for controlling the pandemic. Identifying a reliable and fast diagnostic device is needed for effective testing. We assessed performance and ease-of-use of the Abbott PanBio antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT). Methods This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study enrolled at two sites in Germany. Following routine testing with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a second study-exclusive swab was performed for Ag-RDT testing. Routine swabs were nasopharyngeal (NP) or combined NP/oropharyngeal (OP) whereas the study-exclusive swabs were NP. To evaluate performance, sensitivity and specificity were assessed overall and in predefined sub-analyses accordingly to cycle-threshold values, days after symptom onset, disease severity and study site. Additionally, an ease-of-use assessment (EoU) and System Usability Scale (SUS) were performed. Results 1108 participants were enrolled between Sept 28 and Oct 30, 2020. Of these, 106 (9.6%) were PCR-positive. The Abbott PanBio detected 92/106 PCR-positive participants with a sensitivity of 86.8% (95% CI: 79.0% - 92.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.4%-100%). The sub-analyses indicated that sensitivity was 95.8% in Ct-values &lt;25 and within the first seven days from symptom onset. The test was characterized as easy to use (SUS: 86/100) and considered suitable for point-of-care settings. Conclusion The Abbott PanBio Ag-RDT performs well for SARS-CoV-2 testing in this large manufacturer independent study, confirming its WHO recommendation for Emergency Use in settings with limited resources."
https://openalex.org/W3164988570,"Myocardial infarction is a major cause of premature death in adults. Compromised cardiac function after myocardial infarction leads to chronic heart failure with systemic health complications and a high mortality rate1. Effective therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the recovery of cardiac function after myocardial infarction. More specifically, there is a major unmet need for a new class of drugs that can improve cardiomyocyte contractility, because inotropic therapies that are currently available have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with systolic heart failure2,3 or have shown a very modest reduction of risk of heart failure4. Microtubule detyrosination is emerging as an important mechanism for the regulation of cardiomyocyte contractility5. Here we show that deficiency of microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) substantially limits the reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction in mice, without affecting infarct size or cardiac remodelling. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that MARK4 regulates cardiomyocyte contractility by promoting phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), which facilitates the access of vasohibin 2 (VASH2)—a tubulin carboxypeptidase—to microtubules for the detyrosination of α-tubulin. Our results show how the detyrosination of microtubules in cardiomyocytes is finely tuned by MARK4 to regulate cardiac inotropy, and identify MARK4 as a promising therapeutic target for improving cardiac function after myocardial infarction. MARK4 regulates cardiomyocyte contractility by promoting MAP4 phosphorylation, which facilitates the access of VASH2 to microtubules for the detyrosination of α-tubulin; MARK4 deficiency after acute myocardial infarction limits the reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction."
https://openalex.org/W3165493869,"Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause infectious diseases, including African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in humans and nagana in economically important livestock1,2. An effective vaccine against trypanosomes would be an important control tool, but the parasite has evolved sophisticated immunoprotective mechanisms—including antigenic variation3—that present an apparently insurmountable barrier to vaccination. Here we show, using a systematic genome-led vaccinology approach and a mouse model of Trypanosoma vivax infection4, that protective invariant subunit vaccine antigens can be identified. Vaccination with a single recombinant protein comprising the extracellular region of a conserved cell-surface protein that is localized to the flagellum membrane (which we term ‘invariant flagellum antigen from T. vivax’) induced long-lasting protection. Immunity was passively transferred with immune serum, and recombinant monoclonal antibodies to this protein could induce sterile protection and revealed several mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity, including a major role for complement. Our discovery identifies a vaccine candidate for an important parasitic disease that has constrained socioeconomic development in countries in sub-Saharan Africa5, and provides evidence that highly protective vaccines against trypanosome infections can be achieved. Systemic genome-led vaccinology and a mouse model of Trypanosoma vivax infection identify protective invariant subunit vaccine antigens, and demonstrate the possibility of generating effective vaccines that induce long-lasting protection against trypanosome infections."

Considering their very different cellular properties, it seems likely that L1 IN subtypes exert rather different circuit functions; hence, subtype-specific approaches are required to unambiguously determine their function in the cortex. However, the lack of selective genetic access to either of these L1 IN subtypes has precluded assessing their role in sensory processing. Here, we combine our recently established subtype-specific genetic tools and approaches with in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging, pupillometry, viral tracing, electrophysiology ex vivo and in vivo, chemogenetics, and optogenetics to investigate the role of L1 NDNF INs in the processing of visual information in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We find that L1 NDNF INs respond to visual stimuli in a unique manner compared with other types of cortical neurons and that their sensory-evoked responses are strongly enhanced when an animal is aroused. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that visual cortex L1 NDNF INs receive long-range inputs from many distal brain regions that can convey sensory-evoked and/or state-dependent information. Probing the downstream effects of L1 NDNF INs, we find that these neurons gain-modulate the activity and sensory-evoked responses of local excitatory neurons selectively during high-arousal states and improve their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). L1 NDNF INs do so by conveying direct, long-lasting inhibition to excitatory neurons across all cortical layers and by concomitantly disinhibiting them via direct inhibition of fast-spiking (FS) INs that express Parvalbumin (PV INs). Because L1 NDNF INs target primarily the apical dendrites of cortical excitatory neurons, while PV INs specialize in targeting their somata, and because active NDNF INs are evenly spread across L1, our findings indicate that the behavioral state-dependent activation of L1 NDNF INs leads in local excitatory neurons to a relative shift of inhibition from the soma toward the apical dendrites and that this, in turn, enhances the stimulus-evoked responses in excitatory neurons across whole cortical columns and improves the SNR in these neurons. To study NDNF INs in the visual cortex, we first validated that they are concentrated in L1 in this region of the neocortex (Figure S1), similar to what we and others have reported for the auditory (AUD), somatosensory (SS), and prefrontal cortex (Abs et al., 2018Abs E.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we find that NDNF INs are indeed highly concentrated in L1 of the visual cortex, where they comprise about two-thirds (67.3%) of all GABAergic INs in L1 and express the same subtypes markers as in other cortical areas (including those markers found in NGFCs, e.g., Reln, Npy, and Nos; Cadwell et al., 2016Cadwell C.R. Palasantza A. Jiang X. Berens P. Deng Q. Yilmaz M. Reimer J. Shen S. Bethge M. Tolias K.F. et al.Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed the visual response properties of L1 NDNF INs in the mouse V1 and compared them with those of somatostatin-expressing INs (SST INs), an IN subtype that also specializes in targeting the apical dendrites of local excitatory neurons (Tremblay et al., 2016Tremblay R. Lee S. Rudy B. GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex: from cellular properties to circuits.Neuron. 2016; 91: 260-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and with those of excitatory neurons in L2/3 of the cortex. To this end, we expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in the respective neuronal subtype in V1 (i.e., in L1 NDNF INs, in SST INs, or in L2/3 excitatory neurons) via intracortical injections of adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs and performed in vivo 2P imaging in awake head-fixed mice that were presented with drifting gratings at various directions, contrasts, stimulus sizes, and spatial frequencies, thereby respectively testing orientation tuning, contrast sensitivity, size selectivity, and visual acuity (i.e., spatial frequency) (Figure 1). These experiments revealed that 56.6% of the recorded L1 NDNF INs respond significantly to visual stimuli and that they are strongly orientation tuned (89% of all visually responsive L1 NDNF INs) (Figures 1B, 1C, and S2A). The responses of L1 NDNF INs are not strongly affected by the spatial frequency of the gratings presented to the mice, but they do exhibit a preference for low spatial frequency (Figure 1F; p = 1.6109e–05, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). Similarly, increases in the size of the visual stimulus only moderately enhance the responses of L1 NDNF INs (i.e., their responses plateau before the maximal stimulus size; Figure 1E), consistent with the idea that L1 NDNF INs convey a certain degree of surround suppression (Fan et al., 2020Fan L.Z. Kheifets S. Böhm U.L. Wu H. Piatkevich K.D. Xie M.E. Parot V. Ha Y. Evans K.E. Boyden E.S. et al.All-Optical Electrophysiology Reveals the Role of Lateral Inhibition in Sensory Processing in Cortical Layer 1.Cell. 2020; 180: 521-535.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the visually evoked responses of L1 NDNF INs are, at the population level, only weakly affected by the contrast of the visual stimuli (Figure 1D): although the responses of individual L1 NDNF INs are contrast dependent, a similar percentage of L1 NDNF INs maximally respond at each contrast level, and thus, a similar number of L1 NDNF INs respond to visual inputs regardless of stimulus contrast (Figure 1D, inset). These response properties of L1 NDNF INs clearly differ from those of SST INs: SST INs are less orientation tuned than L1 NDNF INs (Figures 1C and S2; median global orientation selectivity index (gOSI) of SST INs = 0.305 versus median gOSI of L1 NDNF INs = 0.624, p = 9.56e–10, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA), but their responses directly scale with the contrast (Figure 1D) and the size (Figure 1E) of the visual stimulus. The response properties of L1 NDNF INs also differ from those of L2/3 excitatory neurons: while both types of neurons are strongly orientation tuned (Figures 1C and S2; median gOSI of L2/3 excitatory neurons = 0.683, p = 0.898, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA), the responses of L2/3 excitatory neurons are, unlike those of L1 NDNF INs, suppressed at large stimulus size (Figure 1E) and enhanced as the contrast of the stimulus increases (Figure 1D). Taken together, these experiments reveal that L1 NDNF INs in the visual cortex have cell-type-specific responses to visual stimuli (i.e., to bottom-up inputs) that clearly differ from the response properties of other types of neurons in V1: while L1 NDNF INs are strongly orientation tuned, their visually evoked responses remain, on the population level, relatively constant across varying levels of stimulus contrast and are only moderately enhanced upon increases in the size of the stimulus. The relatively subtle effects of the stimulus’ contrast on the visually evoked responses of L1 NDNF INs are very different from those of SST INs and L2/3 excitatory neurons in which the extent of the visually evoked responses increases with the strength of the visual stimuli presented. L1 is thought to be a key site for the behavioral state-dependent regulation of the activity and sensory-evoked responses of cortical neurons. Thus, we next examined the extent to which the activity of L1 NDNF INs is affected by brain state and compared this with the state-dependent modulation of SST INs and L2/3 excitatory neurons. For this, we measured the relation between the spontaneous (i.e., ongoing) or visually evoked activity of the respective neuronal subtypes in V1 to the size of the animal’s pupil, as pupillometry provides a robust indication of a mouse’s arousal state (McGinley et al., 2015McGinley M.J.

Arousal and locomotion make distinct contributions to cortical activity patterns and visual encoding.Neuron. 2015; 86: 740-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). This analysis revealed that the spontaneous activity of L1 NDNF INs is strongly correlated with pupil diameter (mean correlation = 0.2813, p = 1.58e–18, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, shuffle pairs versus true pairs; Figure 2A) and that this correlation is higher in L1 NDNF INs than in SST INs (0.158, p = 0.0005, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA) or in L2/3 excitatory (0.035, p = 9.56e–10, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). Further analysis of the spontaneous activity of L1 NDNF INs reveals that these neurons tend to be co-active (i.e., their spontaneous activity is correlated with each other) (Figures S2B and S2C); this correlated activity of L1 NDNF INs does not depend on their physical distance from each other (Figure S2D), but co-active L1 NDNF INs tend to be evenly spaced from each other (mean distance of 220.3 ± 1.5 μm between co-active NDNF INs in L1, similar to the radius of the their axonal arbor; Jiang et al., 2015Jiang X. Shen S. Cadwell C.R. Berens P. Sinz F. Ecker A.S. Patel S. Tolias A.S. Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex.Science. 2015; 350: aac9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar; Schuman et al., 2019Schuman B. Machold R.P. Hashikawa Y. Fuzik J. Fishell G.J. Rudy B. Four unique interneuron populations reside in neocortical layer 1.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Figure S2E). Consistent with the notion that the activity of L1 NDNF INs increases as the animal becomes more alert, we find that in anesthetized mice, only 42% of L1 NDNF INs are active (Figure S2F). When we then analyzed the state dependency of the evoked responses of L1 NDNF INs, we found that the amplitude of their responses strongly scales with pupil diameter (Figure 2B), indicating that L1 NDNF INs respond to the same visual stimulus much stronger when the animal is alert. Although a positive correlation between the strength of the visually evoked responses and the animal’s arousal state is observed also in SST INs and L2/3 excitatory neurons (Figure 2B), this state-dependent modulation is much stronger in L1 NDNF INs. Thus, taken together, we conclude that the visually evoked responses of L1 NDNF INs are only weakly affected by the strength of visual stimulation (e.g., by stimulus contrast or size; Figures 1D and 1E) but are strongly tuned to an animal’s behavioral state. Having established that L1 NDNF INs in the visual cortex respond to visual inputs and that their activity is strongly modulated by an animal’s arousal state, we next tested whether these neurons receive synaptic inputs from relevant brain areas, i.e., brain areas that can convey bottom-up visual information and/or top-down state-dependent or contextual information. To this end, we performed rabies virus-based retrograde monosynaptic tracing (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J.O. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.-K. Young J.A.T. Callaway E.M. Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), with L1 NDNF INs in the visual cortex as starter cells. Having validated that the starter cells are indeed localized in L1 of the visual cortex (Figure 3A, inset), we prepared serial sections of the brains of the injected mice and quantified the amount of labeled (i.e., monosynaptically connected) neurons in each brain region (n = 12,832 neurons from five mice; Figure 3B). We find that L1 NDNF INs indeed receive direct inputs from brain regions that convey bottom-up visual inputs, including the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLG) in the thalamus. Similarly, we find that visual cortex L1 NDNF INs receive extensive inputs from many brain regions that can convey top-down information, including from other primary cortices (e.g., from the AUD, SS, and motor [MO] cortices), association cortices (e.g., from the retrosplenial [RSP] cortex and from the anterior cingulate area [ACA] in the prefrontal cortex), and higher-order thalamic nuclei (e.g., from the lateral posterior nucleus [LP] in the thalamus). In addition, we identify direct inputs from several hypothalamic nuclei, including the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and the medial preoptic area (MPA). Many of the inputs identified by our rabies tracing derive from both hemispheres, that is, from the hemispheres ipsi- and contralateral to the viral injection site, which is consistent with previous observations about the prominent role of L1 INs in interhemispheric inhibition (Palmer et al., 2012Palmer L.M. Schulz J.M. Murphy S.C. Ledergerber D. Murayama M. Larkum M.E. The cellular basis of GABA(B)-mediated interhemispheric inhibition.Science. 2012; 335: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To validate that the inputs identified by our rabies-tracing experiments are indeed monosynaptic and functional, we focused on the AUD and the prefrontal cortex and performed optogenetic input mapping to visual cortex L1 NDNF INs from these regions (Figure 3C). For this, we expressed the optogenetic activator ChR2 (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang F. Wang L.-P. Boyden E.S. Deisseroth K. Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) in the respective cortical area, labeled L1 NDNF INs in the visual cortex with GFP, and performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from GFP-labeled cells in acute visual cortex slices in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-AP while photo-activating the ChR2-expressing axons. This revealed that visual cortex L1 NDNF INs indeed receive direct monosynaptic inputs from the AUD and prefrontal cortex (Figure 3C). Taken together, these findings are consistent with and extend previous reports on the organization of long-range inputs to visual cortex L1 (Cruz-Martín et al., 2014Cruz-Martín A. El-Danaf R.N.

Notably, the differences between our findings and previous reports on long-range inputs to other types of visual cortex neurons (Leinweber et al., 2017Leinweber M. Ward D.R. Sobczak J.M. Attinger A.

Next, we assessed how the activity of L1 NDNF INs affects the visually evoked responses of local principal (i.e., excitatory) neurons. For this, we expressed the optogenetic activator Chronos-GFP (Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J.

Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) (Figures S3A–S3E) in visual cortex L1 NDNF INs and performed loose patch-clamp recordings from excitatory neurons (see STAR Methods) across all cortical layers while displaying visual stimuli and activating L1 NDNF INs in interleaved trials by turning on a blue light-emitting diode (LED) (470 nm) during the time of stimulus presentation (Figure 4A). Recording in anesthetized mice, we find that optogenetic activation of L1 NDNF INs significantly reduces spontaneous firing (Figure S3G) and visually evoked responses in excitatory neurons across all layers (Figures 4B–4D) without affecting their gOSI (Figure 4E), their preferred orientation (Figure S3H), or their direction selectivity index (DSI; Figure S3I). The same effects were observed when we recorded in awake mice (Figure 4H). We then analyzed the type of inhibition that is conveyed by L1 NDNF INs onto excitatory neurons (i.e., subtractive or divisive; Carandini and Heeger, 1994Carandini M. Heeger D.J.

We find that the change in firing rate at the preferred orientation is significantly higher than the one in orthogonal orientation; together with the fact that we detect no change in gOSI (Figure 4E), this indicates that L1 NDNF INs provide divisive inhibition across all cortical layers. Considering the effects of L1 NDNF INs activation on spontaneous firing in excitatory neurons (Figure S3G), our findings also suggest that L1 NDNF INs"

Folate deficiency is associated with a number of developmental, immune and neurological disorders3-5. Mammals cannot synthesize folates de novo; several systems have therefore evolved to take up folates from the diet and distribute them within the body3,6. The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) (also known as SLC46A1) mediates folate uptake across the intestinal brush border membrane and the choroid plexus4,7, and is an important route for the delivery of antifolate drugs in cancer chemotherapy8-10. How PCFT recognizes folates or antifolate agents is currently unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of PCFT in a substrate-free state and in complex with a new-generation antifolate drug (pemetrexed). Our results provide a structural basis for understanding antifolate recognition and provide insights into the pH-regulated mechanism of folate transport mediated by PCFT."
https://openalex.org/W3165331490,"The phase behaviour of warm dense hydrogen-helium (H-He) mixtures affects our understanding of the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn and their interior structures1,2. For example, precipitation of He from a H-He atmosphere at about 1-10 megabar and a few thousand kelvin has been invoked to explain both the excess luminosity of Saturn1,3, and the depletion of He and neon (Ne) in Jupiter's atmosphere as observed by the Galileo probe4,5. But despite its importance, H-He phase behaviour under relevant planetary conditions remains poorly constrained because it is challenging to determine computationally and because the extremes of temperature and pressure are difficult to reach experimentally. Here we report that appropriate temperatures and pressures can be reached through laser-driven shock compression of H2-He samples that have been pre-compressed in diamond-anvil cells. This allows us to probe the properties of H-He mixtures under Jovian interior conditions, revealing a region of immiscibility along the Hugoniot. A clear discontinuous change in sample reflectivity indicates that this region ends above 150 gigapascals at 10,200 kelvin and that a more subtle reflectivity change occurs above 93 gigapascals at 4,700 kelvin. Considering pressure-temperature profiles for Jupiter, these experimental immiscibility constraints for a near-protosolar mixture suggest that H-He phase separation affects a large fraction-we estimate about 15 per cent of the radius-of Jupiter's interior. This finding provides microphysical support for Jupiter models that invoke a layered interior to explain Juno and Galileo spacecraft observations1,4,6-8."
https://openalex.org/W3165244426,"Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) is a glycero-lysophospholipid and a natural agonist against GPR55. The roles of the LPI/GPR55 axis in the pathogenesis of inflammation have been controversial. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the roles of the LPI/GPR55 axis in inflammation, especially the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α from macrophages. We treated RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) with LPI and observed that LPI induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from these cells, as well as the phosphorylation of p38. These responses were inhibited by treatment with CID16020046 (CID), an antagonist against GPR55, or SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 cascade or knockdown of GPR55 with siRNA. Treatment with CID or ML-193, another antagonist against GPR55, attenuated the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma or tissue of db/db mice and in a septic mouse model induced using lipopolysaccharide, suggesting contributions to the improvement of insulin resistance and protection against organ injuries by treatment with CID or ML-193, respectively. In human subjects, although the serum LPI levels were not different, the levels of LPI in the lipoprotein fractions were lower and the levels in the lipoprotein-depleted fractions were higher in subjects with diabetes. LPI bound to albumin induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from RAW264.7 cells to a greater degree than LPI bound to LDL or HDL. These results suggest that LPI, especially the albumin-bound form, induced inflammatory cytokines depending on the GPR55/p38 pathway, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and acute inflammation."

To fill this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with women living with or at risk for HIV in the United States.We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with women enrolled in the San Francisco and Atlanta sites of the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS). Participants were purposively sampled so half were living with HIV and all reported food insecurity and IPV in the past year. Semi-structured interviews explored experiences with food insecurity and IPV, how these experiences might be related and influence HIV risk and treatment behaviors. Analysis was guided by an inductive-deductive approach.A predominant theme centered on how food insecurity and IPV co-occur with poor mental health and substance use to influence HIV-related behaviors. Women described how intersecting experiences of food insecurity and IPV negatively affected their mental health, with many indicating using substances to ""feel no pain"". Substance use, in turn, was described to perpetuate food insecurity, IPV, and poor mental health in a vicious cycle, ultimately facilitating HIV risk behaviors and preventing HIV treatment adherence.Food insecurity, IPV, poor mental health and substance use intersect and negatively influence HIV prevention and treatment behaviors. Findings offer preliminary evidence of a syndemic that goes beyond the more widely studied ""SAVA"" (substance use, AIDS, and violence) syndemic, drawing attention to additional constructs of mental health and food insecurity. Quantitative research must further characterize the extent and size of this syndemic. Policies that address the social and structural drivers of this syndemic, including multi-level and trauma-informed approaches, should be implemented and evaluated to assess their impact on this syndemic and its negative health effects."

Information on qualitative parameters of these valuable resources is very crucial as it might affect its applicability from agricultural, drinking, and industrial aspects. Although geo-statistics methods can provide insight about spatial distribution of quality factors, applications of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models can contribute to produce more accurate results as robust alternative for such a complex geo-science problem. The present research investigates the capacity of several types of AI models for modeling four key water quality variables namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), total dissolved solid (TDS) and Sulfate (SO 4 ) using dataset obtained from 90 wells in Tabriz Plain, Iran; assessed by k-fold testing. Two different modeling scenarios were established to make simulations using other quality parameters and the geographical information. The obtained results confirmed the capabilities of the AI models for modeling the well groundwater quality variables. Among all the applied AI models, the developed hybrid support vector machine-firefly algorithm (SVM-FFA) model achieved the best predictability performance for both investigated scenarios. The introduced computer aid methodology provided a reliable technology for groundwater monitoring and assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3165132368,"The pluripotency gene regulatory network of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells(piPSCs), especially in epigenetics, remains elusive. To determine the biological function of epigenetics, we cultured piPSCs in different culture conditions. We found that activation of pluripotent gene- and pluripotency-related pathways requires the erasure of H3K9 methylation modification which was further influenced by mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) served feeder. By dissecting the dynamic change of H3K9 methylation during loss of pluripotency, we demonstrated that the H3K9 demethylases KDM3A and KDM3B regulated global H3K9me2/me3 level and that their co-depletion led to the collapse of the pluripotency gene regulatory network. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) provided evidence that KDM3A and KDM3B formed a complex to perform H3K9 demethylation. The genome-wide regulation analysis revealed that OCT4 (O) and SOX2 (S), the core pluripotency transcriptional activators, maintained the pluripotent state of piPSCs depending on the H3K9 hypomethylation. Further investigation revealed that O/S cooperating with histone demethylase complex containing KDM3A and KDM3B promoted pluripotency genes expression to maintain the pluripotent state of piPSCs. Together, these data offer a unique insight into the epigenetic pluripotency network of piPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3164897066,"Aim Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) increases in serum during pregnancy to levels not seen in any other physiological state and is suggested to be involved in pregnancy-induced nausea, weight regulation and glucose metabolism. The main action of GDF15 is regulated through a receptor of the brainstem, i.e., through exposure of GDF15 in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The aim of the current study was to measure GDF15 in both CSF and serum during pregnancy, and to compare it longitudinally to non-pregnant levels. Methods Women were sampled at elective caesarean section (n = 45, BMI = 28.1±5.0) and were followed up 5 years after pregnancy (n = 25). GDF15, insulin and leptin were measured in CSF and serum. Additional measurements included plasma glucose, and serum adiponectin and Hs-CRP. Results GDF15 levels were higher during pregnancy compared with follow-up in both CSF (385±128 vs. 115±32 ng/l, P &lt;0.001) and serum (73789±29198 vs. 404±102 ng/l, P &lt;0.001). CSF levels correlated with serum levels during pregnancy ( P &lt;0.001), but not in the non-pregnant state ( P = 0.98). Both CSF and serum GDF15 were highest in women carrying a female fetus ( P &lt;0.001). Serum GDF15 correlated with the homeostatic model assessment for beta-cell function and placental weight, and CSF GDF15 correlated inversely with CSF insulin levels. Conclusion This, the first study to measure CSF GDF15 during pregnancy, demonstrated increased GDF15 levels in both serum and CSF during pregnancy. The results suggest that effects of GDF15 during pregnancy can be mediated by increases in both CSF and serum levels."

Understanding these effects requires us to obtain and analyse data in as close to real time as possible, especially as rules change rapidly and local lockdowns are enacted. This work studies the UK labour market by analysing data from the online job board Reed.co.uk, using topic modelling and geo-inference methods to break down the data by sector and geography. I also study how the salary, contract type, and mode of work have changed since the COVID-19 crisis hit the UK in March. Overall, vacancies were down by 60 to 70% in the first weeks of lockdown. By the end of the year numbers had recovered somewhat, but the total job ad deficit is measured to be over 40%. Broken down by sector, vacancies for hospitality and graduate jobs are greatly reduced, while there were more care work and nursing vacancies during lockdown. Differences by geography are less significant than between sectors, though there is some indication that local lockdowns stall recovery and less badly hit areas may have experienced a smaller reduction in vacancies. There are also small but significant changes in the salary distribution and number of full time and permanent jobs.

Two subspecies differing in salt tolerance were subjected for analysis, a moderately salt-tolerant sugar beet Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris cv. Huzar and a halophytic beet, Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima. The CpG island methylation status was determined. All target sequences were hyper- or hypomethylated under salt shock and/or salt stress in one or both beet subspecies. It was revealed that the genomic regions analyzed were highly methylated in both, the salt treated plants and untreated controls. Methylation of the target sequences changed in a salt-dependent manner, being affected by either one or both treatments. Under both shock and stress, the hypomethylation was a predominant response in sugar beet. In Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, the hypermethylation occurred with higher frequency than hypomethylation, especially under salt stress and in the promoter-located CpG sites. Conversely, the hypomethylation of the promoter-located CpG sites predominated in sugar beet plants subjected to salt stress. This findings suggest that DNA methylation may be involved in salt-tolerance and transcriptomic response to salinity in beets."

To assure such conditions, not only basic needs must be met, but also possibilities must be provided that allow animals in captive care to express all species-typical behaviors. Rack housing systems for snakes have become increasingly popular and are widely used; however, from an animal welfare perspective, they are no alternative to furnished terrariums. In this study, we therefore evaluated two types of housing systems for ball pythons ( Python regius ) by considering the welfare aspect animal behavior. In Part 1 of the study, ball pythons ( n = 35) were housed individually in a conventional rack system. The pythons were provided with a hiding place and a water bowl, temperature control was automatic, and the lighting in the room served as indirect illumination. In Part 2 of the study, the same ball pythons, after at least 8 weeks, were housed individually in furnished terrariums. The size of each terrarium was correlated with the body length of each python. The terrariums contained substrate, a hiding place, possibilities for climbing, a water basin for bathing, an elevated basking spot, and living plants. The temperature was controlled automatically, and illumination was provided by a fluorescent tube and a UV lamp. The shown behavior spectrum differed significantly between the two housing systems ( p &lt; 0.05). The four behaviors basking, climbing, burrowing, and bathing could only be expressed in the terrarium. Abnormal behaviors that could indicate stereotypies were almost exclusively seen in the rack system. The results show that the housing of ball pythons in a rack system leads to a considerable restriction in species-typical behaviors; thus, the rack system does not meet the requirements for animal-appropriate housing."
https://openalex.org/W3164281787,"GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in several neurological diseases and important physiological pathways in the brain. We previously reported that its long N-terminal ectodomain undergoes constitutive metalloprotease-mediated cleavage and shedding, which have been rarely described for class A GPCRs. Here, we demonstrate that the protease that cleaves GPR37 at Glu167↓Gln168 is a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10). This was achieved by employing selective inhibition, RNAi-mediated downregulation, and genetic depletion of ADAM10 in cultured cells as well as in vitro cleavage of the purified receptor with recombinant ADAM10. In addition, the cleavage was restored in ADAM10 knockout cells by overexpression of the wild type but not the inactive mutant ADAM10. Finally, postnatal conditional depletion of ADAM10 in mouse neuronal cells was found to reduce cleavage of the endogenous receptor in the brain cortex and hippocampus, confirming the physiological relevance of ADAM10 as a GPR37 sheddase. Additionally, we discovered that the receptor is subject to another cleavage step in cultured cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the site (Arg54↓Asp55) was localized to a highly conserved region at the distal end of the ectodomain that contains a recognition site for the proprotein convertase furin. The cleavage by furin was confirmed by using furin-deficient human colon carcinoma LoVo cells and proprotein convertase inhibitors. GPR37 is thus the first multispanning membrane protein that has been validated as an ADAM10 substrate and the first GPCR that is processed by both furin and ADAM10. The unconventional N-terminal processing may represent an important regulatory element for GPR37."
https://openalex.org/W3164581823,"Over the last decade, multiple studies have highlighted the essential role of gut microbiota in normal infant development. However, the sensitive periods during which gut bacteria are established and become associated with physical growth and maturation of the brain are still poorly defined. This study tracked the assembly of the intestinal microbiota during the initial nursing period, and changes in community structure after transitioning to solid food in infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Anthropometric measures and rectal swabs were obtained at 2-month intervals across the first year of life and bacterial taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. At 12 months of age, total brain and cortical regions volumes were quantified through structural magnetic resonance imaging. The bacterial community structure was dynamic and characterized by discrete maturational phases, reflecting an early influence of breast milk and the later transition to solid foods. Commensal microbial taxa varied with diet similar to findings in other animals and human infants; however, monkeys differ in the relative abundances of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, two taxa predominant in breastfed human infants. Higher abundances of taxa in the phylum Proteobacteria during nursing were predictive of slower growth trajectories and smaller brain volumes at one year of age. Our findings define discrete phases of microbial succession in infant monkeys and suggest there may be a critical period during nursing when endogenous differences in certain taxa can shift the community structure and influence the pace of physical growth and the maturational trajectory of the brain."

https://openalex.org/W3164430901,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of health loss and health sector economic burdens in high-income countries. Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden. Aims This modeling study aimed to quantify potential health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ). Methods We adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections from the NZ Treasury. Results We estimated the potential CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 health-adjusted life years (HALYs) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities would be increased with the per capita health loss for Māori (Indigenous population) estimated to be 3.7 times greater than for non-Māori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people). The estimated additional health system costs ranged between (NZ$303 million [m] to 503m in 2019 values; or US$209m to 346m). Conclusions and policy implications Unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause significant health loss, increase health inequities from CVD, and impose additional health system costs in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including additional job creation programs and measures directed towards the primary prevention of CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3164684220,"Strong inflammatory response triggered by the activation of the innate immune system is one typical characteristic of sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI). Guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP-5) is a component of cell-autonomous immunity and known to be associated with inflammation. Currently, whether GBP-5 participates in SALI and its roles in this disease are yet to be investigated. Using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SALI mouse model, we found GBP-5 was highly expressed in LPS-treated mice, and its expression was tightly related to the serum concentrations of live injury markers and inflammatory cytokines, liver damage scores by H&E staining, and amounts of apoptotic hepatocytes by TUNEL staining. Moreover, GBP-5 overexpression was found to aggravate LPS-induced SALI by promoting the activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, then facilitated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, eventually induced hepatocyte cell death. Direct transcriptional activation of GBP-5 by basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) was identified and further validated. This study unveils a transcriptional upregulation of GBP-5 by interacting with BATF, which promotes the progression of LPS-induced SALI through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and provides novel therapeutic insights for halting the progression of liver injury in various liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3164762878,"The Common or Brown Garden Snail, Cornu aspersum, is an invasive land snail that has successfully colonized a diverse range of global environments. Like other invasive land snails, it is a significant pest of a variety of agricultural crops, including citrus, grapes and canola. Cornu aspersum secretes a mucus trail when mobile that facilitates locomotion. The involvement of the trail in conspecific chemical communication has also been postulated. Our study found that anterior tentacle contact with conspecific mucus elicited a significant increase in heart rate from 46.9 to 51 beats per minute. In order to gain a better understanding of the constituents of the trail mucus and the role it may play in snail communication, the protein and volatile components of mucus trails were investigated. Using two different protein extraction methods, mass spectrometry analysis yielded 175 different proteins, 29 of which had no significant similarity to any entries in the non-redundant protein sequence database. Of the mucus proteins, 22 contain features consistent with secreted proteins, including a perlucin-like protein. The eight most abundant volatiles detected using gas chromatography were recorded (including propanoic acid and limonene) and their potential role as putative pheromones are discussed. In summary, this study has provided an avenue for further research pertaining to the role of trail mucus in snail communication and provides a useful repository for land snail trail mucus components. This may be utilized for further research regarding snail attraction and dispersal, which may be applied in the fields of agriculture, ecology and human health."
https://openalex.org/W3164951297,"cAMP responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH) is a hepatic transcription factor to be activated during fasting. We generated CREBH knock-in flox mice, and then generated liver-specific CREBH transgenic (CREBH L-Tg) mice in an active form. CREBH L-Tg mice showed a delay in growth in the postnatal stage. Plasma growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly increased in CREBH L-Tg mice, but plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels were significantly decreased, indicating GH resistance. In addition, CREBH overexpression significantly increased hepatic mRNA and plasma levels of FGF21, which is thought to be as one of the causes of growth delay. However, the additional ablation of FGF21 in CREBH L-Tg mice could not correct GH resistance at all. CREBH L-Tg mice sustained GH receptor (GHR) reduction and the increase of IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) in the liver regardless of FGF21. As GHR is a first step in GH signaling, the reduction of GHR leads to impairment of GH signaling. These data suggest that CREBH negatively regulates growth in the postnatal growth stage via various pathways as an abundant energy response by antagonizing GH signaling."

Bacillus anthracis spores can be found naturally in soil and commonly affect both animals and humans around the world. Domestic and wild animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer can become infected when they inhale or ingest spores from contaminated soil, plants, or water. Anthrax can be fatal if patients are not treated promptly with antibiotics. This protocol aims to describe the implementation and evaluation of the 'One Health' intervention model based on the principles of Theory of Change (ToC) to eliminate human anthrax from a tribal district in Odisha, India.This study would test the effectiveness of a complex public health intervention package developed using the ToC framework for the elimination of human anthrax in Koraput district by a comparative analysis of baseline and end-line data. We plan to enroll 2640 adults across 14 geographically divided blocks in Koraput district of Odisha for baseline and end-line surveys. After baseline, we would provide capacity building training to stakeholders from the department of health, veterinary, forest, academic and allied health institutions followed by workshops on sensitization and awareness through IEC (Information Education Communication)/BCC (Behavior Change Communication) activities in the community. We would establish a state-level laboratory facility as a robust system for timely diagnosis and management of human anthrax cases. Surveillance network will be strengthened to track the cases in early stage and risk zoning will be done for focused surveillance in endemic areas. Advocacy with district level administration will be done for maximizing the coverage of livestock vaccination in the entire district. Interdepartmental coordination would be established for the effective implementation of the intervention package.This would be a first study applying One Health concept for the elimination of human anthrax in India. The findings from this study will offer important insights for policy-making and further replication in other endemic regions of the state and country.The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are prospectively registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India [CTRI/2020/05/025325] on 22 May 2020."

However, some louse fly species, especially in genera attacking birds, show wide range of suitable hosts. In the presented study, we have surveyed the current status of bird specific louse flies in Finland to provide comprehensive host association data to analyse the ecological requirements of the generalist species. A thorough sampling of 9342 birds, representing 134 species, recovered 576 specimens of louse flies, belonging to six species: Crataerina hirundinis , C . pallida , Ornithomya avicularia , O . chloropus , O . fringillina and Ornithophila metallica . Despite some overlapping hosts, the three Ornithomya species showed a notable pattern in their host preference, which was influenced not only by the host size but also by the habitat and host breeding strategy. We also provide DNA barcodes for ten Finnish species of Hippoboscidae, which can be used as a resource for species identification as well as metabarcoding studies in the future."

We recently obtained HBV-susceptible immortalized human hepatocyte NKNT-3 by exogenously expressing NTCP and its derived cell clones, #28.3.8 and #28.3.25.13 exhibiting different levels of HBV susceptibility. In the present study, we showed that HBV infection activated the ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway in #28.3.25.13 cells but not in #28.3.8 cells. Both the cell culture supernatant and extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from HBV-infected #28.3.25.13 cells also activated the ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway in naïve #28.3.25.13 cells. Interestingly, EVs derived from HBV-infected #28.3.25.13 cells included higher level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than those from HBV-infected #28.3.8 cells. Based on our results, we propose the novel model that EVs mediate the activation of ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway by the intercellular transfer of mtDNA in HBV-infected human hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W3164931409,"Tendon inflammation has been implicated in both adaptive connective tissue remodeling and overuse-induced tendinopathy. Lipid mediators control both the initiation and resolution of inflammation, but their roles within tendon are largely unknown. Here, we profiled local shifts in intratendinous lipid mediators via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in response to synergist ablation-induced plantaris tendon overuse. Sixty-four individual lipid mediators were detected in homogenates of plantaris tendons from ambulatory control rats. This included many bioactive metabolites of the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and epoxygenase (CYP) pathways. Synergist ablation induced a robust inflammatory response at day 3 post-surgery characterized by epitenon infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes/macrophages (MΦ), heightened expression of inflammation-related genes, and increased intratendinous concentrations of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 . By day 7, MΦ became the predominant myeloid cell type in tendon and there were further delayed increases in other COX metabolites including prostaglandins D2 , F2α , and I2 . Specialized pro-resolving mediators including protectin D1, resolvin D2 and D6, as well as related pathway markers of D-resolvins (17-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid), E-resolvins (18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid), and lipoxins (15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid) were also increased locally in response to tendon overuse, as were anti-inflammatory fatty acid epoxides of the CYP pathway (eg, epoxy-eicosatrienoic acids). Nevertheless, intratendinous prostaglandins remained markedly increased even following 28 days of tendon overuse together with a lingering MΦ presence. These data reveal a delayed and prolonged local inflammatory response to tendon overuse characterized by an overwhelming predominance of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and a relative lack of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators."
https://openalex.org/W3165251878,"Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH) leads to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) caused by LF tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Emerging evidence has indicated that dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanical stress (MS) has been explored as an initiating step in LFH pathology progression; the inflammation-related miRNAs induced after mechanical stress have been implicated in fibrosis pathology. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of MS-miRNAs-LFH remains to be elucidated. Using miRNAs sequencing analysis and subsequent confirmation with qRT-PCR assays, we identified the decreased expression of miR-10396b-3p and increased expression of IL-11 (interleukin-11) as responses to the development of LSS in hypertrophied LF tissues. We also found that IL-11 is positively correlated with fibrosis indicators of collagen I and collagen III. The up-regulation of miR-10396b-3p significantly decreased the level of IL-11 expression, whereas miR-10396b-3p down-regulation increased IL-11 expression in vitro. Luciferase reporter assay indicates that IL-11 is a direct target of miR-10396b-3p. Furthermore, cyclic mechanical stress inhibits miR-10396b-3p and induces IL-11, collagen I, and collagen III in vitro. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-10396b-3p suppresses MS-induced LFH by inhibiting collagen I and III via the inhibition of IL-11. These data suggest that the MS-miR-10396b-3p-IL-11 axis plays a key role in the pathological progression of LFH."

Periodontitis, as chronic inflammatory destructive disease, is associated metabolic syndromes bidirectionally. Toothbrushing is an essential and important way to manage periodontitis through mechanical removal of biofilm at periodontal tissue. We aimed to assess the association between toothbrushing frequency and the prevalent NAFLD in nationally representative Korean adults. Among adults aged 19 years and older who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2010, a total of 6,352 subjects were analyzed. NAFLD was defined as fatty liver index ≥60. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An inverse association between toothbrushing frequency and NAFLD was found. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of NALFD was 0.56 (0.35-0.91) in the group who performed toothbrushing ≥ 3 per day compared to the group that performed toothbrushing ≤ 1 per day. For those with toothbrushing frequency ≤1 per day, the adjusted OR (95% CIs) of NAFLD was 2.26 (1.22-4.19) in smokers and 4.52 (1.97-10.38) in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM), compared to those without the disease and with toothbrushing frequency ≥2 per day, respectively. Our results indicate that higher frequency of toothbrushing is inversely associated with NAFLD. As a modifiable oral habit, regular toothbrushing may be recommended to lower risk of NAFLD, especially in high risk groups such as smokers and diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3164731506,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are crucial for maintaining proper digestion and overall homeostasis of the gut mucosa. IEC proliferation and differentiation are tightly regulated by well described pathways, however, relatively little is known about how cytokines shape these processes. Given that the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 promotes intestinal barrier function, and insufficient IL-10 signaling increases susceptibility to intestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, we hypothesized that IL-10 signaling modulates processes underlying IEC proliferation and differentiation. This was tested using in vivo and in vitro IEC-specific IL-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) depletion under homeostatic conditions. Our findings revealed that loss of IL-10R1 drove lineage commitment toward a dominant goblet cell phenotype while decreasing absorptive cell-related features. Diminished IL-10 signaling also significantly elevated IEC proliferation with relatively minor changes to apoptosis. Characterization of signaling pathways upstream of proliferation demonstrated a significant reduction in the Wnt inhibitor, DKK1, increased nuclear localization of β-catenin, and increased transcripts of the proliferation marker, OLFM4, with IL-10R1 depletion. Phosphorylated STAT3 was nearly completely absent in IL-10R1 knockdown cells and may provide a mechanistic link between our observations and the regulation of these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate a novel role for IL-10 signaling in intestinal mucosal homeostasis by regulating proper balance of proliferation and IEC lineage fate."

Presently, there is little information regarding the identification of lncRNAs in jujube ( Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), and it is uncertain whether the lncRNAs could respond to heat stress (HS) or not. In our previous study, a cultivar (Hqing1-HR) of Z . jujub a were treated by HS (45°C) for 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days, and it was found that HS globally changed the gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments and informatics analyses. In the current study, 8260 lncRNAs were identified successfully from the previous RNA-seq data, and it indicated that lncRNAs expression was also altered globally, suggesting that the lncRNAs might play vital roles in response to HS. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses of potential target mRNAs of lncRNAs with cis-acting mechanism were performed, and it showed that multiple differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs co-located with DElncRNAs were highly enriched in pathways associated with response to stress and regulation of metabolic process. Taken together, these findings not only provide a comprehensive identification of lncRNAs but also useful clues for molecular mechanism response to HS in jujube."
https://openalex.org/W3165880352,"During the emission phase of ejaculation, the sperm is driven from the cauda epididymidis, where it is stored, through the vas deferens by strong contractions. These contractions are thought of as being mainly induced by the sympathetic nervous system and the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin (suggested to exert effects during ejaculation as well) on defined segments of the rat and human epididymis using live imaging. Our results indicate that it is the very last part of the epididymis, segment 19 (S19) in rat and likewise segment 9 in human, which responds in a uniquely strong and rapid manner to oxytocin (similar to noradrenaline). Because of the complex nature of this contractile response, we developed an imaging analysis method, which allowed us to quantify multidirectional contractions and to display them using heat maps. The reaction of S19 to oxytocin was concentration-dependent and could be inhibited by pretreatment with oxytocin antagonists (atosiban and cligosiban), but not with an arginine vasopressin 1A antagonist (SR49059). In both rat and human tissue, pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist tamsulosin inhibited the response to noradrenaline, whereas the effect of oxytocin was unimpaired. Our data (from men and rodents) strongly suggest that the hormone oxytocin is involved in the ejaculatory process. Thus, oxytocin-based medications might be a promising non-adrenergic treatment option for ejaculatory disorders. Additionally, we propose that S19 could be an advantageous model (detecting very low concentrations of oxytocin) to test the bioactivity of new oxytocin agonists and oxytocin antagonists."

Our aim was to assess the correlation of L&Z habitual dietary intake (excluding food supplements), resulting serum concentrations and lipid profile with macular pigment optical density (MPOD) as well as the contrast sensitivity (CT), as visual outcome in normolipemic subjects (n = 101) aged 45-65.MPOD was measured by heterochromatic flicker photometry, serum L&Z by HPLC, the dietary intake by a 3-day food records and CT using the CGT-1000-Contrast-Glaretester at six stimulus sizes, with and without glare.Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations (median) in serum: 0.361 and 0.078 μmol/L, in dietary intake: 1.1 mg L+Z/day. MPOD: 0.34du. L+Z intake correlates with their serum concentrations (rho = 0.333, p = 0.001), which in turn correlates with MPOD (rho = 0.229, p = 0.000) and with fruit and vegetable consumption (rho = 0.202, p = 0.001), but not with lutein+zeaxanthin dietary intake. MPOD correlated with CT, with and without glare (rho ranges: -0.135, 0.160 and -0.121, -0.205, respectively). MPOD predictors: serum L+Z, L+Z/HDL-cholesterol (β-coeficient: -0.91±0.2, 95%CI: -1.3,-0.5) and HDL-cholesterol (R2 = 15.9%). CT predictors: MPOD, mainly at medium and smaller visual angles (corresponding to spatial frequencies for which sensitivity declines with age) and gender (β-coefficients ranges: -0.95,-0.39 and -0.13,-0.39, respectively).A higher MPOD is associated with a lower ratio of L+Z/HDL-cholesterol and with a lower CT (higher contrast sensitivity). The HDL-cholesterol would also act indirectly on the CT improving the visual function."
https://openalex.org/W3164377790,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by a triad of behavioural impairments and includes disruption in social behaviour. ASD has a clear genetic underpinning and hundreds of genes are implicated in its aetiology. However, how single penetrant genes disrupt activity of neural circuits which lead to affected behaviours is only beginning to be understood and less is known about how low penetrant genes interact to disrupt emergent behaviours. Investigations are well served by experimental approaches that allow tractable investigation of the underpinning genetic basis of circuits that control behaviours that operate in the biological domains that are neuro-atypical in autism. The model organism C . elegans provides an experimental platform to investigate the effect of genetic mutations on behavioural outputs including those that impact social biology. Here we use progeny-derived social cues that modulate C . elegans food leaving to assay genetic determinants of social behaviour. We used the SAFRI Gene database to identify C . elegans orthologues of human ASD associated genes. We identified a number of mutants that displayed selective deficits in response to progeny. The genetic determinants of this complex social behaviour highlight the important contribution of synaptopathy and implicates genes within cell signalling, epigenetics and phospholipid metabolism functional domains. The approach overlaps with a growing number of studies that investigate potential molecular determinants of autism in C . elegans . However, our use of a complex, sensory integrative, emergent behaviour provides routes to enrich new or underexplored biology with the identification of novel candidate genes with a definable role in social behaviour."

The aim of this study was to group farmers depending on their attitudes around antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, and determine the behaviours that are associated with the farmers in these groups. In 2017, a flock health survey was sent to British sheep farmers. K-means cluster analysis was used to identify groups of farmers with similar attitudes towards antibiotic use and resistance. A multivariable logistic regression model was built to determine the associations between farmers' past behaviours and their antibiotic attitude group. There were 461 responses. Two groups of farmers were identified based on their antibiotic attitudes. Cluster 1 were defined as the ""discordant"" group who had positive views of using antibiotics prophylactically and negative views of reducing antibiotic use. Cluster 2 were defined as the ""concordant"" group who were positive about reducing antibiotic use and had negative views about using antibiotics prophylactically. Using antibiotics in all lambs (OR = 2.689, CI = 1.571, 4.603), using antibiotics in all ewes (OR = 3.388, CI = 1.318, 8.706), always trimming diseased feet over the past three years (OR = 2.487, CI = 1.459, 4.238), not using a computer to record information over the past three years (OR = 1.996, CI = 1.179, 3.381), not changing worming practices over the past three years (OR = 1.879, CI = 1.144, 3.087), and farmers' perceptions that their sheep flock did not make a financial loss in the past three years (OR = 2.088, CI = 1.079, 4.040) were significantly associated with belonging to the discordant group. Talking to their veterinarian about antibiotic use or the frequency of veterinary visits were not associated with antibiotic attitude group. These results suggest that farmers who had attitudes relating to antibiotic use that did not align with current recommendations carried out more traditional practices, which were strengthened by their positive perceptions of profitability."

The vascular endothelium plays a major role in this pathophysiological condition. Only few therapeutic strategies focus on the vascular endothelium as a major target for an anti-inflammatory approach. In this study, we present the natural compound-derived carbazole derivative C81 as chemical modulator interfering with leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. An in vivo assay employing intravital microscopy to monitor leukocyte trafficking after C81 treatment in postcapillary venules of a murine cremaster muscle was performed. Moreover, in vitro assays using HUVECs and monocytes were implemented. The impact of C81 on cell adhesion molecules and the NFκB signaling cascade was analyzed in vitro in endothelial cells. Effects of C81 on protein translation were determined by incorporation of a puromycin analog-based approach and polysome profiling. We found that C81 significantly reduced TNF-activated leukocyte trafficking in postcapillary venules. Similar results were obtained in vitro when C81 reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions by down-regulating cell adhesion molecules. Focusing on the NFκB signaling cascade, we found that C81 reduced the activation on multiple levels of the cascade through promoted IκBα recovery by attenuation of IκBα ubiquitination and through reduced protein levels of TNFR1 caused by protein translation inhibition. We suggest that C81 might represent a promising lead compound for interfering with inflammation-related processes in endothelial cells by down-regulation of IκBα ubiquitination on the one hand and inhibition of translation on the other hand without exerting cytotoxic effects."

Despite increasing attention to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in Uganda and globally, concerns remain that unique drivers of infection, and barriers to screening, and treatment, persist among those affected by conflict.Cango Lyec (Healing the Elephant) cohort survey involved conflict-affected adults aged 13-49 in three mid-Northern Uganda districts (Gulu, Amuru and Nwoya). Baseline (2011-2012) samples were tested for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), antibodies to HBV surface antigen (HBsAb), antibodies to HBV e-antigen (HBeAb), and antibodies to HBV core antigen (HBcAb). All HBsAg positive samples were tested for IgM antibodies to HBV B core antigen (HBc-IgM) and where available, >6-month follow-up samples were tested for HBeAg and HBV DNA. Data were analyzed using STATA 15 software. Logistic regression accounted for variance due to complex two-stage sampling that included stratification, unequal selection probabilities and community clustering. Odds ratios measured effect potential risk factors associated with chronic HBV infection.Among 2,421 participants, 45.7% were still susceptible to HBV infection. HBsAg seropositivity was 11.9% (10.9-13.0), chronic HBV was 11.6% (10.4-12.8), acquired immunity resulting from vaccination was 10.9%, and prior natural infection was 31.5%. Older age (OR:0.570; 95%CI:0.368-0.883) and higher education (OR:0.598; 95%CI:0.412-0.868) were associated with reduced odds of chronic HBV infection. Being male (OR:1.639; 95%CI:1.007-2.669) and having been abducted (OR:1.461; 95%CI:1.055-2.023) were associated with increased odds of infection. Among women, having 1 or 2 pregnancies (compared to none or >2) was associated with increased odds of infection (OR:1.764; 95%CI:1.009-3.084).Chronic HBV is endemic in Gulu, Amuru and Nwoya districts. Recommended strategies to reduce post-conflict prevalence include establishment of Northern Uganda Liver Wellness Centres, integration of screening and treatment into antenatal care, and roll out of birth-dose vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3164421806,"The bloodstream stage of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is characterized by its high rate of endocytosis, which is involved in remodeling of its surface coat. Here we present evidence that RNAi-mediated expression down-regulation of vacuolar protein sorting 41 (Vps41), a component of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, leads to a strong inhibition of endocytosis, vesicle accumulation, enlargement of the flagellar pocket (""big eye"" phenotype), and dramatic effect on cell growth. Unexpectedly, other functions described for Vps41 in mammalian cells and yeasts, such as delivery of proteins to lysosomes, and lysosome-related organelles (acidocalcisomes) were unaffected, indicating that in trypanosomes post-Golgi trafficking is distinct from that of mammalian cells and yeasts. The essentiality of TbVps41 suggests that it is a potential drug target."
https://openalex.org/W3164782406,"The analysis of visually guided tracking movements is important to the understanding of imitation exercises and movements carried out using the human visuomotor control system. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of visuomotor control in the intermittent performance of circular tracking movements by applying a system that can differentiate between the conditions of invisible and visible orbits and visible and invisible target phases implemented in a 3D VR space. By applying visuomotor control based on velocity control, our study participants were able to track objects with visible orbits with a precision of approximately 1.25 times greater than they could track objects with invisible orbits. We confirmed that position information is an important parameter related to intermittent motion at low speeds (below 0.5 Hz) and that tracked target velocity information could be obtained more precisely than position information at speeds above 0.5 Hz. Our results revealed that the feedforward (FF) control corresponding to velocity was delayed under the visible-orbit condition at speeds over 0.5 Hz, suggesting that, in carrying out imitation exercises and movements, the use of visually presented 3D guides can interfere with exercise learning and, therefore, that the effects of their use should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W3164855566,"The phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is a key signaling molecule and binding partner for many intracellular proteins. PS is normally found on the inner surface of the cell membrane, but PS can be flipped to the outer surface in a process called PS exposure. PS exposure is important in many cell functions, yet the mechanisms that control PS exposure have not been extensively studied. Copines (Cpn), found in most eukaryotic organisms, make up a family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins. In Dictyostelium, which has six copine genes, CpnA strongly binds to PS and translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to a rise in calcium. Cells lacking the cpnA gene (cpnA-) have defects in adhesion, chemotaxis, membrane trafficking, and cytokinesis. In this study we used both flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy to show that cpnA- cells have increased adhesion to beads and bacteria and that the increased adhesion was not due to changes in the actin cytoskeleton or cell surface proteins. We found that cpnA- cells bound higher amounts of Annexin V, a PS binding protein, than parental cells and showed that unlabeled Annexin V reduced the increased cell adhesion property of cpnA- cells. We also found that cpnA- cells were more sensitive to Polybia-MP1, which binds to external PS and induces cell lysis. Overall, this suggests that cpnA- cells have increased PS exposure and this property contributes to the increased cell adhesion of cpnA- cells. We conclude that CpnA has a role in the regulation of plasma membrane lipid composition and may act as a negative regulator of PS exposure."
