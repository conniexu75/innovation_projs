https://openalex.org/W3152866496,"The perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still largely unknown. This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age &gt; 35 years, Body Mass Index &gt;30 kg/m 2 , and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P &lt;0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P &lt;0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2–18] days vs. 2 [2–3] days, P &lt;0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity. This report highlights the importance of COVID-19 detection at delivery in pregnant women living in high transmission areas."
https://openalex.org/W3155884323,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and has taken over 1.7 million lives as of mid-December, 2020. Although great progress has been made in the development of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 μM range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a ß-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimer's therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 μM, in Vero 76, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral."
https://openalex.org/W3154452664,"Effective teamwork is critical for safe, high-quality care in the operating room (OR); however, teamwork interventions have not consistently resulted in the expected gains for patient safety or surgical culture. In order to optimize OR teamwork in a targeted and evidence-based manner, it is first necessary to conduct a comprehensive, theory-informed assessment of barriers and enablers from an interprofessional perspective.This qualitative study was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Volunteer, purposive and snowball sampling were conducted primarily across four sites in Ontario, Canada and continued until saturation was reached. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and de-identified. Directed content analysis was conducted in duplicate using the TDF as the initial coding framework. Codes were then refined whereby similar codes were grouped into larger categories of meaning within each TDF domain, resulting in a list of domain-specific barriers and enablers.A total of 66 OR healthcare professionals participated in the study (19 Registered Nurses, two Registered Practical Nurses, 17 anaesthesiologists, 26 surgeons, two perfusionists). The most frequently identified teamwork enablers included people management, shared definition of teamwork, communication strategies, positive emotions, familiarity with team members, and alignment of teamwork with professional role. The most frequently identified teamwork barriers included others' personalities, gender, hierarchies, resource issues, lack of knowledge of best practices for teamwork, negative emotions, conflicting norms and perceptions across professions, being unfamiliar with team members, and on-call/night shifts.We identified key factors influencing OR teamwork from an interprofessional perspective using a theoretically informed and systematic approach. Our findings reveal important targets for future interventions and may ultimately increase their effectiveness. Specifically, achieving optimal teamwork in the OR may require a multi-level intervention that addresses individual, team and systems-level factors with particular attention to complex social and professional hierarchies."
https://openalex.org/W3154564164,"Background Limited data is available regarding the frequency of COVID-19 in populations that are highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this cross-section study we evaluated COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police forces of 10 major cities in Rio Grande do Sul, South of Brazil. Methods Sampling was randomly performed in clusters, in respect to the number of professionals at service per city and military unit. Research subjects were evaluated on July 23, 2020 (first wave peak in Brazil). Clinical information was obtained, and venous blood was taken for ELISA testing (IgA, and IgG antibodies). Sample size consisted of 1,592 military workers (33.6% of study population). They were mostly man (81.2%) and young (median 34 years-old). Most had been asymptomatic (75.3%) during pandemic, and 27.5% reported close contact with COVID-19 cases (after a median time of 21 days). Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. Conclusion The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure. Asymptomatic people were more prone to have negative antibody titters in the second run."
https://openalex.org/W3154741634,"This study developed, validated, and evaluated a framework of factors influencing dietary behaviours in urban African food environments, to inform research prioritisation and intervention development in Africa. A multi-component methodology, drawing on concept mapping, was employed to construct a framework of factors influencing dietary behaviours in urban Africa. The framework adapted a widely used socio-ecological model (developed in a high-income country context) and was developed using a mixed-methods research approach that comprised: i. Evidence synthesis consisting of a systematic review of 39 papers covering 14 African countries; ii. Qualitative interview data collected for adolescents and adults (n = 144) using photovoice in urban Ghana and Kenya; and iii. Consultation with interdisciplinary African experts (n = 71) from 27 countries, who contributed to at least one step of the framework (creation, validation/evaluation, finalisation). The final framework included 103 factors influencing dietary behaviours. Experts identified the factors influencing dietary behaviours across all the four levels of the food environment i.e. the individual, social, physical and macro levels. Nearly half (n = 48) were individual-level factors and just under a quarter (n = 26) were at the macro environmental level. Fewer factors associated with social (n = 15) and physical (14) environments were identified. At the macro level, the factors ranked as most important were food prices, cultural beliefs and seasonality. Factors ranked as important at the social level were household composition, family food habits and dietary practices. The type of food available in the neighbourhood and convenience were seen as important at the physical level, while individual food habits, food preferences and socioeconomic status were ranked highly at the individual level. About half of the factors (n = 54) overlap with those reported in an existing socio-ecological food environment framework developed in a high-income country context. A further 49 factors were identified that were not reported in the selected high-income country framework, underlining the importance of contextualisation. Our conceptual framework offers a useful tool for research to understand dietary transitions in urban African adolescents and adults, as well as identification of factors to intervene when promoting healthy nutritious diets to prevent multiple forms of malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3156694795,"Background Clean water is an essential part of human healthy life and wellbeing. More recently, rapid population growth, high illiteracy rate, lack of sustainable development, and climate change; faces a global challenge in developing countries. The discontinuity of drinking water supply forces households either to use unsafe water storage materials or to use water from unsafe sources. The present study aimed to identify the determinants of water source types, use, quality of water, and sanitation perception of physical parameters among urban households in North-West Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among households from February to March 2019. An interview-based a pre-tested and structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data collection samples were selected randomly and proportional to each of the kebeles’ households. MS Excel and R Version 3.6.2 were used to enter and analyze the data; respectively. Descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages were used to explain the sample data concerning the predictor variable. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the association between independent and response variables. Results Four hundred eighteen (418) households have participated. Based on the study undertaken,78.95% of households used improved and 21.05% of households used unimproved drinking water sources. Households drinking water sources were significantly associated with the age of the participant (x 2 = 20.392, df = 3), educational status (x 2 = 19.358, df = 4), source of income (x 2 = 21.777, df = 3), monthly income (x 2 = 13.322, df = 3), availability of additional facilities (x 2 = 98.144, df = 7), cleanness status (x 2 = 42.979, df = 4), scarcity of water (x 2 = 5.1388, df = 1) and family size (x 2 = 9.934, df = 2). The logistic regression analysis also indicated that those factors are significantly determining the water source types used by the households. Factors such as availability of toilet facility, household member type, and sex of the head of the household were not significantly associated with drinking water sources. Conclusion The uses of drinking water from improved sources were determined by different demographic, socio-economic, sanitation, and hygiene-related factors. Therefore; the local, regional, and national governments and other supporting organizations shall improve the accessibility and adequacy of drinking water from improved sources in the area."
https://openalex.org/W3155888798,"Large carnivores have experienced widespread extirpation and species are now threatened globally. The ecological impact of the loss of large carnivores has been prominent in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, after most were extirpated during the 1977–92 civil war. To remedy this, reintroductions are now being implemented in Gorongosa, initiating with endangered African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus ), hereafter ‘wild dogs’. We describe the first transboundary translocation and reintroduction of founding packs of wild dogs to Gorongosa over a 28-month study period and evaluate the success of the reintroduction based on five key indicator categories. We also assess how wild dog space use and diet influenced their success. We found that pre-release, artificial pack formation in holding enclosures aided group cohesion and alpha pair establishment. Post-release, we also observed natural pack formations as a result of multiple dispersal events. Founder and naturally formed packs produced pups in two of the three breeding seasons and packs successfully recruited pups. Survival rate for all wild dogs was 73% and all mortality events were from natural causes. Consequently, the population grew significantly over the study period. All indicators of success were fully achieved and this study documents the first successful reintroduction of wild dogs into a large, unfenced landscape in Mozambique and only the second on the continent. Potential mechanisms underlying these early successes were the avoidance of habitats intensively used by lions, dietary partitioning with lion, avoidance of human settlements, and Gorongosa’s management strategy. We predict further population expansion in Gorongosa given that 68% of the park is still unused by wild dogs. This expansion could be stimulated by continued reintroductions over the short- to medium-term. Recovery of wild dogs in Gorongosa could aid in the re-establishment of a larger, connected population across the greater Gorongosa-Marromeu landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3156147181,"Maternal-offspring communication and care are essential for offspring survival. Oxytocin (OXT) is known for its role in initiation of maternal care, but whether OXT can rapidly influence maternal behavior or ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs; above 50 kHz) has not been examined. To test for rapid effects of OXT, California mouse mothers were administered an acute intranasal (IN) dose of OXT (0.8 IU/kg) or saline followed by a separation test with three phases: habituation with pups in a new testing chamber, separation via a wire mesh, and finally reunion with pups. We measured maternal care, maternal USVs, and pup USVs. In mothers, we primarily observed simple sweep USVs, a short downward sweeping call around 50 kHz, and in pups we only observed pup whines, a long call with multiple harmonics ranging from 20 kHz to 50 kHz. We found that IN OXT rapidly and selectively enhanced the normal increase in maternal simple sweep USVs when mothers had physical access to pups (habituation and reunion), but not when mothers were physically separated from pups. Frequency of mothers’ and pups’ USVs were correlated upon reunion, but IN OXT did not influence this correlation. Finally, mothers given IN OXT showed more efficient pup retrieval/carrying and greater total maternal care upon reunion. Behavioral changes were specific to maternal behaviors (e.g. retrievals) as mothers given IN OXT did not differ from controls in stress-related behaviors (e.g. freezing). Overall, these findings highlight the rapid effects and context-dependent effect a single treatment with IN OXT has on both maternal USV production and offspring care."
https://openalex.org/W3156551585,"A large number of GPCRs are potentially valuable drug targets but remain understudied. Many of these lack well-validated activating ligands and are considered “orphan” receptors, and G protein coupling profiles have not been defined for many orphan GPCRs. Here we asked if constitutive receptor activity can be used to determine G protein coupling profiles of orphan GPCRs. We monitored nucleotide-sensitive interactions between 48 understudied orphan GPCRs and five G proteins (240 combinations) using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). No receptor ligands were used, but GDP was used as a common G protein ligand to disrupt receptor-G protein complexes. Constitutive BRET between the same receptors and β-arrestins was also measured. We found sufficient GDP-sensitive BRET to generate G protein coupling profiles for 22 of the 48 receptors we studied. Altogether we identified 48 coupled receptor-G protein pairs, many of which have not been described previously. We conclude that receptor-G protein complexes that form spontaneously in the absence of guanine nucleotides can be used to profile G protein coupling of constitutively-active GPCRs. This approach may prove useful for studying G protein coupling of other GPCRs for which activating ligands are not available."
https://openalex.org/W3154613385,"Background Different levels of control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. Methods and findings Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 ( http://covidsim.eu/ ) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world—and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. Conclusions The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully."
https://openalex.org/W3156767108,"Bangladesh faces a severe rural to urban migration challenge, which is accentuated by climate change and the Rohingya crisis. These migrants often reside in urban slums and struggle to access public services, which are already short in supply for existing slum dwellers. Given the inadequacy of governmental efforts, nonprofits have assumed responsibility for providing essential services such as housing, healthcare, and education. Would local slum-dwellers in Dhaka be willing to support such nonprofits financially? We deploy an in-person survey experiment with three frames (generic migrants, climate migrants, and religiously persecuted Rohingya migrants) to assess Dhaka slum-dwellers’ willingness to support a humanitarian charity that provides healthcare services to migrants. Bangladesh is noted as a climate change hotspot and its government is vocal about the climate issue in international forums. While we expected this to translate into public support for climate migrants, we find respondents are 16% less likely to support climate migrants in relation to the generic migrants. However, consistent with the government’s hostility towards Rohingya, we find that respondents are 9% less likely to support a charity focused on helping Rohingya migrants. Our results are robust even when we examine subpopulations such as recent arrivals in Dhaka and those who have experienced floods (both of which could be expected to be more sympathetic to climate migrants), as well as those who regularly follow the news (and hence are well informed about the climate and the Rohingya crisis)."
https://openalex.org/W3153573768,"Introduction In Ethiopia there is an extensive unmet need for palliative care, while the burden of non-communicable diseases and cancer is increasing. This study aimed to explore palliative care needs and preferences of patients, their caregivers, and the perspective of stakeholders on service provision in palliative programs for women, mostly affected by cervical cancer and breast cancer. Methods A rapid program evaluation using a qualitative study approach was conducted in three home-based palliative care programs in Addis Ababa and Yirgalem town, Ethiopia. Female patients enrolled in the programs, and their primary caregivers were interviewed on palliative care needs, preferences and service provision. We explored the views of purposely selected stakeholders on the organization of palliative care and its challenges. Audio-taped data was transcribed verbatim and translated into English and an inductive thematic analysis was applied. Descriptive analyses were used to label physical signs and symptoms using palliative outcome scale score. Results A total of 77 interviews (34 patients, 12 primary caregivers, 15 voluntary caregivers, 16 stakeholders) were conducted. The main physical complaints were moderate to severe pain (70.6%), followed by anorexia (50.0%), insomnia, nausea and vomiting (41.2%). Social interaction and daily activities were hampered by the patients’ condition. Both patients and caregivers reported that programs focus most on treatment of symptoms, with limited psychosocial, emotional, spiritual and economic support. Lack of organizational structures and policy directions limit the collaboration between stakeholders and the availability of holistic home-based palliative care services. Conclusions Although female patients and caregivers appreciated the palliative care and support provided, the existing services did not cover all needs. Pain management and all other needed supports were lacking. Multi-sectorial collaboration with active involvement of community-based structures is needed to improve quality of care and access to holistic palliative care services."
https://openalex.org/W3156934986,"Excessive use of chemical fertilizers in agricultural practices have demonstrated a significant impact on microbial diversity and community in soil by altering soil physical and chemical properties, thereby leading to a certain degree of soil salinization and nutritional imbalances. As an organic amendment, maize straw has been widely used to improve soil quality; however, its effect on the soil bacterial community remains limited in Calcarie-Fluvie Cambisols soil in semi-humid arid plateau of North China. In the present experiment, we investigated the effects of continuous straw utilization and fertilization on bacterial communities in Shouyang, Shanxi province, China. Soil samples were collected from 5 different straw utilization and fertilization modes in the following ways: straw mulching (SM), straw crushing (SC), cattle manure (CM), in which way straw is firstly used as silage and then organic fertilizer, control with no straw return (NSR), and control without fertilizers (CK), same amount of N+P fertilizer was applied to the regimes except CK. High-throughput sequencing approaches were applied to the V3-V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA for analysis of the bacterial abundance and community structures. Different long-term straw returning regimes significantly altered the physicochemical properties and bacterial communities of soil, among which CM had the most significant effects on soil fertility and bacterial diversity. Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , Chloroflexi , Acidobacteria , and Gemmatimonadetes were consistently dominant in all soil samples, and Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed significant association of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and available potassium (AK) with alternation of the bacterial community. Cattle manure had the most beneficial effects on soil fertility and bacterial diversity among different straw utilization and fertilization modes."
https://openalex.org/W3156005152,"The health effects associated with fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) have attracted considerable public attention in recent decades. It has been verified that PM 2.5 can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and cause various diseases. While the association between diseases and PM 2.5 has been widely studied, this work aims to analyze the association between PM 2.5 and hospital visit rates for respiratory diseases in Taiwan. To this end, a disease mapping model that considers spatial effects is applied to estimate the association. The results show that there is a positive association between hospital visit rates and the PM 2.5 concentrations in the Taiwanese population in 2012 after controlling for other variables, such as smoking rates and the number of hospitals in each region. This finding indicates that control of PM 2.5 could decrease hospital visit rates for respiratory diseases in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3152779068,"Obesity during pregnancy increases the risk for maternal complications like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and maternal inflammation. Maternal obesity also increases the risk of childhood obesity, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and diabetes to the offspring. Increased circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) in obesity due to adipose tissue lipolysis induces lipoapoptosis to hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and pancreatic-β-cells. During the third trimester of human pregnancy, there is an increase in maternal lipolysis and release of FFAs into the circulation. It is currently unknown if increased FFAs during gestation as a result of maternal obesity cause placental cell lipoapoptosis. Increased exposure of FFAs during maternal obesity has been shown to result in placental lipotoxicity. The objective of the present study is to determine saturated FFA-induced trophoblast lipoapoptosis and also to test the protective role of monounsaturated fatty acids against FFA-induced trophoblast lipoapoptosis using in vitro cell culture model. Here, we hypothesize that saturated FFAs induce placental trophoblast lipoapoptosis, which was prevented by monounsaturated fatty acids.Biochemical and structural markers of apoptosis by characteristic nuclear morphological changes with DAPI staining, and caspase 3/7 activity was assessed. Cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 were examined by western blot analysis.Treatment of trophoblast cell lines, JEG-3 and JAR cells with palmitate (PA) or stearate (SA) induces trophoblast lipoapoptosis as evidenced by a significant increase in apoptotic nuclear morphological changes and caspase 3/7 activity. We observed that saturated FFAs caused a concentration-dependent increase in placental trophoblast lipoapoptosis. We also observed that monounsaturated fatty acids like palmitoleate and oleate mitigates placental trophoblast lipoapoptosis caused due to PA exposure.We show that saturated FFAs induce trophoblast lipoapoptosis. Co-treatment of monounsaturated fatty acids like palmitoleate and oleate protects against FFA-induced trophoblast lipoapoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3152822435,"Background COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 ( http://covidsim.eu/ ) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and—importantly—some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%–80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year’s flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management."
https://openalex.org/W3153408021,"Ischaemic Hepatitis (IH) or Hypoxic Hepatitis (HH) also known as centrilobular liver cell necrosis is an acute liver injury characterized by a rapid increase in serum aminotransferase. The liver injury typically results from different underlying medical conditions such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure and septic shock in which the liver becomes damaged due to deprivation of either blood or oxygen. IH is a potentially lethal condition that is often preventable if diagnosed timely. The role of mechanisms that cause IH is often not well understood, making it difficult to diagnose or accurately quantify the patterns of related biomarkers. In most patients, currently, the only way to determine a case of IH is to rule out all other possible conditions for liver injuries. A better understanding of the liver’s response to IH is necessary to aid in its diagnosis, measurement, and improve outcomes. The goal of this study is to identify mechanisms that can alter associated biomarkers for reducing the density of damaged hepatocytes, and thus reduce the chances of IH. We develop a mathematical model capturing dynamics of hepatocytes in the liver through the rise and fall of associated liver enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) related to the condition of IH. The model analysis provides a novel approach to predict the level of biomarkers given variations in the systemic oxygen in the body. Using IH patient data in the US, novel model parameters are described and then estimated for the first time to capture real-time dynamics of hepatocytes in the presence and absence of IH condition. The results may allow physicians to estimate the extent of liver damage in an IH patient based on their enzyme levels and receive faster treatment on a real-time basis."
https://openalex.org/W3155493998,"Dermal fibroblast aging contributes to aging-associated functional defects in the skin since dermal fibroblasts maintain skin homeostasis by interacting with the epidermis and extracellular matrix. Here, we found that puerarin, an isoflavone present in Pueraria lobata (Kudzu), can prevent the development of the aging-phenotype in human dermal fibroblasts. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) were subcultivated and high-passage cells were selected as senescent cells, whereas low-passage cells were selected as a young cell control. Puerarin treatment increased cell proliferation and decreased the proportion of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells in a high-passage culture of NHDFs. Moreover, puerarin treatment reduced the number of smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts and the expression of a reticular fibroblast marker, calponin 1 (CNN1), which were induced in high-passage NHDFs. Fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor antagonist, blocked the puerarin-mediated downregulation of SMA and CNN1. Our results suggest that puerarin may be a useful functional food that alleviates aging-related functional defects in dermal fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W3152884388,"In the aquaculture sector, a strategy for the more efficient use of resources and proper disease control is needed to overcome the challenges of meat production worldwide. Modulation of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota is a promising approach for promoting animal health and preventing infection. This feeding experiment was conducted to discover the phytonutrient-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract microbiota of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ). Acclimatized animals aged 7 months (30 weeks) were divided randomly into five experimental groups to investigate the effects of the applied feed additives. The dietary supplements were manufactured from anthocyanin-containing processing wastes from the food industry, specifically the production of Hungarian sour cherry extract, synbiotics from fermented corn, and fermentable oligosaccharides from Hungarian sweet red pepper seeds and carotenoids from Hungarian sweet red pepper pulps, applied at a dose of 1%. The gut contents of the animals were collected at four time points throughout the 6-week study period. To track the compositional and diversity changes in the microbiota of the carp intestinal tract, V3-V4 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomic sequencing was performed. The growth performance of common carp juveniles was not significantly affected by supplementation of the basal diet with plant extracts. Phytonutrients improve the community diversity, increase the Clostridium and Lactobacillus abundances and decrease the abundances of potentially pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, such as Shewanella , Pseudomonas , Acinetobacter and Aeromonas . The phyla Proteobacteria , Tenericutes and Chlamydiae were positively correlated with the body weight, whereas Spirochaetes and Firmicutes exhibited negatively correlations with the body weight. We hypothesize that the application of phytonutrients in aquaculture settings might be a reasonable green approach for easing the usage of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3153018967,"Background Prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in low- and middle-income countries is on the rise. We focused on multiple factors which could influence body mass index. Methods A cross sectional school-based study was conducted in Moshi, Tanzania. Primary school children aged 9–11 years were recruited from 20 schools through a multistage sampling technique. Questionnaires were used to collect information on physical activity and diet by food frequency questionnaire. Height and weight measurements were taken and body mass index z scores for age and sex (BMIZ) calculated using the WHO AnthroPlus. Children were considered thin if BMIZ was &lt;-2 standard deviations and overweight or obese if BMIZ was &gt;1 SD. Information on school policies and environment was obtained from headteachers. Correlates of overweight and obesity were examined using a multinomial multilevel logistic regression. Results A total of 1170 primary school children, of whom 636 (54%) were girls, were recruited from 20 schools. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 15% overall (overweight 9% and obesity 6%) and most prevalent in urban areas (23%) and in private schools (24%). Moreover, thinness was found to be (10%) overall, most prevalent in rural areas (13%) and in government schools (14%). At school level, residing in urban (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.49,5.68) and being in private school (aRRR 4.08; 95% CI 2.66,6.25) were associated with a higher risk of overweight and obesity while availability of playgrounds in schools (aRRR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47, 0.97) was associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity. At home level, availability of sugary drinks (aRRR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01,2.28) was associated with a higher risk of overweight and obesity. Conclusion Overweight and obesity are common in private schools and in urban settings. Efforts should be taken to ensure availability of playgrounds in schools and encouraging children to engage in physical activities."
https://openalex.org/W3153167933,"The tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) ripening inhibitor ( rin ) mutation completely represses fruit ripening, as rin fruits fail to express ripening-associated genes and remain green and firm. Moreover, heterozygous rin fruits ( rin /+) ripen normally but have extended shelf life, an important consideration for this perishable fruit crop; therefore, heterozygous rin has been widely used to breed varieties that produce red tomatoes with improved shelf life. We previously used CRISPR/Cas9 to produce novel alleles at the rin locus. The wild-type allele RIN encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and the novel allele, named as rinG2 , generates an early stop codon, resulting in C-terminal truncation of the transcription factor. Like rin fruits, rinG2 fruits exhibit extended shelf life, but unlike rin fruits, which remain yellow-green even after long-term storage, rinG2 fruits turn orange due to ripening-associated carotenoid production. Here, to explore the potential of the rinG2 mutation for breeding, we characterized the effects of rinG2 in the heterozygous state ( rinG2/+ ) compared to the effects of rin /+. The softening of rinG2/+ fruits was delayed compared to the wild type but to a lesser degree than rin/+ fruits. Lycopene and β-carotene levels in rinG2/+ fruits were similar to those of the wild type, whereas rin/+ fruits accumulated half the amount of β-carotene compared to the wild type. The rinG2/+ fruits produced lower levels of ethylene than wild-type and rin/+ fruits. Expression analysis revealed that in rinG2/+ fruits, the rinG2 mutation (like rin ) partially inhibited the expression of ripening-associated genes. The small differences in the inhibitory effects of rinG2 vs. rin coincided with small differences in phenotypes, such as ethylene production, softening, and carotenoid accumulation. Therefore, rinG2 represents a promising genetic resource for developing tomato cultivars with extended shelf life."
https://openalex.org/W3153299419,"Ocean acidification is one the biggest threats to marine ecosystems worldwide, but its ecosystem wide responses are still poorly understood. This study integrates field and experimental data into a mass balance food web model of a temperate coastal ecosystem to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact with one another. Specifically, we forced a food web model of a kelp forest ecosystem near its southern distribution limit in the California large marine ecosystem to a 0.5 pH drop over the course of 50 years. This study utilizes a modeling approach to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact. Isolating OA impacts on growth (Production), mortality (Other Mortality), and predation interactions (Vulnerability) or combining all three mechanisms together leads to a variety of ecosystem responses, with some taxa increasing in abundance and other decreasing. Results suggest that carbonate mineralizing groups such as coralline algae, abalone, snails, and lobsters display the largest decreases in biomass while macroalgae, urchins, and some larger fish species display the largest increases. Low trophic level groups such as giant kelp and brown algae increase in biomass by 16% and 71%, respectively. Due to the diverse way in which OA stress manifests at both individual and population levels, ecosystem-level effects can vary and display nonlinear patterns. Combined OA forcing leads to initial increases in ecosystem and commercial biomasses followed by a decrease in commercial biomass below initial values over time, while ecosystem biomass remains high. Both biodiversity and average trophic level decrease over time. These projections indicate that the kelp forest community would maintain high productivity with a 0.5 drop in pH, but with a substantially different community structure characterized by lower biodiversity and relatively greater dominance by lower trophic level organisms."
https://openalex.org/W3154035254,"Background The treatment of myopericarditis is different than that of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, since their clinical presentation is frequently similar it may be difficult to distinguish between these entities despite a disparate underlying pathogenesis. Myopericarditis is primarily an inflammatory disease associated with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and relatively low elevated troponin concentrations, while AMI is characterized by the opposite. We hypothesized that evaluation of the CRP/troponin ratio on presentation to the emergency department could improve the differentiation between these two related clinical entities whose therapy is different. Such differentiation should facilitate triage to appropriate and expeditious therapy. Methods We evaluated the CRP/troponin ratio on presentation among patients consecutively included in a large single center registry that included 1898 consecutive patients comprising 1025 ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, 518 Non-STEMI (NSTEMI) patients, and 355 patients diagnosed on discharge as myopericarditis. CRP and troponin were sampled on admission in all patients and their ratio was assessed against discharge diagnosis. ROC analysis of the CRP/troponin ratios evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of myopericarditis against all AMI, STEMI, and NSTEMI patients. Results Median admission CRP/troponin ratios were 84, 65, and 436 mg×ml/liter×ng in STEMI, NSTEMI and myopericarditis groups, respectively (p&lt;0.001) demonstrating good differentiating capability. The Receiver-operator-curve of admission CRP/troponin ratio for diagnosis of myopericarditis against all AMI, STEMI, and NSTEMI patients yielded an area-under-the curve of 0.74, 0.73, and 0.765, respectively. CRP/troponin ratio&gt;500 resulted in specificity exceeding 85%, and for a ratio&gt;1000, specificity&gt;92%. Conclusion The CRP/troponin ratio can serve as an effective tool to differentiate between myopericarditis and AMI. In the appropriate clinical context, the CRP/troponin ratio may preclude further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3154389819,"Currently available screening questionnaires for Autism spectrum disorders were tested in developed countries, but many require additional training and many are unsuitable for older individuals, thus reducing their utility in lower/ middle- income countries. We aimed to derive a simplified questionnaire that could be used to screen persons in India.We have previously validated Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA), that is now mandated for disability assessment by the Government of India. This detailed tool requires intensive training and it is time consuming. It was used to derive a new screening questionnaire: 1) items most frequently scored as positive by participants with autism in original ISAA validation study were modified for binary scoring following expert review. 2) In a new sample, clinically diagnosed individuals with/without autism were administered the screening tool and ISAA following written informed consent. Its psychometric properties were determined.A 10-item scale named Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire (IASQ) was prepared in Hindi and English. Thereafter 145 parents/caregivers of participants (autism, n = 90, other psychiatric disorders, n = 55) (ages 3-18), were administered IASQ and ISAA (parents/caregivers plus observation) by separate interviewers, blind to each other and to diagnosis. At a cutoff of 1, sensitivity was 99%, specificity 62%, Positive Predictive Value 81%, and Negative Predictive Value 95%. Test-retest reliability was r = 0.767 (CI = 0.62-0.86) and interrater reliability- Krippendorff""s-alpha was 0.872. The area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) was 95%. There was a significant difference on IASQ-scores between participants with and without a clinical diagnosis of Autism (t = 14.57, p<0.0001).The IASQ is a simple, easy to use screening tool with satisfactory reliability and validity, that can be administered to caregivers in 15 minutes and provides information about DSM 5 criteria for autism. It may be applicable outside India, following additional adaptation, for community-based studies."
https://openalex.org/W3154934287,"The common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is of great importance to the food and nutritional security of many populations, and exploitation of the crop’s genetic diversity is essential for the success of breeding programs. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of 215 common bean accessions, which included cultivars, obsolete cultivars, improved lines, and landraces using morpho-agronomic and biochemical traits, and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers (AFLP). Genetic parameters, box plots, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and Ward’s hierarchical clustering were used to analyze the data. The Jaccard similarity coefficient and neighbour-joining clustering method were used for molecular analysis. A wide variability among the accessions was observed for morpho-agronomic and biochemical traits. Selective accuracy (Ac) and broad-sense heritability (h 2 ) values were high to intermediate for all traits, except seed yield. Ward’s hierarchical clustering analysis generated six groups. AFLP analysis also revealed significant differences among the accessions. There was no correlation between the differences based on genetic markers and those based on morpho-agronomic and biochemical data, which indicates that both datasets are important for elucidating the differences among accessions. The results of the present study indicate great genetic diversity among the evaluated accessions."
https://openalex.org/W3155847983,"Background Adaptation, including changes in blood properties, to whole-body cryostimulation may depend on many factors, including body mass. Aim This study investigates whether hematological parameters change similarly in a group of people with obesity and a group of men with normal body weight after 10 and 20 cryostimulation treatments. Methods In our non-randomized trial, the participants were divided into two groups based on their body fat percentage: 14 men with a high (HBF = 29.35%) and 10 with a normal percent of body fat (NBF = 11.40%) and subjected to 20 whole body cryostimulation treatments (-120°C for 2–3 minutes). Blood samples were taken before the first and after the 10 th and 20 th cryostimulation. The following parameters were determined: red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets (PLT), red blood cell distribution width (RDW-SD), mean platelet volume (MPV), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEUT), lymphocytes (LYMPH), monocytes (MONO), eosinophils (EO) and basophiles (BASO). Results Statistically significant differences were found in red blood cells parameters such as RBC, HCT, MCV and MCHC. Time influence was noted for HCT, MCV and MCHC. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant correlation (for time and group) for 2 paramateres: RBC and MCV. For platelet parameters statistically significant differences were found for PLT (group influence) and MPV (time and group interaction). In white blood cells parameters statistically significant differences in levels of LYMPH were noted. Higher levels were observed for HBF group. Conclusions All observed changes were within the reference range, but hematological markers changed unevenly in people who are obese and non-obese. Therefore, it appears that an amount of fat tissue could be a factor causing the differences in adaptation to low temperature. It is suggested that 20 whole body cryostimulation sessions restore the state of homeostasis disturbed after 10 sessions. Trial registration ACTRN 12619000524190 ."

The aim of this study was to explore the ways in which that first wave of novel coronavirus infections resulted in uncertainties, as experienced by members of the oral health care workforce in British Columbia, Canada. Methods This qualitative inquiry purposefully recruited frontline oral health care workers, including dentists, dental hygienists, certified dental assistants, and administrative staff, via remote semi-structured interviews between April 20 and May 4, 2020. Coding, categories, and themes were inductively assigned. Results A total of 45 interviews, lasting between 39 and 74 minutes each, were conducted involving 18 dentists (6 females), 12 dental hygienists (11 females), 6 certified dental assistants (all females), and 9 administrators/front-desk staff (7 females). Fifty-one hours of audio recordings and more than 650 single-spaced pages of transcripts were produced. Five main themes emerged pertaining to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, patient care, personal lives and infectiousness, concern for the future, and variations among different pandemics. Certitudes were less evident, but surfaced mostly when considering a potential new normal resulting from the pandemic. Conclusion Participants indicated that the uncertainties they felt were dependent upon what is known, and unknown, about the pandemic and the provision of oral health care during the first wave of infections. Future studies are needed to include the viewpoints of oral health care workers from other provinces, as well the perceptions of patients who received oral health care during the height of the first wave of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3153342521,"Macrophages are innate immune cells that play critical roles in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and immune oncology. Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) overcome many limitations of using peripheral blood derived macrophages. The ability to scale up and cryopreserve a large amount of end stage macrophages from single clonal iPSCs from normal and disease specific donors offers a unique opportunity for genomic analysis and drug screening. The present study describes the step wise generation and characterization of macrophages from iPSCs using a defined serum free method amenable to scale up to generate a large batch of pure end stage cryopreservable macrophages expressing CD68, CD33, CD11c, CD11b, CD1a, HLA-DR, CD86, CD64, CD80, CD206, CD169, CD47, HLA-ABC, and CX3CR. The end stage macrophages pre and post cryopreservation retain purity, morphology, responsiveness to stimuli and display robust phagocytic function coming right out of cryopreservation. The same differentiation process was used to generate end stage macrophages from isogenic iPSCs engineered to mimic mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease (SNCA A53T), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (GRN2/GRN R493X), and Rett syndrome (MECP2-Knockout). End stage macrophages from isogenic engineered clones displayed differential macrophage-specific purity markers, phagocytic function, and response to specific stimuli. Thus, generating a panel of functional, physiologically relevant iPSC-derived macrophages can potentially facilitate the understanding of neural inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration."

A population-based household survey was implemented to provide information on HIV prevalence and cascade of care to inform and prioritize community-based HIV interventions in the district.A cross-sectional survey was conducted between September 2016 and January 2017. Using two-stage cluster sampling, eligible adult individuals aged ≥15 years living in the selected households were asked to participate. Participants were interviewed and tested for HIV at home. Those tested HIV-positive had their HIV-RNA viral load (VL) measured, regardless of their ART status. All participants tested HIV-positive at the time of the survey were advised to report their HIV test result to the health facility of their choice that MSF was supported in the district. HIV-RNA VL results were made available in this health facility.Among 5,315 eligible individuals, 91.1% were included in the survey and accepted an HIV test. The overall prevalence was 12.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 11.2-13.0) and was higher in women than in men: 14.0% versus 9.5%, P<0.001. Overall HIV-positive status awareness was 80.0% (95%CI: 76.4-83.1) and was associated with sex (P<0.05). Linkage to care was 78.0% (95%CI: 74.3-81.2) and participants in care 76.2% (95%CI: 72.4-79.5). ART coverage among participants aware of their HIV-positive status was 95.3% (95%CI: 92.9-96.9) and was not associated with sex (P = 0.55). Viral load suppression among participants on ART was 89.9% (95%CI: 86.6-92.4) and was not statistically different by sex (p = 0.40).Despite encouraging results in HIV testing coverage, cascade of care, and UNAIDS targets in Nsanje District, some gap remains in the first 90, specifically among men and young adults.

https://openalex.org/W3154292805,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes . CHIKV infection causes various rheumatic symptoms, including enthesitis; however, these effects are rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to describe the rheumatic manifestations in CHIKV infection, estimate the prevalence of enthesitis in CHIKV-infected patients, and determine the factors associated with CHIKV-induced enthesitis. We conducted a prospective, observational study in patients with CHIKV infection confirmed by positive RT-PCR or IgM assay from October 2019 to March 2020. Patients with pre-existing inflammatory rheumatic diseases were excluded. A rheumatologist evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, including the number of inflamed joints, enthesitis sites, tendinitis, and tenosynovitis. The Leeds enthesitis index (LEI) and the Maastricht ankylosing spondylitis enthesis score (MASES) were used to evaluate enthesitis sites. Factors associated with enthesitis were determined using logistic regression analysis. One hundred and sixty-four participants diagnosed with CHIKV infection were enrolled. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 48.2 (14) years. The most common pattern of rheumatic manifestations was polyarthritis with or without enthesitis. Enthesitis was observed in 63 patients (38.4%). The most common site of enthesitis was the left lateral epicondyle as assessed by LEI and the posterior superior iliac spine as assessed by MASES. Multivariate analysis indicated that the number of actively inflamed joints and Thai-HAQ score at the initial evaluation were significantly associated with the presence of enthesitis. The main rheumatic manifestations of CHIKV infection were arthritis/arthralgia, with enthesitis as a prominent extraarticular feature. CHIKV infection can cause enthesitis at peripheral and axial sites. We found that enthesitis was associated with a high number of inflamed joints and reduced physical function. These results indicate that the assessment of enthesitis should be considered when monitoring disease activity and as a treatment response parameter in CHIKV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W3154411964,"One critical element to optimize funding decisions involves the cost and efficiency implications of implementing alternative program components and configurations. Program planners, policy makers and funders alike are in need of relevant, strategic data and analyses to help them plan and implement effective and efficient programs. Contrary to widely accepted conceptions in both policy and academic arenas, average costs per service (so-called ""unit costs"") vary considerably across implementation settings and facilities. The objective of this work is twofold: 1) to estimate the variation of VMMC unit costs across service delivery platforms (SDP) in Sub-Saharan countries, and 2) to develop and validate a strategy to extrapolate unit costs to settings for which no data exists.We identified high-quality VMMC cost studies through a literature review. Authors were contacted to request the facility-level datasets (primary data) underlying their results. We standardized the disparate datasets into an aggregated database which included 228 facilities in eight countries. We estimated multivariate models to assess the correlation between VMMC unit costs and scale, while simultaneously accounting for the influence of the SDP (which we defined as all possible combinations of type of facility, ownership, urbanicity, and country), on the unit cost variation. We defined SDP as any combination of such four characteristics. Finally, we extrapolated VMMC unit costs for all SDPs in 13 countries, including those not contained in our dataset.The average unit cost was 73 USD (IQR: 28.3, 100.7). South Africa showed the highest within-country cost variation, as well as the highest mean unit cost (135 USD). Uganda and Namibia had minimal within-country cost variation, and Uganda had the lowest mean VMMC unit cost (22 USD). Our results showed evidence consistent with economies of scale. Private ownership and Hospitals were significant determinants of higher unit costs. By identifying key cost drivers, including country- and facility-level characteristics, as well as the effects of scale we developed econometric models to estimate unit cost curves for VMMC services in a variety of clinical and geographical settings.While our study did not produce new empirical data, our results did increase by a tenfold the availability of unit costs estimates for 128 SDPs in 14 priority countries for VMMC. It is to our knowledge, the most comprehensive analysis of VMMC unit costs to date. Furthermore, we provide a proof of concept of the ability to generate predictive cost estimates for settings where empirical data does not exist."

Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyse the information collected in the field work.A qualitative thematic analysis produced the following main theme: 1) Home birth journeys. Two sub-categories: 1.1) Making the decision to give birth at home, 1.2) Giving birth: (re)birth. And four sub-categories also emerged: 1.1.1) Why do I need to give birth at home? 1.1.2) The people around me don't support me; 1.2.1) Shifting emotions during home birth, 1.2.2) I (don't) want to be alone.We concluded that home births involve an intense and diverse range of satisfactions and tensions, the latter basically owing to the sociocultural resistance surrounding women. For this reason, they experienced home birth as an act of protest and highly valued the presence of midwives and their partners."

https://openalex.org/W3154335493,"Background Birth-preparedness and complication readiness is a comprehensive strategy aimed at promoting the timely utilization of skilled maternal and neonatal health care. Pregnancy-related complications both on the mother and the newborn could be largely alleviated if there is a well-consolidated birth preparedness and complication readiness plan developed during pregnancy and implemented at the time of delivery. Objective To determine the prevalence of birth preparedness and complication readiness practice (BPCR) and associated factors among pregnant women in North Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia, 2018. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women in North Gondar Zone from March 2017 to February 2018. A multistage clustered sampling technique was used to enroll a total of 1620 participants. The data were collected by face to face interviews using pretested and semi-structured questionnaires at baseline and following delivery. The data were entered using EPI-data version 3.1 and analyzed using STATA version 14 software. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to assess factors with BPCR practice. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval was used to determine the association between covariates and the outcome variable. Results From a total of 1620 pregnant women only 1523 (94.0%) mothers were followed at the end line. The prevalence of BPCR plan during pregnancy was 66.1% [95% CI: 63.8, 68.5] and the practice at the time of delivery was 73.5% [95% CI 71.3, 75.7]. Of the total respondents who mentioned having a BPCR plan, 76.4% practiced at the time of delivery. Frequency of ANC visits [AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.67, 2.32], larger number of family in the household [AOR = 1.14; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.30], highest wealth asset [AOR = 1.87; 95%CI: 1.16, 3.01], Multigravidity [AOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.62], husband involvement in decision making [AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.25, 3.82], counseled on BPCR [AOR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.51, 3.68], were found to be significantly associated with BPCR practice. Conclusion BPCR practice at the time of delivery was higher than previous studies conducted in the country. However, BPCR practice was found to be lower than the standard that every woman should practice the plan at the time of delivery. Intersectoral collaborative interventions required to improve the economic status and living standard of families in the community as well as various awareness creation strategies should be implemented to support women to attend ANC follow-up visits."
https://openalex.org/W3155325580,"Patients with repaired unilateral cleft lip with palate (UCLP) often show dysmorphology and distorted facial motion clinically, which can cause psychological issues. However, no report has clarified the details concerning distorted facial motion and the corresponding possible causative factors. In this study, we hypothesized that the physical properties of the scar and surrounding facial soft tissue might affect facial displacement while smiling in patients with UCLP (Cleft group). We thus examined the three-dimensional (3D) facial displacement while smiling in the Cleft and Control groups in order to determine whether or not the physical properties of facial soft tissues differ between the Cleft and Control groups and to examine the relationship between the physical properties of facial soft tissues on 3D facial displacement while smiling. Three-dimensional images at rest and while smiling as well as the facial physical properties (e.g. viscoelasticity) of both groups were recorded. Differences in terms of physical properties and facial displacement while smiling between the two groups were examined. To examine the relationship between facial surface displacement while smiling and physical properties, a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was conducted. As a result, three typical abnormal features of smiling in the Cleft group compared with the Control group were noted: less upward and backward displacement on the scar area, downward movement of the lower lip, and a greater asymmetric displacement, including greater lateral displacement of the subalar on the cleft side while smiling and greater alar backward displacement on the non-cleft side. The Cleft group also showed greater elastic modulus at the upper lip on the cleft side, suggesting hardened soft tissue at the scar. The CCA showed that this hard scar significantly affected facial displacement, inducing less upward and backward displacement on the scar area and downward movement of the lower lip in patients with UCLP (correlation coefficient = 0.82, p = 0.04); however, there was no significant relationship between greater nasal alar lateral movement and physical properties of the skin at the scar. Based on these results, personalizing treatment options for dysfunction in facial expression generation may require quantification of the 3D facial morphology and physical properties of facial soft tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3156918541,"Asteroid wasting events and mass mortality have occurred for over a century. We currently lack a fundamental understanding of the microbial ecology of asteroid disease, with disease investigations hindered by sparse information about the microorganisms associated with grossly normal specimens. We surveilled viruses and protists associated with grossly normal specimens of three asteroid species ( Patiriella regularis , Stichaster australis , Coscinasterias muricata ) on the North Island / Te Ika-a-Māui, Aotearoa New Zealand, using metagenomes prepared from virus and ribosome-sized material. We discovered several densovirus-like genome fragments in our RNA and DNA metagenomic libraries. Subsequent survey of their prevalence within populations by quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated their occurrence in only a few (13%) specimens (n = 36). Survey of large and small subunit rRNAs in metagenomes revealed the presence of a mesomycete (most closely matching Ichthyosporea sp.). Survey of large subunit prevalence and load by qPCR revealed that it is widely detectable (80%) and present predominately in body wall tissues across all 3 species of asteroid. Our results raise interesting questions about the roles of these microbiome constituents in host ecology and pathogenesis under changing ocean conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3153008964,"We present a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approach to sparse Poisson regression. The MIO approach to sparse linear regression was first proposed in the 1970s, but has recently received renewed attention due to advances in optimization algorithms and computer hardware. In contrast to many sparse estimation algorithms, the MIO approach has the advantage of finding the best subset of explanatory variables with respect to various criterion functions. In this paper, we focus on a sparse Poisson regression that maximizes the weighted sum of the log-likelihood function and the L 2 -regularization term. For this problem, we derive a mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIQO) formulation by applying a piecewise-linear approximation to the log-likelihood function. Optimization software can solve this MIQO problem to optimality. Moreover, we propose two methods for selecting a limited number of tangent lines effective for piecewise-linear approximations. We assess the efficacy of our method through computational experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets. Our methods provide better log-likelihood values than do conventional greedy algorithms in selecting tangent lines. In addition, our MIQO formulation delivers better out-of-sample prediction performance than do forward stepwise selection and L 1 -regularized estimation, especially in low-noise situations."
https://openalex.org/W3153670353,"Climatic models predict scenarios in which ambient temperature will continue increasing worldwide. Under these climatic conditions, fitness and animal welfare of many populations are expected to suffer, especially those that live in captive or semi-natural conditions, where opportunities of heat abatement are limited. We undertook an experimental design to assess the effect of heat abatement that water sprinkling might have on Iberian red deer calf growth and behaviour from birth to weaning (135 days). One group of ten mother-calf pairs lived on plots with water sprinkling (treatment) available during summer’s hottest time of the day, while the control group (nine mother-calf pairs) occupied plots with no available water sprinkling. Treatment and control groups were fed ad libitum and swapped between plots every seven days to minimise any plot effect. Body weight was monitored weekly and individual behaviour was recorded once or twice a week at mid-day. We observed that calves had showers under the sprinklers and wallowed in mud puddles. The results clearly indicated that calves of the treatment group showed a significant increase in body weight at weaning in comparison with the control group, with no differences between sexes (treatment: male = 56.5 kg, female = 50.3 kg; control: male = 50.3 kg, female = 46.5 kg). Mother weight and mother age effects were negligible on calf body weight at weaning. The heavier the mother the faster was the rate of growth of its offspring, irrespective of calf sex. The model indicated that although males grew significantly slower than female calves in the control group, males grew faster than females when exposed to the treatment. Calves of the treatment group spent less time drinking, less time in the shade, similar time eating and more time in motion than calves of the control group. There were no behavioural differences between calf sexes of treatment and control groups. The results indicate the importance of providing animals with opportunities of heat abatement in hot environments to improve animal growth and welfare in farmed Iberian red deer."
https://openalex.org/W3153753638,"Search results from local alignment search tools use statistical scores that are sensitive to the size of the database to report the quality of the result. For example, NCBI BLAST reports the best matches using similarity scores and expect values (i.e., e-values) calculated against the database size. Given the astronomical growth in genomics data throughout a genomic research investigation, sequence databases grow as new sequences are continuously being added to these databases. As a consequence, the results (e.g., best hits) and associated statistics (e.g., e-values) for a specific set of queries may change over the course of a genomic investigation. Thus, to update the results of a previously conducted BLAST search to find the best matches on an updated database, scientists must currently rerun the BLAST search against the entire updated database, which translates into irrecoverable and, in turn, wasted execution time, money, and computational resources. To address this issue, we devise a novel and efficient method to redeem past BLAST searches by introducing iBLAST. iBLAST leverages previous BLAST search results to conduct the same query search but only on the incremental (i.e., newly added) part of the database, recomputes the associated critical statistics such as e-values, and combines these results to produce updated search results. Our experimental results and fidelity analyses show that iBLAST delivers search results that are identical to NCBI BLAST at a substantially reduced computational cost, i.e., iBLAST performs (1 + δ )/ δ times faster than NCBI BLAST, where δ represents the fraction of database growth. We then present three different use cases to demonstrate that iBLAST can enable efficient biological discovery at a much faster speed with a substantially reduced computational cost."
https://openalex.org/W3154769932,"Objective To investigate whether dementia is associated with incidence of adverse events and longer hospital stays in older adults who underwent hip surgery, after adjusting for individual social and nursing care environment. Design and setting Retrospective observational study using the linked data between the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database and the reports of the medical functions of hospital beds database in Japan (April 2016—March 2017). Participants A total of 48,797 individuals aged 65 and older who underwent hip surgery and were discharged during the study period. Methods Outcomes included in-hospital death, in-hospital pneumonia, in-hospital fracture, and longer hospital stay. We performed two-level, multilevel models adjusting for individual and hospital characteristics. Results Among all participants, 20,638 individuals (42.3%) had dementia. The incidence of adverse events for those with and without dementia included in-hospital death: 2.11% and 1.11%, in-hospital pneumonia: 0.15% and 0.07%, and in-hospital fracture: 3.76% and 3.05%, respectively. The median (inter quartile range) length of hospital stay for those with and without dementia were 26 (19–39) and 25 (19–37) days, respectively. Overall, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) of dementia for in-hospital death, in-hospital pneumonia, and in-hospital fracture were 1.12 (0.95–1.33), 0.95 (0.51–1.80), and 1.08 (0.92–1.25), respectively. Dementia was not associated with the length of hospital stay (% change) (-0.7%, 95% CI -1.6–0.3%). Admission from home, discharge to home, and lower nurse staffing were associated with prolonged hospital stays. Conclusions Although adverse events are more likely to occur in older adults with dementia than in those without dementia after hip surgery, we found no evidence of an association between dementia and adverse events or the length of hospital stay after adjusting for individual social and nursing care environment."
https://openalex.org/W3155628755,"Background and purpose To compare 3D-Fast Gray Matter Acquisition with Phase Sensitive Inversion Recovery (3D-FGAPSIR) with conventional 3D-Short-Tau Inversion Recovery (3D-STIR) and sagittal T1-and T2-weighted MRI dataset at 3 Tesla when detecting MS spinal cord lesions. Material and methods This prospective single-center study was approved by an institutional review board and enrolled participants from December 2016 to August 2018. Two neuroradiologists blinded to all data, individually analyzed the 3D-FGAPSIR and the conventional datasets separately and in random order. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus by a third neuroradiologist. The primary judgment criterion was the number of MS spinal cord lesions. Secondary judgment criteria included lesion enhancement, lesion delineation, reader-reported confidence and lesion-to-cord-contrast-ratio. A Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the two datasets. Results 51 participants were included. 3D-FGAPSIR detected significantly more lesions than the conventional dataset (344 versus 171 respectively, p&lt;0.001). Two participants had no detected lesion on the conventional dataset, whereas 3D-FGAPSIR detected at least one lesion. 3/51 participants had a single enhancing lesion detected by both datasets. Lesion delineation and reader-reported confidence were significantly higher with 3D-FGAPSIR: 4.5 (IQR 1) versus 2 (IQR 0.5), p&lt;0.0001 and 4.5 (IQR 1) versus 2.5 (IQR 0.5), p&lt;0.0001. Lesion-to-cord-contrast-ratio was significantly higher using 3D-FGAPSIR as opposed to 3D-STIR and T2: 1.4 (IQR 0,3) versus 0.4 (IQR 0,1) and 0.3 (IQR 0,1)(p = 0.04). Correlations with clinical data and inter- and intra-observer agreements were higher with 3D-FGAPSIR. Conclusion 3D-FGAPSIR improved overall MS spinal cord lesion detection as compared to conventional set and detected all enhancing lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3156855965,"Augmentation of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, either by the classical L-arginine-NO synthase pathway, or the recently discovered entero-salivary nitrate-nitrite-NO system, may slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). To test this hypothesis, the expression of NO in human ADPKD cell lines (WT 9–7, WT 9–12), and the effect of L-arginine on an in vitro model of three-dimensional cyst growth using MDCK cells, was examined. In addition, groups of homozygous Pkd1 RC/RC mice (a hypomorphic genetic ortholog of ADPKD) received either low, moderate or high dose sodium nitrate (0.1, 1 or 10 mmol/kg/day), or sodium chloride (vehicle; 10 mmol/kg/day), supplemented drinking water from postnatal month 1 to 9 (n = 12 per group). In vitro , intracellular NO, as assessed by DAF-2/DA fluorescence, was reduced by &gt;70% in human ADPKD cell lines, and L-arginine and the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, both attenuated in vitro cyst growth by up to 18%. In contrast, in Pkd1 RC/RC mice, sodium nitrate supplementation increased serum nitrate/nitrite levels by ~25-fold in the high dose group (P&lt;0.001), but kidney enlargement and percentage cyst area was not altered, regardless of dose. In conclusion, L-arginine has mild direct efficacy on reducing renal cyst growth in vitro , whereas long-term sodium nitrate supplementation was ineffective in vivo . These data suggest that the bioconversion of dietary nitrate to NO by the entero-salivary pathway may not be sufficient to influence the progression of renal cyst growth in ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W3155689079,"Background and purpose With the availability and development of disease-modifying therapies for individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), new emerging phenotypes must be characterized, and potential new treatment paradigms tested. There is an urgent demand to develop an educational program that provides physical therapists (PTs) worldwide the necessary knowledge and training to contribute to best-practice care and clinical research. A competency based education framework is one that would focus on outcomes not process and where progression of learners would occur only after competencies are demonstrated. The first step toward such a framework is defining outcomes. The purpose of this Delphi study was to develop consensus on those competencies deemed essential within the SMA PT community. Methods Purposive selection and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit expert SMA PTs. Three web-based survey rounds were used to achieve consensus, defined as agreement among &gt;80% of respondents. The first round gathered demographic information on participants as well as information on clarity and redundancy on a list of competencies; the second round, collected the same information on the revised list and whether or not participants agreed if the identified domains captured the essence of a SMA PT as well as the definitions for each; and the third asked participants to rank their agreement with each competency. Results Consensus revealed 35 competencies, organized under 6 domains, which were deemed essential for a PT working with persons with SMA. Discussion In order to develop a curriculum to meet the physical therapy needs of persons with SMA, it is imperative to establish defined outcomes and to achieve consensus on those outcomes within the SMA community. Conclusions This study identified essential competencies that will help to provide guidance in development of a formal education program to meet these defined outcomes. This can foster best-practice care and clinical decision-making for all PTs involved in the care of persons with SMA in a clinical and research setting."
https://openalex.org/W3155821807,"Aim of this study is to evaluate whether magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is capable of measuring velocities occurring in the coronary arteries and to compute coronary flow reserve (CFR) in a canonical phantom as a preliminary study.For basic velocity measurements, a circulation phantom was designed containing replaceable glass tubes with three varying inner diameters, matching coronary-vessel diameters. Standardised boluses of superparamagnetic-iron-oxide-nanoparticles were injected and visualised by MPI. Two image-based techniques were competitively applied to calibrate the respective glass tube and to compute the mean velocity: full-duration-at-half-maximum (FDHM) and tracer dilution (TD) method. For CFR-calculation, four necessary settings of the circulation model of a virtual vessel with an inner diameter of 4 mm were generated using differently sized glass tubes and a stenosis model. The respective velocities in stenotic glass tubes were computed without recalibration.On velocity level, comparison showed a good agreement (rFDHM = 0.869, rTD = 0.796) between techniques, preferably better for 4 mm and 6 mm inner diameter glass tubes. On CFR level MPI-derived CFR-prediction performed considerably inferior with a relative error of 20-44%.MPI has the ability to reliably measure coronary blood velocities at rest as well as under hyperaemia and therefore may be suitable for CFR calculation. Calibration-associated accuracy of CFR-measurements has to be improved substantially in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3156837963,"Pregnancy is a complicated and long procedure during one or more offspring development inside a woman. A short period of oxygen shortage after birth is quite normal for most babies and does not threaten their health. However, if babies have to suffer from a long period of oxygen shortage, then this condition is an indication of pathological fetal intolerance, which probably causes their death. The identification of the pathological fetal intolerance from the physical oxygen shortage is one of the important clinical problems in obstetrics for a long time. The clinical syndromes typically manifest five symptoms that indicate that the baby may suffer from fetal intolerance. At present, liquid biopsy combined with high-throughput sequencing or mass spectrum techniques provides a quick approach to detect real-time alteration in the peripheral blood at multiple levels with the rapid development of molecule sequencing technologies. Gene methylation is functionally correlated with gene expression; thus, the combination of gene methylation and expression information would help in screening out the key regulators for the pathogenesis of fetal intolerance. We combined gene methylation and expression features together and screened out the optimal features, including gene expression or methylation signatures, for fetal intolerance prediction for the first time. In addition, we applied various computational methods to construct a comprehensive computational pipeline to identify the potential biomarkers for fetal intolerance dependent on the liquid biopsy samples. We set up qualitative and quantitative computational models for the prediction for fetal intolerance during pregnancy. Moreover, we provided a new prospective for the detailed pathological mechanism of fetal intolerance. This work can provide a solid foundation for further experimental research and contribute to the application of liquid biopsy in antenatal care."
https://openalex.org/W3152587247,"Measuring airways in chest computed tomography (CT) scans is important for characterizing diseases such as cystic fibrosis, yet very time-consuming to perform manually. Machine learning algorithms offer an alternative, but need large sets of annotated scans for good performance. We investigate whether crowdsourcing can be used to gather airway annotations. We generate image slices at known locations of airways in 24 subjects and request the crowd workers to outline the airway lumen and airway wall. After combining multiple crowd workers, we compare the measurements to those made by the experts in the original scans. Similar to our preliminary study, a large portion of the annotations were excluded, possibly due to workers misunderstanding the instructions. After excluding such annotations, moderate to strong correlations with the expert can be observed, although these correlations are slightly lower than inter-expert correlations. Furthermore, the results across subjects in this study are quite variable. Although the crowd has potential in annotating airways, further development is needed for it to be robust enough for gathering annotations in practice. For reproducibility, data and code are available online: \url{http://github.com/adriapr/crowdairway.git}."
https://openalex.org/W3152728483,"Background Cognitive reappraisal is a strategy for emotional regulation, important in the context of anxiety disorders. It is not known whether anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines affect cognitive reappraisal. Aims We aimed to investigate the effect of 25 mg oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal. Methods In a preliminary investigation, 33 healthy male volunteers were randomised to oxazepam or placebo, and then underwent an experiment where they were asked to use cognitive reappraisal to upregulate or downregulate their emotional response to images with negative or neutral emotional valence. We recorded unpleasantness ratings, skin conductance, superciliary corrugator muscle activity, and heart rate. Participants completed rating scales measuring empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index, IRI), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, TAS-20), and psychopathy (Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised, PPI-R). Results Upregulation to negative-valence images in the cognitive reappraisal task caused increased unpleasantness ratings, corrugator activity, and heart rate compared to downregulation. Upregulation to both negative- and neutral-valence images caused increased skin conductance responses. Oxazepam caused lower unpleasantness ratings to negative-valence stimuli, but did not interact with reappraisal instruction on any outcome. Self-rated trait empathy was associated with stronger responses to negative-valence stimuli, whereas self-rated psychopathic traits were associated with weaker responses to negative-valence stimuli. Conclusions While 25 mg oxazepam caused lower unpleasantness ratings in response to negative-valence images, we did not observe an effect of 25 mg oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal."
https://openalex.org/W3155403224,"The European sunflower moth, Homoesoma nebulellum (Denis et Schiffermüller), emerged as a major new pest in Bayannur, China, in 2006. Insecticidal control with a single application is problematic because timing is critical, and multiple applications increase production and environmental costs. Management of H . nebulellum by planting date adjustment can be effective, but the optimal time window for late planting is unknown. Natural levels of H . nebulellum infestation were compared among sunflowers planted on five dates from April 25 to June 5 in two years, and the relationship between timing of adult abundance and flowering assessed. Delaying planting of sunflower from the traditional planting period of April 25 –May 5 to May 15 –June 5 significantly decreased damage by H . nebulellum . Seed infestation rate was 30–40 times higher, and number of larvae/head 75–100 times higher in the earliest two plantings than in the latest two. Within two years of implementing delayed planting in Bayannur city, infestation area decreased from 72% in 2006 to 1.5% in 2008, and production losses decreased from 4.5 ton/ha in 2006 to 0.36 ton/ha in 2008, a 97% decrease compared to 2006. Moreover, the infestation area caused by H . nebulellum was continuously controlled below 5.3% of the planting area since 2008. We found the overlap between the first two days of flowering and peak adult presence was the key factor influencing level of damage caused by H . nebulellum . Because the number of eggs laid in the first two days of flowering accounted for 68% of the total, and sunflower seed infestation rate was positively correlated with the number of trapped adults weighted by proportion of daily oviposition. Oviposition of the majority of eggs in the first two days of flowering suggests an evolutionary mechanism whereby females choose host plants most conducive to larval development, consistent with the preference-performance hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3156731481,"It is not fully understood how enzymes are regulated in the tiny reaction field of a cell. Several enzymatic proteins form cytoophidia, a cellular macrostructure to titrate enzymatic activities. Here, we show that the epileptic encephalopathy-associated protein Tbc1d24 forms cytoophidia in neuronal cells both in vitro and in vivo . The Tbc1d24 cytoophidia are distinct from previously reported cytoophidia consisting of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (Impdh) or cytidine-5’-triphosphate synthase (Ctps). Tbc1d24 cytoophidia is induced by loss of cellular juvenescence caused by depletion of Gm14230 , a juvenility-associated lncRNA (JALNC) and zeocin treatment. Cytoophidia formation is associated with impaired enzymatic activity of Tbc1d24. Thus, our findings reveal the property of Tbc1d24 to form cytoophidia to maintain neuronal cellular juvenescence."
