https://openalex.org/W2997017923,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia leading to high mortality rates. Inflammation triggered by pneumococcal infection is necessary for bacterial clearance but must be spatially and temporally regulated to prevent further tissue damage and bacterial dissemination. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) mainly acts through Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) inducing the resolution of inflammation. Here, we have evaluated the role of AnxA1 and FPR2 during pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. For that, AnxA1, Fpr2/3 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) controls were infected intranasally with S pneumoniae. AnxA1 and Fpr2/3 KO mice were highly susceptible to infection, displaying uncontrolled inflammation, increased bacterial dissemination, and pulmonary dysfunction compared to WT animals. Mechanistically, the absence of AnxA1 resulted in the loss of lung barrier integrity and increased neutrophil activation upon S pneumoniae stimulation. Importantly, treatment of WT or AnxA1 KO-infected mice with Ac2-26 decreased inflammation, lung damage, and bacterial burden in the airways by increasing macrophage phagocytosis. Conversely, Ac2-26 peptide was ineffective to afford protection in Fpr2/3 KO mice during infection. Altogether, these findings show that AnxA1, via FPR2, controls inflammation and bacterial dissemination during pneumococcal pneumonia by promoting host defenses, suggesting AnxA1-based peptides as a novel therapeutic strategy to control pneumococcal pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2995830422,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most common mycotoxins that contaminates food or feed and cause intestinal damage. Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as EPA and DHA exert beneficial effects on intestinal integrity in animal models and clinical trials. Necroptosis signaling pathway plays a critical role in intestinal cell injury. This study tested the hypothesis that EPA and DHA could alleviate DON-induced injury to intestinal porcine epithelial cells through modulation of the necroptosis signaling pathway. Intestinal porcine epithelial cell 1 (IPEC-1) cells were cultured with or without EPA or DHA (6.25-25 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/mL DON for indicated time points. Cell viability, cell number, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, cell necrosis, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran 4kDa (FD4) flux, tight junction protein distribution, and protein abundance of necroptosis related signals were determined. EPA and DHA promoted cell growth indicated by higher cell viability and cell number, and inhibited cell injury indicated by lower LDH activity in the media. EPA and DHA also improved intestinal barrier function, indicated by higher TEER and lower permeability of FD4 flux as well as increased proportions of tight junction proteins located in the plasma membrane. Moreover, EPA and DHA decreased cell necrosis demonstrated by live cell imaging and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, EPA and DHA downregulated protein expressions of necroptosis related signals including tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3, phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL), phosphoglycerate mutase family 5 (PGAM5), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1). EPA and DHA also inhibited protein expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8. These results suggest that EPA and DHA prevent DON-induced intestinal cell injury and enhance barrier function, which is associated with inhibition of the necroptosis signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2995619852,"Hypoxia-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is an important cause of renal fibrosis that is triggered by unknown mechanisms. Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) is a newly discovered key molecule that causes ECM deposition. We used the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model to investigate the expression and mechanisms of HE4 in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Results were confirmed in the HK2 cell line and in human donors of kidney tissue with chronic kidney disease. Hypoxia significantly increased HE4 in renal tubular epithelial cells. HE4 overexpression activated the NF-κB pathway through the NF-κB transcription-activating group P65 by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-κB upregulated tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases 1, which may inhibit ECM degradation through inhibition of matrix metallopeptidase 2 activity. Silencing HE4 inhibited hypoxia-induced ECM deposition and alleviated fibrosis in UUO mice in vivo and blocked NF-κB activation in vitro. Expression of HE4 in the tubulointerstitium was positively correlated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis in tissue samples from patients with chronic kidney disease. Our results suggest that hypoxia induces renal fibrosis by upregulating HE4 and activating the HIF-1α/HE4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms and function of HE4 overexpression in hypoxia-induced renal fibrosis will provide important insights into understanding renal fibrosis and antifibrotic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2997669198,"Cellular senescence acts as an important barrier to tumorigenesis by eliminating precancerous cells. Previous studies have shown an essential role of the tumor suppressor p53 in cellular senescence, but how p53 induces cellular senescence is not fully understood. We found that p53 promoted the formation of highly interconnected and elongated mitochondria prior to the onset of cellular senescence. The inhibition of mitochondrial elongation upon p53 expression suppressed cellular senescence, suggesting that mitochondrial elongation is required for the induction of p53-dependent senescence. p53-induced mitochondrial elongation resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, an important mediator of cellular senescence. Mechanistically, the inhibitory phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637 increased upon p53 expression, suppressing the translocation of Drp1 into mitochondria. The transcriptional function of p53 was crucial for controlling the inhibitory phosphorylation of Drp1, whereas p21 was nonessential. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity was responsible for p53-mediated Drp1 Ser637 phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, these results suggest that p53 regulates mitochondrial dynamics through the PKA-Drp1 pathway to induce cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2998105885,"Mitochondrial quality control maintains mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Despite the identification of mitochondrial quality control factors, little is known about the crucial regulators coordinating both mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Through a cell-based functional screening assay, FK506 binding protein 8 (FKBP8) was identified to target microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to the mitochondria and to change mitochondrial morphology. Microscopy analysis revealed that the formation of tubular and enlarged mitochondria was observed in FKBP8 knockdown HeLa cells and the cortex of Fkbp8 heterozygote-knockout mouse embryos. Under iron depletion-induced stress, FKBP8 was recruited to the site of mitochondrial division through budding and colocalized with LC3. FKBP8 was also found to be required for mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy under hypoxic stress. Conversely, FKBP8 overexpression induced mitochondrial fragmentation in HeLa cells, human fibroblasts and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and this fragmentation occurred in Drp1 knockout MEF cells, FIP200 knockout HeLa cells and BNIP3/NIX double knockout HeLa cells, but not in Opa1 knockout MEFs. Interestingly, we found an LIR motif-like sequence (LIRL), as well as an LIR motif, at the N-terminus of FKBP8 and LIRL was essential for both inducing mitochondrial fragmentation and binding of FKBP8 to OPA1. Together, we suggest that FKBP8 plays an essential role in mitochondrial fragmentation through LIRL during mitophagy and this activity of FKBP8 together with LIR is required for mitophagy under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2996923656,"Diet plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A recent epidemiological study has shown an inverse relationship between nutritional manganese (Mn) status and IBD patients. Mn is an essential micronutrient required for normal cell function and physiological processes. To date, the roles of Mn in intestinal homeostasis remain unknown and the contribution of Mn to IBD has yet to be explored. Here, we provide evidence that Mn is critical for the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and that Mn deficiency exacerbates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Specifically, when treated with DSS, Mn-deficient mice showed increased morbidity, weight loss, and colon injury, with a concomitant increase in inflammatory cytokine levels and oxidative and DNA damage. Even without DSS treatment, dietary Mn deficiency alone increased intestinal permeability by impairing intestinal tight junctions. In contrast, mice fed a Mn-supplemented diet showed slightly increased tolerance to DSS-induced experimental colitis, as judged by the colon length. Despite the well-appreciated roles of intestinal microbiota in driving inflammation in IBD, the gut microbiome composition was not altered by changes in dietary Mn. We conclude that Mn is necessary for proper maintenance of the intestinal barrier and provides protection against DSS-induced colon injury."
https://openalex.org/W2998728164,"Osterix is a critical transcription factor of mesenchymal stem cell fate, where its loss or loss of Wnt signaling diverts differentiation to a chondrocytic lineage. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration activates the differentiation of prehypertrophic chondrocyte-like cells and inactivates Wnt signaling, but its interactive role with osterix is unclear. First, compared to young-adult (5 mo), mechanical compression of old (18 mo) IVD induced greater IVD degeneration. Aging (5 vs 12 mo) and/or compression reduced the transcription of osterix and notochordal marker T by 40-75%. Compression elevated the transcription of hypertrophic chondrocyte marker MMP13 and pre-osterix transcription factor RUNX2, but less so in 12 mo IVD. Next, using an Ai9/td reporter and immunohistochemical staining, annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells of young-adult IVD expressed osterix, but aging and compression reduced its expression. Lastly, in vivo LRP5-deficiency in osterix-expressing cells inactivated Wnt signaling in the nucleus pulposus by 95%, degenerated the IVD to levels similar to aging and compression, reduced the biomechanical properties by 45-70%, and reduced the transcription of osterix, notochordal markers and chondrocytic markers by 60-80%. Overall, these data indicate that age-related inactivation of Wnt signaling in osterix-expressing cells may limit regeneration by depleting the progenitors and attenuating the expansion of chondrocyte-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2998583633,"Newly weaned piglets challenged with Salmonella infantis were particularly susceptible, whereas oral preadministration of Lactobacillus johnsonii L531 alleviated enteritis and promoted intestinal secretory IgA production. Salmonella infantis-induced activation of NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and (nuclear factor kappa B) NF-κB signaling in the small intestine was also inhibited by L. johnsonii L531 pretreatment, thus limiting inflammation. An IPEC-J2 cell model of S. infantis infection yielded similar results. Salmonella infantis infection also resulted in mitochondrial damage and impaired mitophagy in the ileum and IPEC-J2 cells, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence colocalization of mitochondria with microtubule-binding protein light chain 3 (LC3) and high expression of autophagy-related proteins PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), optineurin (OPTN), and LC3 by Western blotting analysis. However, L. johnsonii L531 pretreatment reduced both the extent of mitochondrial damage and autophagy-related protein expression. Our findings suggest that the amelioration of S. infantis-associated enteritis by L. johnsonii L531 is associated with regulation of NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and NF-κB signaling pathway activation and suppression of mitochondrial damage. Amelioration of impaired mitophagy by L. johnsonii L531 could involve eliminating damaged mitochondria and regulating S. infantis-induced activation of the NF-κB-SQSTM1mitophagy signaling pathway in host cells to prevent the further mitochondrial damage and S. infantis dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2999290570,"Dense granule protein 12 (GRA12) is implicated in a range of processes related to the establishment of Toxoplasma gondii infection, such as the formation of the intravacuolar network (IVN) within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). This protein is also thought to be important for T. gondii-host interaction, pathogenesis, and immune evasion, but their exact roles remain unknown. In this study, the contributions of GRA12 to the molecular pathogenesis of T. gondii infection were examined in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of GRA12 in type I RH and type II Pru T. gondii strains did not affect the parasite growth and replication in vitro, however, it caused a significant reduction in the parasite virulence and tissue cyst burden in vivo. T. gondii Δgra12 mutants were more vulnerable to be eliminated by host immunity, without the accumulation of immunity-related GTPase a6 (Irga6) onto the PV membrane. The ultrastructure of IVN in Δgra12 mutants appeared normal, suggesting that GRA12 is not required for biogenesis of the IVN. Combined deletion of GRA12 and ROP18 induced more severe attenuation of virulence compared to single Δgra12 or Δrop18 mutant strains. These data suggest a functional association between GRA12 and ROP18 that is revealed by the severe attenuation of virulence in a double mutant relative to the single individual mutations. Future studies are needed to define the molecular basis of this putative association. Collectively these findings indicate that although GRA12 is not essential for the parasite growth and replication in vitro, it contributes to the virulence and growth of T. gondii in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2997005318,"Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Arctigenin, the main active constituent in Fructus Arctii (a traditional Chinese medicine), has previously been found to attenuate colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. The present study investigated whether and how arctigenin protects against the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD. Arctigenin maintained the intestinal epithelial barrier function of mice with DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis. In Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, arctigenin lowered the monolayer permeability, increased TEER, reversed the abnormal expression of tight junction proteins, and restored the altered localization of F-actin induced by TNF-α and IL-1β. The specific antagonist PHTPP or shRNA of ERβ largely weakened the protective effect of arctigenin on the epithelial barrier function of Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Molecular docking demonstrated that arctigenin had high affinity for ERβ mainly through hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic effects, and the protective effect of arctigenin on the intestinal barrier function was largely diminished in ERβ-mutated (ARG346 and/or GLU305) Caco-2 cells. Moreover, arctigenin-blocked TNF-α induced increase of the monolayer permeability in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells and the activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/myosin light chain (MLC) pathway in an ERβ-dependent manner. ERβ deletion in colons of mice with DSS-induced colitis resulted in a significant attenuation of the protective effect of arctigenin on the barrier integrity and colon inflammation. Arctigenin maintained the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier under IBD by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins through the ERβ-MLCK/MLC pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2998307971,"Latent viral reactivation is a commonly reported manifestation of immune system dysregulation during spaceflight. As physical fitness and exercise training have been shown to benefit multiple arms of the immune system, we hypothesized that higher levels of preflight physical fitness and/or maintaining fitness during a mission would protect astronauts from latent viral reactivation. Standardized tests of maximal strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were performed in 22 international space station (ISS) crewmembers before and after a ~6-month mission. Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) was determined in crewmembers and ground-based controls before, during, and after spaceflight. Crewmembers with higher CRF before spaceflight had a 29% reduced risk of latent viral reactivation compared to crew with lower CRF. Higher preflight upper body muscular endurance was associated with a 39% reduced risk of viral reactivation, a longer time to viral reactivation, and lower peak viral DNA concentrations, particularly for EBV and VZV. Latent viral reactivation rates were highest in crew with lower preflight CRF and higher levels of CRF deconditioning on return to Earth. We conclude that physical fitness may protect astronauts from latent viral reactivation during long duration spaceflight missions."
https://openalex.org/W2999027342,"Macrophages are the professional phagocytes that protect the host from infection or injury. Tissue microenvironment at the site of injury and inflammation is characterized by low oxygen concentration and poor supply of nutrients. The responding macrophages have to advance against oxygen and nutrient gradients to reach the site of inflammation to perform host protection, and tissue repair functions. Thus, evolution has fashioned macrophages to orchestrate a coordinated inflammatory and hypoxic gene program to mount an effective immune response. Here, we discovered that Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) governs macrophage functions by promoting inflammatory and hypoxic response gene programming. Our in vivo studies revealed that myeloid-KLF6-deficient mice were highly resistant to endotoxin-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome symptomatology and mortality. Using complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, we observed that KLF6 overexpression elevate and KLF6 deficiency attenuate inducible HIF1α expression in macrophages. Our integrated transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analysis studies uncovered that KLF6 deficiency attenuates broad inflammatory and glycolytic gene expression in macrophages. More importantly, overexpression of oxygen stable HIF1α reversed attenuated proinflammatory and glycolytic gene expression in KLF6-deficient macrophages. Collectively, our studies uncovered that KLF6 govern inflammatory and hypoxic response by regulating HIF1α expression in macrophage."
https://openalex.org/W2994847345,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a ω-3 fatty acid typically obtained from the diet or endogenously synthesized through the action of elongases (ELOVLs) and desaturases. DHA is a key central nervous system constituent and the precursor of several molecules that regulate the resolution of inflammation. In the present study, we questioned whether the impaired synthesis of DHA affected neural plasticity and inflammatory status in the adult brain. To address this question, we investigated neural and inflammatory markers from mice deficient for ELOVL2 (Elovl2−/−), the key enzyme in DHA synthesis. From our findings, Elovl2−/− mice showed an altered expression of markers involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory formation such as Egr-1, Arc1, and BDNF specifically in the cerebral cortex, impacting behavioral functions only marginally. In parallel, we also found that DHA-deficient mice were characterized by an increased expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, namely TNF, IL-1β, iNOS, caspase-1 as well as the activation and morphologic changes of microglia in the absence of any brain injury or disease. Reintroducing DHA in the diet of Elovl2−/− mice reversed such alterations in brain plasticity and inflammation. Hence, impairment of systemic DHA synthesis can modify the brain inflammatory and neural plasticity status, supporting the view that DHA is an essential fatty acid with an important role in keeping inflammation within its physiologic boundary and in shaping neuronal functions in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2996195365,"Pharmacologic HIF hydroxylase inhibitors (HIs) are effective for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients and may also be beneficial for the treatment of diseases such as chronic inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The selectivities of many HIs for HIF hydroxylases and possible off-target effects in cellulo are unclear, delaying the translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials. We developed a novel assay that discriminates between the inhibition of HIF-α prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes and HIF-α asparagine hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). We characterized 15 clinical and preclinical HIs, categorizing them into pan-HIF-α hydroxylase (broad spectrum), PHD-selective, and FIH-selective inhibitors, and investigated their effects on HIF-dependent transcriptional regulation, erythropoietin production, and cellular energy metabolism. While energy homeostasis was generally maintained following HI treatment, the pan-HIs led to a stronger increase in pericellular pO2 than the PHD/FIH-selective HIs. Combined knockdown of FIH and PHD-selective inhibition did not further increase pericellular pO2 . Hence, the additional increase in pericellular pO2 by pan- over PHD-selective HIs likely reflects HIF hydroxylase independent off-target effects. Overall, these analyses demonstrate that HIs can lead to oxygen redistribution within the cellular microenvironment, which should be considered as a possible contributor to HI effects in the treatment of hypoxia-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2996960467,"Glucocorticoids are widely used for the suppression of inflammation, but evidence is growing that they can have rapid, non-genomic actions that have been unappreciated. Diverse cell signaling effects have been reported for glucocorticoids, leading us to hypothesize that glucocorticoids alone can swiftly increase the 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. We found that prednisone, fluticasone, budesonide, and progesterone each increased cAMP levels within 3 minutes without phosphodiesterase inhibitors by measuring real-time cAMP dynamics using the cAMP difference detector in situ assay in a variety of immortalized cell lines and primary human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. A membrane- impermeable glucocorticoid showed similarly rapid stimulation of cAMP, implying that responses are initiated at the cell surface. siRNA knockdown of Gαs virtually eliminated glucocorticoid-stimulated cAMP responses, suggesting that these drugs activate the cAMP production via a G protein-coupled receptor. Estradiol had small effects on cAMP levels but G protein estrogen receptor antagonists had little effect on responses to any of the glucocorticoids tested. The genomic and non-genomic actions of budesonide were analyzed by RNA-Seq analysis of 24 hours treated HASM, with and without knockdown of Gαs. A 140-gene budesonide signature was identified, of which 48 genes represent a non-genomic signature that requires Gαs signaling. Collectively, this non-genomic cAMP signaling modality contributes to one-third of the gene expression changes induced by glucocorticoid treatment and shifts the view of how this important class of drugs exerts its effects."
https://openalex.org/W2997571240,"Key molecules promoting migration and invasion exist in the extracellular matrix, and include chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S), functionally important carbohydrate chains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that participate in regulating cancer development. Here, we show that C4S and C6S expression is upregulated in human glioma tissues, when compared to normal brain tissue, and that the extent of upregulation positively correlated with glioma malignancy. Treatment of cultured glioma cells with C4S and C6S enhanced cell viability, migration, and invasion, increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, enhanced N-cadherin, but reduced E-cadherin expression. Inhibition of expression of the two CS synthetic enzymes chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1/CHST11) and chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1/CHST3) suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion, reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, and reduced N-cadherin expression, but increased E-cadherin levels. The C4S- and C6S-enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expression of MMP-2 occurred via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, known to be involved in promoting cell migration and invasion. In immune-deficient larval zebrafish, C4S and C6S increased the numbers of viable tumor cells, thereby promoting glioma cell proliferation. The present observations point to a novel role of C4S and C6S in human glioma cell functions, thus possibly representing targets in glioma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2998209433,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (proBDNF) has been reported to strengthen the dysfunction of monocytes/macrophages in animal studies. However, it is still unknown the roles of proBDNF in the dysfunction of monocytes in the inflammatory diseases in humans. In the present study, we showed that proBDNF and pan neurotrophic receptor p75 were significantly upregulated in monocytes from healthy donors (HD) after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Exogenous proBDNF treatment upregulated CD40 and proinflammatory cytokines expression in monocytes including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In Stanford type-A acute aortic dissection (AAD) patients, proBDNF was upregulated in CD14+ CD163+ CX3CR1+ M2- but not CD14+ CD68+ CCR2+ M1-like monocytes. In addition, sera from AAD patients activated gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in cultured PBMCs from HD, which was attenuated by proBDNF monoclonal antibody (Ab-proB) treatment. These findings suggested that upregulation of proBDNF in M2-like monocytes may contribute to the proinflammatory response in the AAD."
https://openalex.org/W2999056085,"Objectives Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a promising treatment for patients with fear of driving. The present pilot study is the first one focusing on behavioral effects of VRET on patients with fear of driving as measured by a post-treatment driving test in real traffic. Methods The therapy followed a standardized manual including psychotherapeutic and medical examination, two preparative psychotherapy sessions, five virtual reality exposure sessions, a final behavioral avoidance test (BAT) in real traffic, a closing session, and two follow-up phone assessments after six and twelve weeks. VRE was conducted in a driving simulator with a fully equipped mockup. The exposure scenarios were individually tailored to the patients’ anxiety hierarchy. A total of 14 patients were treated. Parameters on the verbal, behavioral and physiological level were assessed. Results The treatment was helpful to overcome driving fear and avoidance. In the final BAT, all patients mastered driving tasks they had avoided before, 71% showed an adequate driving behavior as assessed by the driving instructor, and 93% could maintain their treatment success until the second follow-up phone call. Further analyses suggest that treatment reduces avoidance behavior as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder as measured by standardized questionnaires (Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire: p < .10, PTSD Symptom Scale–Self Report: p < .05). Conclusions VRET in driving simulation is very promising to treat driving fear. Further research with randomized controlled trials is needed to verify efficacy. Moreover, simulators with lower configuration stages should be tested for a broad availability in psychotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999085794,"Aging-related organ degeneration is driven by multiple factors including the cell maintenance mechanisms of autophagy, the cytoprotective protein αKlotho, and the lesser known effects of excess phosphate (Pi), or phosphotoxicity. To examine the interplay between Pi, autophagy, and αKlotho, we used the BK/BK mouse (homozygous for mutant Becn1F121A ) with increased autophagic flux, and αKlotho-hypomorphic mouse (kl/kl) with impaired urinary Pi excretion, low autophagy, and premature organ dysfunction. BK/BK mice live longer than WT littermates, and have heightened phosphaturia from downregulation of two key NaPi cotransporters in the kidney. The multi-organ failure in kl/kl mice was rescued in the double-mutant BK/BK;kl/kl mice exhibiting lower plasma Pi, improved weight gain, restored plasma and renal αKlotho levels, decreased pathology of multiple organs, and improved fertility compared to kl/kl mice. The beneficial effects of heightened autophagy from Becn1F121A was abolished by chronic high-Pi diet which also shortened life span in the BK/BK;kl/kl mice. Pi promoted beclin 1 binding to its negative regulator BCL2, which impairs autophagy flux. Pi downregulated αKlotho, which also independently impaired autophagy. In conclusion, Pi, αKlotho, and autophagy interact intricately to affect each other. Both autophagy and αKlotho antagonizes phosphotoxicity. In concert, this tripartite system jointly determines longevity and life span."
https://openalex.org/W2997548483,"Gastric cancer (GC) patients with metastasis had limited treatment options and dismal outcome. We have previously reported the aberrant expression of Zic family member 1 (Zic1) in GC. However, the functional roles and underlying mechanism of Zic1 in GC metastasis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that lower expression of Zic1 was correlated with more lymph node metastasis and poor outcome of GC patients. Ectopic expression of Zic1 suppressed both lung metastasis and peritoneal tumor dissemination of GC in mice. The metastatic suppressing ability of Zic1 was mediated by regulating the process of cell invasion, adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, Zic1 could downregulate Wnt targets including c-Myc and Cyclin D1 by inhibiting LEF transcriptional activity in GC cells. Notably, Zic1 was inversely related to the expression of Cyclin D1 in GC tissues tested. In addition, Zic1 could physically interact with β-catenin/transcription factor 4 (TCF4) and disrupt their complex formation, while not affecting β-catenin nuclear localization. Collectively, our study indicated that Zic1 suppressed GC metastasis through attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the EMT process. Our work may provide novel therapeutic strategies for the metastasis of GC."
https://openalex.org/W2998070472,"Extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVTs) invade into the uterine wall and remodel spiral arteries for proper placentation. Studies from us and others have demonstrated that the transforming growth factor-β superfamily member bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) plays important roles in endometrial decidualization and trophoblast cell invasion. However, BMP2 has also been shown to regulate endothelial cell migration and capillary-like tube formation, as has its downstream signaling molecule inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1). Interestingly, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) also promotes cell migration and angiogenesis in endothelial precursor cell. Moreover, Id1 has a regulatory effect on Igfbp3 expression in rat prostate epithelial cells. However, whether ID1 and IGFBP3 are integrated in BMP2 signaling and involved in the regulation of trophoblast invasive and endovascular differentiation remains unknown. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of BMP2 on ID1 and IGFBP3 expression and their roles in BMP2-regulated human trophoblast invasion and endothelial-like tube formation. Primary and immortalized (HTR8/SVneo) cultures of human trophoblast cells were employed as study models. BMP2 treatment increased ID1 and IGFBP3 mRNA and protein levels in HTR8/SVneo and primary human EVT cells. Intriguingly, ID1 was essential for BMP2-induced IGFBP3 upregulation in both study models, and BMP2-induced trophoblast invasion was attenuated by knockdown of either ID1 or IGFBP3. In addition, BMP2 significantly increased endothelial-like tube formation and knockdown of ID1 and IGFBP3 reduced basal and BMP2-induced tube formation in HTR8/SVneo cells. Similarly, BMP2 increased placenta growth factor (PlGF) production in HTR8/SVneo cells and these effects were attenuated by knockdown of ID1 or IGFBP3. Our results reveal that BMP2 promotes trophoblast cell invasion and endothelial-like tube formation by ID1-mediated IGFBP3 upregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2998907356,"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction. HD progression causes loss of automaticity, such that previously automatic tasks require greater attentional resources. Dual-task (DT) paradigms and fast-paced gait may stress the locomotor system, revealing deficits not seen under single-task (ST). However, the impact of gait ""stress tests"" on HD individuals needs further investigation. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate whether: 1) fast-paced and dual-task walking uncover deficits in gait and turning not seen under single-task, 2) cognitive and gait outcomes relate to fall incidence, and 3) gait deficits measured with wearable inertial sensors correlate with motor symptom severity in HD as measured by the Unified Huntington's disease Rating Scale-total motor score (UHDRS-TMS). Seventeen HD (55 ± 9.7 years) and 17 age-matched controls (56.5 ± 9.3 years) underwent quantitative gait testing via a 25m, two-minute walk test with APDMTM inertial sensors. Gait was assessed under a 1) ST, self-selected pace, 2) fast-as-possible (FAP) pace, and 3) verbal fluency DT. The UHDRS-TMS and a cognitive test battery were administered, and a retrospective fall history was obtained. During ST, DT, and FAP conditions, HD participants demonstrated slower gait, shorter stride length, and greater lateral step and stride length variability compared to controls (p<0.00001 to 0.034). Significant dual-task costs (DTC) were observed for turns; HD participants took more time (p = 0.013) and steps (p = 0.028) to complete a turn under DT compared to controls. Higher UHDRS-TMS correlated with greater stride length variability, less double-support, and more swing-phase time under all conditions. Decreased processing speed was associated with increased gait variability under ST and FAP conditions. Unexpectedly, participant's self-reported falls did not correlate with any gait or turn parameters. HD participants demonstrated significantly greater DTC for turning, which is less automatic than straight walking, requiring coordination of body segments, anticipatory control, and cortical regulation. Turn complexity likely makes it more susceptible to cognitive interference in HD."

Moreover, whether the coupled ""mechano-electro-magnetic"" signals can induce greater osteogenic potential than single stimulation remains unknown. Herein, 5-month-old or 20-month-old rats were assigned to the Control, PEMF, WBV, and PEMF + WBV groups. After 8-week treatment, single PEMF/WBV enhanced bone mass, strength, and anabolism in 5-month-old rats, but not in 20-month-old rats. PEMF + WBV induced greater increase of bone quantity, quality, and anabolism than single PEMF/WBV in young adult rats. PEMF + WBV also inhibited bone loss in elderly rats by primarily improving osteoblast and osteocyte activity, but had no effects on bone resorption. PEMF + WBV upregulated the expression of various canonical Wnt ligands and downstream molecules (p-GSK-3β and β-catenin), but had no impacts on noncanonical Wnt5a expression in aged skeleton, revealing the potential involvement of canonical Wnt signaling in bone anabolism of PEMF + WBV. This study not only reveals much weaker responsiveness of aged skeleton to single PEMF/WBV relative to young adult skeleton, but also presents a novel noninvasive approach based on combinatorial treatment with PEMF + WBV for improving bone health and preserving bone quantity/quality (especially for age-related osteoporosis) with stronger anabolic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2998373472,"The brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ that plays a major role in energy balance, obesity, and diabetes due to the potent glucose and lipid clearance that fuels its thermogenesis, which is largely mediated via sympathetic nervous system activation. However, thus far there has been little experimental validation of the hypothesis that selective neuromodulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the BAT is sufficient to elicit thermogenesis in mice. We generated mice expressing blue light-activated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the sympathetic nerves innervating the BAT using two different strategies: injecting the BAT of C57Bl/6J mice with AAV6-hSyn-ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP; crossbreeding tyrosine hydroxylase-Cre mice with floxed-stop ChR2-EYFP mice. The nerves in the BAT expressing ChR2 were selectively stimulated with a blue LED light positioned underneath the fat pad of anesthetized mice, while the BAT and core temperatures were simultaneously recorded. Using immunohistochemistry we confirmed the selective expression of EYFP in TH positive nerves fibers. In addition, local optogenetic stimulation of the sympathetic nerves induced significant increase in the BAT temperature followed by an increase in core temperature in mice expressing ChR2, but not in the respective controls. The BAT activation was also paralleled by increased levels of pre-UCP1 transcript. Our results demonstrate that local optogenetic stimulation of the sympathetic nerves is sufficient to elicit BAT and core thermogenesis, thus suggesting that peripheral neuromodulation has the potential to be exploited as an alternative to pharmacotherapies to elicit organ activation and thus ameliorate type 2 diabetes and/or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2998322769,"Many notable human pathogens are facultative anaerobes. These pathogens exhibit redundant metabolic pathways and a whole array of regulatory systems to adapt to changing oxygen levels. However, our knowledge of facultative anaerobic pathogens is mostly based on fully aerobic or anaerobic cultures, which does not reflect real infection conditions, while the microaerobic range remains understudied. Here, we examine the behavior of pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of two facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, during the aerobic-anaerobic transition. To do so, we introduce a new technique named AnaeroTrans, in which we allow self-consumption of oxygen by steady-state cultures and monitor the system by measuring the gas-phase oxygen concentration. We explore the different behavior of the studied species toward oxygen and examine how this behavior is associated with the targeted infection sites. As a model, we characterize the adaptation profile of the ribonucleotide reductase network, a complex oxygen-dependent enzymatic system responsible for the generation of the deoxyribonucleotides. We also explore the actions of the most important anaerobic regulators and how these regulators influence bacterial fitness. Our results allow us to classify the different elements that compose the aerobic-anaerobic transition into reproducible stages, thus showing the different adaptation mechanisms of the studied species."
https://openalex.org/W2997676782,"Tau hyperphosphorylation is a major neuropathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Several anesthetics have been shown previously to induced marked tau hyperphosphorylation. Although the ketamine/xylazine mixture is one of the most commonly used anesthetic agents in animal research and veterinary practice, the effect of this anesthetic agent on tau phosphorylation still remains to be determined. Here, we found that ketamine-/xylazine-induced a rapid and robust hyperphosphorylation of tau in a dose-dependent manner under normothermic and hypothermic conditions in mice. When used together, ketamine and xylazine exerted a synergistic action on tau phosphorylation most strongly not only on epitopes S396 and S262, but also on other residues (T181, and S202/T205). We observed that activation of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is the major upstream molecular event leading to tau hyperphosphorylation following ketamine/xylazine anesthesia in mice. Moreover, we observed that intracerebroventricular injection of the selective CaMKII inhibitor KN93 attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation. Since ketamine/xylazine also had a marked impact on other key molecular signaling pathways involving the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), our study calls for high caution and careful monitoring when using this anesthetic agent in laboratory animal settings across all fields of biological sciences in order to avoid artifactual results."
https://openalex.org/W2997836505,"PPM1A and PTEN emerged as novel suppressors of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since loss of PPM1A and PTEN in the tubulointerstitium promotes fibrogenesis, defining molecular events underlying PPM1A/PTEN deregulation is necessary to develop expression rescue as novel therapeutic strategies. Here we identify TGF-β1 as a principle repressor of PPM1A, as conditional renal tubular-specific induction of TGF-β1 in mice dramatically downregulates kidney PPM1A expression. TGF-β1 similarly attenuates PPM1A and PTEN expression in human renal epithelial cells and fibroblasts, via a protein degradation mechanism by promoting their ubiquitination. A proteasome inhibitor MG132 rescues PPM1A and PTEN expression, even in the presence of TGF-β1, along with decreased fibrogenesis. Restoration of PPM1A or PTEN similarly limits SMAD3 phosphorylation and the activation of TGF-β1-induced fibrotic genes. Concurrent loss of PPM1A and PTEN levels in aristolochic acid nephropathy further suggests crosstalk between these repressors. PPM1A silencing in renal fibroblasts, moreover, results in PTEN loss, while PTEN stable depletion decreases PPM1A expression with acquisition of a fibroproliferative phenotype in each case. Transient PPM1A expression, conversely, elevates cellular PTEN levels while lentiviral PTEN introduction increases PPM1A expression. PPM1A and PTEN, therefore, co-regulate each other's relative abundance, identifying a previously unknown pathological link between TGF-β1 repressors, contributing to CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2998166771,"Chorioamnionitis (CA, fetal membrane inflammation) predisposes to preterm birth and is associated with increased neonatal infection risk, but the separate effects of prematurity, CA, and postnatal adaptations on this risk are unclear. Using pigs as models for infants, we examined the systemic immune-metabolic status in cesarean-delivered preterm pigs, with and without CA induced by intra-amniotic (IA) LPS exposure. At birth, cord blood of preterm pigs showed neutropenia and low expressions of innate and adaptive immune genes, relative to term pigs. IA LPS induced CA and fetal systemic innate immune activation via complement and neutrophil-related pathways. These were mainly modulated via cellular regulations rather than granulopoiesis, as validated by the in vitro LPS stimulation of cord blood. After birth, IA LPS-exposed preterm pigs did not follow normal immune-metabolic ontogenies found in fetuses or newborns without prenatal insults, but showed consistently high levels of Treg, impaired Th1 polarization, and reduced expressions of multiple genes related to cellular oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal activities. In conclusion, our results provide cellular and molecular evidence for CA-induced distinct neonatal immune-metabolic status with increased disease tolerance strategy, suggesting mechanisms for the clinical observation of elevated sepsis risks in immune-compromised preterm infants born with CA."
https://openalex.org/W2998606591,"Bone resorption is a severe consequence of inflammatory diseases associated with osteolysis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), often leading to disability in patients. In physiological conditions, the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts is delicately regulated by the balance between osteoclastogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic mechanisms. Inflammation has complex impact on osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction, and the underlying mechanisms of which, especially feedback inhibition, are underexplored. Here, we identify a novel regulatory network mediated by RBP-J/NFATc1-miR182 in TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone resorption. This network includes negative regulator RBP-J and positive regulators, NFATc1 and miR182, of osteoclast differentiation. In this network, miR182 is a direct target of both RBP-J and NFATc1. RBP-J represses, while NFATc1 activates miR182 expression through binding to specific open chromatin regions in the miR182 promoter. Inhibition of miR182 by RBP-J servers as a critical mechanism that limits TNF-induced osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone resorption. Inflammation, such as that which occurs in RA, shifts the expression levels of the components in this network mediated by RBP-J/NFATc1-miR182-FoxO3/PKR (previously identified miR182 targets) towards more osteoclastogenic, rather than healthy conditions. Treatment with TNF inhibitors in RA patients reverses the expression changes of the network components and osteoclastogenic potential. Thus, this network controls the balance between activating and repressive signals that determine the extent of osteoclastogenesis. These findings collectively highlight the biological significance and translational implication of this newly identified intrinsic regulatory network in inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2996337396,"Although recognized to have an in vivo vasodepressor effect blunted by the vasoconstrictor effect of E-prostanoid receptor-3 (EP3), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) evokes contractions of many vascular beds that are sensitive to antagonizing the thromboxane prostanoid receptor (TP). This study aimed to determine the direct effect of PGE2 on renal arteries and/or the whole renal vasculature and how each of these two receptors is involved in the responses. Experiments were performed on isolated vessels and perfused kidneys of wild-type mice and/or mice with deficiency in TP (TP-/- ), EP3 (EP3-/- ), or both TP and EP3 (TP-/- /EP3-/- ). Here we show that PGE2 (0.001-30 μM) evoked not only contraction of main renal arteries, but also a decrease of flow in perfused kidneys. EP3-/- diminished the response to 0.001-0.3 μM PGE2 , while TP-/- reduced that to the prostanoid of higher concentrations. In TP-/- /EP3-/- vessels and perfused kidneys, PGE2 did not evoke contraction but instead resulted in vasodilator responses. These results demonstrate that PGE2 functions as an overall direct vasoconstrictor of the mouse renal vasculature with an effect reflecting the vasoconstrictor activities outweighing that of dilation. Also, our results suggest that EP3 dominates the vasoconstrictor effect of PGE2 of low concentrations (≤0.001-0.3 μM), but its effect is further added by that of TP, which has a higher efficacy, although activated by higher concentrations (from 0.01 μM) of the same prostanoid PGE2 ."
https://openalex.org/W2996833675,"Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare and fatal neuromuscular disorder caused by the loss of alpha motor neurons. The affected individuals have mutated the ubiquitously expressed SMN1 gene resulting in the loss or reduction in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels. However, an almost identical paralog exists in humans: SMN2. Pharmacological activation of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion by small molecules or modified antisense oligonucleotides is a valid approach to treat SMA. Here we describe an in vivo SMN2 minigene reporter system in Drosophila motor neurons that serves as a cost-effective, feasible, and stringent primary screening model for identifying chemicals capable of crossing the conserved Drosophila blood-brain barrier and modulating exon 7 inclusion. The model was used for the screening of 1100 drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library, resulting in 2.45% hit rate. The most promising candidate drugs were validated in patient-derived fibroblasts where they proved to increase SMN protein levels. Among them, moxifloxacin modulated SMN2 splicing by promoting exon 7 inclusion. The recovery of SMN protein levels was confirmed by increased colocalization of nuclear gems with Cajal Bodies. Thus, a Drosophila-based drug screen allowed the discovery of an FDA-approved small molecule with the potential to become a novel therapy for SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2998155039,"Allergic asthma with high plasma IgE levels is a significant risk factor of human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This study tests a direct role of IgE in angiotensin-II (Ang-II) perfusion- and peri-aortic CaCl2 injury-induced AAA in mice. In both models, IgE-deficiency in Apoe-/- Ige-/- mice blunts AAA growth and reduces lesion accumulation of macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and lesion MHC class-II expression, CD31+ microvessel growth, and media smooth muscle cell loss, compared with those from Apoe-/- control mice. Real time-PCR reveals significant reductions in expression of neutrophil chemoattractants MIP-2α and CXCL5 in AAA lesions or macrophages from Apoe-/- Ige-/- mice, along with reduced lesion Ly6G+ neutrophil accumulation. Consistent with reduced lesion inflammatory cell accumulation, we find significant reductions of plasma and AAA lesion IL6 expression in Apoe-/- Ige-/- mice. Immunofluorescent staining and FACS analysis show that AAA lesion neutrophils express FceR1. Mechanistic study demonstrates that IgE induces neutrophil FceR1 expression, activates MAPK signaling, and promotes IL6 production. This study supports a direct role of IgE in AAA by promoting lesion chemokine expression, inflammatory cell accumulation, MAPK signaling, and cytokine expression. IgE inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach in AAA management."
https://openalex.org/W2997022627,"Timely recovery of the light response in photoreceptors requires efficient inactivation of photoactivated rhodopsin. This process is initiated by phosphorylation of its carboxyl terminus by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1). Previously, we showed that GRK1 is phosphorylated in the dark at Ser21 in a cAMP-dependent manner and dephosphorylated in the light. Results in vitro indicate that dephosphorylation of Ser21 increases GRK1 activity, leading to increased phosphorylation of rhodopsin. This creates the possibility of light-dependent regulation of GRK1 activity and its efficiency in inactivating the visual pigment. To address the functional role of GRK1 phosphorylation in rods and cones in vivo, we generated mutant mice in which Ser21 is substituted with alanine (GRK1-S21A), preventing dark-dependent phosphorylation of GRK1. GRK1-S21A mice had normal retinal morphology, without evidence of degeneration. The function of dark-adapted GRK1-S21A rods and cones was also unaffected, as demonstrated by the normal amplitude and kinetics of their responses obtained by ex vivo and in vivo ERG recordings. In contrast, rod dark adaptation following exposure to bright bleaching light was significantly delayed in GRK1-S21A mice, suggesting that the higher activity of this kinase results in enhanced rhodopsin phosphorylation and therefore delays its regeneration. In contrast, dark adaptation of cones was unaffected by the S21A mutation. Taken together, these data suggest that rhodopsin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation modulates the recovery of rhodopsin to the ground state and rod dark adaptation. They also reveal a novel role for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of GRK1 in regulating the dark adaptation of rod but not cone photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W3000683031,"During the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, different sets of cellular events take place across the seminiferous epithelium in the testis. For instance, remodeling of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) that facilitates the transport of preleptotene spermatocytes across the immunological barrier and the release of sperms at spermiation take place at the opposite ends of the epithelium simultaneously at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle. These cellular events are tightly coordinated via locally produced regulatory biomolecules. Studies have shown that collagen α3 (IV) chains, a major constituent component of the basement membrane, release the non-collagenous (NC) 1 domain, a 28-kDa peptide, designated NC1-peptide, from the C-terminal region, via the action of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9). NC1-peptide was found to be capable of inducing BTB remodeling and spermatid release across the epithelium. As such, the NC1-peptide is an endogenously produced biologically active peptide which coordinates these cellular events across the epithelium in stage VIII tubules. Herein, we used an animal model, wherein NC1-peptide cloned into the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector was overexpressed in the testis, to better understanding the molecular mechanism by which NC1-peptide regulated spermatogenic function. It was shown that NC1-peptide induced considerable downregulation on a number of cell polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins, and studies have shown these polarity and PCP proteins modulate spermatid polarity and adhesion via their effects on microtubule (MT) and F-actin cytoskeletal organization across the epithelium. More important, NC1-peptide exerted its effects by downregulating the expression of microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) called EB1 (end-binding protein 1). We cloned the full-length EB1 cDNA for its overexpression in the testis, which was found to block the NC1-peptide-mediated disruptive effects on cytoskeletal organization in Sertoli cell epithelium and pertinent Sertoli cell functions. These findings thus illustrate that NC1-peptide is working in concert with EB1 to support spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3000744007,"TIAM2S, the short form of human T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2, can have oncogenic effects when aberrantly expressed in the liver or lungs. However, it is also abundant in healthy, non-neoplastic brain tissue, in which its primary function is still unknown. Here, we examined the neurobiological and behavioral significance of human TIAM2S using the human brain protein panels, a human NT2/D1-derived neuronal cell line model (NT2/N), and transgenic mice that overexpress human TIAM2S (TIAM2S-TG). Our data reveal that TIAM2S exists primarily in neurons of the restricted brain areas around the limbic system and in well-differentiated NT2/N cells. Functional studies revealed that TIAM2S has no guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and is mainly located in the nucleus. Furthermore, whole-transcriptome and enrichment analysis with total RNA sequencing revealed that TIAM2S-knockdown (TIAM2S-KD) was strongly associated with the cellular processes of the brain structural development and differentiation, serotonin-related signaling, and the diseases markers representing neurobehavioral developmental disorders. Moreover, TIAM2S-KD cells display decreased neurite outgrowth and reduced serotonin levels. Moreover, TIAM2S overexpressing TG mice show increased number and length of serotonergic fibers at early postnatal stage, results in higher serotonin levels at both the serum and brain regions, and higher neuroplasticity and hyperlocomotion in latter adulthood. Taken together, our results illustrate the non-oncogenic functions of human TIAM2S and demonstrate that TIAM2S is a novel regulator of serotonin level, brain neuroplasticity, and locomotion behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2996770053,"The Mre11A/RAD50/NBN complex (MRN) is an essential regulator of the cellular damage response after DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). More recent work has indicated that MRN may also impact on the duration of mitosis. We show here that RAD50-deficient fibroblasts exhibit a marked delay in mitotic progression that can be rescued by lentiviral transduction of RAD50. The delay was observed throughout all mitotic phases in live cell imaging using GFP-labeled H2B as a fluorescent marker. In complementation assays with RAD50 phosphorylation mutants, modifications at Ser635 had little effect on mitotic progression. By contrast with RAD50, fibroblast strains deficient in ATM or NBN did not show a significant slowing of mitotic progression. Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) fibroblasts with nuclease-deficient MRE11A (p.W210C) tended to show slower mitosis, though by far not as significant as RAD50-deficient cells. Inhibitor studies indicated that ATM kinase activity might not grossly impact on mitotic progression, while treatment with MRE11A inhibitor PFM39 modestly prolonged mitosis. Inhibition of ATR kinase significantly prolonged mitosis but this effect was mostly independent of RAD50 status. Taken together, our data unravel a mitotic role of RAD50 that can be separated from its known functions in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W3000263093,"Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a glycoprotein, that is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family. Approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have mutations of this gene, and activation of the FLT3 downstream pathway plays an important role in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. However, the role of N-glycosylation for FLT3 activation remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the N-glycan structures on wild type (WT), internal tandem duplication (ITD), and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutants of FLT3 were different. Interestingly, expression of either WT or mutant FLT3 in Ba/F3 cells, an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell, greatly induced core fucosylation. To elucidate the function of core fucosylation in FLT3-mediated signaling, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) knockout (KO) cells. Surprisingly, the Fut8KO resulted in cell proliferation in an IL-3-independent manner in FLT3-WT cells, which was not observed in the parental cells, and suggested that this proliferation is dependent on FLT3 expression. Fut8KO greatly increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels, together with an activation of STAT5, AKT, and ERK signaling, which could be completely neutralized by restoration with Fut8 in the KO cells. Consistently, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor efficiently inhibited cell proliferation induced by Fut8KO or specific fucosylation inhibitor. Additionally, immunostaining with FLT3 showed that the proteins were mainly expressed on the cell surface in the KO cells, which is similar to FLT3-WT cells, but different from the ITD mutant. Finally, we found that Fut8KO could induce dimer-formation in FLT3 without ligand-stimulation. Taken together, the present study clearly defines the regulatory function of core fucosylation in FLT3, which could provide a valuable direction for development of drugs could be effective in the treatment of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2997971112,"Eicosanoids are powerful mediators of inflammation and are known to drive both the progression and regression of arthritis. We previously reported the infection of C3H 5-lipoxygenase (LO)-deficient mice with Borrelia burgdorferi results in prolonged nonresolving Lyme arthritis. Here we define the role of the 5-LO metabolite leukotriene (LT)B4 and its high-affinity receptor, BLT1, in this response. C3H and C3H BLT1-/- mice were infected with B. burgdorferi and arthritis progression was monitored by ankle swelling over time. Similar to 5-LO-/- mice, BLT1-/- mice developed nonresolving Lyme arthritis characterized by increased neutrophils in the joint at later time points than WT mice, but with fewer apoptotic (caspase-3+ ) neutrophils. In vitro, BLT1-/- neutrophils were defective in their ability to undergo apoptosis due to the lack of LTB4 -mediated down-regulation of cAMP, subsequent failure to induce Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) components, and decreased FasL and CD36 expression. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with SQ 22,536 restored BLT1-/- BMN apoptosis, FasL and CD36 expression, and clearance by macrophages. We conclude that LTB4/BLT1 signaling has an unexpected critical role in mediating neutrophil apoptosis via the down-regulation of cAMP. Loss of BLT1 signaling led to defective clearance of neutrophils from the inflamed joint and failed arthritis resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2999156583,"Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) leads to the transcription of diverse inducible genes involved in many biological processes; therefore, aberrant NFAT expression is responsible for the development and exacerbation of various disorders. Since five isoforms of NFAT (NFATc1-c4, NFAT5) exhibit distinct and overlapping functions, selective control of a part, but not all, of NFAT family members is desirable. By comparing the binding activity of each NFATc1-c4 with its regulatory enzyme, calcineurin (CN), using a quantitative immunoprecipitation assay, we found a new CN-binding region (CNBR) selectively functioning in NFATc1 and NFATc4. This region, termed CNBR3, is located between two preexisting CNBR1 and CNBR2, within the Ca2+ regulatory domain. The nuclear translocation of NFATc1 but not NFATc2 in T cells was suppressed by ectopic expression of CNBR3 and, accordingly, NFATc1-dependent cytokine expression was downregulated. Through competition assays using NFATc1-derived partial peptides and mass spectrometry with photoaffinity technology, we identified 18 amino acids in NFATc1 (Arg258 to Pro275 ) and 13 amino acids in CN catalytic subunit (CNA) (Asn77 to Gly89 ) responsible for CNA/CNBR3 binding in which Cys263 and Asp82 , respectively, played crucial roles. The possible selective regulation of NFAT-mediated biological processes by targeting this new CN/NFAT-binding region is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3000168504,"Wearable electronics capable of recording and transmitting biosignals can provide convenient and pervasive health monitoring. A typical EEG recording produces large amount of data. Conventional compression methods cannot compress date below Nyquist rate, thus resulting in large amount of data even after compression. This needs large storage and hence long transmission time. Compressed sensing has proposed solution to this problem and given a way to compress data below Nyquist rate. In this paper, double temporal sparsity based reconstruction algorithm has been applied for the recovery of compressively sampled EEG data. The results are further improved by modifying the double temporal sparsity based reconstruction algorithm using schattern-p norm along with decorrelation transformation of EEG data before processing. The proposed modified double temporal sparsity based reconstruction algorithm out-perform block sparse bayesian learning and Rackness based compressed sensing algorithms in terms of SNDR and NMSE. Simulation results further show that the proposed algorithm has better convergence rate and less execution time."
https://openalex.org/W2996001808,"Bladder dysfunction is associated with the overexpression of the intermediate filament (IF) proteins desmin and vimentin in obstructed bladder smooth muscle (BSM). However, the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to BSM dysfunction are not known. Previous studies have shown that desmin and vimentin directly participate in signal transduction. In this study, we hypothesized that BSM dysfunction associated with overexpression of desmin or vimentin is mediated via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). We employed a model of murine BSM tissue in which increased expression of desmin or vimentin was induced by adenoviral transduction to examine the sufficiency of increased IF protein expression to reduce BSM contraction. Murine BSM strips overexpressing desmin or vimentin generated less force in response to KCl and carbachol relative to the levels in control murine BSM strips, an effect associated with increased JNK2 phosphorylation and reduced myosin light chain (MLC20 ) phosphorylation. Furthermore, desmin and vimentin overexpressions did not alter BSM contractility and MLC20 phosphorylation in strips isolated from JNK2 knockout mice. Pharmacological JNK2 inhibition produced results qualitatively similar to those caused by JNK2 knockout. These findings suggest that inhibition of JNK2 may improve diminished BSM contractility associated with obstructive bladder disease."
https://openalex.org/W2996040253,"How receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) growth signaling is controlled physiologically is incompletely understood. We have previously provided evidence that the survival and mitotic activities of vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) signaling are dependent on C3a/C5a receptor (C3ar1/C5ar1) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-gp130 joint signaling in a physically interactive platform. Herein, we document that the platelet derived and epidermal growth factor receptors (PDGFR and EGFR) are regulated by the same interconnection and clarify the mechanism underlying the dependence. We show that the joint signaling is required to overcome dominant restraint on RTK function by the combined repression of tonically activated PHLPP, SOCS1/SOCS3, and CK2/Fyn dependent PTEN. Signaling studies showed that augmented PI-3Kɣ activation is the process that overcomes the multilevel growth restraint. Live-cell flow cytometry and single-particle tracking indicated that blockade of C3ar1/C5ar1 or IL-6R signaling suppresses RTK growth factor binding and RTK complex formation. C3ar1/C5ar1 blockade abrogated growth signaling of four additional RTKs. Active relief of dominant growth repression via joint C3ar1/C5ar1 and IL-6R joint signaling thus enables RTK mitotic/survival signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2996216678,"Primary cilia are nonmotile sensory organelles found on the surface of almost all kidney tubule epithelial cells. Being exposed to the tubular lumen, primary cilia are thought to be chemo- and mechanosensors of luminal composition and flux, respectively. We hypothesized that, Na+ transport and primary cilia exist in a sensory functional connection in mature renal tubule epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that primary cilium length is reduced in mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) knockout (KO) mice in a cell autonomous manner along the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ADSN) compared with wild type (as µm ± SEM; 3.1 ± 0.2 vs 4.0 ± 0.1). In mouse cortical collecting duct (mCCD)cl1 cells, which are a model of collecting duct (CD) principal cells, changes in Na+ transport intensity were found to mediate primary cilium length in response to aldosterone (as µm ± SEM: control: 2.7 ± 0.9 vs aldosterone treated: 3.8 ± 0.8). Cilium length was positively correlated with the availability of IFT88, a major intraflagellar anterograde transport complex B component, which is stabilized in response to exposure to aldosterone treatment. This suggests that the abundance of IFT88 is a regulated, rate limiting factor in the elongation of primary cilia. As previously observed in vivo, aldosterone treatment increased cell volume of cultured CD principal cells. Knockdown of IFT88 prevents ciliogenesis and inhibits the adaptive increase in cell size that was observed in response to aldosterone treatment. In conclusion, our results reveal a functional connection between Na+ transport, primary cilia, and cell size, which may play a key role in the morphological and functional adaptation of the CD to sustained changes in active Na+ reabsorption due to variations in aldosterone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2997127980,"The expression of α-cardiac actin, a major constituent of the cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes, is dramatically decreased in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy triggered by inducible cardiac-specific serum response factor (Srf) gene disruption that could mimic some forms of human dilated cardiomyopathy. To investigate the consequences of the maintenance of α-cardiac actin expression in this model, we developed a new transgenic mouse based on Cre/LoxP strategy, allowing together the induction of SRF loss and a compensatory expression of α-cardiac actin. Here, we report that maintenance of α-cardiac actin within cardiomyocytes temporally preserved cytoarchitecture from adverse cardiac remodeling through a positive impact on both structural and transcriptional levels. These protective effects were accompanied in vivo by the decrease of ROS generation and protein carbonylation and the downregulation of NADPH oxidases NOX2 and NOX4. We also show that ectopic expression of α-cardiac actin protects HEK293 cells against oxidative stress induced by H2 O2 . Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of cardiac remodeling and contributes also to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Taken together, these findings indicate that α-cardiac actin could be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress that is a leading cause of adverse remodeling during dilated cardiomyopathy development."

High-grade serous ovarian cancer patient tumors and cells express significantly higher levels of KRCC1 which correlates with poor overall survival and chemoresistance. We demonstrate that KRCC1 is predominantly present in the chromatin-bound nuclear fraction, interacts with HDAC1, HDAC2, and with the serine-threonine phosphatase PP1CC. Silencing KRCC1 inhibits cellular plasticity, invasive properties, and potentiates apoptosis resulting in reduced tumor growth. These phenotypes are associated with increased acetylation of histones and with increased phosphorylation of H2AX and CHK1, suggesting the modulation of transcription and DNA damage that may be mediated by the action of HDAC and PP1CC, respectively. Hence, we address an urgent need to develop new targets in cancer."

In mice lacking CTRP1, we observed significantly increased kidney weight and glomerular hypertrophy in aged male but not female or young mice. Although glomerular filtration rate, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and renal response to water restriction did not differ between genotypes, CTRP1-deficient male mice had elevated blood pressure. Echocardiogram and pulse wave velocity measurements indicated normal heart function and vascular stiffness in CTRP1-deficient animals, and increased blood pressure was not due to greater salt retention. Paradoxically, CTRP1-deficient mice had elevated urinary sodium and potassium excretion, partially resulting from reduced expression of genes involved in renal sodium and potassium reabsorption. Despite renal hypertrophy, markers of inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress were reduced in CTRP1-deficient mice. RNA sequencing revealed alterations and enrichments of genes in metabolic processes in CTRP1-deficient animals. These results highlight novel contributions of CTRP1 to aging-associated changes in renal physiology."

Here, we explored the protein-protein interaction network built on known inguinal hernia-causative genes to identify essential and common downstream proteins for inguinal hernia formation. We discovered that PIK3R1, PTPN11, TGFBR1, CDC42, SOS1, and KRAS were the most essential inguinal hernia-causative proteins and UBC, GRB2, CTNNB1, HSP90AA1, CBL, PLCG1, and CRK were listed as the most commonly-involved downstream proteins. In addition, the transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway was the most frequently found inguinal hernia-related pathway. Our in silico approach was able to uncover a novel molecular mechanism underlying inguinal hernia formation by identifying inguinal hernia-related essential proteins and potential common downstream proteins of inguinal hernia-causative proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2997963046,"Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) system has gained attention for its essential roles in cellular maintenance and survival under harsh environmental conditions such as nutrient deficiency and antibiotic treatment. There are at least 14 TA systems in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, a pathogenic bacterium, and none of the structures of these TA systems have been determined. We determined the crystal structure of the VapBC TA complex from S. Typhimurium LT2 in proteolyzed and DNA-bound forms at 2.0 Å and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The VapC toxin possesses a pilT N-terminal domain (PIN-domain) that shows ribonuclease activity, and the VapB antitoxin has an AbrB-type DNA binding domain. In addition, the structure revealed details of interaction mode between VapBC and the cognate promoter DNA, including the inhibition of VapC by VapB and linear conformation of bound DNA in the VapBC complex. The complexation of VapBC with the linear DNA is not consistent with known structures of VapBC homologs in complex with bent DNA. We also identified VapC from S. Typhimurium LT2 as a putative Ca2+ -dependent ribonuclease, which differs from previous data showing that VapC homologs have Mg2+ or Mn2+ -dependent ribonuclease activities. The present studies could provide structural understanding of the physiology of VapBC systems and foundation for the development of new antibiotic drugs against Salmonella infection."
https://openalex.org/W3000278060,"The fundamental utility of the Large-Scale Visual Sensor Networks (LVSNs) is to monitor specified events and to transmit the detected information back to the sink for achieving the data aggregation purpose. However, the events of interest are usually not uniformly distributed but frequently detected in certain regions in real-world applications. It implies that when the events frequently picked up by the sensors in the same region, the transmission load of LVSNs is unbalanced and potentially cause the energy hole problem. To overcome this kind of problem for network lifetime, a Comprehensive Visual Data Gathering Network Architecture (CDNA), which is the first comparatively integrated architecture for LVSNs is designed in this paper. In CDNA, a novel α-hull based event location algorithm, which is oriented from the geometric model of α-hull, is designed for accurately and efficiently detect the location of the event. In addition, the Chi-Square distribution event-driven gradient deployment method is proposed to reduce the unbalanced energy consumption for alleviating energy hole problem. Moreover, an energy hole repairing method containing an efficient data gathering tree and a movement algorithm is proposed to ensure the efficiency of transmitting and solving the energy hole problem. Simulations are made for examining the performance of the proposed architecture. The simulation results indicate that the performance of CDNA is better than the previous algorithms in the realistic LVSN environment, such as the significant improvement of the network lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2995875562,"The main mechanism of hyaluronidase 1(HYAL-1) in the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) was unknown. In this study, a comprehensive inventory of pre-, intra-, and postoperative clinical and biological data of two cohorts (62 pancreatic cancer [PCa] and 111 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [PDAC]) which could induce POPF were retrospectively analyzed. Then, a total of 7644 genes correlated with HYAL-1 was predicted in PDAC tissues and the enriched pathway, kinase targets and biological process of those correlated genes were evaluated. Finally, a mouse pancreatic fistula (PF) model was first built and in vitro studies were performed to investigate the effects of HYAL-1 on PF progression. Our data indicated that preoperative serum HYAL-1 level, pancreatic fibrosis score, and pancreatic duct size were valuable factors for detecting POPF of Grade B and C. The serum HYAL-1 level of 2.07 mg/ml and pancreatic fibrosis score of 2.5 were proposed as the cutoff values for indicating POPF. The bioinformatic analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that HYAL-1 facilitates pancreatic acinar cell autophagy via the dephosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways, which exacerbate pancreatic secretion and inflammation. In summary, the preoperative serum HYAL-1 was a significant predictor for POPF in patients who underwent PD. Tumor-induced HYAL-1 is one of core risk in accelerating PF and then promoting pancreatic secretion and acute inflammation response through the AMPK and STAT3-induced autophagy."
