By far the most commonly used form of amino acids in all kingdoms of life is the l -form. Now Lam et al. (p. 1552 ; see the Perspective by Blanke ) present the unanticipated observation that diverse bacteria release large amounts of various d -amino acids into the environment in a population density–dependent fashion and that d -amino acids act as extracellular effectors that regulate the composition, structure, amount, and strength of peptidoglycan, the major stress-bearing component of the bacterial cell wall."

The spin-injected field effect transistor, a lateral semiconducting channel with two ferromagnetic electrodes, lies at the foundation of spintronics research. We demonstrated a spin-injected field effect transistor in a high-mobility InAs heterostructure with empirically calibrated electrical injection and detection of ballistic spin-polarized electrons. We observed and fit to theory an oscillatory channel conductance as a function of monotonically increasing gate voltage."
https://openalex.org/W2093238989,"Insect wings are complex structures that deform dramatically in flight. We analyzed the aerodynamic consequences of wing deformation in locusts using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation based on detailed wing kinematics. We validated the simulation against smoke visualizations and digital particle image velocimetry on real locusts. We then used the validated model to explore the effects of wing topography and deformation, first by removing camber while keeping the same time-varying twist distribution, and second by removing camber and spanwise twist. The full-fidelity model achieved greater power economy than the uncambered model, which performed better than the untwisted model, showing that the details of insect wing topography and deformation are important aerodynamically. Such details are likely to be important in engineering applications of flapping flight."
https://openalex.org/W1997734311,"Iron Sensor Intracellular iron is an essential cofactor for many proteins, but can also damage macromolecules, so its levels are carefully controlled. Cellular iron homeostasis is mediated by iron regulatory proteins that regulate the expression of genes involved in iron uptake and storage. However, it is not clear how cells sense iron bioavailability (see the Perspective by Rouault ). Using different approaches, Salahudeen et al. (p. 722 , published online 17 September) and Vashisht et al. (p. 718 , published online 17 September) have identified the F-box protein FBXL5 as a human iron sensor. FBXL5 is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates the degradation of iron regulatory proteins and thereby cellular iron levels. It contains a hemerythrin domain that binds iron and acts as an iron-dependent regulatory switch, causing the degradation of FBXL5 under low iron conditions. This alternative pathway for the regulation of iron homeostasis has implications for both normal cellular physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2043523270,"Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by the coordinate posttranscriptional regulation of genes responsible for iron uptake, release, use, and storage through the actions of the iron regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2. However, the manner in which iron levels are sensed to affect IRP2 activity is poorly understood. We found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the FBXL5 protein targets IRP2 for proteasomal degradation. The stability of FBXL5 itself was regulated, accumulating under iron- and oxygen-replete conditions and degraded upon iron depletion. FBXL5 contains an iron- and oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain that acted as a ligand-dependent regulatory switch mediating FBXL5's differential stability. These observations suggest a mechanistic link between iron sensing via the FBXL5 hemerythrin domain, IRP2 regulation, and cellular responses to maintain mammalian iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2047864778,"Background Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators."
https://openalex.org/W2113772296,"Cold Atom Magnetism Magnetic ordering arises from the strong interactions between atoms, with its origins deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. How the ordering comes about, however, has long been a topic of debate because most condensed-matter systems are limited by a somewhat fixed parameter space. Cold atom systems, by comparison, provide the ability to tune the magnitude and sign of the atom-atom interaction, as well as the density. Jo et al. (p. 1521 ; see the Perspective by Zwerger ) exploit this flexibility to use an ensemble of ultracold fermionic atoms as a “quantum simulator” to explore the possibility of magnetic ordering. As the repulsive interaction between atoms is increased, an instability occurs in the free two-component Fermi gas (or jellium), which results in a phase transition and the ferromagnetic ordering of the atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2001074379,"Available serological diagnostics do not allow the confirmation of clinically suspected leptospirosis at the early acute phase of illness. Several conventional and real-time PCRs for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis have been described but these have been incompletely evaluated. We developed a SYBR Green-based real-time PCR targeting secY and validated it according to international guidelines. To determine the analytical specificity, DNA from 56 Leptospira strains belonging to pathogenic, non-pathogenic and intermediate Leptospira spp. as well as 46 other micro-organisms was included in this study. All the pathogenic Leptospira gave a positive reaction. We found no cross-reaction with saprophytic Leptospira and other micro-organisms, implying a high analytical specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the PCR was one copy per reaction from cultured homologous strain M 20 and 1.2 and 1.5 copy for heterologous strains 1342 K and Sarmin, respectively. In spiked serum & blood and kidney tissue the sensitivity was 10 and 20 copies for M 20, 15 and 30 copies for 1342 K and 30 and 50 copies for Sarmin. To determine the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp), clinical blood samples from 26 laboratory-confirmed and 107 negative patients suspected of leptospirosis were enrolled as a prospective consecutive cohort. Based on culture as the gold standard, we found a DSe and DSp of 100% and 93%, respectively. All eight PCR positive samples that had a negative culture seroconverted later on, implying a higher actual DSp. When using culture and serology as the gold standard, the DSe was lower (89%) while the DSp was higher (100%). DSe was 100% in samples collected within the first--for treatment important--4 days after onset of the illness. Reproducibility and repeatability of the assay, determined by blind testing kidney samples from 20 confirmed positive and 20 negative rodents both appeared 100%. In conclusion we have described for the first time the development of a robust SYBR Green real-time PCR for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira combined with a detailed assessment of its clinical accuracy, thus providing a method for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis with a well-defined satisfactory performance."

https://openalex.org/W2063687158,"The Warburg effect describes how cancer cells down-regulate their aerobic respiration and preferentially use glycolysis to generate energy. To evaluate the link between hypoxia and Warburg effect, we studied mitochondrial electron transport, angiogenesis and glycolysis in pheochromocytomas induced by germ-line mutations in VHL, RET, NF1 and SDH genes. SDH and VHL gene mutations have been shown to lead to the activation of hypoxic response, even in normoxic conditions, a process now referred to as pseudohypoxia. We observed a decrease in electron transport protein expression and activity, associated with increased angiogenesis in SDH- and VHL-related, pseudohypoxic tumors, while stimulation of glycolysis was solely observed in VHL tumors. Moreover, microarray analyses revealed that expression of genes involved in these metabolic pathways is an efficient tool for classification of pheochromocytomas in accordance with the predisposition gene mutated. Our data suggest an unexpected association between pseudohypoxia and loss of p53, which leads to a distinct Warburg effect in VHL-related pheochromocytomas."

Ecological approaches to distinguish between these two biogeographic controls are limited by environmental variability both in space and through time (see the Perspective by Patterson ). Using a 1.5-million-year fossil record of marine diatoms, Cermeño and Falkowski (p. 1539 ) show that, even at the largest (global) spatial scale, the dispersal of marine diatoms is not very limited.

Thus, even without exogenous sources of variability such as weather, fundamental uncertainties arise biologically from inherent differences among individuals and small population sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1965671005,"The ability of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to stimulate cartilage matrix synthesis is reduced in aged and osteoarthritic cartilage. Aging and osteoarthritis are associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species, which we hypothesized would interfere with normal IGF-I signaling. We compared IGF-I signaling in normal and osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes and investigated the effects of oxidative stress induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP). In normal human chondrocytes, IGF-I initiated a strong and sustained phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Tyr-612) and Akt (Ser-473) and transient ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, in osteoarthritic chondrocytes, which possessed elevated basal IRS-1 (Ser-312) and ERK phosphorylation, IGF-I failed to stimulate IRS-1 (Tyr-612) or Akt phosphorylation. In normal human chondrocytes, tBHP triggered strong IRS-1 (Ser-312 and Ser-616) and ERK phosphorylation and inhibited IGF-I-induced IRS-1 (Tyr-612) and Akt phosphorylation. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active (CA) Akt significantly enhanced proteoglycan synthesis, whereas both dominant negative Akt and CA MEK inhibited proteoglycan synthesis. CA Akt also promoted type II collagen and Sox9 expression, whereas tBHP treatment and CA MEK inhibited aggrecan, collagen II, and Sox9 mRNA expression. In osteoarthritic chondrocytes, the antioxidants Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin and N-acetylcysteine increased the ratio of Akt to ERK phosphorylation and promoted IGF-I-mediated proteoglycan synthesis. Chemical inhibition of ERK significantly enhanced IGF-I phosphorylation of Akt and alleviated tBHP inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. These results demonstrate opposing roles for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt and MEK-ERK in cartilage matrix synthesis and suggest that elevated levels of reactive oxygen species cause chondrocyte IGF-I resistance by altering the balance of Akt to ERK activity."
https://openalex.org/W1964867682,"Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a predominantly nuclear enzyme that exerts numerous functions in cellular physiology and pathology, from maintenance of DNA stability to transcriptional regulation. Through a proteomic analysis of PARP-1 co-immunoprecipitation complexes, we identified Mitofilin, a mitochondrial protein, as a new PARP-1 interactor. This result prompted us to further investigate the presence and the role of the enzyme in mitochondria. Using laser confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis of purified mitochondria, we demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of a fraction of PARP-1. Further, the effects of overexpressing or down-regulating Mitofilin showed that this protein promotes and is required for PARP-1 mitochondrial localization. We also report several lines of evidence suggesting that intramitochondrial PARP-1 plays a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage signaling and/or repair. First, we show that PARP-1 binds to different regions throughout the mtDNA. Moreover, we demonstrated that the depletion of either PARP-1 or Mitofilin, which abrogates the mitochondrial localization of the enzyme, leads to the accumulation of mtDNA damage. Finally, we show that DNA ligase III, known to be required for mtDNA repair, participates in a PARP-1-containing complex bound to mtDNA. This work highlights a new environment for PARP-1, opening the possibility that at least some of the nuclear functions of the enzyme can be also extended to mtDNA metabolism."

Foamy viruses, complex retroviruses that infect mammals, have been notably absent from this record. We have found an endogenous foamy virus within the genomes of sloths and show that foamy viruses were infecting mammals more than 100 million years ago and codiverged with their hosts across an entire geological era. Our analysis highlights the role of evolutionary constraint in maintaining viral genome structure and indicates that accessory genes and mammalian mechanisms of innate immunity are the products of macroevolutionary conflict played out over a geological time scale."

https://openalex.org/W2004147608,"Mitochondrial oxidative stress is a contributing factor in the etiology of numerous neuronal disorders. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) modify cellular targets to induce the death of neurons remains unknown. The goal of this study was to determine if oxidative inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) resulted in the release of redox-active iron (Fe2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and whether this contributes to cell death.Incubation of rat primary mesencephalic cultures with the redox cycling herbicide paraquat (PQ2+) resulted in increased production of H2O2 and Fe2+ at times preceding cell death. To confirm the role of m-aconitase as a source of Fenton reagents and death, we overexpressed m-aconitase using an adenoviral construct thereby increasing the target available for inactivation by ROS. Co-labeling studies identified astrocytes as the predominant cell type expressing transduced m-aconitase although neurons were identified as the primary cell type dying. Oxidative inactivation of m-aconitase overexpressing cultures resulted in exacerbation of H2O2 production, Fe2+ accumulation and increased neuronal death. Increased cell death in m-aconitase overexpressing cultures was attenuated by addition of catalase and/or a cell permeable iron chelator suggesting that neuronal death occurred in part via astrocyte-derived H2O2.These results suggest a role of ROS-sensitive m-aconitase as a source of Fe2+ and H2O2 and as a contributing factor to neurotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2046159737,"The changes in phylogenetic composition and structure of communities during succession following disturbance can give us insights into the forces that are shaping communities over time. In abandoned agricultural fields, community composition changes rapidly when a field is plowed, and is thought to reflect a relaxation of competition due to the elimination of dominant species which take time to re-establish. Competition can drive phylogenetic overdispersion, due to phylogenetic conservation of 'niche' traits that allow species to partition resources. Therefore, undisturbed old field communities should exhibit higher phylogenetic dispersion than recently disturbed systems, which should be relatively 'clustered' with respect to phylogenetic relationships. Several measures of phylogenetic structure between plant communities were measured in recently plowed areas and nearby 'undisturbed' sites. There was no difference in the absolute values of these measures between disturbed and 'undisturbed' sites. However, there was a difference in the 'expected' phylogenetic structure between habitats, leading to significantly lower than expected phylogenetic diversity in disturbed plots, and no difference from random expectation in 'undisturbed' plots. This suggests that plant species characteristic of each habitat are fairly evenly distributed on the shared species pool phylogeny, but that once the initial sorting of species into the two habitat types has occurred, the processes operating on them affect each habitat differently. These results were consistent with an analysis of correlation between phylogenetic distance and co-occurrence indices of species pairs in the two habitat types. This study supports the notion that disturbed plots are more clustered than expected, rather than 'undisturbed' plots being more overdispersed, suggesting that disturbed plant communities are being more strongly influenced by environmental filtering of conserved niche traits."

https://openalex.org/W2014308349,"Tumor progression and metastasis depend on the ability of cancer cells to initiate angiogenesis to ensure delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors to tumor cells and provide access to the systemic circulation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can activate expression of a broad range of genes that mediate many of the adaptive responses to decreased oxygen concentration, such as enhanced glucose uptake and formation of new blood vessels. Acting through Plexin-B1 on endothelial cells, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) has been shown to promote angiogenesis and enhance invasive growth and proliferation in some tumors. Here we show that the gene for Sema4D, the product of which is elevated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, contains upstream hypoxia response elements (HRE) and is strongly induced in hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner. Knocking down Sema4D expression with short hairpin (sh) RNA reduces in vitro endothelial cell migration and growth and vascularity of HNSCC xenografts expressing a degradation resistant HIF-1alpha subunit. We also demonstrate a correlation between HIF-1 activity and Sema4D expression in HNSCC specimens. These findings indicate that Sema4D is induced by hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner and influences endothelial cell migration and tumor vascularity. Expression of Sema4D may be a strategy by which carcinomas promote angiogenesis and therefore could represent a therapeutic target for these malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2037404760,"Reprogramming human somatic cells to pluripotency represents a valuable resource for the development of in vitro based models for human disease and holds tremendous potential for deriving patient-specific pluripotent stem cells. Recently, mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) have been shown capable of reprogramming into a pluripotent state by forced expression of Oct3/4 and Klf4; however it has been unknown whether this same strategy could apply to human NSCs, which would result in more relevant pluripotent stem cells for modeling human disease.Here, we show that OCT3/4 and KLF4 are indeed sufficient to induce pluripotency from human NSCs within a two week time frame and are molecularly indistinguishable from human ES cells. Furthermore, human NSC-derived pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into all three germ lineages both in vitro and in vivo.We propose that human NSCs represent an attractive source of cells for producing human iPS cells since they only require two factors, obviating the need for c-MYC, for induction into pluripotency. Thus, in vitro human disease models could be generated from iPS cells derived from human NSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2018747277,"Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are leading to changes in the nature of many habitats globally, and the magnitude and frequency of these perturbations are predicted to increase under climate change. Globally coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change. Fishes often show relatively rapid declines in abundance when corals become stressed and die, but the processes responsible are largely unknown. This study explored the mechanism by which coral bleaching may influence the levels and selective nature of mortality on a juvenile damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, which associates with hard coral. Recently settled fish had a low propensity to migrate small distances (40 cm) between habitat patches, even when densities were elevated to their natural maximum. Intraspecific interactions and space use differ among three habitats: live hard coral, bleached coral and dead algal-covered coral. Large fish pushed smaller fish further from the shelter of bleached and dead coral thereby exposing smaller fish to higher mortality than experienced on healthy coral. Small recruits suffered higher mortality than large recruits on bleached and dead coral. Mortality was not size selective on live coral. Survival was 3 times as high on live coral as on either bleached or dead coral. Subtle behavioural interactions between fish and their habitats influence the fundamental link between life history stages, the distribution of phenotypic traits in the local population and potentially the evolution of life history strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2117418766,"Many mass spectrometry-based studies, as well as other biological experiments produce cluster-correlated data. Failure to account for correlation among observations may result in a classification algorithm overfitting the training data and producing overoptimistic estimated error rates and may make subsequent classifications unreliable. Current common practice for dealing with replicated data is to average each subject replicate sample set, reducing the dataset size and incurring loss of information. In this manuscript we compare three approaches to dealing with cluster-correlated data: unmodified Breiman's Random Forest (URF), forest grown using subject-level averages (SLA), and RF++ with subject-level bootstrapping (SLB). RF++, a novel Random Forest-based algorithm implemented in C++, handles cluster-correlated data through a modification of the original resampling algorithm and accommodates subject-level classification. Subject-level bootstrapping is an alternative sampling method that obviates the need to average or otherwise reduce each set of replicates to a single independent sample. Our experiments show nearly identical median classification and variable selection accuracy for SLB forests and URF forests when applied to both simulated and real datasets. However, the run-time estimated error rate was severely underestimated for URF forests. Predictably, SLA forests were found to be more severely affected by the reduction in sample size which led to poorer classification and variable selection accuracy. Perhaps most importantly our results suggest that it is reasonable to utilize URF for the analysis of cluster-correlated data. Two caveats should be noted: first, correct classification error rates must be obtained using a separate test dataset, and second, an additional post-processing step is required to obtain subject-level classifications. RF++ is shown to be an effective alternative for classifying both clustered and non-clustered data. Source code and stand-alone compiled versions of command-line and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) versions of RF++ for Windows and Linux as well as a user manual (Supplementary File S2) are available for download at: http://sourceforge.org/projects/rfpp/ under the GNU public license."
https://openalex.org/W2012683574,"Integrins form mechanical links between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Although integrin activation is known to be regulated by an allosteric conformational change, which can be induced from the extracellular or intracellular end of the molecule, little is known regarding the sequence of structural events by which signals propagate between distant sites. Here, we reveal with molecular dynamics simulations of the FnIII(10)-bound alpha(V)beta(3) integrin headpiece how the binding pocket and interdomain betaA/hybrid domain hinge on the distal end of the betaA domain are allosterically linked via a hydrophobic T-junction between the middle of the alpha1 helix and top of the alpha7 helix. The key results of this study are: 1) that this T-junction is induced by ligand binding and hinge opening, and thus displays bidirectionality; 2) that formation of this junction can be accelerated by ligand-mediated force; and 3) how formation of this junction is inhibited by Ca(2+) in place of Mg(2+) at the site adjacent to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (""ADMIDAS""). Together with recent experimental evidence that integrin complexes can form catch bonds (i.e. become strengthened under force), as well as earlier evidence that Ca(2+) at the ADMIDAS results in lower binding affinity, these simulations provide a common structural model for the dynamic process by which integrins become activated."
https://openalex.org/W2019434001,"The Myc/Max/Mad network transcription factors are known to govern target gene expression through recruiting histone acetyltransferases or deacetylases. In the present study, we show that Madl recruits the histone demethylase RBP2 to the Myc target telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene promoter to repress transcription. With differentiation of leukemic HL60 cells, Madl and RBP2 were both up-regulated, interacted, and cooccupied the hTERT promoter accompanied by histone H3-K4 demethylation. In immortalized p493–6 B cells, shutting down c-Myc led to the accumulation of Madl and RBP2 at hTERT promoter and diminished hTERT mRNA expression. When RBP2 was depleted, hTERT expression was significantly enhanced, coupled with dissociation of RBP2 with and increased H3-K4 methylation at the hTERT promoter in p493–6 cells. Moreover, RBP2 and Madl were present on the hTERT promoter in human fibroblasts having a silent hTERT gene, and RBP2 depletion resulted in gene derepression. Taken together, Madl recruits RBP2 to the hTERT promoter that, in turn, demethylates H3-K4, thereby contributing to a stable repression of the hTERT gene in normal or differentiated malignant cells. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism through which the Myc/Max/Mad network proteins control their target gene transcription and provide insights into mechanisms underlying telomerase silencing and activation.—Ge, Z., Li, W., Wang, N., Liu, C., Zhu, Q., Björkholm, M., Gruber, A., Xu, D.

https://openalex.org/W2055569374,"The ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and its SNAP (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein) cofactor constitute the ubiquitous enzymatic machinery responsible for recycling of the SNARE (SNAP receptor) membrane fusion machinery. The enzyme uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to dissociate the constituents of the SNARE complex, which is formed during the fusion of a transport vesicle with the acceptor membrane. However, it is still unclear how NSF and the SNAP adaptor work together to take the tight SNARE bundle apart. SNAPs have been reported to attach to membranes independently from SNARE complex binding. We have investigated how efficient the disassembly of soluble and membrane-bound substrates are, comparing the two. We found that SNAPs support disassembly of membrane-bound SNARE complexes much more efficiently. Moreover, we identified a putative, conserved membrane attachment site in an extended loop within the N-terminal domain of alpha-SNAP. Mutation of two highly conserved, exposed phenylalanine residues on the extended loop prevent SNAPs from facilitating disassembly of membrane-bound SNARE complexes. This implies that the disassembly machinery is adapted to attack membrane-bound SNARE complexes, probably in their relaxed cis-configuration."

As none of them affects the residues known to be critical for LH activity, we studied their consequences at the molecular level by analyzing the folding and catalytic properties of the corresponding mutant recombinant polypeptides. Folding and oligomerization of the R594H and G597V mutants were abnormal, and their activity was reduced by >95% relative to the wild type. The T604I mutation did not affect the folding properties, although the mutant retained only ∼8% activity under standard assay conditions. As the reduced activity was caused by a 10-fold increase in the Km for 2-oxoglutarate, the mutation interferes with binding of this cosubstrate. In the presence of a saturating 2-oxoglutarate concentration, the activity of the T604I mutant was ∼30% of that of the wild type. However, the T604I mutant did not generate detectable amounts of hydroxylysine in the N-terminal telopeptide of a recombinant procollagen I chain when coexpressed in insect cells. The low activity of the mutant LH2 polypeptides is in accordance with the markedly reduced extent of collagen telopeptide hydroxylation in Bruck syndrome, with consequent changes in the cross-linking of collagen fibrils and severe abnormalities in the skeletal structures.

Hydroxylysine residues have at least two important functions in collagens. They are essential for stabilization of the intermolecular collagen cross-links that provide the tensile strength and mechanical stability for collagen fibrils, and their hydroxy groups serve as attachment sites for carbohydrates, either a galactose or a glucosyl-galactose unit (1Kivirikko K.I.

Fibril-forming collagens have four cross-linking sites, one each in the N- and C-terminal telopeptides and two in the triple helix.

These findings have led to the suggestion that LH1 and LH2(long) may be responsible for the hydroxylation of lysine residues within the collagenous and telopeptide regions of collagen polypeptides, respectively. Studies with synthetic peptides have shown, however, that all three LH isoenzymes are capable of hydroxylating the -XKG- sequences representing the triple-helical cross-linking sites but with different efficiencies (29Takaluoma K. Lantto J. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of various tissue samples from LH1 null mice showed recently that the triple-helical cross-linking sites were hydroxylated to varying extents in different tissues, thus demonstrating that LH2 and LH3 are also capable of hydroxylating these sites in vivo, although they cannot fully compensate for the lack of LH1 activity (30Takaluoma K.

The mutations R594H, G597V, and T604I were introduced into the pAcgp67A-LH2(long) baculovirus transfer vector using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

The DNA sequences were verified on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3100, Applied Biosystems). The recombinant baculovirus vectors were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were amplified (36Crossen R.

The wild-type and mutant LH2(long) proteins were expressed in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) cultured in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The media samples were collected 72 h after infection by centrifugation first at 250 × g and then at 8300 × g for 10 min each. Media samples containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were incubated with chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (1.5–2 ml/100-ml media sample; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, 50 mm urea, and 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing. The resin was packed into a column; the flow-through was collected; and the column was washed three times with 10–30 volumes of the above buffer. 300-μl aliquots of the resin with bound proteins were collected before and after washing and boiled directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the column with the above buffer containing 50 mm histidine. Samples of the bound proteins before and after washing the column and the flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing the full-length wild-type or mutant LH2(long) polypeptides were pooled, concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore Corp.), passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the above buffer to remove the excess histidine, and used directly in LH activity assays. The protein concentrations were determined with Roti-Quant (Karl Roth GmbH). The purified enzymes were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and by 8% nondenaturing PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or ECL Western blotting (GE Healthcare) with a polyclonal rabbit antibody generated against a synthetic LH peptide. N-terminal sequencing was performed using samples transferred to a ProBlottTM membrane (Applied Biosystems) and a ProciseTM 492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with a rapid reverse-phase HPLC gradient. LH activity was determined by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate in a reaction volume of 0.5 ml using the synthetic peptide (IKG)3 (Innovagen) as a substrate (37Kivirikko K.I.

For CD spectrum measurements, the buffer of the purified wild-type and mutant recombinant LH2(long) polypeptides was exchanged with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD spectrum measurements of the purified LH2(long) polypeptides were recorded with a JASCO J-715 CD spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette, with the sample cell temperature controlled by a JASCO PFD-350S Peltier-type temperature control unit. Far-UV spectra were measured at 20 °C between 240 and 195 or 190 nm using a step size of 0.2 nm and a scan speed of 20 nm/min with four accumulations for blank spectra and eight accumulations for sample spectra. The bandwidth used was 1 nm; the response time was 1 s; and the protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The purified wild-type and mutant recombinant LH2 polypeptides (10 μg) were digested with thermolysin (R&D Systems) at a protease/LH2 ratio of 1:500 at 37 °C for 60 min. The digestion was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 3 mm. Thermolysin was omitted in control samples.

https://openalex.org/W2100501305,"α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is the major component of Lewy bodies (LBs) deposited in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. Synphilin-1 (Sphl) is a novel α-Syn-interacting protein also present in the LBs. However, the roles of α-Syn-Sphl interaction in LB formation and in the related pathogenesis are still unclear. We have studied the interaction between α-Syn and Sph1 by biochemical and structural approaches and found that the central coiled-coil domain of Sph1 specifically interacts with the N-terminal stretch of α-Syn. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, Sphl forms inclusions together with α-Syn, but the Sphl-positive inclusions cannot recruit the N-terminally truncated α-Syn. The central portion of Sph1 can also recruit α-Syn and induce inclusion formation through its coiled-coil domain. These observations demonstrate that the α-Syn-Sphl interaction significantly promotes the formation of cytoplasmic α-Syn inclusions, which may have implications for LB formation in neural cells. We have also elucidated solution structure of the coiled-coil domain of Sphl and its interaction with the N-terminal peptide of α-Syn. The specific interaction between α-Syn and Sphl provides mechanistic insights into the inclusion-body formation in cells and pathological implication in Parkinson's disease.—Xie, Y.-Y., Zhou, C.-J., Zhou, Z.-R., Hong, J., Che, M.-X., Fu, Q.-S., Song, A.-X., Lin, D.-H., and Hu, H.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W1992070708,"Epsilon toxin is a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium perfringens types B and D, an anaerobic bacterium that causes enterotoxaemia in ruminants. In the affected animal, it causes oedema of the lungs and brain by damaging the endothelial cells, inducing physiological and morphological changes. Although it is believed to compromise the intestinal barrier, thus entering the gut vasculature, little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. This study characterizes the effects of epsilon toxin on fluid transport and bioelectrical parameters in the small intestine of mice and rats. The enteropooling and the intestinal loop tests, together with the single-pass perfusion assay and in vitro and ex vivo analysis in Ussing's chamber, were all used in combination with histological and ultrastructural analysis of mice and rat small intestine, challenged with or without C. perfringens epsilon toxin. Luminal epsilon toxin induced a time and concentration dependent intestinal fluid accumulation and fall of the transepithelial resistance. Although no evident histological changes were observed, opening of the mucosa tight junction in combination with apoptotic changes in the lamina propria were seen with transmission electron microscopy. These results indicate that C. perfringens epsilon toxin alters the intestinal permeability, predominantly by opening the mucosa tight junction, increasing its permeability to macromolecules, and inducing further degenerative changes in the lamina propria of the bowel."
https://openalex.org/W2038015695,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor plays an essential role in modulating neurotransmitter release and regulating the activity of ion channels and adenyl cyclase. However, whether the naturally occurring polymorphisms in the two GABA(B) receptor subunit genes interact with each other to alter susceptibility to nicotine dependence (ND) remains largely unknown. In this study, we genotyped 5 and 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for GABA(B) receptor subunit 1 and 2 genes (GABBR1, GABBR2), respectively, in a sample of 2037 individuals from 602 nuclear families of African- American (AA) or European-American (EA) origin. We conducted association analyses to determine (1) the association of each subunit gene with ND at both the individual SNP and haplotype levels and (2) the collective effect(s) of SNPs in both GABA(B) subunits on the development of ND. Several individual SNPs and haplotypes in GABBR2 were significantly associated with ND in both ethnic samples. Two haplotypes in AAs and one haplotype in EAs showed a protective effect against ND, whilst two other haplotypes in AAs and three haplotypes in EAs showed a risk effect for developing ND. Interestingly, these significant haplotypes were confined to two regions of GABBR2 in the AA and EA samples. Additionally, we found two minor haplotypes in GABBR1 to be positively associated with Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) in the EA sample. Finally, we demonstrated the presence of epistasis between GABBR1 and GABBR2 for developing ND. The variants of GABBR1 and GABBR2 are significantly associated with ND, and the involvement of GABBR1 is most likely through its interaction with GABBR2, whereas GABBR2 polymorphisms directly alter susceptibility to ND. Future studies are needed with more dense SNP coverage of GABBR1 and GABBR2 to verify the epistatic effects of the two subunit genes."
https://openalex.org/W2080144615,"Physiological polyamines are required in various biological processes. In the current study, we used norspermidine, a structural analog of the natural polyamine spermidine, to investigate polyamine uptake in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Norsper-midine was found to have two remarkable effects: it is toxic for the nematode, without affecting its food, Escherichia coli; and it hampers RNA interference. By characterizing a norspermidine-resistant C. elegans mutant strain that has been isolated in a genetic screen, we demonstrate that both effects, as well as the uptake of a fluorescent polyamine-conjugate, depend on the transporter protein CATP-5, a novel P5B-type ATPase. To our knowledge, CATP-5 represents the first P5-type ATPase that is associated with the plasma membrane, being expressed in the apical membrane of intestinal cells and the excretory cell. Moreover, genetic interaction studies using C. elegans polyamine synthesis mutants indicate that CATP-5 has a function redundant to polyamine synthesis and link reduced polyamine levels to retarded postembryonic development, reduced brood size, shortened life span, and small body size. We suggest that CATP-5 represents a crucial component of the pharmacologically important polyamine transport system, the molecular nature of which has not been identified so far in metazoa.—Heinick, A., Urban, K., Roth, S., Spies, D., Nunes, F., Phanstiel IV, O., Liebau, E., Lüersen, K.

https://openalex.org/W2006475777,"Hyperhomocysteinemia has been correlated with hepatic steatosis and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), yet a causal relationship has not been established. Although methionine and choline are essential components of homocysteine metabolism, the role of homocysteine in the pathogenesis of a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet remains unknown. We explored the effects of homocysteine supplementation on hepatic steatosis and the UPR in mice fed a control or MCD diet. Mice fed the MCD diet developed severe hyperhomocysteinemia and activation of the hepatic UPR. Supplementing the MCD diet with homocysteine attenuated the MCD diet-induced hepatic UPR activation and other injurious effects of the MCD diet including hepatic cholesterol accumulation, weight loss, and plasma ALT elevation. Homocysteine supplementation replenished the MCD diet-induced depletion of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Depleting SAM in HepG2 cells using MAT1alpha siRNA or cycloleucine resulted in enhanced activation of the UPR upon exposure to thapsigargin. Mice fed a control diet supplemented with homocysteine had a 3-fold elevation in plasma homocysteine level by 2 weeks and 6-fold elevation by 6 weeks but demonstrated no other pathophysiologic change. In summary, we found that homocysteine attenuates MCD diet-induced hepatic UPR activation, likely via repletion of hepatic SAM. Furthermore, homocysteine supplementation alone does not cause hepatic steatosis or UPR activation despite inducing hyperhomocysteinemia. These studies indicate that although hyperhomocysteinemia is often associated with hepatic steatosis and UPR activation, these effects may be a secondary response rather than a direct effect of homocysteine."
https://openalex.org/W2089959534,"Sam68, Src associated in mitosis of 68 kDa, is a known RNA-binding protein and a signaling adaptor protein for tyrosine kinases. However, the proteins associated with Sam68 and the existence of a Sam68 complex, its mass, and regulation are, however, unknown. Herein we identify a large Sam68 complex with a mass >1 MDa in HeLa cells that is composed of ∼40 proteins using an immunoprecipitation followed by a mass spectrometry approach. Many of the proteins identified are RNA-binding proteins and are known components of a previously identified structure termed the spreading initiation center. The large Sam68 complex is a ribonucleoprotein complex, as treatment with RNases caused a shift in the molecular mass of the complex to 200–450 kDa. Moreover, treatment of HeLa cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or epidermal growth factor induced the disassociation of Sam68 from the large complex and the appearance of Sam68 within the smaller complex. Actually, in certain cell lines such as breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20, Sam68 exists in equilibrium between a large and a small complex. The appearance of the small Sam68 complex in cells correlates with the ability of Sam68 to promote the alternative splicing of CD44 and cell migration. Our findings show that Sam68 exists in equilibrium in transformed cells between two complexes and that extracellular signals, such as epidermal growth factor stimulation, promote alternative splicing by modulating the composition of the Sam68 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2114463938,"This paper presents a low-cost inkjet dosing system capable of continuous, two-dimensional spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression via delivery of diffusible regulators to a custom-mounted gel culture of E. coli. A consumer-grade, inkjet printer was adapted for chemical printing; E. coli cultures were grown on 750 µm thick agar embedded in micro-wells machined into commercial compact discs. Spatio-temporal regulation of the lac operon was demonstrated via the printing of patterns of lactose and glucose directly into the cultures; X-Gal blue patterns were used for visual feedback. We demonstrate how the bistable nature of the lac operon's feedback, when perturbed by patterning lactose (inducer) and glucose (inhibitor), can lead to coordination of cell expression patterns across a field in ways that mimic motifs seen in developmental biology. Examples of this include sharp boundaries and the generation of traveling waves of mRNA expression. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of reaction-diffusion effects in the well-studied lac operon. A finite element reaction-diffusion model of the lac operon is also presented which predicts pattern formation with good fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2012049931,"Laminin-2 promotes basement membrane assembly and peripheral myelinogenesis; however, a receptor-binding motif within laminin-2 and the downstream signaling pathways for motif-mediated cell adhesion have not been fully established. The human laminin-2 alpha2 chain cDNAs cloned from human keratinocytes and fibroblasts correspond to the laminin alpha2 chain variant sequence from the human brain. Individually expressed recombinant large globular (LG) 1 protein promotes cell adhesion and has heparin binding activities. Studies with synthetic peptides delineate the DLTIDDSYWYRI motif (Ln2-P3) within the LG1 as a major site for both heparin and cell binding. Cell adhesion to LG1 and Ln2-P3 is inhibited by treatment of heparitinase I and chondroitinase ABC. Syndecan-1 from PC12 cells binds to LG1 and Ln2-P3 and colocalizes with both molecules. Suppression of syndecan-1 with RNA interference inhibits cell adhesion to LG1 and Ln2-P3. The binding of syndecan-1 with LG1 and Ln2-P3 induces the recruitment of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) into the membrane and stimulates its tyrosine phosphorylation. A decrease in PKCdelta activity significantly reduces cell adhesion to LG1 and Ln2-P3. Taken together, these results indicate that the Ln2-P3 motif and LG1 domain, containing the motif, within the human laminin-2 alpha2 chain are major ligands for syndecan-1, which mediates cell adhesion through the PKCdelta signaling pathway."

Furthermore, this enzyme has been shown to play a major role in the physiological development of bone and cartilage as well as in pathophysiological processes such as systemic sclerosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or fibrosis. Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of the XYLT1 gene promoter region and important transcription factors involved in its regulation. Members of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) family of transcription factors are necessary for the transcriptional regulation of the XYLT1 gene, which was proven by curcumin, tanshinone IIA, mithramycin A, and short interference RNA treatment. A stepwise 5' and 3' deletion of the predicted GC-rich promoter region, which lacks a TATA and/or CAAT box, revealed that a 531-bp core promoter element is able to drive the transcription on a basal level. A binding site for transcription factors of the AP-1 family, which is essential for full promoter activity, was identified by site-directed mutagenesis located 730 bp 5' of the translation initiation site. The ability of this site to bind members of the AP-1 family was further verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A promoter element containing this binding site was able to drive the transcription to about 79-fold above control in SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells. Our findings provide a first insight into the regulation of the XYLT1 gene and may contribute to understanding the processes taking place during extracellular matrix formation and remodeling in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2064887465,"Bone marrow transplantation is a curative treatment for many diseases, including leukemia, autoimmune diseases, and a number of immunodeficiencies. Recently, it was claimed that bone marrow cells transdifferentiate, a much desired property as bone marrow cells are abundant and therefore could be used in regenerative medicine to treat incurable chronic diseases. Using a Cre/loxP system, we studied cell fusion after bone marrow transplantation. Fused cells were chiefly Gr-1(+), a myeloid cell marker, and found predominantly in the bone marrow; in parenchymal tissues. Surprisingly, fused cells were most abundant in the kidney, Peyer's patches, and cardiac tissue. In contrast, after cell fusion with embryonic stem cells, bone marrow cells were reprogrammed into new tetraploid pluripotent stem cells that successfully differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes. Together, these data suggest that cell fusion is ubiquitous after cellular transplants and that the subsequent sharing of genetic material between the fusion partners affects cellular survival and function. Fusion between tumor cells and bone marrow cells could have consequences for tumor malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W2087919325,"The mitochondrial protease OMI (also known as HtrA2) has been implicated in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and deletion or protease domain point mutations have shown profound neuropathologies in mice. A beneficial role by OMI, in preserving cell viability, is assumed to occur via the avoidance of dysfunctional protein turnover. However relatively few substrates for mitochondrial Omi are known. Here we report our identification of three novel mitochondrial substrates that impact metabolism and ATP production. Using a dual proteomic approach we have identified three interactors based upon ability to bind to OMI, and/or to persist in the proteome after OMI activity has been selectively inhibited. One candidate, the chaperone HSPA8, was common to each independent study. Two others (PDHB subunit and IDH3A subunit) did not appear to bind to OMI, however persisted in the mito-proteome when OMI was inhibited. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are two key Kreb's cycle enzymes that catalyse oxidative decarboxylation control points in mitochondrial respiration. We verified both PDHB and IDH3A co-immunoprecipitate with HSPA8 and after elution, were degraded by recombinant HtrA2 in vitro. Additionally our gene expression studies, using rotenone (an inhibitor of Complex I) showed Omi expression was silenced when pdhb and idh3a were increased when a sub-lethal dose was applied. However higher dose treatment caused increased Omi expression and decreased levels of pdhb and idh3a transcripts. This implicates mitochondrial OMI in a novel mechanism relating to metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1997158105,"Upon ligand binding, cell surface signaling receptors are internalized through a process tightly regulated by endocytic proteins and adaptor protein 2 (AP2) to orchestrate them. Although the molecular identities and roles of endocytic proteins are becoming clearer, it is still unclear what determines the receptor endocytosis kinetics which is mainly regulated by the accumulation of endocytic apparatus to the activated receptors.Here we employed the kinetic analysis of endocytosis and adaptor recruitment to show that mu2, a subunit of AP2 interacts directly with phospholipase D (PLD)1, a receptor-associated signaling protein and this facilitates the membrane recruitment of AP2 and the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We also demonstrate that the PLD1-mu2 interaction requires the binding of PLD1 with phosphatidic acid, its own product.These results suggest that the temporal regulation of EGFR endocytosis is achieved by auto-regulatory PLD1 which senses the receptor activation and triggers the translocation of AP2 near to the activated receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2000115740,"Alternative splicing of 3'-terminal exons plays a critical role in gene expression by producing mRNA with distinct 3'-untranslated regions that regulate their fate and their expression. The Xenopus alpha-tropomyosin pre-mRNA possesses a composite internal/3'-terminal exon (exon 9A9') that is differentially processed depending on the embryonic tissue. Exon 9A9' is repressed in non-muscle tissue by the polypyrimidine tract binding protein, whereas it is selected as a 3'-terminal or internal exon in myotomal cells and adult striated muscles, respectively. We report here the identification of an intronic regulatory element, designated the upstream terminal exon enhancer (UTE), that is required for the specific usage of exon 9A9' as a 3'-terminal exon in the myotome. We demonstrate that polypyrimidine tract binding protein prevents the activity of UTE in non-muscle cells, whereas a subclass of serine/arginine rich (SR) proteins promotes the selection of exon 9A9' in a UTE-dependent way. Morpholino-targeted blocking of UTE in the embryo strongly reduced the inclusion of exon 9A9' as a 3'-terminal exon in the endogenous mRNA, demonstrating the function of UTE under physiological circumstances. This strategy allowed us to reveal a splicing pathway that generates a mRNA with no in frame stop codon and whose steady-state level is translation-dependent. This result suggests that a non-stop decay mechanism participates in the strict control of the 3'-end processing of the alpha-tropomyosin pre-mRNA."

Because the list of gamma-secretase substrates is growing quickly and this enzyme is a cancer and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic target, the mapping of gamma-secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways.To identify genes and molecular functions transcriptionally affected by gamma-secretase activity, the cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced and inhibited gamma-secretase activity were analyzed and compared by cDNA microarray. The functional clustering by FatiGO of the 1,981 identified genes revealed over- and under-represented groups with multiple activities and functions. Single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to gamma-secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the 21 validated genes, the strikingly decreased transcription of PTPRG and AMN1 and increased transcription of UPP1 potentially support data on cell cycle disturbances relevant to cancer, stem cell and neurodegenerative diseases' research. The mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data and revealed broad effects on Wnt pathway members, including WNT3A and DVL3. Intriguingly, the transcription of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is affected by gamma-secretase activity and was significantly altered in the analyzed human Alzheimer's disease brain cortices.Investigating the effects of gamma-secretase activity on gene transcription has revealed several affected clusters of molecular functions and, more specifically, 21 genes that hold significant potential for a better understanding of the biology of gamma-secretase and its roles in cancer and Alzheimer's disease pathology."
