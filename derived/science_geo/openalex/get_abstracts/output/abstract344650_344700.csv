https://openalex.org/W2014276882,"A coupled numerical model of the global atmosphere and biosphere has been used to assess the effects of Amazon deforestation on the regional and global climate. When the tropical forests in the model were replaced by degraded grass (pasture), there was a significant increase in surface temperature and a decrease in evapotranspiration and precipitation over Amazonia. In the simulation, the length of the dry season also increased; such an increase could make reestablishment of the tropical forests after massive deforestation particularly difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2084763116,"Optical control over elementary molecular motion is enhanced with timed sequences of femtosecond (10-15 second) pulses produced by pulse-shaping techniques. Appropriately timed pulse sequences are used to repetitively drive selected vibrations of a crystal lattice, in a manner analogous to repetitively pushing a child on a swing with appropriate timing to build up a large oscillation amplitude. This process corresponds to repetitively ""pushing"" molecules along selected paths in the lattice. Amplification of selected vibrational modes and discrimination against other modes are demonstrated. Prospects for more extensive manipulation of molecular and collective behavior and structure are clearly indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1986841636,"ZSM-18 is the first known aluminosilicate zeolite to contain rings of three (Si,Al)-O species (3-rings). Its framework topology has been determined by hypothetical model building, subsequent constrained distance and angle least-squares refinements of atomic coordinates, and x-ray powder diffraction pattern simulations. Its channel structure is characterized by a linear unidimensional 12-ring channel, with an approximate pore opening of 7.0 angstroms. In addition, the channels are lined with pockets that are capped by 7-rings with dimensions of 2.8 angstroms by 3.5 angstroms. An intraframework packing model of the organic moiety used in the synthesis suggests that a strong templating effect may be responsible for the formation of this unusual zeolite structure."
https://openalex.org/W1989660883,"A magnitude 7.2 earthquake in 1975 caused the south flank of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, to move seaward in response to slippage along a deep fault. Since then, a large part of the volcano's edifice has been adjusting to this perturbation. The summit of Kilauea extended at a rate of 0.26 meter per year until 1983, the south flank uplifted more than 0.5 meter, and the axes of both the volcano's rift zones extended and subsided; the summit continues to subside. These ground-surface motions have been remarkably steady and much more widespread than those caused by either recurrent inflation and deflation of the summit magma chamber or the episodic propagation of dikes into the rift zones. Kilauea's magmatic system is, therefore, probably deeper and more extensive than previously thought; the summit and both rift zones may be underlain by a thick, near vertical dike-like magma system at a depth of 3 to 9 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2060973304,"The adsorption of neutral molecules and ions on the surfaces of zeolites was observed in real time with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Direct imaging of the surface of the zeolite clinoptilolite was possible by using a diluted tert-butyl ammonium chloride solution as a medium. Images of the crystal in different liquids revealed that molecules could be bound to the surface in different ways; neutral molecules of tert-butanol formed an ordered array, whereas tert-butyl ammonium ions formed clusters. These absorbed molecules were not rearranged by the AFM tip when used in an imaging mode. However, when a sufficiently large force was applied, the tip of the AFM could rearrange the tert-butyl ammonium ions on the zeolite surface. This demonstration of molecular manipulation suggests new applications, including biosensors and lithography."
https://openalex.org/W2014676995,"Fossil soils and grasses from the well-known Miocene mammal locality of Fort Ternan, southwestern Kenya, are evidence of a mosaic of grassy woodland and wooded grassland some 14 million years ago. This most ancient wooded grassland yet known on the African continent supported more abundant and diverse antelopes than known earlier in Africa. Ape fossils at Fort Ternan, including Kenyapithecus wickeri, were associated with woodland parts of the vegetation mosaic revealed by paleosols. Grassland habitats were available in East Africa long before the evolutionary divergence of apes and humans some 5 to 10 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2005580749,"One of the gamones (gamone II) which are effective for the induction of conjugation in Blepharisma intermedium has been isolated in a crystalline form and designated as blepharismin. From the result of chemical and spectroscopic investigations, in which x-ray crystallographic analysis was used as a definitive tool, blepharismin has been found to have the structure of calcium 3-(2'-formylamino-5'-hydroxybenzoyl)lactate."
https://openalex.org/W2035646372,"Three caste-specific substances new to arthropod glandular secretions occur in the mandibular glands of male ants of five species in the genus Camponotus. These volatile compounds, which are not found in alate females or workers, have been identified as methyl 6-methyl salicylate, 2,4-dimethyl-2-hexenoic acid, and methyl anthranilate. The free acid has not been described previously."
https://openalex.org/W2032214590,"A thick sequence of floodplain sediments has accumulated in the Delaware River Valley by the process of overbank deposition. Textures in the sediments indicate that the sequence contains no point-bar deposits and is unbroken by periods of erosion. Fourteen radiocarbon dates show that deposition began at least 6000 years ago and has continued to the present. Because the Delaware River shifts its position laterally at a very slow rate, overbank deposition becomes dominant in the construction of its floodplain."
https://openalex.org/W1981766578,"Paleozoic paleogeographies should be consistent with all available, reliable data. However, comparison of three different Devonian paleogeographies that are based largely or wholly on the data of remanent magnetism show them to be inconsistent in many regards. When these three paleogeographies are provided with possible ocean surface current circulation patterns, and have added to them lithofacies and biogeographic data, they also are shown to be inconsistent with such data. A pangaeic reconstruction positioned in the Southern Hemisphere permits the lithofacies and biogeographical data to be reconciled in a plausible manner."

These evaporites and their structural positions indicate that other brine areas are present-and, indeed, several others have been discovered."
https://openalex.org/W1977617210,"The magnetic behavior of iron in chalcopyrite (CuFeS(2)) and pyrrhotite (Fe(7)S(8)) in the pressure range from 1 atmosphere to 20 kilobars has been studied by MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. Both chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite exhibit transitions from magnetically ordered to disordered states over the range from 5 to 16 kilobars. Both transitions, particularly the loss of ferrimagnetism in pyrrhotite, have geophysical consequences."
