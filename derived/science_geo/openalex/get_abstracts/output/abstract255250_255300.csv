It has been shown previously that the cold regulation of CBF3 involves an upstream bHLH-type transcription factor, ICE1. ICE1 binds to the Myc recognition sequences in the CBF3 promoter. Apart from Myc recognition sequences, CBF promoters also have Myb recognition sequences. We report here that the Arabidopsis MYB15 is involved in cold-regulation of CBF genes and in the development of freezing tolerance. The MYB15 gene transcript is up-regulated by cold stress. The MYB15 protein interacts with ICE1 and binds to Myb recognition sequences in the promoters of CBF genes. Overexpression of MYB15 results in reduced expression of CBF genes whereas its loss-of-function leads to increased expression of CBF genes in the cold. The myb15 mutant plants show increased tolerance to freezing stress whereas its overexpression reduces freezing tolerance. Our results suggest that MYB15 is part of a complex network of transcription factors controlling the expression of CBFs and other genes in response to cold stress.

Cold temperatures have a huge impact on the survivability and distribution of living organisms. Plants, being sessile, have evolved efficient mechanisms to sense and adapt to low temperature stress. Plant responses to adverse low temperature are manifested at physiological, molecular and biochemical levels. Many temperate plants have the potential to increase their freezing tolerance after a prior exposure to nonfreezing temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation (1Guy C.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 187-223Crossref Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 3Browse J. Xin Z. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, a specific set of proteins is induced in response to low temperature, which helps plants cope with chilling and freezing stress (4Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 8Hsieh T.H. Lee J.T. Yang P.T. Chiu L.H. Charng Y.Y. Wang Y.C. Chan M.T. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Proteins induced during cold acclimation include enzymes involved in respiration and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, phenylpropanoids, and antioxidants, molecular chaperones, antifreeze proteins, and many others with a presumed function in tolerance to cellular dehydration caused by apoplastic freezing (1Guy C.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 187-223Crossref Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 4Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Promoters of many of the cold-responsive genes have the DRE/CRT/LTRE (dehydration responsive element/C-repeat/low temperature responsive element) sequence, a cis element necessary and sufficient for gene transcription under cold stress (10Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 12Jiang C. Iu B. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 679-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CBF/DREB family of transcription factors binds to this sequence and activates cold-responsive genes (11Stockinger E.J. Gilmour S.J. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 13Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The CBF transcription factor genes are also induced by cold, and their induction is regulated by components upstream in the cold response pathways (14Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 17Teige M. Scheikl E. Eulgem T. Doczi R. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Dangl J.L. Hirt H. T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that a loss-of-function mutation in CBF2 results in increased expression of CBF1 and CBF3, implying that CBF2 negatively regulates the expression of CBF1 and CBF3 (18Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition to the CBF pathway, recent studies have revealed the presence of parallel pathways associated with cold acclimation (19Seki M. Narusaka M. Abe H. Kasuga M. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 21Kreps J.A. Wu Y. Chang H.S. Zhu T. Wang X. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2129-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Some important components mediating cold tolerance through CBF-independent pathways include homeodomain and MYB-type transcription factors (22Zhu J. Shi H. Lee B.H. Damsz B. Cheng S. Stirm V. Zhu J.K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Zhu J. Verslues P.E. Zheng X. Lee B.H. Zhan X. Manabe Y. Zhu Y. Dong C.H. Zhu J.K. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9966-9971Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Support for the existence of CBF-independent pathways has also come from the analysis of the eskimo1 mutants of Arabidopsis (24Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7799-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), which are constitutively freezing tolerant, without any apparent effect on the CBF regulon. Apart from large changes in gene transcript levels, extensive reconfiguration of the metabolome also takes place in response to cold temperatures (25Cook D. Fowler S. Fiehn O. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15243-15248Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 26Kaplan F. Kopka J. Haskell D.W. Zhao W. Schiller K.C. Gatzke N. Sung D.Y. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). A critical component in the activation of CBF3 and a number of other cold-responsive transcription factor genes in Arabidopsis is ICE1 (14Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). ICE1 is a constitutively expressed transcription factor of the bHLH 2The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Luc, luciferase; RNAi, RNA interference; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. family that can bind to the Myc recognition elements in the CBF3 promoter. A dominant mutation in ICE1 blocks the cold induction of CBF3 and many other transcription factors, and reduces the expression of their downstream genes (14Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 27Lee B.H. Henderson D.A. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3155-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Apart from Myc recognition sequences, many putative Myb binding sequences are present in the promoters of CBF genes (28Shinwari Z.K. Nakashima K. Miura S. Kasuga M. Seki M. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) indicating that MYB-like transcription factors may also play a role in controlling CBF gene expression. Furthermore, some reports suggest that the interplay of MYC-like bHLH transcription factors and MYB co-transcription factors and/or WD repeat containing factors is required for transcriptional activation of target genes (29Spelt C. Quattrocchio F. Mol J.N.M. Koes R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 30Walker A.R. Davison P.A. Bolognesi-Winfield A.C. James C.M. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Esch J.J. Marks M.D. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a MYB-like transcription factor involved in the cold regulation of CBF genes. This transcription factor, referred to as MYB15, interacts physically with ICE1. MYB15 binds to sequences in the promoters of CBF1, 2, and 3 genes. Transgenic plants overexpressing MYB15 show reduced levels of CBF3, CBF2 and CBF1 transcripts in the cold. MYB15 loss-of-function mutant plants show increased levels of CBF3 as well as CBF1 and CBF2. Overexpression of MYB15 results in decreased tolerance to freezing stress, whereas its knock-out mutant exhibits increased freezing tolerance. These results suggest that MYB15 is involved in the cold-regulation of CBF genes and in cold stress tolerance. Gene Expression Analysis—For RNA analysis, 10-day-old seedlings of wild-type and ice1 mutant plants grown on separate halves of the same Murashige-Skoog (MS) nutrient agar plate were used. Total RNA extracted from control and stressed plants was analyzed by RNA blotting as described by Liu and Zhu (31Liu J. Zhu J.K. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). RNA isolated from the transgenic plants overexpressing MYB15, the RNAi line of MYB15 and the myb15 T-DNA mutant was extracted and transferred to nylon membranes. The membrane was probed with MYB15 cDNA corresponding to the full-length open reading frame, or gene-specific probes of CBF3, CBF2, and CBF1. β-Tubulin or actin gene was used as a loading control. For checking the MYB15 expression analysis in various tissues RNA was extracted from roots, leaves, stems, and flowers. 2 μg of total RNA was used to make cDNA using Superscript II cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA template was used to amplify MYB15 gene using forward primer 5′-GGAATTCCATATGACGAGCTCGAACAGTACTAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGCCAATACATCGAACCAGAAG-3′. β-Tubulin gene was amplified as an internal loading control using the following primers: forward primer: 5′-GTCAAGAGGTTCTCAGCAGTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCACCTTCTTGATCCGCAGTT-3′. Yeast 2-Hybrid Interaction Studies—MYB15 was amplified with primers 5′-GATGGGAAGAGCTCCATGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAGCCAATACATCGAACCAG-3′ and cloned in the SmaI and XhoI sites of the pACT2 vector (prey vector). The C-terminal region (corresponding to 266-494 amino acids) of ICE1 was amplified from pMal-ICE1 DNA (ICE1 cloned in MBP fusion vector) as a template with 5′-TGAGACTGGGATTGAGGTTTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTGCCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′ primers and cloned in the SmaI and SalI sites of pAS2 vector (bait vector). For mapping, the interacting domain deletions of the C-terminal portion of ICE1 were PCR-amplified with gene-specific primers and cloned in NcoI and BamHI sites of the pAS2 vector. Prey and different bait plasmids were co-transformed in the Y190 strain of yeast, and colonies were selected on SC-Trp-Leu medium (32Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Resultant colonies were assayed for β-Gal activity. Expression and Purification of Fusion Protein in Escherichia coli—Full-length MYB15 open reading frame (cloned in pGEMT-easy) was amplified with the gene-specific primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGGGAAGAGCTCCATGCTGTG-3′ and SP6 primer. The amplicon was cloned in the BamHI and SalI sites of the pMAL vector (NEB, Beverley, MA) and pGEX 4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length AtMYB79 cDNA was amplified with 5′-CGGGATCCGAATGGTGGAAGAAGTTTGGAGAAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAACAAAATGGAATCACCAAGTT-3′ and cloned in BamHI and XhoI sites of pGex 4T-1 vector. The MBP-MYB15 fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-fused MYB15 and AtMYB79 constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(codon plus) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C, transferred to fresh 20× volume of Luria-Bertani media and further cultured for 1 h. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were resuspended in prechilled lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Dithiothreitol (50 mm), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and N-lauroyl sarcosine (1%) were added before 1-min sonication. The sonicate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Triton X-100 (1.5%) was added in the supernatant and mixed, followed by the addition of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted and washed extensively with prechilled PBS. GST-fused proteins were eluted with 100 mm glutathione (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8. DNA Binding—For binding with CBF promoters, different fragments were PCR-amplified from the CBF promoters (details of the regions are shown in Fig. 3) with KOD polymerase (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Amplified fragments were eluted from agarose gel with use of the QiaQuick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluted fragments were end-labeled with [γ-P32]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. A total of 500 pg of the labeled probe was incubated with 500 ng of purified MBP-MYB15 fusion protein at room temperature for 30 min. For competition, purified protein was incubated with 100 ng of unlabeled fragments for 30 min at room temperature prior to their incubation with the labeled probe. The DNA-protein complex was resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. Transient Expression Assays—MYB15 cDNA was cloned in SmaI and SalI sites of the plant expression vector [35S]GAL4-DB (33Ohta M. Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant J. 2000; 22: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA of the resulting effector GAL4-ICE1 (14Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar) and a GAL4 responsive reporter, GAL4-LUC (33Ohta M. Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant J. 2000; 22: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were delivered into Arabidopsis protoplasts by PEG-mediated DNA uptake (34Guo Y. Xiong L. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In Vitro Pull-down Assay—In vitro pull-down assays were carried out to confirm the physical interaction of MYB15 and ICE1. Full-length MYB15 cloned in pGEM-T easy and AtMYB79 (cloned in EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBCSK; Stratagene) were used for in vitro transcription and translation. Full-length ICE1 and ABI2 open reading frames were cloned in EcoRI/SalI and NcoI/EcoRI sites of pCITE4a. A total of 2 μg each of the linearized plasmid was in vitro transcribed with use of the Megascript T7 RNA polymerase kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 10 μg of the purified transcript of MYB15 and AtMYB79 was in vitro translated with use of the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. S-tag-ICE1, and S-tag-ABI2 transcripts were translated in the absence of [35S]methionine, and their proteins were purified with use of the S-tag purification kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. S-Tag-ICE1 and S-tag-ABI2 bound on the S-Tag slurry were used to pull down 35S-labeled MYB15. In a separate experiment, 35S-labeled ICE was produced and used for pull-down assays with either GST-MYB15 or GST-MYB79 proteins. Pull-down assays were performed as described (32Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Expression and Localization of MYB15—For construction of the MYB15 promoter-GUS fusion, a 2.0-kb fragment upstream of the start codon of MYB15 cDNA was PCR-amplified with 5′-CCCAAGCTTATACCATATCAAATCTGAGAAAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCATTTGTGATTGCTGATAAAAGAAG-3′ primers from the Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype) genomic DNA and cloned in HindIII and BamHI sites of pCAMBIA1391Z. The resultant plasmid was mobilized in Agrobacterium strain and transformed in Col-0 Arabidopsis plants by floral infiltration (35Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). The transgenic plants were selected on MS medium containing 30 mg/liter of hygromycin. Transgenic seedlings were histochemically stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide at 21 days as described in Jefferson et al. (36Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8352) Google Scholar) and visualized under an Olympus FZX12 dissecting microscope. For construction of the GFP fusion, full-length MYB15 cDNA was PCR-amplified with 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGGAAGAGCTCCATGCTGTGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGCCAATACATCGAACCAGAAG-3′ primers and cloned in EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGAD vector containing a bialaphos acetyltransferase selectable marker gene (37Cutler S.R. Ehrhardt D.W. Griffitts J.S. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3718-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, MYB15-GFP transgenic seedlings selected on MS medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter phosphinothricin were mounted on glass slides, and images were visualized under a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 488-nm excitation laser and a 522/DF35 emission filter. Transgenic Plants and T-DNA Knock-outs—MYB15 was amplified with 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGGAAGAGCTCCATGCTGTGA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCCTAGCCAATACATCGAACCAGA-3′ and cloned in XbaI/KpnI sites of pRT105 vector. The cassette containing the 35 S promoter-MYB15-nos terminator was excised from the resulting plasmid and cloned in the PstI site of the pCAMBIA3300 vector. The final construct was mobilized into the GV3101 Agrobacterium strain. Transformation of Arabidopsis plants (CBF3-LUC background) was carried out by Agrobacterium-mediated floral infiltration. The T1 transgenic plants were selected by spraying 30 mg/liter basta 3 times, at 3-day intervals, 2 weeks after imbibition. Seeds from each T1 plant (T2) were individually collected and used in the initial analysis. Selected T2 plants were further propagated, and homozygous lines of overexpression plants were used for analysis. For the construction of the RNAi construct, 348 bp of MYB15 was amplified with 5′-GGACTAGTCGGCGCGCCGATATCGATGAAAGCTTCT-3′ and 5′-GGTACCATTTAAATCTAGAGCCCGGCTAAGAGATCT-3′ primers. The resulting PCR product was cloned in AscI and SwaI sites of the pFGC5948 vector. The construct was introduced into Arabidopsis (CBF3-LUC background) and transformants were selected on MS medium supplemented with 30 mg/liter hygromycin. Seeds of T-DNA mutant of MYB15 available in ABRC (SALK_151976) were used to find the homozygous T-DNA insertion line. After confirmation of homozygous T-DNA insertion, gene knock-out was confirmed by RT-PCR of MYB15 with gene-specific primers. RNA was extracted from the homozygous line and analyzed for CBF expression. Freezing Tolerance Assays—For the freezing tolerance assay, seeds of the MYB15 overexpression line and wild-type plants (CBF3-LUC) were sown in pot media. Ion leakage test after freezing was carried out essentially as described by Ishitani et al. (15Ishitani M. Xiong L. Lee H. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each treatment, one excised leaf was placed in a test tube containing 100 μl of deionized H2O, and the tube was placed in a circulating freezing bath (VWR Scientific, San Francisco, CA) set at 0 °C. For each temperature treatment three replicates were taken. The temperature of the bath was programmed to decrease to -10 °C at 2 °C per hour. When the designated temperature was reached, tubes were removed and placed immediately on ice to allow gradual thawing. The leaflets then were transferred carefully to another tube containing 25 ml of deionized water and shaken overnight, followed by measurement of conductivity. The tubes with the leaves were then autoclaved. After cooling down to room temperature, conductivities of the solutions were measured again. The percentage of electrolyte leakage was calculated as the percentage of the conductivity before autoclaving over that after autoclaving. The ion leakage experiment was repeated twice with three replicates in each experiment. Representative results from one of the experiments are presented here. Whole plant freezing was assayed as described (24Xin Z. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7799-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type and myb15 seeds were sown in separate halves of the same agar (0.9%) plate with Gamborg basal salts and 1.5% sucrose. Three plates were used for each point of freezing temperatures. After 2 days of stratification at 4 °C, the plates were kept at 22 °C under 50 ± 2 μmol quanta m-2·s-1 continuous light. Ten-day-old seedlings were cold-acclimated at 4 °C± 1 °C and 30 ± 2 μmol quanta m-2·s-1 light for 4 days. Plants in Petri dishes were placed on ice in a freezing chamber (Percival Scientific) set to -1 °C ± 0.1 °C for 16 h. Ice chips were sprinkled on the plants before the chamber was programmed to cool at 1 °C/h. The Petri dishes were removed after being frozen at the desired temperatures for 2 h, thawed at 4 °C for 12 h in the dark, and then transferred to 22 °C under 50 ± 2 μmol quanta m-2·s-1 continuous light. Survival of the seedlings was scored visually after 2 days. MYB15 Expression in Wild Type and ice1 Mutant Plants—To find candidate MYB transcription factors that may function together with ICE1 in cold response pathways, we examined DNA microarray data from a comparison of the transcriptomes of wild type and ice1 mutant plants treated with cold for 6 h (14Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of AtMyb15 (designated as MYB15 herein) was higher in ice1 mutant than that in the wild type. RNA blot analysis showed that MYB15 expression is up-regulated by cold stress in both the wild type and ice1 mutant plants (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the microarray data, MYB15 expression level is higher in ice1 after 6 h of cold treatment. The expression level is also higher after 3 h of cold treatment, but the level becomes lower in ice1 after 12 h of cold treatment (Fig. 1A). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR as well as in silico examination using Genevestigator indicated that MYB15 is expressed constitutively at low levels in all plant tissues (not shown). Transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter gene under the control of the MYB15 promoter were analyzed to determine the tissue distribution of MYB15. GUS activity was detected in roots, leaves, stems, and floral parts (Fig. 1B), further indicating that MYB15 is ubiquitously expressed. MYB15 Interacts with ICE1—Yeast 2-hybrid analysis was used to determine whether MYB15 might interact with ICE1. Different portions of ICE1 protein were used as bait, and full-length MYB15 was used as prey to determine their interaction. Because the full-length ICE1 protein itself gave strong activation of the β-Gal reporter gene we used portions of ICE1 as bait. MYB15 did not interact with N-terminal portion (1-266 amino acids) of ICE1 (data not shown), but interacted strongly with the C-terminal portion (266-494 amino acids) of ICE1 (Fig. 2A). The interaction of MYB15 and ICE1 was specific, because the prey vector or AtMYB79 failed to activate the reporter gene (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal portion of ICE1 was further narrowed down by deletions (Fig. 2B) and then used as baits to determine the MYB15 interacting domain in ICE1. The region corresponding to amino acid residues 358-494 of ICE1 was found to interact with MYB15 (Fig. 2C). We used protein pull-down assays to confirm the interaction between ICE1 and MYB15. GST-MYB15 was able to pull down 35S-labeled ICE1 (Fig. 2D). Similarly S-tagged ICE1 was able to pull down 35S-labeled MYB15 (Fig. 2E). Their interaction was specific, because neither GSTMYB79 nor S-Tag-ABI2 was able to pull-down either ICE1 or MYB15 proteins, respectively. These results suggest that MYB15 interacts specifically with ICE1. MYB15 Binds to Myb Recognition Sites in the Promoters of CBF Genes—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out to determine whether MYB15 could bind to elements in CBF promoters. Different portions of the CBF promoters were PCR-amplified and used for EMSA. One major complex was observed with fragments II (-750/-500) and III (-500/-300) of the CBF1 promoter, whereas other regions of the CBF1 promoter had no binding with MYB15 (Fig. 3A). When CBF2 promoter fragments were used, binding was observed with fragments I (-1000/-750) and II (-500/-270), whereas no binding was observed with fragment III (-270/-20). MYB15 was able to bind to all 4 fragments of the CBF3 promoter. These complexes were abolished by the addition of cold competitors with the same sequences. Transcription factors belonging to the Myb family have binding specificity to either type I Myb recognition sequences (-CNGTT(A/G)-) or type II (-G(G/T)T(A/T)GTT(A/G)-) and type IIG (-G(G/T)T(A/T)GGT(A/G)-; Ref. 38Romero I.

MYB15 preferentially binds to type II and type IIG and binds to a much lesser extent to type I Myb recognition sequence (38Romero I. Fuertes A. Benito M.J. Malpica J.M. Leyva A. Paz-Ares J. Plant J. 1998; 14: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The CBF promoter regions used in this study was found to have many sequences closely related to Type II and Type IIG Myb recognition sites. A detailed presentation of the sequences present in the regions of these promoters and the binding of MYB15 is shown in Table 1. The results indicate that MYB15 can bind to the CBF promoters, and the binding is possibly mediated by the Myb recognition sequences.TABLE 1Presence of type II and type IIG Myb recognition sequences in the promoters of CBF1, -2, and -3 The fragments used for mobility shift assay are indicated in the left columns, and the binding is indicated in the column to the right of the sequences.CBF1CBF2CBF3Frag.

GFP-MYB15 fusion driven by a CaMV 35 S promoter was expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Confocal imaging of GFP fluorescence in the transgenic plants showed that the GFP-MYB15 fusion protein is present in the nucleus (Fig. 4A), suggesting that MYB15 is nuclear-localized under nonstressed conditions. Cold stress did not change the nuclear localization of MYB15 (data not shown). Transient expression assays were carried out to determine whether MYB15 might be a transcriptional activator or repressor. An effector plasmid was constructed by fusing MYB15 with the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator under the control of a CaMV 35 S promoter (GAL4-MYB15; Fig. 4B). When the GAL4-MYB15 and a GAL4-responsive reporter gene, GAL4-LUC, were delivered into Arabidopsis protoplasts by PEG-mediated DNA uptake, the luciferase activity increased 10-fold relative to the control with or without an effector plasmid containing only the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that MYB15 might be a transcriptional activator. MYB15 Overexpression Reduces the Expression of CBF Genes under Cold Stress—MYB15 was overexpress"

https://openalex.org/W1979258089,"The presence of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides provides an important mechanism for prevention of infection against a wide variety of microbial pathogens. The activity of cathelicidin is controlled by enzymatic processing of the proform (hCAP18 in humans) to a mature peptide (LL-37 in human neutrophils). In this study, elements important to the processing of cathelicidin in the skin were examined. Unique cathelicidin peptides distinct from LL-37 were identified in normal skin. Through the use of selective inhibitors, SELDI-TOF-MS, Western blot, and siRNA, the serine proteases stratum corneum tryptic enzyme (SCTE, kallikrein 5) and stratum corneum chymotryptic protease (SCCE, kallikrein 7) were shown to control activation of the human cathelicidin precursor protein hCAP18 and also influence further processing to smaller peptides with alternate biological activity. The importance of this serine protease activity to antimicrobial activity in vivo was illustrated in SPINK5-deficient mice that lack the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI. Epidermal extracts of these animals show a significant increase in antimicrobial activity compared with controls, and immunoabsorption of cathelicidin diminished antimicrobial activity. These observations demonstrate that the balance of proteolytic activity at an epithelial interface will control innate immune defense."

The magnitude and duration of fatty acid amide signaling are controlled by enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in mammals has been primarily attributed to a single integral membrane enzyme of the amidase signature (AS) family. Here, we report the functional proteomic discovery of a second membrane-associated AS enzyme in humans that displays FAAH activity. The gene that encodes this second FAAH enzyme was found in multiple primate genomes, marsupials, and more distantly related vertebrates, but, remarkably, not in a number of lower placental mammals, including mouse and rat. The two human FAAH enzymes, which share 20% sequence identity and are referred to hereafter as FAAH-1 and FAAH-2, hydrolyzed primary fatty acid amide substrates (e.g. oleamide) at equivalent rates, whereas FAAH-1 exhibited much greater activity with N-acyl ethanolamines (e.g. anandamide) and N-acyl taurines. Both enzymes were sensitive to the principal classes of FAAH inhibitors synthesized to date, including O-aryl carbamates and α-keto heterocycles. These data coupled with the overlapping, but distinct tissue distributions of FAAH-1 and FAAH-2 suggest that these proteins may collaborate to control fatty acid amide catabolism in primates. The apparent loss of the FAAH-2 gene in some lower mammals should be taken into consideration when extrapolating genetic or pharmacological findings on the fatty acid amide signaling system across species.

Interestingly, these animals do not exhibit the adverse responses that typically accompany global activation of the CB1 receptor, such as hypomotility, hypothermia, and catalepsy (21Cravatt B.F.

A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), suggesting that FAAH inhibitors may induce a therapeutically useful subset of the effects observed with direct cannabinoid receptor agonists. FAAH is an integral membrane protein widely distributed in mammalian tissues that belongs to a large family of enzymes that share a highly conserved ∼130 amino acid motif designated the “amidase signature” (AS) sequence (20McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). AS enzymes possess an unusual serine-serine-lysine catalytic triad, which functions to promote amide bond hydrolysis in a manner generally analogous to the serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad more commonly observed in serine hydrolases (27McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37393-37399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Shin S. Yun Y.S. Koo H.M. Kim Y.S. Choi K.Y. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24937-24943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography studies have revealed that FAAH possesses multiple modes for membrane binding, including a hydrophobic plateau domain for monotopic integration that resides adjacent to the active site and appears to grant the enzyme access to bilayerembedded fatty acid amide substrates (29Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The majority of AS enzymes identified to date are bacterial or fungal in origin, with FAAH constituting the sole characterized member of this protein family in mammals. Here, we provide functional proteomic evidence for the existence of a second mammalian AS enzyme with FAAH activity. This “FAAH-2” enzyme (originally designated FLJ31204) exhibits overlapping, but distinct tissue distribution, substrate selectivity, and inhibitor sensitivity profiles compared with the original FAAH enzyme (FAAH-1). Remarkably, analysis of genome and gene expression databases revealed that the FAAH-2 gene is present in primates, as well as in a variety of distantly related vertebrates, but not in murids (mice and rats). These results suggest differences in the enzymatic complexity of fatty acid amide catabolism across mammalian species. Materials—Cancer cell lines were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program. 14C-Fatty acid amides were synthesized from their corresponding acid chlorides as reported previously (2Cravatt B.F.

Activity-based Protein Profiling Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (ABPP-MudPIT) of Human Cancer Cell Lines—Cells were grown to 80% confluence in either RPMI 1640 medium (for the ovarian cancer line OVCAR-3), or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for the breast cancer line MCF-7), both of which contain 10% fetal calf serum, and were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before being harvested by scraping. Cell pellets were sonicated and Dounce homogenized in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8 (Buffer 1) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g to separate soluble (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) proteomes. Membrane pellets were sonicated to homogeneity in Buffer 1. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Proteomes (1 mg/ml) were analyzed by ABPP-MudPIT, as described previously (30Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M. Humphrey M. Ji Y. Han W. Noh D.Y. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jeffrey S.S. Cravatt B.F. Nat.

Membrane proteomes were then solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. Enrichment of FP-labeled proteins by avidin-conjugated beads, protease digestion, and multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were performed as previously reported (30Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M. Humphrey M. Ji Y. Han W. Noh D.Y. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jeffrey S.S. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 32Washburn M.P.

All mass spectra data were searched against the human IPI data base (version 1.4.2005) using the SEQUEST algorithm (33Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Amer. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar). Peptides were considered correct identifications if cross-correlation scores were above 1.8 (for +1 charge), 2.5 (+2), 3.5 (+3) and delta CN scores were above 0.08. As a control for nonspecific binding to the avidin beads, proteomes that had not been treated with FP-biotin were also analyzed (“no probe” controls). FP-biotin-treated and no-probe control proteomes were analyzed in triplicate and duplicate, respectively. Generation and Transfection of Expression Constructs for FAAH-1 and FAAH-2—A full-length FAAH-2 cDNA clone was obtained from Open Biosystems (Clone ID 3210044). The cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pFLAG.CMV6 vector (Sigma) with an N-terminal FLAG tag using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector with a C-terminal Myc-His tag using EcoRI and XbaI sites, and into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal Kozak sequence (GCCACC) using EcoRI and XbaI sites. Authenticity of all constructed plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using the FuGene transfection reagent following manufacturer's protocols (Roche Applied Science). The inclusion of an epitope tag at the C terminus of FAAH-2 impaired the expression of active enzyme (data not shown), and therefore, an N-terminal FLAG-tagged construct was used for the characterization of recombinant FAAH-2. ABPP of FAAH-transfected Cells—Transfected cell proteomes (1 mg/ml) were treated with a rhodamine-conjugated FP probe (FP-rhodamine (34Patricelli M.P. Giang D.K. Stamp L.M. Burbaum J.J.

A portion of the labeled samples was then treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) to provide deglycosylated proteomes. Reactions were quenched with an equal volume of standard 2× SDS/PAGE loading buffer (reducing) and heated for 8 min at 90 °C. Proteome samples were resolved by SDS/PAGE (10% acrylamide) and visualized in-gel with an FMBio IIe flatbed fluorescence scanner (Hitachi). Integrated fluorescence band intensities were quantified using the manufacturer's supplied software. FAAH-2 protein was quantified by summing the intensities of the 58- and 60-kDa bands observed in transfected COS-7 cells. Western Blotting—Proteome samples resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 3% milk, and incubated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. To detect endoplasmic reticulum marker proteins, the membrane was incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents, 1:5000 dilution). To probe FAAH-1, the blot was incubated with rabbit anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies (1:500 dilution) (35Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F.

Blots were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and Tween-20, incubated with the goat-anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Bio-Rad), and analyzed using a SuperSignal Western Pico Chemiluminescence Kit (Pierce), and x-ray film exposure. FAAH Substrate Assays—FAAH assays were performed by following the conversion of 14C-labeled substrates to their corresponding fatty acid using a thin layer chromatography (TLC) assay as described previously (27McKinney M.K.

Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in a buffer of 125 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 9.0), except for pH rate profile assays, which were performed using a buffer of 50 mm Bis-Tris propane, 50 mm CAPS, 50 mm citrate, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100 (pH 6, 7, 8, or 9, adjusted using HCl or NaOH). Reactions performed in triplicate were initiated by incubating membrane lysates of COS-7 cells expressing FAAH-1 or FAAH-2 with 100 μm substrate, and were quenched with 0.5 n HCl at two time points. Fatty acids were separated from the corresponding substrates by TLC in 65% ethyl acetate/35% hexane, and the radioactive compounds were quantified using a Cyclone PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Appropriate protein concentrations and time points were chosen for each substrate-enzyme combination to keep substrate conversion between 5 and 20%. Background hydrolysis was measured using matching concentrations of the membrane lysate of COS-7 cells transfected with empty pFLAG.CMV6 vector. FAAH-1 was found to express at ∼6-fold higher levels than FAAH-2 in COS-7 cells, as judged by active site titration with FP-rhodamine (1 μm, 1 h) following previously described protocols (36Jessani N. Liu Y. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10335-10340Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Relative substrate hydrolysis data shown in Table 2 were normalized to account for this difference in expression.TABLE 2Rates of hydrolysis for FAAH-1 and FAAH-2 with representative fatty acid amide substratesa Rates were measured at pH 9.0 using membrane fractions of COS-7 cells transfected with human FAAH-1-pcDNA3 or FAAH-2-pFLAG.CMV6 constructs. Net rates for FAAH-1 and FAAH-2 were obtained by subtracting the corresponding background (mock) rates from the measured rates. Net rates for FAAH-2 were multiplied by 6.3 to account for the 6.3-fold higher concentration of FAAH-1 than that of FAAH-2 in transfected cells.b Background hydrolysis rates were measured using membrane fractions of COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pFLAG.CMV6 vectors.

FAAH Inhibitor Assays—Inhibitor analysis was carried out with membrane lysates using two methods. First, inhibitor potency was examined by competitive ABPP as described previously (37Leung D. Hardouin C. Boger D.L. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteomes (0.01 mg/ml for FAAH-1, 0.1 mg/ml for FAAH-2) were preincubated with varying concentrations of inhibitors (1 nm to 100 μm) for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of FP-rhodamine (100 nm). The reactions were then quenched after 5 min with one volume of 2× SDS loading buffer (reducing), resolved by SDS/PAGE, and visualized by in-gel fluorescence scanning. Inhibitor potency was measured as a percentage reduction in fluorescent signals relative to control samples (treated with Me2SO alone). Inhibitor potency was also analyzed by using the radioactive substrate assay described above (27McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37393-37399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 35Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, hydrolysis of [14C]oleamide by membrane proteomes was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors (1 nm-10 μm, preincubated for 10 min) at 25 °C. Dose-response curves obtained by both methods from three independent trials at each inhibitor concentration were fit with Prism software (GraphPad) to obtain IC50 values with 95% confidence intervals. Protease Protection Assays—Transfected cells were pelleted, washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose). Cells were lysed by passage through a 21-gauge needle 20 times. The cell extract was then spun at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant removed. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was gently resuspended in 500 μl of buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 250 m m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl) and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 15 min. The resuspended membrane preparation (67.5 μl) were treated with 7.5 μl of either buffer C, 10% digitonin (Wako Chemical) in buffer C, or 10% Triton X-100 in buffer C. These solutions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Each 75-μl sample was then treated with 0.75 μl 1 m CaCl2, and split in thirds, and one-third of the sample was treated with 1 μl of either buffer C, trypsin (Promega, 1 μg) in buffer C, or α-chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science, 2 μg) in buffer C and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated at 90 °C for 8 min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting procedures. Genomic Analysis of Species Distribution of FAAH-2—Orthologs of FAAH-2 were identified using tblastn (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) against the assembled genomes of chimpanzee (assembly version pan-Tro1), macaque (rheMac2), dog (canFam2), cow (bosTau2), mouse (mm8), rat (rn4), opossum (monDom1), chicken (gal-Gal2), frog (xenTro2), zebrafish (danRer4), tetraodon (tet-Nig1), and fugu (fr1) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser; and using discontiguous Mega BLAST against the NCBI wgs data base and Trace Archive. Inferred amino acid sequences were manually edited to remove artifacts because of alignment errors or low quality sequence information, and subsequently re-aligned using ClustalW (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis of Tissue Distribution of FAAH-1 and FAAH-2—First-strand cDNA from 12 human tissues (Origene Technologies) were used as the templates. PCR was performed according to the vendor suggested protocol using TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 40 cycles. Primers were designed for FAAH-1 (forward: 5′-GCACACGCTGGTTCCCTTCTTG-3′; reverse: 5′-GTTTTCCAGCCGAACGAGACTTCATGTTG-3′) and FAAH-2 (forward: 5′-CCTGGGATCAAAAGGTTAAAACTAGACACAAAGG-3′; reverse: 5′-CTTTTCTTCCAACAAAGCCAGTCCAATGG-3′). The provided control primers for β-actin were used. Evidence for a Second AS Enzyme in Humans That Possesses FAAH Activity—In the course of conducting activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) studies on a panel of human cancer cell lines, we identified an uncharacterized AS enzyme, FLJ31204, as a target of the functional proteomics probe fluorophosphonate-biotin (FP-biotin; (31Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar)). FP-biotin covalently labels the conserved serine nucleophile in a wide range of serine hydrolases, including AS enzymes, and has served as a powerful tool for the discovery of new members of this large and diverse enzyme class (36Jessani N.

Using an LC-MS platform for the analysis of FP-biotin-treated proteomes referred to as ABPP-MudPIT (30Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M. Humphrey M. Ji Y. Han W. Noh D.Y. Yates 3rd, J.R.

The enzyme was detected in the membrane, but not soluble fraction of cancer cells (Fig. 1) and was absent in control samples not treated with FP-biotin (data not shown). The more thoroughly characterized AS enzyme FAAH was also identified in the membrane fractions of MCF-7 and OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Identification of a novel AS enzyme FLJ31204 (FAAH-2) in human cancer cell lines by ABPP-MudPITIdentified tryptic peptidesObserved charge statesCell linesK.TPRPVTEPLLLLSGMQLAK.LaBoundaries of the tryptic peptides are marked by dots.+2, +3OVCAR-3, MCF7K.ELVDMLGDDGVFLYPSHPTVAPK.H+2, +3OVCAR-3, MCF7K.LAEKQEDEATLENKWPFLGVPLTVK.E+2, +3OVCAR-3, MCF7K.EAFQLQGMPNSSGLMNR.R+2MCF7K.GQFPLAVGAQE"

https://openalex.org/W2162507709,"Cannabinoids, the active components of marijuana and their endogenous counterparts, act on the brain and many other organs through the widely expressed CB1 cannabinoid receptor. In contrast, the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is abundant in the immune system and shows a restricted expression pattern in brain cells. CB2-selective agonists are, therefore, very attractive therapeutic agents as they do not cause CB1-mediated psychoactive effects. CB2 receptor expression in brain has been partially examined in differentiated cells, while its presence and function in neural progenitor cells remain unknown. Here we show that the CB2 receptor is expressed, both in vitro and in vivo, in neural progenitors from late embryonic stages to adult brain. Selective pharmacological activation of the CB2 receptor in vitro promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation and neurosphere generation, an action that is impaired in CB2-deficient cells. Accordingly, in vivo experiments evidence that hippocampal progenitor proliferation is increased by administration of the CB2-selective agonist HU-308. Moreover, impaired progenitor proliferation was observed in CB2-deficient mice both in normal conditions and on kainate-induced excitotoxicity. These findings provide a novel physiological role for the CB2 cannabinoid receptor and open a novel therapeutic avenue for manipulating neural progenitor cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2162670271,"Following inducible expression in HEK293 cells, the human orexin-1 receptor was targeted to the cell surface but became internalized following exposure to the peptide agonist orexin A. By contrast, constitutive expression of the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor resulted in a predominantly punctate, intracellular distribution pattern consistent with spontaneous, agonistindependent internalization. Expression of the orexin-1 receptor in the presence of the CB1 receptor resulted in both receptors displaying the spontaneous internalization phenotype. Single cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging indicated the two receptors were present as heterodimers/oligomers in intracellular vesicles. Addition of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR-141716A to cells expressing only the CB1 receptor resulted in re-localization of the receptor to the cell surface. Although SR-141716A has no significant affinity for the orexin-1 receptor, in cells co-expressing the CB1 receptor, the orexin-1 receptor was also re-localized to the cell surface by treatment with SR-141716A. Treatment of cells co-expressing the orexin-1 and CB1 receptors with the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB-674042 also resulted in re-localization of both receptors to the cell surface. Treatment with SR-141716A resulted in decreased potency of orexin A to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 only in cells co-expressing the two receptors. Treatment with SB-674042 also reduced the potency of a CB1 receptor agonist to phosphorylate ERK1/2 only when the two receptors were co-expressed.

Until recently it was widely believed that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; Image-iT™, WGA-Alexa Fluor 594 plasma membrane marker; ROI, region of interest; SB-674042, 1-(5-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methylthiazol-4-yl)-1-((S)-2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]oxadiazol-2-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-methanone; SR-141716A, N-piperidinyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide; WIN 55,221-2, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de-]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRETc, corrected FRET; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; h, human; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; Image-iT™, WGA-Alexa Fluor 594 plasma membrane marker; ROI, region of interest; SB-674042, 1-(5-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methylthiazol-4-yl)-1-((S)-2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]oxadiazol-2-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-methanone; SR-141716A, N-piperidinyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide; WIN 55,221-2, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de-]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRETc, corrected FRET; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; h, human; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. existed and functioned as monomers and therefore that ligands with high pharmacological selectivity would be expected to target a single receptor. However, in recent years data employing a wide range of approaches have indicated that most GPCRs exist as dimers or, potentially, as high order oligomers (1Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 4Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), although there may be exceptions (5Meyer B.H. Segura J.M. Martinez K.L. Hovius R. George N. Johnsson K. Vogel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2138-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Apart from providing an explanation for observations such as cooperativity in the binding of agonist ligands (5Meyer B.H. Segura J.M. Martinez K.L. Hovius R. George N. Johnsson K. Vogel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2138-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Franco R. Casado V. Mallol J. Ferre S. Fuxe K. Cortes A. Ciruela F. Lluis C. Canela E.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 360-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), homodimerization between two copies of the same GPCR has somewhat limited implications for either novel drug design or the function of previously well characterized GPCR ligands. However, GPCRs represent the largest family of transmembrane receptors in the human genome, and some 400 genes encode GPCRs that are believed to respond to endogenously produced ligands (10Vassilatis D.K. Hohmann J.G. Zeng H. Li F. Ranchalis J.E. Mortrud M.T. Brown A. Wright A.C. Bergmann J.E. Gaitanaris G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4903-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Greater than 90% of these GPCRs are expressed to some extent in the central nervous system (11Hakak Y. Shrestha D. Goegel M.C. Behan D.P. Chalmers D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it is believed that specific key small nuclei and, indeed, even individual neurons may express a substantial number of distinct GPCRs (11Hakak Y. Shrestha D. Goegel M.C. Behan D.P. Chalmers D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although largely studied in detail in heterologous expression systems, there is little doubt that certain pairs of GPCRs can form and exist as heterodimers (1Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 4Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). There is also an expanding literature about the existence of GPCR heterodimers in physiological settings (12AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 16Waldhoer M. Fong J. Jones R.M. Luzner M.M. Sharma S.K. Kostenis E. Portoghese P.S. Whistler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9050-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and these may exhibit quite distinct pharmacology and function from the corresponding homodimers. As such, GPCR heterodimers may offer entirely novel sets of potential therapeutic targets (17Milligan G. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This concept has recently been given a substantial boost by the identification of a nonpeptide agonist ligand that appears to have significant selectivity to active a κ-opioid peptide receptor-δ-opioid peptide receptor heterodimer, both in heterologous expression systems and in vivo (16Waldhoer M. Fong J. Jones R.M. Luzner M.M. Sharma S.K. Kostenis E. Portoghese P.S. Whistler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9050-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). GPCRs that respond to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive principle of Cannabis, and a group of endogenously produced endo-cannabinoids are termed CB1 and CB2 (18Mackie K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 6: 101-122Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The CB1 receptor is expressed predominantly in brain, whereas the CB2 receptor is expressed largely in white cells of the immune system. The CB1 receptor is one of the most highly expressed GPCRs in both primate and rodent neurons and is widely expressed in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (18Mackie K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 6: 101-122Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 19Mackie K. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 299-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been appreciated for some time that the CB1 receptor can control conditioned drug seeking (20Le Foll B. Golberg S.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21De Vries T.J. Schoffelmeer A.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 420-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and antagonism of this receptor blocks the dopamine-releasing and motivational effects of nicotine (20Le Foll B. Golberg S.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21De Vries T.J. Schoffelmeer A.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 420-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As such, a CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist SR-141716A, also known as rimonabant, has been considered as a potential therapy in cessation of smoking programs (22Fernandez J.R. Allison D.B. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 430-435PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boyd S.T. Fremming B.A. Ann. Pharmacother. 2005; 39: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists stimulate appetite, SR-141716A/rimonabant has also been assessed in weight reduction and anti-obesity programs (25Black S.C. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kirkham T.C. Williams C.M. Treat. Endocrinol. 2004; 3: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and was recently approved for clinical use. The orexigenic peptides orexin A and orexin B were named for their ability to stimulate feeding responses and function via the G protein-coupled orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors (27Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N.A. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that antagonists at one or either of these receptors might also be effective in weight loss programs (28Smart D. Haynes A.C. Williams G. Arch J.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 440: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Mieda M. Yanagisawa M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The orexin-1 receptor is also widely expressed in brain (30Backberg M. Hervieu G. Wilson S. Meister B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Hervieu G.J. Cluderay J.E. Harrison D.C. Roberts J.C. Leslie R.A. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 777-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), with distribution overlapping with the cannabinoid CB1 receptor in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hippocampal formations as well as the lateral hypothalamus, a region of key importance in feeding and appetite control. The orexin system is also important in regulation of sleep, wakefulness, and arousal (32Taheri S. Zeitzer J.M. Mignot E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 283-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and low levels of orexin peptides are observed in some 90% of patients with sporadic narcolepsy-cataplexy (33Baumann C.R. Bassetti C.L. Lancet Neurol. 2005; 4: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although syndromes associated with narcolepsy are more usually associated with effects at the orexin-2 receptor (34Mieda M. Willie J.T. Hara J. Sinton C.M. Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4649-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), alteration in levels of, or sensitivity to, the orexin peptides may generally provide links between wakefulness and feeding responses. Co-expression of the CB1 receptor and the orexin-1 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells was recently reported to enhance the potency of orexin A to stimulate ERK-MAP kinase phosphorylation, and this effect was blocked by addition of SR-141716A/rimonabant (35Hilairet S. Bouaboula M. Carriere D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23731-23737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although Hilairet et al. (35Hilairet S. Bouaboula M. Carriere D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23731-23737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggested that these two receptors might interact to produce this effect, this was not explored directly. In this study we show that the human CB1 and orexin-1 receptors can indeed heterodimerize/oligomerize. Although the cellular trafficking and recycling characteristics of the two receptors are very different when expressed individually, when co-expressed, and in the absence of receptor ligands, the phenotype of the CB1 receptor is dominant in the CB1-orexin-1 receptor heterodimer in that both receptors recycle spontaneously. Because of this, in cells containing the CB1 receptor-orexin-1 receptor heterodimer, SR-141716A/rimonabant alters the cellular distribution not only of the CB1 receptor but also of the orexin-1 receptor, although this ligand has no significant inherent affinity for the orexin-1 receptor. Moreover, in cells co-expressing the two receptors, the orexin-1 antagonist SB-674042 (36Langmead C.J. Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Scott C. Porter R.A. Herdon H.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) also alters the cellular distribution of the CB1 receptor, although this ligand has no inherent affinity for the CB1 receptor. Because of their effects either on receptor distribution or via direct allosteric modulation of the receptor heterodimer, both SR-141716A and SB-674042 alter the effectiveness of agonists at the partner receptor. These studies introduce an entirely novel pharmacological paradigm, which may be significantly more widely applicable. We also speculate that this may contribute to the clinical effects of SR-141716A/rimonabant. [3H]SR-141716A (50 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]SB-674042 (36Langmead C.J. Jerman J.C.

All tissue culture materials were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were purchased from ThermoElectron, Ulm, Germany. Orexin A was produced by GlaxoSmithKline. (R)-(+)-[2,3-Dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de-]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate (WIN 55,212-2) was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). The VSV-G antiserum was generated by Sigma Genosys. IMAGEiT™ was supplied by Invitrogen. Antibodies recognizing ERK1/2 MAP kinases and their phosphorylated forms were from Cell Signaling (Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK). Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells were from Invitrogen. All other materials were supplied by Sigma. The VSV-G-human (h)-orexin-1-eYFP construct was created by splicing parts of two existing forms of the receptor (37Milasta S. Evans N. Ormiston L. Wilson S. Lefkowitz R.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). VSV-G-h-orexin-1 receptor in pcDNA3 was digested with HindIII and AflII isolating the N-terminal portion of VSV-G-h-orexin-1 receptor. h-Orexin-1 receptor-eYFP (also in pcDNA3) was digested with HindIII and AflII removing the N-terminal section of h-orexin-1 receptor. The isolated VSV-G-h-orexin-1 receptor N-terminal fragment was then subcloned into the HindIII and AflII sites of the digested h-orexin-1 receptor-eYFP construct. The resulting construct was digested with HindIII and XhoI to isolate VSV-G-h-orexin-1-eYFP that was then subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO. The h-CB1 receptor in pcDNA3 was used as PCR template with the following primers: sense primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGAAGTCGATCCTAGATGGCCTT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGGGGTACCCAGAGCCTCGGCAGACGT3′. A HindIII site present in the sense primer and a KpnI site present in the antisense primer are underlined, and the amplified fragment was digested and ligated into pcDNA3 upstream and in-frame with CFP ligated between KpnI and NotI. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium without sodium pyruvate, 4500 mg/liter glucose, and l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotic mixture, and 10 μg/ml blastacidin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1).

After 48 h, the medium was changed to medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B to initiate selection of stably transfected cells. To constitutively co-express a variant of the h-CB1 receptor in the inducible cell lines, the inducible VSV-G-h-orexin-1-eYFP-expressing cell line was transfected with the appropriate cDNA construct as described above, and resistant cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. Resistant clones were screened for receptor expression by monitoring specific binding of [3H]SR-141716A in cell homogenates for the untagged h-CB1 receptor and by fluorescent microscopy for the h-CB1-CFP receptor. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline 24-96 h prior to assays to induce expression of the VSV-G-h-orexin-1-eYFP cloned into the Flp-In locus. Monolayers of cells in 96-well plates were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for varying times. Afterward cell surface receptors were labeled with anti-VSV-G antibody (1:1000) in growth medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with 20 mm HEPES/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C in growth medium supplemented with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit IgG as secondary antibody and 1 μm Hoechst nuclear stain (Sigma) to determine cell number.

Cells were grown in 12-well plates and receptor expression was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for varying times. Cells were then place on ice, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer. After 1 h at 4 °C, the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,800 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The samples were mixed with 5× reducing loading buffer and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. Cell lysates were resolved using SDS-PAGE. VSV-G-h-orexin-1-eYFP expression was detected by protein immunoblotting using anti-VSV-G antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody for immunodetection. Cells were grown in 12-well plates and serum-starved overnight prior to treatment with ligands as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared as above. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected by protein immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary for immunodetection. After visualizing ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stripped and re-probed using a total anti-ERK1/2 antibody. Cells were grown in 12-well plates, and receptor expression was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 72 h. Following this, cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in Earle's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2-6H2O, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% glucose. Cells were then incubated in supplemented Earle's buffer containing either 1 μm SR-141716A or 5 μm SB674042 for 30 min at 4 °C, before being incubated at 37 °C for 3 h prior to either imaging by epifluorescence microscopy or used in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays. Pellets of cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (TE buffer), and the cells were homogenized using 40 strokes of a glass on a Teflon homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant fraction was removed and passed through a 25-gauge needle 10 times before being transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and subjected to centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. Protein concentration was assessed, and membranes were diluted to 1 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C until required. [3H]SR-141716A binding reaction mixtures were established in a volume of 1000 μl containing 20-60 μg of membrane protein in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing a range of concentrations (0.25-8 nm) of [3H]SR-141716A. Potential competing ligands (0.5 μm orexin A or 5 μm SB-674042) were diluted in binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined using cold SR-141716A (2 μm). Samples were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C prior to filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism, and Bmax and Kd values were determined via saturation binding analysis. Reaction mixtures were established in a volume of 500 μl containing 5 μg of membrane protein in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.025% bacitracin, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 nm [3H]SB-674042 (36Langmead C.J. Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Scott C. Porter R.A. Herdon H.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined using 1-6,8-difluoro-2-methyl-quinolin-4-yl)-3-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-urea (SB-408124) (3 μm). Samples were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C prior to filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a ×63 oil-immersion Plan Fluor Apochromat objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4. A pinhole of 20 and an electronic zoom of 1 or 2.5 was used. The excitation laser line for eYFP was the 514 nm argon laser with detection via a 475-525 nm bandpass filter. The excitation laser line for CFP was the 458 nm argon laser with detection via a 505-530 nm bandpass filter. Cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. For internalization studies, cells were pretreated with specific antagonist or control for 30 min at 37 °C, and the agonist was then added to these cells for a further 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 5% sucrose. The cells were washed a further three times in ice-cold PBS prior to being mounted onto microscope slides with 40% glycerol in PBS. The images were analyzed with Metamorph software (version 6.3.3; Molecular Devices Corp., Downing, PA). Dual Imaging h-CB1-CFP and VSV-G-h-Orexin-1-eYFP Receptor Fusions—Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells, expressing the appropriate receptor fusion protein, were imaged in two or three dimensions using an inverted Nikon TE2000-E microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a ×60 (NA = 1.4) oil-immersion Plan Fluor Apochromat lens, a z axis linear encoder, and a cooled digital Cool Snap-HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific/Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Epifluorescence excitation light was generated by an ultrahigh point intensity 75-watt xenon arc Optosource lamp (Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK) coupled to a computer-controlled Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK). Monochromator was set to 436/12 and 500/5 nm for the sequential excitation of CFP and eYFP, respectively. CFP and eYFP excitation light was transmitted through the objective lens using the following single pass dichroics, 455DCLP for CFP and Q515LP for eYFP. CFP and eYFP fluorescence emission was controlled via a high speed filter wheel device (Prior Instruments) containing the following emitters: HQ480/40 nm for CFP and HQ535/30 nm for eYFP. Using these filter sets, the fluorophores were easily separated with no bleed through. Images were collected using a Cool Snap-HQ digital camera operated in 12-bit mode. Computer control of all electronic hardware and camera acquisition was achieved using Metamorph software (version 6.3.3; Molecular Devices Corp., Downing, PA). For three-dimensional imaging, stacks of images (2 × 2 binning, 200-300-ms exposure/image) with a 0.26-μm Z step (∼20-25 frames/stack) were sequentially acquired for each GFP variant. VSV-G-h-Orexin-1-eYFP Receptor Fusion and Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 594 Fluorescent-labeled Plasma Membrane Marker—To fluorescently visualize the plasma membrane in live cells expressing the VSV-G-h-orexin-1-eYFP receptor construct, cells were treated (as specified by the manufacturer) with the reagents in the Image-iT plasma membrane and nuclear labeling kit (Invitrogen), in which the plasma membrane is specifically labeled with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Alexa Fluor 594, and nuclei are stained simultaneously with Hoechst 33342. eYFP was excited as described previously, and Alexa Fluor 594 was excited at 575/12 nm and imaged using the following filter set (dichroic, Q595LP; emitter, HQ645/75 nm). Using these filters, no bleed through was observed. Sequential 12-bit images were collected as previously outlined above. Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips and transiently transfected with appropriate CFP/eYFP constructs. Coverslips were placed into a microscope chamber containing physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). Using an Optoscan monochromator, the CFP and eYFP fluorophores were excited sequentially at 500/5 and 430/12 nm, respectively. Images were obtained individually for CFP, eYFP, and CFP-eYFP FRET filter channels using the appropriate excitation wavelength, a dual dichroic mirror (86002v2bs; Chroma Inc., Rockingham, VT), and a high speed filter wheel device (Prior Instruments) containing the following bandpass emitters: HQ470/30 nm for CFP and HQ535/30 nm for eYFP. The illumination time was 250 ms and binning was set to 2 × 2. Metamorph imaging software (version 6.3.3; Molecular Devices Corp., Downing, PA) was used to quantify the FRET images using the sensitized FRET method. Corrected FRET (FRETc) was calculated using a pixel-by-pixel methodology using the equation FRETc = FRET - (coefficient B × CFP) - (coefficient A × eYFP), where CFP,"
https://openalex.org/W1986615878,"In higher plants, RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that converts C to U in organelle mRNAs. We have previously shown that an Arabidopsis thaliana crr4 mutant is defective with respect to RNA editing for creating the translational initial codon of the plastid ndhD gene (the ndhD-1 site). CRR4 contains 11 pentatricopeptide repeat motifs but does not contain any domains that are likely to be involved in the editing activity. The green fluorescent protein fused to the putative transit peptide of CRR4 targeted the plastid. The recombinant CRR4 expressed in Escherichia coli specifically bound to the 25 nucleotides of the upstream and the 10 nucleotides of the downstream sequences surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1. The target C nucleotide of this editing is not essential for the binding of CRR4. Taken together with the genetic evidence, we conclude that the pentatricopeptide repeat protein CRR4 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that acts as a site recognition factor in plastid RNA editing.

RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that alters the genetic information held at specific sites on an RNA molecule. It has been detected in a variety of organisms, including viruses, fungi, plants, and mammals (1Brennicke A. Marchfelder A. Binder S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 297-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Smith H.C. Gott J.M. Hanson M.R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1997; 3: 1105-1123Google Scholar). In plants, RNA editing is the process of altering a specific C nucleotide to U (and, less frequently, from U to C) in mitochondria and plastids (3Bock R. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Shikanai T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The chloroplast genome of higher plants contains about 30 editing sites (6Tsudzuki T. Wakasugi T. Sugiura M. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, RNA editing occurs more frequently in mitochondria; 427, 456, and 491 sites have been reported in rapeseed (Brassica napus), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively (7Giege P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Notsu Y. Masood S. Nishikawa T. Kubo N. Akiduki G. Nakazono M. Hirai A. Kadowaki K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 268: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Most RNA editing events occur in protein-coding regions and are necessary for expressing functional proteins (10Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Zito F. Kuras R. Choquet Y. Kössel H. Wollman F.A. Plant Mol.

Both an in vivo editing system using tobacco plastid transformation (13Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhuri S. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5958-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the in vitro editing system (16Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have contributed to answering this question. Fewer than 30 nucleotides surrounding the editing site are sufficient for site recognition: these are termed cis-acting elements in plastids (13Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhuri S. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5958-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Reed M.L. Peeters N.M. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 6948-6952Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A similar story is true in mitochondria, implying that the two organelles use a related system for site recognition (19Farré J.C. Araya A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Takenaka M. Neuwirt J. Brennicke A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sequences surrounding editing sites exhibit no significant homology, suggesting that each cis-acting element is recognized by a site-specific trans-acting factor. This idea is supported by the fact that the cis-acting element derived from the transgene specifically competed with the corresponding endogenous cis-acting element (13Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhuri S. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5958-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking experiments in the in vitro editing system also revealed that proteins with distinct molecular masses of 25, 56, and 70 kDa specifically bind to the cis-acting elements required for editing in psbL, psbE, and petB, respectively (16Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the trans-acting factor would be a protein, although the involvement of an RNA factor cannot be ruled out completely. If each editing site is independently recognized by a trans-acting factor, the factor should be encoded by a gene forming an extraordinarily large family. A gene responsible for the specific RNA editing event was discovered in the genetic study of photosynthetic electron transport. The Arabidopsis crr4 mutant is defective in the RNA editing of ndhD-1 site in the chloroplast (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The ndhD gene encodes a subunit of the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (22Munekage Y. Hashimoto M. Miyake C. Tomizawa K. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2004; 429: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Positional cloning revealed that the CRR4 gene encodes a member of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) 2The abbreviations used are: PPR, pentatricopeptide repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. protein family (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The PPR protein family is extraordinarily large, especially in higher plants, containing ∼450 and 480 members in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (23Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Maqniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Most of these members are predicted to localize to plastids or mitochondria (23Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Maqniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). These proteins are defined by the PPR motif, which is a highly degenerate unit, consisting of 35 amino acids, that usually appears as tandem repeats in a protein (24Small I.D. Peeters N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in PPR proteins lead to defects in the post-transcriptional processes of organelle mRNAs. Maize (Zea mays) CRP1 is required for the translation of petA and psaC and for the processing of petD (25Barkan A. Walker M. Nolasco M. Johnson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3170-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Fisk D.G. Walker M.B. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2621-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), whereas Arabidopsis CRR2 is required for intergenic RNA processing between rps7 and ndhB (27Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis HCF152 is essential for splicing of petB and intergenic RNA cleavage between psbH and petB (28Meierhoff K. Felder S. Nakamura T. Bechtold N. Schuster G. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura T. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Schuster G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis PGR3 is involved in the stabilization of petL RNA operons and might be also involved in the translation of petL and one of the ndh genes (30Yamazaki H. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2004; 38: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Members of the PPR protein family are also involved in the suppression of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) via RNA processing or editing of CMS-associated transcripts in petunia (Petunia hybrida) (31Bentolila S. Alfonso A.A. Hanson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10887-10892Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), radish (Raphanus sativus) (32Koizuka N. Imai R. Fujimoto H. Hayakawa T. Kimura Y. Kohno-Murase J. Sasai T. Kawasaki S. Imamura J. Plant J. 2003; 34: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and rice (33Kazama T. Toriyama K.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 676-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our genetic results suggest that a PPR protein is a trans-acting factor that is essential for the recognition of the RNA editing site. To conclude this idea, it is essential to show that CRR4 interacts directly with the sequence surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1. In the present study, we show that the recombinant CRR4 expressed in Escherichia coli specifically binds to the sequence surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1. Our data support a model of plastid RNA editing in which PPR protein acts as a trans-acting factor. Plant Transformation—The nucleotide sequence encoding the transit peptide of CRR4 was amplified from the genomic DNA of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia gl1) by PCR using primers 5′-TCTAGAATGGAGTGTTCGATTTCATC-3′ and 5′-CTATAGCGCGAAATCGGCGAGATA-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated to the sGFP (S65T) gene. The resultant chimeric gene was finally cloned into the pBIN19 vector and introduced into Columbia gl1 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens MP90. Microscopy—The fluorescence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was monitored using a BZ-8000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Plasmid Construction for Expressing CRR4 in E. coli—The CRR4 sequence corresponding to the putative mature protein was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GAATTCGCTTTTGCCTCTTCTCGAC-3′ and 5′-CGCCGGCGCAATGTACTGGAAACAACAATG-3′. The PCR product was ligated into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The plasmid that encodes CRR4 fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression and Purification of the Recombinant CRR4 Protein—Cells cultured at 37 °C in 2.5 liters of LB medium were cooled to 22 °C. Thirty minutes after the temperature shift, expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 22 °C for 5-6 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with buffer comprising 10 mm sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 4.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The recombinant CRR4 protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged (to 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) by gel filtration using a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) and finally concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Preparation of RNA Probes—The Arabidopsis chloroplast DNA sequences were amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CAAGTACTCGTACTCAAAAAAG-3′ and 5′-AATGAACCAGCAGATATTGG-3′ for RB1 and 5′-GTTATTTCTCCCGCATAGC-3′ and 5′-TCGTATAGAAAGTCCATC-3′ for RB2. The RB3 sequence was synthesized as a synthetic oligonucleotide. The DNA fragments were then used as templates for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). For this purpose, the T7 promoter sequence (ATGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) was attached to the 5′-end of the forward primer. The 5′-ends of the synthesized RNAs were chemically labeled with fluorescein maleimide as described in the instruction manual for the 5′ EndTag™ Nucleic Acid Labeling System (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The 5′-end-labeled RNA probes were then purified through 6-8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The competitor RNAs were also prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase but not labeled with fluorescein maleimide. The purified competitor RNAs and yeast tRNAs were loaded onto a 6-8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, electrophoresed, and stained with ethidium bromide. The intactness and concentration of competitor RNAs were then verified by comparing them with a range of yeast tRNA concentrations. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A binding reaction was carried out by mixing the various amounts of recombinant CRR4 with the 5′-end labeled RNA probe (0.5 nm) in a total volume of 20 μl of solution containing 5 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 7 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm KCl, 4.3% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 30 fmol of yeast tRNA. Nonlabeled competitor RNAs were preincubated with the protein for 5 min, and then the labeled RNA was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The samples was then loaded onto a 6-8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide at 29:1) and electrophoresed in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C). After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane. The signals from the labeled RNA were detected using a Gene Image CDP-Star detection kit (GE Healthcare). Signals from the labeled RNA were quantified using a LAS1000 chemiluminescence analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo). The Kd value was determined from the concentration of protein at which 50% of the RNA probe bound. Localization of GFP Fused with the Predicted Transit Peptide Sequence of CRR4—Physiological characterization indicated that the crr4 defect is specific to the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). If CRR4 were directly involved in the RNA editing of ndhD-1 in plastids, CRR4 would be imported to the plastids. The ChloroP 1.1 program predicts that the N-terminal 45 amino acids of CRR4 are a transit peptide to the plastids (Fig. 1A). To confirm this prediction experimentally, we constructed transgenic plants that overexpress the N-terminal 59 amino acid residues of CRR4 fused to GFP under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The GFP signal was detected exclusively in the plastids of transgenic plant cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that CRR4 localizes in the plastids. RNA Binding Analysis of the Recombinant CRR4 Protein— CRR4 localizes in the plastids where RNA editing of the ndhD-1 site takes place. This fact is consistent with our model in which CRR4 binds to the cis-acting element for ndhD-1 editing. To investigate this possibility, we attempted to express the recombinant CRR4 in E. coli. The 551-amino acid sequence of CRR4 without the transit peptide to plastids was cloned using several expression vectors. A small amount of CRR4 fused with GST was able to be expressed in soluble form in E. coli cultured at 22 °C. The recombinant CRR4 was then purified from the soluble extracts to homogeneity using a GST-affinity column. Purified protein was detected on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a band at 90 kDa, close to the predicted molecular mass (Fig. 2A). Purified protein was also verified by immunoblotting using antibodies against the GST protein (Fig. 2A). The recombinant CRR4 was used for the analysis of RNA-binding properties. The target RNA (RB1) includes the 94 nucleotides of upstream sequences and the first 57 nucleotides of downstream sequences surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1. It corresponds to the entire sequence of the psaC-ndhD intergenic region and the 57 nucleotides of the ndhD exon (Fig. 2B). The RB1 RNA includes an inverted repeat sequence in which are located the 5′-end of mature ndhD RNA and the 3′-end of mature psaC RNA (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the 5′-end of RB1 RNA is more upstream than that of the mature monocistronic ndhD mRNA. The probe RNA was labeled by fluorescein maleimide and incubated with the purified recombinant CRR4. The CRR4-RNA complex was detected as a shift band that migrated more slowly than free RNA in the gel. As shown in Fig. 2C (lanes 1-6), the retarded band was detected upon increasing the amounts of the recombinant CRR4. The presence of about 3-10-fold the amount of CRR4 to the RB1 probe was required for retardation. To eliminate the possibility that GST binds to the RB1 probe, the same RNA probe was incubated with GST lacking the CRR4 sequence. Even 100-fold the amount of GST to the RB1 probe did not induce any shift band (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-9), indicating that the RNA binding activity crucially depends on CRR4. To analyze whether the RNA binding activity of CRR4 is specific to the sequence of the RB1 probe, the ability of different competitor RNAs to reduce binding of labeled RB1 probe to CRR4 was compared. We used nonlabeled RB1 and RB2 probes as competitor RNAs. The RB2 probe includes the 201 nucleotides of the coding region of ndhD, which is unlikely to contain the cis-acting element for the RNA editing of ndhD-1 (Fig. 2B). To demonstrate the sequence specificity of CRR4, it is essential that the competitor RNAs used in this assay were accurately quantified. We therefore verified that two competitor RNAs (cold RB1 and cold RB2) were intact and that their concentrations were accurately quantified by comparing them with a range of yeast tRNA concentrations (Fig. 2D). The addition of 100-fold the amount of nonlabeled RB2 probe had no effect on CRR4-RB1 binding (Fig. 2E, left panel). In contrast, the addition of 10-fold the amount of nonlabeled RB1 probe resulted in the disappearance of the retarded band (Fig. 2E, right panel). These results indicate that CRR4 specifically binds to the 151 nucleotides surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1. CRR4 Is a Trans-acting Factor Required for RNA Editing of ndhD-1—Both in vivo and in vitro analyses of cis-acting elements indicated that fewer than 20 nucleotides of the upstream sequence and, in some cases, fewer than 10 nucleotides of the downstream sequence surrounding the editing site are enough for site recognition for RNA editing (13Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhuri S. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5958-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The putative trans-acting factor specifically binds to this cis-acting element. If CRR4 really is a trans-acting factor, the short sequence surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1 might be enough to recruit CRR4. To study this possibility, RNA binding activity was determined using an RB3 probe that includes the 25 upstream nucleotides and the 10 nucleotides in the downstream sequence surrounding the ndhD-1 editing site (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 1-6), the retarded band was detected with increasing amounts of the recombinant CRR4. The presence of about 3-10-fold the amount of CRR4 to the RB3 probe was required for retardation, the same as when using the RB1 probe (Fig. 2C). It was also verified that this binding does not depend on GST (Fig. 3B, lanes 7-9). The addition of 3-10-fold the amount of nonlabeled RB3 probe resulted in the disappearance of the retarded band (Fig. 3C, left panel). However, the addition of excess amounts of nonlabeled RB2 probe had no effect (Fig. 3C, right panel), indicating that CRR4 binds to the putative cis-acting element of ndhD-1 site in a sequence-specific manner. Taken together with the genetic evidence indicating that CRR4 is required for the RNA editing of ndhD-1, we conclude that a PPR protein, CRR4, is a trans-acting factor required for the RNA editing of ndhD-1. The C residue of ndhD-1 Is Not Essential for CRR4 Binding— A UV cross-linking experiment using the in vitro editing system revealed that a single factor binds both to the cis-acting element and the RNA editing site (35Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). If the C nucleotide of ndhD-1 also contributes to CRR4 binding, its editing from C to U may influence the binding of CRR4. We next investigated the possibility that CRR4 preferably binds to the pre-edited RNA rather than the post-edited RNA, which carries U at the editing site. In this analysis, the RB3 probe was modified to carry U at the editing site of ndhD-1, so that the sequence corresponds to that of post-edited RNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, the post-edited RB3 probe also interacted with CRR4, indicating that the C nucleotide in the ndhD-1 site is not essential for CRR4 binding. However, the binding affinity was slightly lower when using the post-edited RNA rather than the pre-edited RNA (compare Fig. 3B, lane 3 with Fig. 4A, lane 3). To further estimate the relative binding affinity for the pre-edited and post-edited RNA, a constant low concentration of labeled RNA probe was incubated with a range of protein concentrations. The Kd value is the concentration of protein at which 50% of the RNA probe bound, and was 1.6 and 3.0 nm, for pre- and post-edited RNA, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that the recombinant CRR4 binds to the pre-edited RNA with a slightly higher affinity than to the post-edited RNA. CRR4 binding to the post-edited RNA was also exposed to competition with the nonlabeled pre- and post-edited RNA (Fig. 4D). The result similarly indicated that the pre-edited RNA has slightly higher activity for recruiting CRR4 than the post-edited RNA (compare Fig. 4D, left panel, lanes 5 and 6, with Fig. 4D, right panel, lanes 5 and 6). Although the C nucleotide of the editing site is not essential for CRR4 binding, CRR4 slightly favors the pre-edited RNA over the post-edited RNA for binding at least at the in vitro assay level. C-to-U RNA editing in plant organelles requires a cis-acting element for site recognition. The putative trans-acting factor binds to this cis-acting element to directly deaminate the target C or to recruit the second trans-acting factor, an unidentified RNA-editing enzyme. However, the molecular identity of the trans-acting factor has up to now been unclear. The breakthrough was the identification of an Arabidopsis crr4 mutant that is specifically impaired with respect to RNA editing of ndhD-1. The CRR4 gene encodes a member of the PPR protein family (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). PPR proteins are believed to be involved in the RNA maturation processes in organelles and to form a large family, especially in higher plants (5Shikanai T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Maqniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The 466 genes encoding PPR proteins are roughly sufficient to maintain all of the RNA editing events in Arabidopsis. Although the model in which a PPR protein acts as a trans-acting factor was plausible, we could not eliminate the possibility that CRR4 is involved in RNA maturation processes other than RNA editing and that the function of CRR4 is indirectly involved in RNA editing. In this study, we showed that GFP fused with the transit peptide of CRR4 targets to the plastid (Fig. 1B), and CRR4 specifically binds to the 25 nucleotides of the upstream and the 10 nucleotides of the downstream sequences surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we have shown that the four alleles of crr4 are specifically defective with respect to RNA editing of the ndhD-1 site (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We conclude that CRR4 is a trans-acting factor required for the RNA editing of ndhD-1 and propose a model in which a PPR protein acts as a site recognition factor for RNA editing in the plastid (Fig. 5). The 36 nucleotides, including the ndhD-1 site, are sufficient to recruit CRR4 (Fig. 3). The intergenic region between psaC and ndhD includes an inverted repeat, which possibly forms a stem-loop structure, and a potential Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence (Fig. 2B). The former is probably involved in intergenic RNA cleavage, whereas the latter may be involved in ribosome binding. However, these sequences are not required for CRR4 binding, because the 36 nucleotides lack these sequences. This result is consistent with the fact that the intergenic RNA cleavage between psaC and ndhD is not affected in crr4 (21Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), indicating that recognition of 36 nucleotide sequence by CRR4 is not related to RNA processing. On the other hand, some RNA editing is coupled with RNA processing or translation (34Wang Z. Zou Y. Li X. Zhang Q. Chen L. Wu H. Su D. Chen Y. Guo J. Luo D. Long Y. Zhong Y. Liu Y.G. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 676-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Karcher D. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Schmitz-Linneweber C. Tillich M. Herrmann R.G. Maier R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4874-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some cases, translation might play the role of unwinding an RNA secondary structure to facilitate access of the editing machinery. The UV cross-linking experiments using in vitro editing system revealed that both labels in the target C site and the cis-acting element covalently bind to an unidentified 56-kDa protein in the psbE editing site (35Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, no additional protein was specifically cross-linked with the editing site, implying that the 56-kDa protein itself might carry out the site recognition and the cytidine deamination (35Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, these results favor a single-subunit model of RNA editing machinery. Consistent with this result, we also showed that the C nucleotide in the ndhD-1 site is somewhat involved in CRR4 binding (Fig. 4, B and C), although the binding affinity of recombinant CRR4 for pre-edited RB3 probe was only slightly higher than for the post-edited RB3 probe (Fig. 4, B and C). The competition experiment using the pre-edited and the post-edited RNA also showed that the contribution of the target C nucleotide to CRR4 binding was rather minor (Fig. 4D). This observation is consistent with in vivo studies indicating that the cis-acting element of ndhF carrying U at the editing site derived from a transgene leads to reduction of editing efficiency in endogenous ndhF transcripts (18Reed M.L. Peeters N.M. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 6948-6952Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the C nucleotide at the editing site is not a critical recognition feature for the trans-acting factor. We are not sure whether the slight preference of the pre-edited RNA to the post-edited RNA for the CRR4 binding in vitro has a physiological significance in vivo. CRR4 belongs to the PLS subfamily (E subclass) in the PPR protein family according to its motif structure (23Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Maqniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). CRR4 consists of 11 PPR motifs, an E motif, and an unknown 15-amino acid motif (Fig. 1A). Biochemical analyses of HCF152 have suggested that the PPR motif acts as an RNA-binding motif (29Nakamura T. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Schuster G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several PPR proteins are capable of binding to nucleic acids (23Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Maqniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 38Schumitz-Linneweber C. Williams-Carrier R. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2791-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). CRR4 also interacts with the RNA sequence surrounding the editing site of ndhD-1 (Fig. 3), implying that the PPR motifs have a role in RNA recognition. The sequence of the E motif is also related to the PPR motifs (Fig. 1A). However, the sequence of the PPR motifs in the E motif diverges to some degree from the N-terminal PPR motifs (39Rivals E. Bruyere C. Toffano-Nioche C. Lecharny A. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The C-terminal unknown 15-amino acid motif is also related to the E and E+ motif and is well conserved in some PPR proteins, including CRR4. The C-terminal region of CRR4 may have a function that is distinct from PPR motifs in the N-terminal region. Another member of the PLS subfamily, CRR2, is involved in the intergenic RNA cleavage between rps7 and ndhB (27Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). CRR2 is a member of the DYW subclass and has all of the motifs present in CRR4, although the 15-amino acid motif is not conserved. It is unlikely that CRR4 includes any possible domain responsible for cytidine deamination. It is therefore necessary to hypothesize another factor responsible for the deamination of the C nucleotide. We propose a two-component model of RNA editing machinery in plastids, which consists of a trans-acting factor of PPR protein and an unidentified RNA-editing enzyme (Fig. 5). This process of RNA editing in plastids appears to be similar to the C-to-U editing in apolipoprotein B mRNA seen in mammals (40Wedekind J.E. Dance G.S. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), although the molecules involved in the editing are dissimilar. We thank M. Tanoue for skilled technical support and W. Sakamoto, S. Arimura, and H. Takemura for providing the GFP controls."
https://openalex.org/W1999202878,"Isoaspartate formation in extracellular matrix proteins, by aspartate isomerization or asparagine deamidation, is generally viewed as a degradation reaction occurring in vivo during tissue aging. For instance, non-enzymatic isoaspartate formation at RGD-integrin binding sites causes loss of cell adhesion sites, which in turn can be enzymatically “repaired” to RGD by protein-l-isoAsp-O-methyltransferase. We show here that isoaspartate formation is also a mechanism for extracellular matrix activation. In particular, we show that deamidation of Asn263 at the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) site in fibronectin N-terminal region generates an αvβ3-integrin binding site containing the l-isoDGR sequence, which is enzymatically “deactivated” to DGR by protein-l-isoAsp-O-methyltransferase. Furthermore, rapid NGR-to-isoDGR sequence transition in fibronectin fragments generates αvβ3 antagonists (named “isonectins”) that competitively bind RGD binding sites and inhibit endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and tumor growth. Time-dependent generation of isoDGR may represent a sort of molecular clock for activating latent integrin binding sites in proteins.

Time-dependent generation of isoDGR may represent a sort of molecular clock for activating latent integrin binding sites in proteins. Fibronectins are adhesive proteins that mediate a variety of cellular interactions with extracellular matrix and play important roles in hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, wound repair, angiogenesis, and embryogenesis (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 2Humphries M.J. Obara M. Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cancer Investig. 1989; 7: 373-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). About 20 isoforms of human fibronectin can be generated as a result of alternative splicing of the primary transcript (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 3Mohri H. Peptides. 1997; 18: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fibronectins are large glycoproteins (∼450 kDa) composed of two nearly identical disulfide-bonded subunits present in most body fluids and extracellular matrix of many tissues. Each subunit consists of three types of repeating homologous modules termed FN-I, FN-II, and FN-III repeats. Alternatively spliced modules, called EDA, EDB, and IIICS, can also be present (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 3Mohri H. Peptides. 1997; 18: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Single modules or groups of modules may contain binding sites for different molecules, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, DNA, gelatin, heparin, and fibrin (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 3Mohri H. Peptides. 1997; 18: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fibronectins contain binding sites for about half of the known cell surface integrin receptors (5Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 6Johansson S. Svineng G. Wennerberg K. Armulik A. Lohikangas L. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d126-d146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, the FN-III10 repeat contains an RGD site that can bind α3β1, α5β1, αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, α8β1, and αIIbβ3 integrins, while the FN-III9 repeat contains the so-called “synergy site” PHSRN that cooperates with RGD in the binding of α5β1 and αIIbβ3 (1Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 7Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Primary and tertiary structure analysis of human fibronectin showed that this protein contains two GNGRG loops, located in FN-I5 and FN-I7 modules, that are conserved in bovine, murine, rat, amphibian, and fish (8Di Matteo P. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo G. Sacchi A. Crippa L. Protti M.P. Ponzoni M. Toma S. Corti A. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two additional NGR sites, less conserved, are also present in human FN-II1 and FN-III9 (see Fig. 1). Recent experimental work showed that peptides containing the NGR motif can inhibit α5β1- and αvβ1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (9Koivunen E. Gay D.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

We observed that the NGR sequence of FN-I5 (residues 263-265) promotes endothelial cell adhesion via an unusual mechanism based on non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn263 to l-isoAsp, generating isoDGR, a new cell adhesion motif. Furthermore, we show that αvβ3 integrin is an important receptor of isoDGR and that the deamidated FN-I5 module (named “isonectin-1”) regulates endothelial cell adhesion and inhibits tumor growth. Finally, we show that this motif is regulated in a negative manner by protein-l-isoAsp-O-methyltransferase (PIMT). 2The abbreviations used are: PIMT protein-l-isoAsp/d-Asp-O-methyltransferase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM, extracellular matrix; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; HMEC, human microvasculature endothelial cell.2The abbreviations used are: PIMT protein-l-isoAsp/d-Asp-O-methyltransferase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM, extracellular matrix; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; HMEC, human microvasculature endothelial cell. Based on these findings we propose a new “activation/deactivation” model for isoAsp “formation/removal” in fibronectin. Cell Lines and Reagents—Mouse RMA lymphoma cells, B16 melanoma, and EA.hy926 cells (human endothelial cells fused with human lung carcinoma A549 cells) were cultured as described previously (10Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 11Curnis F. Gasparri A. Sacchi A. Cattaneo A. Magni F. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2906-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human microvasculature endothelial cells, HMEC-1, were provided by Dr. A. Manfredi (San Raffaele H Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy) and cultured in MCDB131 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 units/ml streptomycin, 25 ng/ml amphotericin B, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems, Inc.), and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (complete medium). Crystal violet (Fluka Chemie), bovine serum albumin (BSA), goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, FN-70 kDa, FN-45 kDa, and FN-30 kDa fragments (Sigma), RetroNectin (Takara Biomedicals), human αvβ3, α5β1, and α1β1 integrins (Immunological Sciences), and streptavidin peroxidase (Società Prodotti Antibiotici) were used. Human fibronectin was freshly isolated from plasma by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose as described (12Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Haralson M.A. Hassel J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 175-185Google Scholar). Preparation and Characterization of Recombinant FN-I4-5 and FN-I4-5SGS—The cDNA coding for human fibronectin fourth-fifth type I repeats (FN-I4-5; residues 184-273 of fibronectin) was prepared by reverse transcriptase PCR on MSR-3-mel cells total RNA (13Tanzarella S. Russo V. Lionello I. Dalerba P. Rigatti D. Bordignon C. Traversari C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2668-2674PubMed Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-CTGGATCCGAGAAGTGTTTTGATCATGCTGCTGGG (forward) and 5′-TATATTAAGCTTTCAGTGCCTCTCACACTTCC (reverse). A control fragment with NGR replaced with SGS (FN-I4-5SGS), was generated by PCR on FN-I4-5 plasmid using the above forward primer and the following reverse primer, 5′-TATATTAAGCTTTCAGTGCCTCTCACACTTCCACTCTCCACTGCCGCTG. Amplified fragments were cloned into a pRSET-A plasmid (Invitrogen), expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells as soluble proteins (with a His tag at the N terminus), and purified from cell extracts by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. Preparation and Characterization of Synthetic Peptides—Various peptides (biotinylated and non-biotinylated) were prepared by chemical synthesis using an Applied Biosystem model 433A peptide synthesizer. Amino acids in l-configuration were used except when indicated. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the fifth type I repeat of human fibronectin (FN-I5), residues 230-274 of mature protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P02751), was also synthesized with an additional N-terminal acetyl-glycine and with Glu250 in place of Asp250. To promote disulfide formation between Cys258-Cys270 and Cys231-Cys260 in FN-I5 (see Fig. 1), Cys258 and Cys270 were protected with S-trityl groups (removable by trifluoroacetic acid after side-chain deprotection and cleavage from the resin), whereas Cys231 and Cys260 were protected with S-acetamidomethyl groups (removable by treatment with iodine). After RP-HPLC purification of peptide, the Cys258-Cys270 disulfide bridge was formed by incubating 20 μmol of peptide in 300 ml of 8% Me2SO at pH 7 (room temperature, overnight). The peptide was then purified by RP-HPLC and lyophilized. To form the second Cys231-Cys260 disulfide bridge, 13.5 μmol of peptide was dissolved in 67 ml of 80% v/v acetic acid and mixed with 0.135 ml of 1 N hydrochloric acid. Then, 21 mg of iodine, dissolved in 2 ml of methanol, was added to the peptide solution under stirring. After 90 min, 1 mmol of ascorbic acid was added to quench iodine. The peptide was then purified by RP-HPLC. All peptides were dissolved in sterile water and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Peptide purity was analyzed by RP-HPLC. Free sulfhydryl groups in all peptide preparations were <0.1% as checked by titration with Ellman's reagent (Pierce). Peptide identity was checked by MALDI-TOF or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of peptides used throughout this work was similar to the expected value. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of FN-I5 showed the presence of an additional component of +144 Da, corresponding to FN-I5 with unremoved acetamidomethyl groups. Preparation and Characterization of CNGRC-TNF, CDGRC-TNF, ACDCRGDCFC-TNF, and CNGRC-TNF1-11 Conjugates—Murine TNF, CNGRC-TNF (consisting of murine TNF fused with the C terminus of CNGRCG), and ACDCRGDCFC-TNF conjugates were prepared by recombinant DNA technology as described (14Curnis F. Sacchi A. Borgna L. Magni F. Gasparri A. Corti A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Curnis F. Gasparri A. Sacchi A. Longhi R. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for CDGRC-TNF (murine TNF fused with the C terminus of CDGRCG) was prepared by PCR on CNGRC-TNF plasmid (14Curnis F. Sacchi A. Borgna L. Magni F. Gasparri A. Corti A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CACCATGGGCAACGGCCGTGGCGGCGTC (forward) and 5′-TCAGGATCCTCACAGGGCAATGATCCCAAAGTAGAC (reverse). The amplified cDNA was cloned into the pET101/D-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen), expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen), and purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography on soluble p75-TNF receptor-Sepharose essentially as described previously for CNGRC-TNF (16Colombo G. Curnis F. De Mori G.M. Gasparri A. Longoni C. Sacchi A. Longhi R. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47891-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both CNGRC-TNF and CDGRC-TNF were subjected to a refolding procedure as described previously (14Curnis F. Sacchi A. Borgna L. Magni F. Gasparri A. Corti A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Protein purity and identity were checked by SDS-PAGE, electrospray mass spectrometry, and gel filtration chromatography. The in vitro cytolytic activity of CNGRC-TNF and CDGRC-TNF, measured by standard cytolytic assay with L-M mouse fibroblasts (17Corti A. Poiesi C. Merli S. Cassani G. J. Immunol. Meth. 1994; 177: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were 2.96 (± 0.56) × 108 and 2.59 (± 0.69) × 108 units/mg, respectively. CNGRC-TNF1-11, corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of NGR-TNF (lacking TNF activity) and CARAC-TNF1-11 peptide, were prepared by chemical synthesis as described above. Accelerated Aging (Heat Treatment) of Fibronectin Fragments and Peptides—Fibronectin fragments, peptides, and peptide-TNF conjugates were diluted in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, and stored at -20 °C until analysis. These products are hereinafter referred to as “heat treated.” Isoaspartate (isoAsp) Quantification—isoAsp content in proteins and peptides was quantified using the IsoQuant isoaspartate detection kit (Promega). The isoAsp content in fibronectin (freshly isolated from human plasma) and FN-30 kDa fragment was 0.048 and 0.026 pmol/pmol of protein, respectively. Cell Adhesion Assay and PIMT Treatment—Untreated and heat-treated fibronectin fragments, peptides, and peptide-TNF conjugates were diluted at the desired concentration with 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, and added to 96-well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Falcon; BD Biosciences). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed, seeded with EA.hy926 cells in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (40,000 cells/well), and left to incubate for 2-3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as described (11Curnis F. Gasparri A. Sacchi A. Cattaneo A. Magni F. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2906-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effect of PIMT on the pro-adhesive properties of different fragments was investigated as follows. Microtiter plates were coated with various products as described above and washed with 0.9% sodium chloride. Each well was then filled with 45 μl of a solution containing 0.02 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine in 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 5 μl of PIMT solution (from the IsoQuant isoaspartate detection kit; Promega) (final volume 50 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation the plates were washed with 0.9% sodium chloride, and cell adhesion assay was performed as described above. Binding of Peptides and Proteins to Integrins—Human αvβ3, α5β1, and α1β1 integrin solutions, 0.5-2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS; Cambrex), were added to 96-well polyvinylchloride microtiter plates (50 μl/well) and left to incubate overnight at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. The plates were washed with DPBS and further incubated with DPBS containing 3% BSA (200 μl/well, 1 h). The plates were washed and filled with CNGRC-TNF or TNF solutions (5 μg/ml, 50 μl/well in 3% BSA-DPBS) and left to incubate for 2 h. After washing with DPBS, each well was incubated with purified rabbit anti-murine TNF IgGs in 3% BSA-DPBS containing 1% normal goat serum (10 μg/ml, 50 μl/well, 1 h) followed by a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate in the same buffer (50 μl/well, 1 h). Bound peroxidase was detected by adding o-phenylendiamine chromogenic substrate. Binding of biotinylated peptides (CNGRC-TNF1-11, CARAC-TNF1-11, and FN-I5) to purified integrins was studied using streptavidin peroxidase conjugate complexes. Complexes were prepared by mixing various quantities (0.5-1 μg) of heat-treated biotinylated peptides in DPBS containing 3% BSA with 0.03 units of streptavidin peroxidase (binding capacity 1 μg of biotin/unit of streptavidin peroxidase) (final volume 15 μl). Complexes were diluted in 3% BSA-DPBS (1:500), added to microtiter plates coated with integrins as described above, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with DPBS, bound peroxidase was detected by chromogenic reaction as described above. Each assay was carried out in triplicate. Inhibition of Endothelial Cell Proliferation—HMEC-1 cells (8 × 103) in complete medium were seeded in 96-well plate (100 μl/well). After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 100 μl of peptide solution in complete medium (100 μm) was added to each well. Cells were further incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The number of viable cells present within each well was then determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay using a calibration curve generated by plating different amounts of cells. In Vivo Studies—Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical Committee of the San Raffaele H Scientific Institute and performed according to the prescribed guidelines. C57BL/6N mice (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy) weighing 16-18 g were challenged with subcutaneous injection in the left flank of 7 × 104 RMA living cells; 4 days later, mice were treated daily with 200 μg of heat-treated FN-I5 (100 μl) in 0.9% sodium chloride (intraperitoneal). Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumors with calipers as previously described (18Gasparri A. Moro M. Curnis F. Sacchi A. Pagano S. Veglia F. Casorati G. Siccardi A.G. Dellabona P. Corti A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2917-2923PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed before tumors reached 1.0-1.3 cm in diameter. Tumor sizes are shown as mean ± S.E. (five animals/group). Accelerated Aging of Fibronectin Fragments Generates NGR-dependent Adhesion Sites—The adhesion of EA.hy926 cells to natural, recombinant, and synthetic fibronectin fragments containing the NGR motif was studied. First, the following proteolytic fragments of fibronectin were studied: (a) FN-70 kDa, containing the FN-I1-9 and FN-II1-2 repeats; (b) FN-30 kDa, containing the FN-I1-5 repeats; and (c) FN-45 kDa, containing the FN-I6-9 and FN-II1-2 repeats (see Fig. 1 for a schematic representation). All fragments, after adsorption to microtiter plates, induced cell adhesion and spreading (Fig. 2A), suggesting the presence of pro-adhesive sites in these regions. To investigate the role of the NGR motif in this phenomenon we analyzed the pro-adhesive properties of FN-I4-5 and FN-I4-5SGS fragments, the latter corresponding to a mutant with SGS in place of NGR (residues 263-265). Recombinant FN-I4-5, but not the SGS mutant, promoted cell adhesion (Fig. 2B). When we incubated these fragments in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, for 16 h at 37 °C (from now on this treatment will be called “heat treatment”), we observed an increase of cell adhesion to FN-I4-5, but not to FN-I4-5SGS (Fig. 2B). This suggests that a cell adhesion site, somehow related to the NGR sequence, was generated by accelerated aging. Similar results were obtained with synthetic FN-I5 (Fig. 2C). To assess whether the NGR motif was sufficient for mediating this phenomenon, we investigated the pro-adhesive properties of short peptides containing the NGR motif before and after heat treatment. Because the NGR tripeptide is unlikely to fold and to bind to microtiter plates, we introduced two flanking cysteines. The rationale for using flanking cysteines was based on the fact that the predicted conformation of CNGRC peptide, by molecular dynamic simulation, is similar to that of the GNGRG loop of FN-I5 repeat (8Di Matteo P. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo G. Sacchi A. Crippa L. Protti M.P. Ponzoni M. Toma S. Corti A. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we fused this peptide to TNF (CNGRC-TNF) or to the first eleven residues of TNF (CNGRC-TNF1-11, devoid of TNF activity) to enable adsorption to microtiter plates. As expected, heat treatment of CNGRC-TNF increased cell adhesion (Fig. 2D). No adhesion was observed to TNF alone either before or after heat treatment (data not shown). Similarly, heat treatment of CNGRC-TNF1-11, but not of CARAC-TNF1-11 (a control peptide), increased cell adhesion (Fig. 2D, right). These results support the hypothesis that the NGR motif is sufficient for promoting cell adhesion after heat treatment. Interestingly, a CDGRC-TNF conjugate, prepared by recombinant DNA technology, was completely inactive (Fig. 2E), suggesting that Asn is a crucial residue for the enhanced activity. In conclusion, these results suggest that structural changes related to the Asn residue of NGR motif in FN-I5 lead to generation of a pro-adhesive site. Deamidation of the NGR Motif Is Associated with Increased Cell Adhesion—It is well known that the Asn residues, particularly when followed by Gly, can undergo non-enzymatic deamidation via succinimide intermediate at physiological pH (19Tyler-Cross R.

Sci. 2005; 11: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This reaction leads to formation of Asp and isoAsp, predominantly in l-configuration (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, heat treatment of FN-I5, CNGRC-TNF, and CNGRC peptides increased their molecular mass by ∼1 Da as measured by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, >0.5 mol isoAsp/mol of heat-treated CNGRC-TNF subunit was detected using the IsoQuant kit. To assess whether the enhanced adhesive properties of FN-I5 after heat treatment depended on NGR deamidation, we incubated the heat-treated FN-I5 and CNGRC-TNF with PIMT, an enzyme that converts l-isoAsp and d-Asp residues to l-Asp (25McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Galletti P. Ingrosso D. Manna C. Sica F. Capasso S. Pucci P. Marino G. Eur. J.

PIMT almost completely inhibited the pro-adhesive activity of heat-treated FN-I5 and CNGRC-TNF (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this enzymatic treatment partially inhibited the pro-adhesive properties of natural FN-30 kDa (Fig. 3B) and FN-45 kDa fragments (data not shown), suggesting that Asn deamidation can occur also in natural fibronectin fragments. To assess the specificity of this reaction we evaluated the effect of PIMT on retronectin, an FN fragment that is known to promote cell adhesion via RGD (see Fig. 1). As expected, in this case no inhibition was observed after enzymatic treatment (Fig. 3B). Conversely, in this case we observed a modest but significant increase. This was not totally unexpected as also RGD can undergo isomerization of Asp residues, with formation of isoAsp and loss of function (20Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lanthier J.

Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, in this case PIMT is expected to “repair” RGD and increase cell adhesion. In conclusion, these results suggest that NGR deamidation, in contrast to RGD isomerization, is associated with a “gain of function” in cell adhesion assays. Mechanism of NGR Deamidation—The mechanism and the kinetics of peptide deamidation in DMEM, pH 7.53, and in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, were then investigated. To this aim the CNGRCGVRY peptide (called NGR-2C) was synthesized and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC before and after incubation at 37 °C. Residues GVRY were added to the C terminus of CNGRC to enable detection and column adsorption. In addition, two peptides called CDGRCGVRY (DGR-2C) and CisoDGRCGVRY (isoDGR-2C) corresponding to the same sequence of NGR-2C except for the presence of l-Asp and l-isoAsp in place of l-Asn, respectively, were prepared and analyzed by HPLC. The half-life of NGR-2C at pH 7.53 and pH 8.5, estimated from the height of the main chromatographic peak (Fig. 4A, peak 1), was ∼4 and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 4A, inset). In contrast, DGR-2C and isoDGR-2C under the same conditions were considerably more stable than NGR-2C (not shown). Further studies on NGR-2C stability in 150 mm sodium chloride, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and in 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, showed that 1 and 5% of peptide, respectively, was degraded after 1 day at 4 °C. These values increased to 27 and 86%, respectively, after 1 day at 37 °C. Of note, the peptide was stable for more than 1 week at 4 and 37 °C when stored in water (pH 5.6). Thus, the degradation reaction strongly depends on buffer composition. To identify the degradation products corresponding to peaks 2 and 3, formed in ∼1:3 ratio, we next analyzed heat-treated NGR-2C before and after spiking with NGR-2C or DGR-2C or isoDGR-2C. The results showed that peaks 2 and 3 correspond to DGR-2C and isoDGR-2C, respectively (Fig. 4B), suggesting that both degradation products are deamidated forms. To verify this hypothesis and to assess whether the mechanism of deamidation occurs via succinimide intermediate we monitored the NGR-2C deamidation reaction by MALDI-TOF. This analytical method showed, as expected, a progressive decrease during incubation of the molecular species corresponding to NGR-2C (expected monoisotopic mass, MH+ 1025.43) and an increase of species characterized by +1 Da (Fig. 4C). Noteworthy, a peak of -17 Da was also observed during the first 80 min of treatment, likely corresponding to the succinimide intermediate, which disappeared at later time points (Fig. 4C). These results strongly support the hypothesis that deamidation of Asn in the NGR motif occurs via loss of ammonia (-17 Da) followed by hydrolysis of the succinimide ring (+ 18 Da) with a global gain of ∼1 Da, as has been demonstrated for other Asn-containing peptides (19Tyler-Cross R.

To this aim, direct and competitive ELISAs with integrins adsorbed on microtiter plates were performed. Direct ELISA showed binding of all NGR-containing molecules (heat treated) to αvβ3 but little, or not at all, to the other integrins (Fig. 5, A and B). No binding was observed with heat-treated TNF or with a control CARAC-TNF1-11 peptide (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that NGR was critical. Of note, we observed binding of CNGRC-TNF to αvβ3 even before heat treatment, although to a lower extent (data not shown), possibly due to deamidation occurring during preparation and/or assay incubation. Accordingly, pretreatment with PIMT decreased the binding of both “heat-treated” and “untreated” CNGRC-TNF to αvβ"

https://openalex.org/W1979127230,"Although mitochondria and the Nox family of NADPH oxidase are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by external stimuli, there is limited information on their functional relationship. This study has shown that serum withdrawal promotes the production of ROS in human 293T cells by stimulating both the mitochondria and Nox1. An analysis of their relationship revealed that the mitochondria respond to serum withdrawal within a few minutes, and the ROS produced by the mitochondria trigger Nox1 action by stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Rac1. Activation of the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway was evident 4-8 h after but not earlier than serum withdrawal initiation, and this time lag was found to be required for an additional activator of the pathway, Lyn, to be expressed. Functional analysis suggested that, although the mitochondria contribute to the early (0-4 h) accumulation of ROS, the maintenance of the induced ROS levels to the later (4-8 h) phase required the action of the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway. Serum withdrawal-treated cells eventually lost their viability, which was reversed by blocking either the mitochondria-dependent induction of ROS using rotenone or KCN or the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway using the dominant negative mutants or small interfering RNAs. This suggests that mitochondrial ROS are essential but not enough to promote cell death, which requires the sustained accumulation of ROS by the subsequent action of Nox1. Overall, this study shows a signaling link between the mitochondria and Nox1, which is crucial for the sustained accumulation of ROS and cell death in serum withdrawal-induced signaling. Although mitochondria and the Nox family of NADPH oxidase are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by external stimuli, there is limited information on their functional relationship. This study has shown that serum withdrawal promotes the production of ROS in human 293T cells by stimulating both the mitochondria and Nox1.

Functional analysis suggested that, although the mitochondria contribute to the early (0-4 h) accumulation of ROS, the maintenance of the induced ROS levels to the later (4-8 h) phase required the action of the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway. Serum withdrawal-treated cells eventually lost their viability, which was reversed by blocking either the mitochondria-dependent induction of ROS using rotenone or KCN or the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway using the dominant negative mutants or small interfering RNAs. This suggests that mitochondrial ROS are essential but not enough to promote cell death, which requires the sustained accumulation of ROS by the subsequent action of Nox1. Overall, this study shows a signaling link between the mitochondria and Nox1, which is crucial for the sustained accumulation of ROS and cell death in serum withdrawal-induced signaling.

J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Cell stimulation by such agents has been shown to increase the cellular ROS levels, which regulate various cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, migration, and viability. Therefore, to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of diverse cell functions, it is essential that the cellular processes that lead to the induction of ROS be identified. The mitochondria and the Nox family of NADPH oxidase have emerged as major sources of ROS induction (4Fleury C. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 5Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). The mitochondria generate ROS as byproducts of respiration, and inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as rotenone and KCN, have been shown to attenuate the ability of hormones and cytokines to promote the production of ROS in various cell types (6Yoon Y.S. Lee J.H. Hwang S.C. Choi K.S. Yoon G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1895-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Felty Q. Xiong W.C. Sun D. Sarkar S. Singh K.P. Parkash J. Roy D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6900-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy has consistently shown increased mitochondrial ROS levels as a response to cell stimulation (7Felty Q. Xiong W.C. Sun D. Sarkar S. Singh K.P. Parkash J. Roy D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6900-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Lam M. Oleinick N.L. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47379-47386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase is a membrane enzyme that is responsible for the oxidative burst induced in activated phagocytes (9Wymann M.P. Sozzani S. Altruda F. Mantovani A. Hirsch E. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Brandes R.P. Kreuzer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The proposed model suggests that phagocyte stimulation by fMLP results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which then triggers the translocation of Rho GTPase Rac from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. The translocated Rac then interacts with and activates NADPH oxidase to generate ROS. Recent reports suggest that non-phagocytic cells can express isoforms of the catalytic subunit (Nox2) of NADPH oxidase, such as Nox1, -3, -4, and -5 (11Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X.

Although the physiological roles of these isozymes and the signaling events leading to their activation are largely unknown, Nox1 was shown to be involved in the production of ROS in the smooth muscle and epithelial cells induced by growth factors, such as angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor (14Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was also reported that PI3K and Rac are involved in the platelet-derived growth factor-induced Nox1 stimulation in a mechanism similar to that proposed for phagocytic type Nox2 stimulation (15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, Nox1 and Nox2 appear to use different Rac isoforms for their stimulation. Although the hematopoietic cell-specific Rac2 is believed to be the major isoform involved in Nox2 stimulation (10Brandes R.P. Kreuzer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Res. 2006; 98: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), Nox1 stimulation was induced by an interaction with the ubiquitously expressed protein Rac1 (15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Ueyama T. Geiszt M. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17718-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, despite the proposed roles of the tested Nox family members and the mitochondria in the induction of ROS, there is little information available regarding the functional relationship between the two different types of ROS sources. Serum withdrawal is a stimulus that can induce apoptosis by elevating the cellular ROS levels (21Lee S.B. Hong S.H. Kim H. Um H.D. Life Sci. 2005; 78: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was proposed that serum withdrawal could induce the accumulation of ROS in a single cell type through two different mechanisms, PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways. This is based on the observation from human U937 monocytic cells, which showed that serum withdrawal begins to induce ROS prior to PI3K activation, and the induced ROS then activates PI3K. The activated PI3K was shown to promote the cellular process leading to the further accumulation of ROS (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PI3K in this model does not simply mediate the stimulus-induced accumulation of ROS but amplifies and/or extends the ROS induction process. Given the unique features of serum withdrawal, further analysis of serum withdrawal-induced signaling was expected to provide new insights into how the accumulation of ROS is induced and regulated. Therefore, this study investigated the sources of serum withdrawal-induced ROS along with their functional relationship. To accomplish this, this study used human embryonic kidney 293T cells, which have a much higher efficiency of DNA transfection and RNA interference than U937 cells. The results show that both the mitochondria and Nox1 are involved in the serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of ROS in a single cell type. Importantly, it was found that they do not act independently but rather function in a cooperative manner to extend the production of ROS. The mechanism and functional significance of this phenomenon are discussed. Antibodies raised against the p85 subunit of PI3K, Myc, and Lck were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA) supplied the antibodies against Rac1, Lyn, and Hck. Anti-Ras and anti-α-tubulin were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All of the other antibodies used in this study were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative mutant of PI3K (PI3K-M) cloned in the pSRα2 vector and the Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (Rac1-M) in the pEXV vector (23Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Drs. L. C. Cantley (Harvard Medical School) and A. Hall (University College London), respectively. The following specific sequences of the 19 nucleotides were selected for the synthesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs): 5′-CCAGGATTGAAGTGGATGG-3′ (residues 1130-1148 of the human Nox1 cDNA; 5′-GCCACCAATCTGAAGCTCA (residues 1291-1309 of the human Nox2), and 5′-GTCAACATCCAGCTGTACC-3′ (residues, 1474-1492 of the human Nox4 cDNA) (24Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). As a negative control, the universal control sequence 5′-AGTTCAACGACCAGTAGTC-3′, which has no significant homology to any known mammalian genome, was used (25Yu L. Wu G. Wang L. Wang H. Zhang G. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2006; 209: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSUPER vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 293T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). The cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (26Kim D.K. Cho E.S. Um H.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the indicated expression construct or the chemically synthesized Lyn siRNA and its control RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX). To treat the 293T cells/transfectants, they were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml, allowed to adhere overnight, washed, and then given serum-free medium. Where specified, LY294002 (LY) (Calbiochem), catalase, and inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were added at the indicated concentrations. Treated and untreated control cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) followed by flow cytometry analysis to monitor their staining intensity and size. The cells displaying both a normal size and a low permeability to propidium iodide were understood to be viable, as previously defined (27Mangan D.F. Welch G.R. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1541-1546PubMed Google Scholar). All other populations were understood to be dead. Cellular ROS levels were analyzed using the following two different methods. Flow Cytometry—Treated and untreated cells were exposed to 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min, and cell-associated levels of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence were analyzed by flow cytometry (28Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were treated with 10 nm Mito-tracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR, 10 μm) was then added, incubation was continued for 5 min, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The confocal images were acquired and analyzed using a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were lysed as described previously (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the lysate proteins (400 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85. The immune complexes were washed and resolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 2.5 mm EGTA. l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) (5 mg/ml) was used to initiate the kinase reactions. After 20 min of incubation, the reactions were quenched by adding 1 m HCl. The phospholipids were extracted using a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol and separated by thin-layer chromatography. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of the proteins (50-100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to the Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were subsequently blotted using the indicated antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and lysed by sonication. The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the above buffer, which also contained 0.1% Triton X-100, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the membrane fraction (supernatant). The Rac1 levels in these membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the extent of Rac1 translocation to the membrane. To determine the binding of the translocated Rac1 to Nox1, the membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Nox1, and the levels of Rac1 in the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Cellular viability and ROS levels were analyzed at least three times to obtain means ± S.D. Results were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Responses of 293T Cells to Serum Withdrawal—It was reported that serum withdrawal killed U937 cells by inducing the accumulation of ROS and PI3K activation (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm this in 293T cells, these cells were grown in 10% serum, washed, and exposed to serum-free medium. The treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in the cellular ROS levels, which was observed within 5 min of serum withdrawal and persisted for ∼8 h without significant alterations (Fig. 1A). After this time, the ROS levels decreased gradually, reaching their original base at 16 h. Serum withdrawal did not re-induce the accumulation of ROS up to 72 h. The addition of catalase, an H2O2-degrading enzyme, to serum-free medium greatly reduced the serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of ROS and cell death (data not shown), suggesting that ROS mediate serum withdrawal-induced 293T cell death. Serum withdrawal also induced the activation of PI3K in 293T cells, which in contrast to the induction of ROS, was evident at 4-8 h of serum withdrawal initiation, but not earlier (2.5 min-2 h) (Fig. 1B). Such a delay in PI3K activation was also reported when rat pheochromocystoma cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions (29Alvarez-Tejado M. Naranjo-Suarez S. Jimenez C. Carrera A.C. Landazuri M.O. del Peso L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22368-22374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The serum withdrawal-induced activity of PI3K was abolished when PI3K-M was expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1C, top). Although this treatment did not significantly influence the induction of ROS within2hof serum withdrawal, the later period (4-8 h) of ROS accumulation was effectively reduced by PI3K-M expression (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using pharmacologic inhibitors for PI3K, such as LY (5-10 μm) and wortmannin (0.25-1 μm) (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that serum withdrawal increases the levels of ROS in 293T cells in both a PI3K-dependent and -independent manner, and that the latter mechanism precedes the former, as suggested for U937 cells (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PI3K-M (Fig. 1C, bottom) and PI3K inhibitors also rescued the 293T cells from serum withdrawal, which suggests that the PI3K-dependent late phase of ROS accumulation is essential for the lethality of serum withdrawal. Rac1 and Nox1 Are Involved in PI3K-dependent ROS Accumulation—Given the ability of PI3K to stimulate certain members of the Nox family (9Wymann M.P. Sozzani S. Altruda F. Mantovani A. Hirsch E. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), this study focused on Nox isozymes to determine the sources of PI3K-induced ROS in this system. Western blotting showed that the 293T cells expressed Nox1, -2, and -4 (Fig. 2A). The expression of Nox1 and Nox4 in these cells has also been reported (15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Park H.S. Jung H.Y. Park E.Y. Kim J. Lee W.J. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In contrast, real-time PCR experiments showed that there was little or no Nox3 and -5 expression in 293T cells (data not shown). To determine whether the Nox isozymes expressed were essential for serum withdrawal-induced ROS accumulation, the cellular levels of Nox1, -2, and -4 were specifically reduced by RNA interference (Fig. 2A). These cells and the cells that received the control RNAs were exposed to serum-free medium and incubated either for 30 min or 8 h to examine the early and late stages of ROS accumulation, respectively. Although both phases of ROS accumulation were not significantly influenced by reducing either the Nox2 or -4 levels, a decrease in the Nox1 levels resulted in a significant decrease in the induction of ROS 8 h (but not 30 min) after serum withdrawal (Fig. 2B). Serum withdrawal-induced 293T cell death was consistently attenuated when the Nox1 levels (but not Nox2 and -4) were reduced (Fig. 2C). Therefore, Nox1 appears to be the major Nox isozyme involved in the serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of ROS. These results also suggest that Nox1 acts selectively in the late phase in a similar manner to PI3K. In the case of growth factor-induced signaling, Rac1 was reported to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and interact with and stimulate Nox1 (15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee J.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Rac1 in this system, membrane fractions were prepared from the cells treated with serum withdrawal for various periods. Western blot analysis of the samples showed that serum withdrawal induced the translocation of Rac1 to the membrane fractions (Fig. 3A, top two panels). Rac1 in these fractions was co-immunoprecipitated with Nox1, suggesting an interaction (Fig. 3A, bottom two panels). Interestingly, both Rac1 translocation and its interaction with Nox1 were observed at 4-8 h (but not earlier), which is similar to that observed with PI3K activation. The introduction of Rac1-M into the 293T cells consistently reduced the accumulation of ROS after 8 h of serum withdrawal (but not at 30 min) (Fig. 3B) and also attenuated serum withdrawal-induced cell death (Fig. 3C). Therefore, Rac1 appears to mediate the late (but not early) stage of ROS accumulation by interacting with Nox1. Considering that the actions of Rac1 and Nox1 are kinetically associated with those of PI3K, it is likely that the PI3K in this system acts upstream of Rac1 and Nox1. Indeed, either LY or PI3K-M abolished the ability of serum withdrawal to induce the translocation of Rac1 and its interaction with Nox1 (Fig. 3D). Overall, serum withdrawal-activated PI3K appears to induce ROS by stimulating Rac1 and Nox1. Mitochondria Are Involved in PI3K-independent Early ROS Induction—To determine the ROS source involved in the early phase, 293T cells were treated with serum withdrawal for 30 min. The treated and untreated control cells were stained with Mito-tracker Red CMXRos and DHR, a ROS-sensitive probe that is localized in the mitochondria (31Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 32Emmendorffer A. Hecht M. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Roesler J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 131: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy analysis of the stained cells revealed that serum withdrawal increased the staining intensity of DHR (Fig. 4A, green). The majority of DHR-positive cells became orange when the DHR images were merged with those of Mitotracker Red CMXRos. This shows the cell population with the induced ROS in mitochondria. Moreover, the inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, rotenone and KCN, consistently suppressed the serum withdrawal-induced ROS accumulation after 30 min of serum withdrawal (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the ROS induced in the early PI3K-independent phase of serum withdrawal were generated, at least in part, by the mitochondria. Mitochondrial ROS Are Required for PI3K-dependent ROS Induction—Having determined the actions of both the mitochondria and Nox1 in a single model system, the association between the two was next investigated. Given the ability of ROS to activate PI3K under various experimental conditions (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 34Eom S.J. Kim E.Y. Lee J.E. Kang H.J. Shim J. Kim S.U. Gwag B.J. Choi E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is likely that the ROS induced in the early phase stimulate the late PI3K-dependent events. Indeed, catalase suppressed the ability of serum withdrawal to induce PI3K activation, Rac1 translocation, and the Rac1/Nox1 interaction (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained using rotenone or KCN. These inhibitors consistently attenuated the accumulation of ROS not only after 30 min (Fig. 4B) but also at 8 h of serum withdrawal (data not shown) and suppressed serum withdrawal-induced cell death (Fig. 4D). This suggests that ROS, particularly those originating from the mitochondria, are essential for activating the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway as well as for accumulating ROS in the late stage and cell death. PI3K-dependent ROS Induction Requires Protein Synthesis—Nevertheless, PI3K activation in 293T cells was observed ∼4 h after the mitochondria began to generate ROS (Fig. 1). This time lag might reflect the need to accumulate additional factors for PI3K activation. Cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (AD), which inhibit protein synthesis and transcription, respectively, were used to examine this possibility. Either inhibitor significantly reduced the ability of serum withdrawal to induce PI3K activation, Rac1 translocation, and the Rac1/Nox1 interaction (Fig. 5A), suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is essential for the induction of these events. Both inhibitors consistently attenuated the accumulation of ROS at 8 h but had little effect at 30 min (Fig. 5B) and also suppressed serum withdrawal-induced cell death (Fig. 5C). Therefore, protein synthesis appears to be essential for the late (but not early) stage of ROS accumulation and thus for cell death. Overall, serum withdrawal appears to stimulate the synthesis of a protein crucial for activating the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway. Role of Lyn in Serum Withdrawal-induced Signaling—To identify this protein, we first examined PI3K. However, the levels of its p85 and p110 subunits were not increased for up to 8 h after serum withdrawal (Fig. 6A). Because PI3K can be activated in a small G protein (35Rodriguez-Viciana P.

The small G proteins examined included Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 (Fig. 6B), and the Src family protein kinases included Lyn, Src, Fyn, Lck, Fgr, Blk, Yes, and Hck (Fig. 6C). Of these, only the Lyn levels increased in response to serum withdrawal. Interestingly, this was observed only when there was significant PI3K activation (4-8 h), suggesting that Lyn is involved in the serum withdrawal-induced activation of PI3K. Therefore, Lyn siRNA was introduced into 293T cells to further examine this possibility. It was confirmed that the treatment reduced the serum withdrawal-induced Lyn expression level (Fig. 7A, top two panels). The treatment also attenuated the ability of serum withdrawal to activate PI3K (Fig. 7A, bottom two panels), to induce the accumulation of ROS at 8 h (but not at 30 min) (Fig. 7B), and also to kill the cells (Fig. 7C). This suggests that serum withdrawal-induced Lyn participates in the process leading to PI3K activation and thus to late ROS accumulation and cell death.FIGURE 7Lyn is essential for PI3K-dependent ROS accumulation. A, the 293T cells were transfected with a nonspecific control RNA or Lyn-specific siRNA. The cellular Lyn levels were compared by Western blotting using α-tubulin as the loading control (top two panels). The transfectants were treated with serum withdrawal for 8 h, and the PI3K activity and content were analyzed (bottom two panels). B, the transfectants were treated with serum withdrawal for either 30 min or 8 h. The cellular ROS levels were analyzed. C, this treatment was extended for up to 72 h, and the cell viability was analyzed. D, the 293T cells were exposed to serum-free medium in the presence or absence of catalase (1,000 units/ml), rotenone (0.1 μm), KCN (1 mm), CHX (1 μg/ml), and AD (0.5 μg/ml). After incubation for 8 h, the cellular Lyn levels were analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lyn Is Induced in a ROS-independent Manner—Having determined that both mitochondrial ROS and Lyn are essential for serum withdrawal-induced PI3K activation, this study investigated whether or not ROS mediated the ability of serum withdrawal to induce Lyn. However, catalase, rotenone, or KCN had no significant effect on the serum withdrawal-induced Lyn expression, which was abolished by either CHX or AD (Fig. 7D). Therefore, serum withdrawal appears to increase the levels of Lyn in a ROS-independent manner. To determine the cellular components involved in serum withdrawal-induced ROS accumulation, this study used 293T cells as a model. It was confirmed that, as in the case of U937 cells (22Lee S.B. Cho E.S. Yang H.S. Kim H. Um H.D. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), serum withdrawal increases the levels of ROS in 293T cells in both a PI3K-dependent and -independent manner. This is based on the observations that, although ROS were induced immediately after serum withdrawal, the PI3K in 293T cells was activated 4-8 h later and that the inhibition of PI3K by PI3K-M or LY attenuated the induction of ROS at 4-8 h but not earlier. Therefore, the PI3K in this model appears to be selectively involved in the late (4-8 h) (but not early (0-4 h)) phase of ROS induction. Our findings suggest that Rac1 and Nox1 are involved in the PI3K-induced accumulation of ROS in this system. First, it was shown that Rac1 responds to serum withdrawal by translocating to the membrane fractions and interacting with Nox1. These events were selectively induced during the late phase, and the late phase of ROS accumulation was attenuated by either Rac1-M or Nox1 siRNA. This suggests that Rac1 and Nox1 play a role in the late phase of ROS induction, as observed for PI3K. Moreover, the observation that PI3K-M or LY prevented serum withdrawal from inducing the translocation of Rac1 and the Rac1/Nox1 interaction, supports the view that PI3K acts upstream of Rac1 and Nox1 in this system. However, it should be noted that the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway might not be solely responsible for the late stage of ROS accumulation. This is based on the observation that a blockade of this pathway by targeting PI3K, Rac1, or Nox1 failed to completely stop the late stage of ROS accumulation. The alternative ROS sources do not appear to involve other Nox isozymes tested in this study, such as Nox2 and Nox4, because a reduction of their expression levels by RNA interference did not significantly influence the serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of ROS. In contrast to the late phase, ROS during the early stage appear to be generated, at least in part, in the mitochondria. Confocal microscopy revealed the co-localization of induced ROS and mitochondria during the early phase. It was also shown that inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as rotenone and KCN, attenuate the early accumulation of ROS. Therefore, it appears that serum withdrawal increases the cellular ROS levels initially through the mitochondria, which is followed by the action of Nox1. Although the ROS-inducing roles of the mitochondria (40Vrablic A.S. Albright C.D. Craciunescu C.N. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) have been proposed for other stimuli, these findings suggest that they both can function in a single system. Importantly, the functions of the mitochondria and Nox1 appear to be linked. This is based on the observation that serum withdrawal failed to induce PI3K activation, Rac1 translocation, Rac1/Nox1 interaction, and the late stage of ROS accumulation when the ROS accumulation during the early stage was prevented by catalase, rotenone, or KCN. Therefore, ROS generated from the mitochondria during the early phase appear to trigger the late phase of ROS induction by stimulating the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show a direct signaling linkage between the mitochondria and Nox1 for ROS production. The link appears to be influenced by an additional factor induced by serum withdrawal in 293T cells. This was suggested by the long interval between the mitochondrial production of ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway and was indicated more directly by the ability of CHX or AD to prevent the activation of the pathway and late accumulation of ROS. In contrast, the early induction of ROS was not significantly influenced by CHX or AD, suggesting that the induction of the late stage (but not the early stage) of ROS accumulation requires protein synthesis. Our data suggest that Lyn, an activator of PI3K (37Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1606-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 42Ptasznik A. Prossnitz E.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25204-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), is one such protein that is induced by serum withdrawal and participates in the process leading to PI3K-dependent ROS accumulation. First, serum withdrawal induced an increase in the cellular Lyn levels, which was observed only in the late phase. Moreover, the prevention of Lyn induction using its siRNA prevented PI3K activation and the late induction of ROS. This highlights the requirement of Lyn induction for PI3K-dependent ROS accumulation. Therefore, the time lag required to activate the PI3K-dependent pathway appears to reflect the need for Lyn accumulation. Given the finding that PI3K-dependent ROS accumulation requires both mitochondrial ROS and Lyn induction, this study examined the relationship between the two. However, the introduction of Lyn siRNA did not significantly influence early/mitochondria-dependent ROS induction. Moreover, neither catalase, rotenone nor KCN, blocked the serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of Lyn. This suggests that mitochondrial ROS and Lyn do not mutually influence their inductions. Therefore, it appears that serum withdrawal activates the PI3K/Rac1/Nox1 pathway by triggering at least two independent routes, one leading to the mitochondrial generation of ROS and the other to the induction of Lyn. Although the mitochondria initiated the induction of ROS in the present system, the total levels of ROS induced were not further elevated by the subsequent additional action of Nox1 (Fig. 1A). Although the mechanism for this is unclear, it is possible that the ROS-inducing action of the mitochondria is slowed down as Nox1 begins to function. Regardless of the mechanism involved, Nox1 in this particular system appears to prolong the accumulation of ROS initiated by the mitochondria. In this regard, the mitochondria and Nox1 may be considered to be an initiator and a sustainer of ROS induction, respectively. Given that cell death is favored when an oxidative stress is protracted (43Chiaramonte R. Bartolini E. Riso P. Calzavara E. Erba D. Testolin G. Comi P. Sherbet G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Ventura J.J. Cogswell P. Flavell R.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2905-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the sustained accumulation of ROS caused by the cooperative action of the mitochondria and Nox1 is expected to support cell death. Indeed, inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which abolished both the early and late stage of ROS accumulation, attenuated serum withdrawal-induced cell death. This suggests that both accumulation phases are essential for cell death. Interestingly, cell death was also suppressed when the late stage of ROS induction was selectively reduced by targeting Nox1, Rac1, PI3K, Lyn, or protein synthesis. Therefore, it appears that mitochondrial ROS are essential (but not sufficient) for cell death and that the accumulation of ROS must be extended by the subsequent action of Nox1 to induce cell death. Fig. 8 gives a schematic of this process. In summary, this study has shown a link between the mitochondria and Nox1 for the production of ROS. The signaling molecules involved have also been determined. Finally, the functional significance of the link was verified by showing its key role in the sustained accumulation of ROS and cell death. These findings significantly advance our understanding of how ROS accumulation is induced and prolonged particularly in a cell death model."
https://openalex.org/W2047658647,"The use of tobacco products is associated with an increased incidence of periodontal disease, poor response to periodontal therapy, and a high risk for developing head and neck cancer. Nicotine and tobacco-derived nitrosamines have been shown to exhibit their pathobiologic effects due in part to activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs), mainly alpha7 nAChR, expressed by oral keratinocytes (KCs). This study was designed to gain mechanistic insight into alpha7-mediated morbidity of tobacco products in the oral cavity. We investigated the signaling pathways downstream of alpha7 nAChR in monolayers of oral KCs exposed for 24 h to aged and diluted sidestream cigarette smoke (ADSS) or an equivalent concentration of pure nicotine. By both real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and In-cell Western, the KCs stimulated with ADSS or nicotine showed multifold increases of STAT-3. These effects could be completely blocked or significantly (P<0.05) diminished if the cells were pretreated with the alpha7 antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (alphaBTX) or transfected with anti-alpha7 small interfering RNA (siRNA-alpha7). The use of pathway inhibitors revealed that signaling through the Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK steps mediated alpha7-dependent up-regulation of STAT-3. Targeted mutation of the alpha7 gene prevented ERK1/2 activation by nicotine. Using the gel mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that an increased protein binding activity of STAT-3 caused by ADSS or pure nicotine was mediated by janus-activated kinase (JAK)-2. Activation of JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway could be prevented by alphaBTX or siRNA-alpha7. Thus, nuclear transactivation of STAT-3 in KCs exposed to tobacco products is mediated via intracellular signaling downstream from alpha7, which proceeds via two complementary pathways. The Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK cascade culminates in up-regulated expression of the gene encoding STAT-3, whereas recruitment and activation of tyrosine kinase JAK-2 phosphorylates it. Elucidation of this novel mechanism of nicotine-dependent nuclear transactivation of STAT-3 identifies oral alpha7 nAChR as a promising molecular target to prevent, reverse, or retard tobacco-related periodontal disease and progression of head and neck cancer by receptor inhibitors."

Here we describe a new approach for visualizing tumors whose fluorescence can be detected using telomerase-specific replication-competent adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (OBP-401). OBP-401 contains the replication cassette, in which the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter drives expression of E1 genes, and the GFP gene for monitoring viral replication. When OBP-401 was intratumorally injected into HT29 tumors orthotopically implanted into the rectum in BALB/c nu/nu mice, para-aortic lymph node metastasis could be visualized at laparotomy under a three-chip color cooled charged-coupled device camera. Our results indicate that OBP-401 causes viral spread into the regional lymphatic area and selectively replicates in neoplastic lesions, resulting in GFP expression in metastatic lymph nodes. This technology is adaptable to detect lymph node metastasis in vivo as a preclinical model of surgical navigation."

Cell movement requires the coordinated rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to extend the leading edge of the cell, attach the leading edge to substrates, and then contract the cell body behind the cell. Small hair-like protrusions called filopodia are not well characterized but they are likely to help polarize cells and form a leading edge. Filopodia are followed by much larger extensions called lamellipodia, which often fold back over the peripheral edges to form ruffles. In addition to these peripheral ruffles, ruffles can take the shape of distinct waves over the dorsal surface of cells called dorsal ruffles or circular ruffles. Peripheral ruffles help direct lateral movement while the dorsal ruffles promote movement off of the plane of the cell. All of these structures are rich in filamentous actin (F actin) and the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell motility through filopodia and lamellipodia at the leading edge as well as promoting contraction at the trailing edge. Coordinating the actions of the cytoskeleton in response to growth factors and chemo-attractants requires the activation of multiple cell signaling pathways through phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; Pak, p21-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ECM, extracellular matrix; 1KO, Akt knock-out; 2KO, Akt2 knock-out; DKO, double knock-out.3The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; Pak, p21-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ECM, extracellular matrix; 1KO, Akt knock-out; 2KO, Akt2 knock-out; DKO, double knock-out. 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). PI 3-kinase-generated phospholipids serve as second messengers that activate small GTPases from the Rho family to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and their targets are among the best characterized molecules that direct cell motility. Cdc42 regulates filopodia, Rac regulates lamellipodia and ruffles, while Rho regulates stress fibers and cell contraction (1Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In addition, signals from PI 3-kinase promote both cell survival and glucose metabolism through a distinct effector, the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). The Akt family consists of three isoforms: Akt1 (α), Akt2 (β), and Akt3 (γ). All Akt isoforms contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for phospholipid binding followed by a short linker domain, a catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory tail domain. The isoforms share many common substrates through their preferential phosphorylation of a motif with the sequence of RXRXX(S/T) (2Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Akt1 is also rapidly recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells and is required for cell polarization (8Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr.

Thus, a growing body of literature has emerged showing that the cytoskeletal and cell survival pathways downstream of PI 3-kinase are interconnected by several overlapping signals. Isoform-specific knock-out mice have revealed distinct roles for two of the isoforms, Akt1 and Akt2.

Pak kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases identified through screens for direct effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Paks are divided into two groups, A and B, based on sequence similarities. Group A consists of three closely related family members, Pak1 (Pakα), Pak2 (Pakγ), and Pak3 (Pakβ). Group B contains Pak4, Pak5, and Pak6 (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 24Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano J. Dan C.

Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), while the effects of Pak on stress fibers are caused by phosphorylation and inhibition of a Rho GEF (31Alberts A.S. Qin H.

However, the precise role of Pak in regulating these structures is complicated by feedback activation of Rac, which occurs when Pak localizes to the membrane, so in some experimental paradigms even kinase-dead Pak can stimulate ruffling by activating Rac (32Obermeier A.

PIX proteins are guanine exchangers for Rac and Cdc42 but can activate Pak through both GTPase-dependent and GTPase-independent mechanisms (39Daniels H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

PDK-1 phosphorylates Pak at threonine 423, a site that is also autophosphorylated when Pak is activated by Rac or Cdc42 (40King C.C. Gardiner M.M. Zenke F.T. Bohl B.P. Newton A.C.

Cells lacking Akt2 have enhanced dorsal ruffling in response to the growth factor PDGF as well as elevated levels of activated Rac and Pak1. Akt2 knock-out cells also have increased migration, especially invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). These studies suggest opposing roles for Akt1 and Akt2 in regulation of Rac/Pak signaling, the actin cytoskeleton, and cell migration.

Construction of Wild Type, Kinase-dead, and Chimeric Akt Retroviral Constructs—Wild-type Akt1 and Akt2 in the retroviral vector, pMIGR1, have been described previously (6Bae S.S. Cho H. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49530-49536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Kinase-dead (KD) Akt2 construct was made based on the pMIGR-mycAkt2 by introduction of a K181M mutation (21Arboleda M.J. Lyons J.F. Kabbinavar F.F. Bray M.R. Snow B.E. Ayala R. Danino M. Karlan B.Y. Slamon D.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 196-206PubMed Google Scholar). Two primers: CCGCTATTATGCCATGATGATCCTGCGCAAGGAGG (F) and GGCGATAATACGGTACTACTAGGACGCGTTCCTCC (R) were used in PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase. The successful introduction of the point mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Akt chimeras were generated by PCR ligation-PCR mutagenesis (45Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). Murine Akt1 or Akt2 cDNA in pUC19 were used as templates for PCR. All Akt constructs bear an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag, and lack a native initiation codon. Primer pairs were designed to amplify cDNA sequences corresponding to the following domains of Akt1 and Akt2: PH domain (Akt1 residues 1-113, Akt2 residues 1-112), PH and linker region (Akt1 residues 2-143, Akt2 residues 2-145), PH, linker and catalytic (Akt1 residues 2-349, Akt2 residues 2-350), linker, catalytic, and regulatory tail (Akt1 residues 113-480, Akt2 residues 112-481), catalytic (Akt1 residues 144-349, Akt2 residues 146-350), catalytic and regulatory tail (Akt1 residues 144-480, Akt2 residues 146-481), and regulatory tail (Akt1 residues 350-480, Akt2 residues 351-481). The primer sequences were as follows: pUC19/EcoRI/c-Myc(F) for the N terminus of both Akt1 and Akt2:CGGCCAAATTCCACCATGG; pUC19/BamHI/Stop(R) for the C terminus of both Akt1 and Akt2: CTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCTC; Akt1PH(R):CTGCCTCTTGAGTCCATCGGCC; Akt1Linker (F): GAAGAAGAGACGATGGACTTCCGATC; Akt1Linker(R): GTGCTTGGGCTTGGCCAGGGAC; Akt1Catalytic(F): CGTGTGACCATGAACGAGTTTGAG; Akt1Catalytic(R): GAAGGGCAGGCGGCGGCCACAC; Akt1Tail(F): TACAACCAGGACCACGAGAAGCTGTTC; Akt2PH(R): CTGCTTCAGACTGTTGGCGACCATC; Akt2Linker(F): CGGGCCCAGGTGAGGAC; Akt2Linker(R): GGCCCGTGCCTTGTTGACAGC; Akt2Catalytic(F): AAAGTGACCATGAATGACTTCGATTATC; Akt2Catalytic(R): GAATGGCAGGCGGCCACAC; Akt2Tail(F): TACAACCAGGACCACGAGCGC. The amplified fragments were gel-purified from agarose and subject to blunt-end ligation in the desired combinations. Ligation reactions were used as templates for a second round of PCR to amplify the full-length chimera. PCR products corresponding to full-length chimera were gel-purified from agarose and cloned into pUC19 as EcoRI/BamHI fragments. Chimera integrity was verified by automated DNA sequencing. For mammalian expression, wild-type and chimeric Akt were subcloned into the retroviral vector pMIGR2, a derivative of pMIGR, as EcoRI/BamHI fragments. Retroviral Infection of Akt2KO MEFs—Ecotropic BOSC23 packaging cells (a gift from Dr. Warren S. Pear, The University of Pennsylvania) were grown to ∼70% confluence in 100-mm dishes. BOSC23 cells were transfected with 6 μg of each pMIGR retroviral construct using FuGENE6. Retroviral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Cell-free supernatants were used to infect spontaneously immortalized Akt2KO MEFs in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. An additional round of infection was performed using cell-free retroviral supernatants harvested 72 h post-transfection. Infection efficiencies were assessed by GFP expression and were routinely greater than 90%, as determined by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Akt chimera expression and kinase activity was comparable in mouse fibroblasts (not shown). Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum as previously described (9Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For transfection of HEK 293T cells, cells were split and grown for a day until 60-80% confluent and transfected using FuGENE 6. For one single well of a 6-well plate, 2 μg of plasmids and 6 μl of FuGENE 6 were used. The cells were allowed to express the proteins for ∼24 h after DNA was added. The cells were harvested and cell lysate was prepared as previously described (9Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Pak Kinase Assay—For kinase assays using endogenous Pak from MEF cells, cell lysates were prepared, then Pak1 was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Pak1 antibody. For kinase assays using transfected Pak in 293T cells, Myc-Pak was immunoprecipitated with a Myc monoclonal antibody. Pak kinase assays were conducted as previously described using either histone 4 or a Bad S112 peptide (ETRSRHSSYP) as a substrate (9Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Kinase assay results were detected by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Rac Activation Assay—Rac activation assays were conducted as recommended by the supplier. Cells were plated onto 100-mm plates and grown ∼24 h to 75-80% confluent, serum-starved for ∼24 h, and then harvested. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min prior to harvesting. To harvest, the cells were washed twice with icecold PBS before adding 0.8 ml 1× Mg2+ Lysis/Wash Buffer (MLB). The cells were then scraped from the plate and transferred to microtubes on ice. To prepare the cell lysates they were incubated with 10% (v/v) glutathione-agarose for 10 min at 4 °C on a rotator. The samples were spun down at 14,000 rpm for 5 s, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes as cell lysates. The cell lysates were used immediately for a pull-down of active Rac with Pak1-PBD-agarose. 10 μl of Pak1 PBD-agarose were added to 500 μl of cell lysate, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 60 min. The agarose beads were collected by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 5 s, and the supernatants were removed. The beads were washed three times with MLB and suspended in 2× SDS buffer for Rac detection by Western blot. To serve as positive and negative controls, cell lysates prepared the same way from wild-type MEF cells were preloaded with 100 μm (final concentration) of either GTPγS or GDP in the presence of 10 μm EDTA and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding MgCl2 to 60 mm. Pull-down assays were also conducted with these samples as above, except the incubation time was for 30 min. Phase Imaging and Immunofluorescence—MEF cells were observed and pictures were taken using Phase 3 Imaging Systems (Glen Mills, PA). Time lapse images were taken at 30-s intervals. For immunostaining, MEF cells were grown on a Nunc chamber overnight and starved for ∼24 h, and then stimulated with PDGF for 10 min. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then premeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton for 20 min. Following incubation with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and goat serum for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were incubated with diluted antibodies (1:50 for Pak; 1:100 for Rac) for 1-2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton three times and then incubated with Alexa-Fluor 594 phalloidin, 1:500 dilution of Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), or Marina blue goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton several times, the samples were mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The samples were observed and pictures were taken as previously described (9Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—MEF cells were grown overnight until subconfluent and then serum-starved for ∼24 h. Cells were detached with Trypsin-EDTA, collected in prewarmed DMEM containing trypsin inhibitor (Boehringer), washed once with the same medium and kept in it until used. For migration in transwells, about 2.5 × 104 cells in a 100-μl volume were added to the upper well of 24-well chamber plates (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μm pores) coated with fibronectin and DMEM containing 30 ng/ml PDGF was added to the bottom part of the well. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for ∼18 h, the membranes were fixed with a solution with 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol, stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 10% ethanol for 30 min. Then, the non-migrating cells, which stay on the upper side of the membrane, were removed by gently wiping the membrane with a cotton swab. For invasion assays through Matrigel, a chamber with 8 μm pore size coated with Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix was used. ∼1.25 × 105 cells in a 500-μl volume were loaded into the top well. The medium in the bottom well, incubation, and staining procedures were the same as described for the transwell assay. After the cells were stained and dried, the migrated cells were counted under a Nikon TMS inverted microscope using a 20× lens. Enhanced Dorsal Ruffling in Akt2 Knock-out MEFs—Akt1 can stimulate Pak1 through multiple mechanisms (9Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell.

However, all of the studies on the interactions between Akt1 and Pak have been based on cell transfection or in vitro studies. To date, there is no genetic evidence for a role of Akt1 in Pak signaling, nor have any studies documented an interaction between Akt2 and Pak. To study the interaction between Akt and Pak we initiated studies with mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines derived from Akt knock-out mice as described previously (6Bae S.S. Cho H. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49530-49536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The cell lines tested were: wild type (WT), Akt1 knock-out (1KO), Akt2 knock-out (2KO), and Akt1/Akt2 double knock-out (DKO). For reexpression of Akt isoforms, stable cell lines were made by introducing pMIGR-based Akt1 or Akt2 into WT or 2KO backgrounds. These cell lines include: WT cells with empty vector (WTM); 2KO cells with empty vector (2KOM); 2KO cells with Akt2 (2KOM2) and 2KO cells with Akt1 (2KOM1). We first examined morphological alterations caused by the loss of the Akt isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1A, 1KO cells are larger and more spread than WT and the other two KO lines, 2KO or DKO. Many Akt1 KO cells have a branched structure (Fig. 1A, indicated with an arrowhead). When stained for F-actin with phalloidin, Akt1 KO cells have highly developed stress fibers compared with WT cells (Fig. 1C, arrow). While stress fibers are caused by Rho activation, they are also observed when Pak activity is reduced because Pak phosphorylates and inhibits a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (31Alberts A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2086472592,"A novel family of focal adhesion proteins, the kindlins, is involved in attachment of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and in integrin-mediated cellular processes. Deficiency of kindlin-1, as a result of loss-of-function mutations in the KIND1 gene, causes Kindler syndrome, an autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by skin blistering, progressive skin atrophy, photosensitivity and, occasionally, carcinogenesis. Here we characterized authentic and recombinantly expressed kindlin-1 and show that it is localized in basal epidermal keratinocytes in a polar fashion, close to the cell surface facing the basement membrane, in the areas between the hemidesmosomes. We identified two forms of kindlin-1 in keratinocytes, with apparent molecular masses of 78 and 74 kDa, corresponding to phosphorylated and desphosphorylated forms of the protein. In kindlin-1-deficient skin, basal keratinocytes show multiple abnormalities: cell polarity is lost, proliferation is strongly reduced, and several cells undergo apoptosis. In vitro, deficiency of kindlin-1 in keratinocytes leads to strongly reduced cell proliferation, decreased adhesion, undirected motility, and intense protrusion activity of the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results show that kindlin-1 plays a role in keratinocyte adhesion, polarization, proliferation, and migration. It is involved in organization and anchorage of the actin cytoskeleton to integrin-associated signaling platforms.

The Kindler syndrome protein, kindlin-1, is a member of a newly described protein family, which also includes kindlin-2 (also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing family C member 1 or mitogen-inducible gene 2 protein, Mig-2) and kindlin-3 (also known as Unc-112-related protein 2). The family members show a high amino acid sequence homology to each other and to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-112 (1Siegel D.H. Ashton G.H. Penagos H.G. Lee J.V. Feiler H.S. Wilhelmsen K.C.

The homology to UNC-112 has led to functional predictions about the kindlins as linkers of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (1Siegel D.H. Ashton G.H. Penagos H.G. Lee J.V. Feiler H.S.

C. elegans embryos homozygous for unc-112 null mutations exhibit a Pat (paralyzed arrested elongation at 2-fold) terminal phenotype, i.e. they arrest at the 2-fold stage of embryogenesis and have severely disorganized body wall muscle. Correspondingly, UNC-112-GFP fusion protein was localized to dense bodies and M-lines, structures that attach the myofilament lattice to the muscle cell membrane (2Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Gilbert M.M. Williams B.D. Moerman D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

The 298-amino acid FERM domain was originally identified in band 4.1 isolated from human erythrocyte ghosts. FERM proteins provide a regulated linkage from filamentous actin in the cortex to membrane proteins on the surface of cells. Their conformation and activity are regulated by a combination of phospholipid binding and phosphorylation and seems to play a crucial role in the cellular cytoskeletal response to Rho pathway activation (3Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). PH domains share little sequence conservation but all have an electrostatically polarized common fold. PH domains have diverse functions including targeting proteins to the plasma membrane and strong specificity for lipid binding. They are present in protein kinases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and GTPase-activating proteins for small GTP-binding proteins and phospholipases (4Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Kindlin-2 or Mig-2 was shown to be a component of the cell-extracellular matrix adhesion structures in keratinocytes (5Gkretsi V. Zhang Y. Tu Y. Chen K. Stolz D.B. Yang Y. Watkins S.C. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated that Mig-2 is indispensable for proper control of cell shape change (6Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens suggested that Mig-2 interacts with a novel protein, migfilin, a widely expressed component of the actin-cytoskeleton-membrane junctions, which play key roles in cell shape modulation, motility, and differentiation (5Gkretsi V.

Indirect genetic evidence for kindlin-1 functions is provided by Kindler syndrome (KS), a human disorder, characterized by skin blistering at birth and in early childhood, mucosal fragility, progressive poikiloderma, mild photosensitivity, and, occasionally, carcinogenesis (8White S.J. McLean W.H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2005; 38: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Identification of null mutations in the kindlin-1 gene, KIND1, in patients with KS permitted both molecular diagnosis of the disease and structural predictions of the KIND1 gene product, kindlin-1 (1Siegel D.H.

However, very little is known about biochemical characteristics and physiological functions of kindlin-1 or the phenotypic consequences of its alterations in KS. Here we used biochemical, functional, and genetic studies to characterize authentic kindlin-1 in human skin and cultivated primary keratinocytes. We show that it has two physiological forms, phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, and that it is intimately involved in the regulation of cell shape, adhesion, polarity, proliferation, and motility. Recombinant Protein Expression and Antibody Production— Two glutathione S-transferase expression constructs spanning the C-terminal part of kindlin-1 were engineered (Fig. 1A). To obtain the shorter kindlin-1 fragment (spanning amino acids 620-674), a 165-bp PCR product was generated from cDNA obtained from normal human keratinocyte (NHK) total RNA using the forward primer KS2F: 5′-GCGCGGATCCCAGGTGGTCATCGAGTTTGA-3′, the reverse primer KS1R: 5′-GCGCGAATTCGCCGGTCAATTTGTGGAA-3′. For the larger fragment (spanning amino acids 541-674), a 402-bp amplicon was generated using the forward primer KS1F: 5′-GCGCGGATCCCAGAACGTGGCCCAGATG-3′ and the reverse primer KS1R. Both PCR fragments were cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of the p-GEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), verified by DNA sequencing and then used to transform BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences). The insoluble recombinant proteins trapped in inclusion bodies were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, briefly stained with BioSafe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad), and excised from the gel. Gel pieces containing the kindlin-1 fragments were used for immunization of rabbits with standard immunization protocols (Eurogentec). The antisera were affinity-purified with recombinant kindlin-1 immobilized to nitrocellulose. After washing of the membranes with TBS, the antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralized immediately with 1 m unbuffered Tris. A third antibody was produced in rabbits against a polypeptide spanning amino acids 153-171 of kindlin-1 (Fig. 1A) and affinity purified (PANATecs). Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Different cell types were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Pefabloc for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; and the supernatants were transferred into clean tubes and assayed for protein concentration with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were heated for 3 min at 90 °C in blue sample buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) or horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies against following proteins were used: kindlin-1 (affinity-purified), tubulin (Sigma), MAPK diphosphorylated ERK-1 and -2 (Sigma), His-G (Invitrogen), vinculin (Chemicon), talin (Sigma), ILK (Upstate Biotechnology), keratin 5 (Dako), and β1 integrin (Chemicon). Visualization was with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in detection buffer or with ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Assays for Cell Proliferation, Adhesion, Migration, and Apoptosis—Human keratinocytes from normal or KS skin and HaCaT cells were cultivated in keratinocyte growth medium (Invitrogen) and COS-7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamate. Normal human foreskin melanocytes were obtained from PromoCell. Cell morphology and shape were observed and photographed with the phase-contrast digital compact camera C-7070 (Olympus). Proliferation assays were performed in duplicates, as described (10Raghavan S. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 415-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion assays were performed in triplicates on 96-well plates coated with 10 μg/ml of fibronectin or 2 μg/ml of laminin 332. The wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Equal amounts of NHK and KS keratinocytes (104 cells) were plated for 1 h, washed, trypsinized, and counted (10Raghavan S. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 415-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Tasanen K. Tunggal L. Chometon G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Am. J.

Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2027-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with modifications. Keratinocytes were seeded on 6-well plates coated with laminin 332 in duplicates and grown to 90% confluence. Then the cell monolayers were scratched with a pipette tip. Three scratches for NHK and KS keratinocytes were photographed with a digital compact camera C-7070 (Olympus) immediately after wounding and then every 2 h during 12 h. The wound area was measured using the program ImageJ version1.37g (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Keratinocyte migration was monitored with time-lapse video microscopy and image analysis. The cells were seeded in keratinocyte growth medium, and after reaching 40-50% confluence, cell movements were recorded in a chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100TV, Zeiss) equipped with a digital CCD camera (Xillix Micro-Imager). Phase contrast photographs were automatically captured every 5 min for 3 h and stored with the Open lab software system (Improvision). The image sequences were converted to Quick Time movies, and migration tracks and cell shape changes were analyzed using Dynamic Image Analysis System software (Solltech Inc.). Cell velocity (μm/min) and direction of migration were calculated from the trajectories of at least 40 cells for each population. Shape changes of single cells were determined by measuring in successive frames (12 frames, 1 frame/5 min) the areas involved in protrusion and retraction of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis in cell cultures was assessed with the M30-Apoptosense ELISA kit (PEVIVA) (Alexis). cDNA Synthesis and Transfection Studies—Total RNA was extracted with QiAmp RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen) from subconfluent NHK. Reverse transcription was performed with Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit (BD Biosciences) with 0.5 μg of total RNA, using oligo(dT) primers. For amplification of full-length KIND1 cDNA, the oligonucleotides: 5′-ATGCTGTCATCCACTGACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGACAGATCAGCACGAGGA-3′ (reverse) were used. The PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 200 ng of cDNA, 1× buffer 2 with 2.5 mm Mg2+, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics). The cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 70 °C for 2 min 30 s; final extension was for 10 min at 70 °C. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pcDNA4/HisMax using the TOPOTA expression kit (Invitrogen). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and used for transfection of subconfluent COS-7 and HaCaT cells with 150 ng KIND1 cDNA per cm2 and the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Immunostainings and Confocal Microscopy—Skin cryosections were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 30 min. The specimen were stained with primary antibodies against kindlin-1, integrins α3 (P1B5, Chemicon), and α6 (GoH3, kindly provided by Dr. A. Sonnenberg, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam), collagen XVII (12Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol.

As secondary antibodies, FITC-, rhodamine-, or Cy3-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG or the AEC system (Dako) were used. The signals were visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss) or light microscopy. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used as nuclear stain and hematoxylin as counter stain. The TUNEL assay was performed with the DeadEnd Colorimetric System (Promega), as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For post-embedding immunogold labeling, tissue specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2-5 h at 4 °C. Specimens were dehydrated serially to 70% ethanol at-20 °C and embedded in LR White resin. Ultrathin sections were successively incubated in TBS, 0.05 m glycine in TBS, 0.5% ovalbumin, and 0.5% fish gelatin in TBS, primary antibody diluted in TBS-ovalbumin overnight at 4 °C, and, finally, 10 nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody (BioCell) diluted 1:30 in TBS-ovalbumin for 1 h. After rinsing, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined with an electron microscope. In negative controls, the primary antibody was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline or equimolar concentrations of non-immune rabbit IgG or an irrelevant primary antibody. Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation—Phosphorylated proteins were purified from HaCaT cell lysates containing 2 mm EDTA, 25 μm chymostatin, 10 μm antipain, 15 μm leupeptin, and 20 μm pepstatin (all from Sigma) using the PhosphoProtein purification kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. For dephosphorylation, the lysates were digested with 800 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 45 min at room temperature. As negative controls, a lysate containing enzyme and 10 mm activated orthovanadate, and a lysate without enzyme but with ortho-vanadate, were used. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Scanning densitometry of band intensities was performed using the Gel-Pro Express 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). For kinase inhibition experiments, the following inhibitors were used: 0.5, 1, and 2 μm casein kinase I inhibitor D4476; 100 and 150 μm casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole (TBB); and 75, 100 and 150 μm protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylamide III (all from Calbiochem). The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and added to subconfluent HaCaT cells for 2 h at 37°C. Control cells received an equal volume of Me2SO. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Diagnosis of the Kindler Syndrome—Peripheral blood and skin samples (from non-sun-exposed skin areas) of three patients with Kindler syndrome and of age-matched control persons were obtained after informed consent and used for mutation detection, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining, and cell culture. The mutation screening was performed as described elsewhere (9Jobard F. Bouadjar B. Caux F. Hadj-Rabia S. Has C. Matsuda F. Weissenbach J. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Hum. Mol.

Antibody Production and Kindlin-1 Expression—Antibodies were raised against two prokaryotic recombinant fragments spanning the C terminus and one polypeptide corresponding to the N-terminal part of kindlin-1 (Fig. 1A). Antibody specificity was tested on lysates of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a His-tagged full-length KIND1 cDNA construct. Affinity-purified antibodies against kindlin-1 and antibodies against the His tag recognized a unique 78-kDa band in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the antibodies did not react with untransfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B), which constitutively express kindlin-2 (6Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The size of the polypeptide band corresponds to the molecular mass of 77.4 kDa predicted for kindlin-1 on the basis of its cDNA sequence. The antibodies were next used to detect authentic kindlin-1 in human cells. Lysates of primary keratinocytes, HaCaT cells, and skin squamous cell carcinoma cells produced a 74-kDa/78-kDa double band in immunoblots (Fig. 1C). In contrast, keratinocytes of KS patients carrying kindlin-1 null mutations did not yield a signal with the antibodies (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, two other major cell types in human skin, epidermal melanocytes and dermal fibroblasts, produced no signal with the antibodies (Fig. 1C), indicating that kindlin-1 is a keratinocyte-specific protein in the skin. In vivo, kindlin-1 is localized along the dermal-epidermal junction zone (DEJZ) in a linear pattern (Fig. 2A), while in KS skin there was a lack of immunofluorescence staining with kindlin-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that kindlin-1 is located in a polarized manner at the basal aspect of keratinocytes facing the basement membrane. The gold particles were found intracellularly, close to the plasma membrane and distributed between the hemidesmosomes (Fig. 2, C and D). Kindlin-1 Is Phosphorylated—To explain the nature of the 74-kDa/78-kDa double band in immunoblots, both glycosylation and phosphorylation of kindlin-1 were investigated. Deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F did not change migration of kindlin-1 on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, in silico analysis of the amino acid sequence predicted five threonine, two tyrosine and 14 serine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A). Purification of phosphorylated proteins from HaCaT cell lysates demonstrated that the 78-kDa kindlin-1 band is phosphorylated (Fig. 3B). Dephosphorylation with lambda protein phosphatase led to a significant reduction of the intensity of the 78 kDa band and to an increase of the 74-kDa band (Fig. 3C), thus demonstrating that the latter is the unphosphorylated form. Addition of the specific CK2 inhibitor TBB to cell cultures abolished the 78 kDa form of kindlin-1 (Fig. 3D), but the casein kinase I inhibitor D4476 and the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylamide III had no influence on phosphorylation of kindlin-1 (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that kindlin-1 is a substrate for CK2 and, consequently, that phosphorylation is likely to be involved in the regulation of kindlin-1 function. Genetic Model: Kindlin-1 Deficiency in Kindler Syndrome— To investigate the function of kindlin-1, skin and cells of three individuals with Kindler syndrome were analyzed. Patient 1, a 6-year-old girl was homozygous for the KIND1 mutation c.676insC, leading to a frameshift from codon 226 and to a premature termination codon 25 codons downstream. Patient 2, a female of 7-years of age, was compound heterozygous for the mutation c.910G>T, p.E304X, and for a genomic deletion starting in intron 9 and ending in intron 11, designated g.70250_74168del (15Has C. Wessagowit V. Pascucci M. Baer C. Didona B. Wilhelm C. Pedicelli C. Locatelli A. Kohlhase J. Ashton G.H. Tadini G. Zambruno G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. McGrath J.A. Castiglia D. J. Invest Dermatol. 2006; 126: 1776-1783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Patient 3, a 40-year-old man, was homozygous for p.E304X (14Has C. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest Dermatol. 2004; 122: 84-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The clinical phenotype included pigment anomalies and extensive skin atrophy, particularly on dorsal hands, giving them a wrinkled prematurely aged appearance, more pronounced in the oldest individual (Fig. 4A). In all cases the mutations caused premature termination codons and led to complete absence of kindlin-1 in the skin (Fig. 2B) and, notably, to several secondary aberrations. Kindlin-1-deficient epidermis was severely atrophic, with only five to six cell layers (Fig. 4B), and exhibited almost no reactivity with the proliferation marker Ki67, in contrast to age-matched control skin (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that absence of kindlin-1 leads to decreased keratinocyte proliferation. The intensity of keratin 5, a marker of the intermediate filament system in proliferating epidermal keratinocytes, was substantially lower in kindlin-1 deficient skin, correlating with the Ki67 signal. In particular, only the basal layer of keratinocytes was stained with antibodies against keratin 5, whereas in normal control skin two or three suprabasal cell layers were positive. In contrast, epidermal differentiation was similar in KS and control skin, as assessed by keratin 10 and involucrin staining (Fig. 4, E-J). The uppermost dermis contained numerous keratin 5-positive single cells (Fig. 4E), and the TUNEL assay revealed several apoptotic cells (Fig. 4, K and L). Furthermore, kindlin-1 deficiency perturbed positioning of transmembrane components in basal keratinocytes. Instead of a preferential localization at the basal plasma membrane in control cells, collagen XVII was equally distributed all around the basal keratinocytes, also at the apical plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, implicating loss of polarization (Fig. 5, A and B). Integrin α6 (Fig. 5, C, D, G, and H) and tetraspanin CD151 (data not shown), which are targeted to the ventral surface of basal keratinocytes in control skin, were strongly reduced along some DEJZ stretches, while in others the deposition seemed increased. In addition, integrin α6 was also found at the lateral and apical cell membranes in KS skin, co-localizing with α3 integrin (Fig. 5, C"

https://openalex.org/W2080314903,"Myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) is a thick-filament protein whose precise function within the sarcomere is not known. However, recent evidence from cMyBP-C knock-out mice that lack MyBP-C in the heart suggest that cMyBP-C normally slows cross-bridge cycling rates and reduces myocyte power output. To investigate possible mechanisms by which cMyBP-C limits cross-bridge cycling kinetics we assessed effects of recombinant N-terminal domains of MyBP-C on the ability of heavy meromyosin (HMM) to support movement of actin filaments using in vitro motility assays. Here we show that N-terminal domains of cMyBP-C containing the MyBP-C ""motif,"" a sequence of approximately 110 amino acids, which is conserved across all MyBP-C isoforms, reduced actin filament velocity under conditions where filaments are maximally activated (i.e. either in the absence of thin filament regulatory proteins or in the presence of troponin and tropomyosin and high [Ca2+]). By contrast, under conditions where thin filament sliding speed is submaximal (i.e. in the presence of troponin and tropomyosin and low [Ca2+]), proteins containing the motif increased filament speed. Recombinant N-terminal proteins also bound to F-actin and inhibited acto-HMM ATPase rates in solution. The results suggest that N-terminal domains of MyBP-C slow cross-bridge cycling kinetics by reducing rates of cross-bridge detachment."

Strains defective in the synthesis of PtdEtn via phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) synthase/decarboxylase are auxotrophic for ethanolamine, which must be transported into the cell and converted to phospholipid by the cytidinediphosphate-ethanolamine-dependent Kennedy pathway. We now demonstrate that yeast strains with psd1Δ psd2Δ mutations, devoid of PtdSer decarboxylases, import and acylate exogenous 1-acyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (lyso-PtdEtn). Lyso-PtdEtn supports growth and replaces the mitochondrial pool of PtdEtn much more efficiently than and independently of PtdEtn derived from the Kennedy pathway. Deletion of both the PtdSer decarboxylase and Kennedy pathways yields a strain that is a stringent lyso-PtdEtn auxotroph. Evidence for the specific uptake of lyso-PtdEtn by yeast comes from analysis of strains harboring deletions of the aminophospholipid translocating P-type ATPases (APLTs). Elimination of the APLTs, Dnf1p and Dnf2p, or their noncatalytic β-subunit, Lem3p, blocked the import of radiolabeled lyso-PtdEtn and resulted in growth inhibition of lyso-PtdEtn auxotrophs.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model organism for understanding basic processes of lipid metabolism and membrane biogenesis. The major pathways of lipid biosynthesis have been elucidated in this organism, and our knowledge of the genes and proteins that play a direct role in glycerophospholipid and sterol synthesis is extensive. The biosynthetic reactions for the aminoglycerophospholipids, PtdSer, 2The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; Cho, choline; CoA, coenzyme A; Etn, ethanolamine; lyso-PtdEtn, 1-acyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; P-Etn, phosphorylethanolamine; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdEtn(Me)2, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. PtdEtn, and PtdCho, are particularly well characterized, and the pathways for their synthesis and certain aspects of their intracellular transport have been extensively reviewed (1Voelker D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 396-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Holthuis J.C. Levine T.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). There are two major pathways ultimately leading to the production of Ptd-Cho, which is the major phospholipid component of yeast membranes. First, PtdCho can be synthesized de novo by reactions catalyzing formation of PtdSer by the Pss1p enzyme, followed by decarboxylation of PtdSer by Psd1p in the mitochondrion or Psd2p in the Golgi, and finally methylation of PtdEtn by the ER localized Pem1p and Pem2p methyltransferase enzymes. Additionally, PtdEtn and PtdCho can be synthesized from exogenous Etn or Cho by the action of the Kennedy pathways, which utilize phosphorylethanolamine/cytidinediphosphate-ethanolamine or phosphorylcholine/cytidinediphosphate-choline as biosynthetic intermediates, respectively. Given the redundancy of multiple pathways leading to the same final products, the de novo and Kennedy pathways are not individually essential for growth, providing that at least one of the alternate pathways remains intact. For example, strains disrupted in the PSS1 (CHO1) (3Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kodaki T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) are auxotrophic for Etn or Cho, indicating a reliance on the Kennedy pathway for lipid synthesis. This fact has been exploited in genetic screens aimed at uncovering lipid transport mutants (6Trotter P.J. Wu W.I. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

However, the Kennedy and de novo pathways are only partially redundant, and the pools of PtdEtn and PtdCho produced by these different pathways are not functionally equivalent in all respects. For example, in mutants of the mitochondrial branch of the de novo pathway (i.e. psd1Δ strains), the lipid composition of mitochondria is greatly altered relative to the wild type cells, with a mitochondrial PtdEtn deficiency that is not fully restored by PtdEtn produced from exogenous Etn (10Birner R.

Additionally, recent work using molecular species determination and flux analysis by mass spectrometry has shown that the different pools of PtdEtn and PtdCho, produced by the Kennedy or de novo pathways, contain different sn-1,2-diacylglycerol molecular species profiles (12Boumann d.K.B.H.A. Heck A.J.R. de Kroon A.I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3054-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These latter findings reveal that in addition to spatially segregated pools of PtdEtn and PtdCho, there are also chemical distinctions between the products of these pathways. To circumvent the issues of molecular species and pathway-specific pools of spatially and chemically distinct lipids, it would be preferable to find a way to supply biosynthetic and transport mutants with a source of PtdEtn that restores all cellular pools of these lipids back to wild type levels. To this end, and in addition to the Kennedy and de novo pathways, we now describe the characterization of a third pathway of PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis in yeast, in which lyso-PtdEtn is specifically imported and used for PtdEtn synthesis by an acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase. Lyso-PtdEtn can serve as the sole source of PtdEtn and PtdCho in yeast and is used preferentially (relative to that derived from the Kennedy pathway) for supporting the structure and function of mitochondrial membranes. Uptake of lyso-PtdEtn is mediated by the plasma membrane aminophospholipid translocases Dnf1p and Dnf2p and their noncatalytic subunit Lem3p. Following uptake, lyso-PtdEtn is converted to PtdEtn by the action of an acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase activity. This system allows for the direct auxotrophic assay of lyso-PtdEtn internalization, trafficking, and acylation and thus provides a new tool for the study of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis and transport in yeast. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals, solvents, and amino acids for media were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Yeast extract, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were from Difco (Detroit, MI). CI-976 (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) was dissolved as a 25 mm stock solution in Me2SO and stored at 4 °C. Silica-60 TLC plates were from EM Sciences, and Silica gel H plates were from Analtech Corp. All of the lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lyso-PtdEtn was purchased as a 20 mg/ml chloroform solution and was prepared by rotary evaporation of the solvent under vacuum, followed by repeated addition and evaporation of methanol to remove traces of chloroform. The dried lyso-PtdEtn was dissolved in 10% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40, filter-sterilized, and stored at –20 °C until use. Yeast Culture and Genetic Manipulations—Yeast strains and their associated genotypes are provided in Table 1. Yeast strains with deletions of specific open reading frames were constructed by standard methods involving one-step gene replacement (14Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar, 15Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Gene replacements were carried out by transformation of PCR fragments containing an appropriate marker gene (as indicated in Table 1), flanked by at least 40 base pairs of DNA identical to the 5′ and 3′ regions outside the start and stop codons of the open reading frame of interest. The eviction of target genes from drug-resistant or prototrophic colonies was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 5′ and 3′ recombination junctions using appropriate combinations of marker gene and target gene-specific primers. Strains were routinely maintained on standard YP media containing either 2% lactate (YPLac) or 2% glucose (YPD) as a carbon source, with the addition of 40 mg/liter adenine, 40 mg/liter uracil, and 2 mm Etn (YPDAUE medium). For media containing lyso-PtdEtn, 1% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40 was included, and lyso-PtdEtn was added to the desired concentration from a sterile 25 mm stock solution in 10% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40.TABLE 1Strains used in this workStrainGenotypeSourceSEY6210Matα trp1 leu2 ura3 lys2 his3 suc2Scott EmrRYY52Matα trp1 leu2 ura3 lys2 his3 suc2 psd1Δ::TRP1Ref. 11Storey M.K.

Dipalmitoyl- and dioleoyl-cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol (Avanti) and [U-14C]serine (ICN Biochemicals; 135 mCi/mmol) were used to synthesize the corresponding Ptd[U′-14C]Ser (16Dowhan W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), followed by decarboxylation with purified Escherichia coli PSD to form Ptd[U′-14C]Etn (17Dowhan W. Li Q.X. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The radioactive phospholipids was treated with Apis mellifera PLA2 (Sigma) to yield lyso-Ptd[U′-14C]Etn (18Pluckthun A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11099-11106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make lyso-PtdEtn labeled in the fatty acid moiety, 100 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid was added to a 50-ml Cultures of E. coli strain SJ201 in M9-Brij media (19Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12720-12724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate [9,10-3H]palmitoyl-PtdEtn, with the labeled palmitate present almost exclusively at the sn-1 position. This PtdEtn was then purified from E. coli cells by preparative TLC on Silica gel H plates in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/0.25% KCl/triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v/v/v/v). The labeled PtdEtn was isolated from the silica and digested with PLA2 at 30 °C in a reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. Analysis of the fatty acid and lyso-PtdEtn species after TLC separation showed that >95% of the labeled palmitate was present at the sn-1 position of PtdEtn. Metabolic Labeling Experiments and Uptake Assays—Experiments examining lyso-PtdEtn addition to whole cells were conducted with the appropriate strains pregrown in YPDAUE medium to an A600 of 0.5–1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with one-half the original volume of SCGT (SC medium with 2% glucose and 1% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40), and then suspended in SCGT to a final A600 of 1.0 and used for metabolic studies. Radiolabeled lyso-PtdEtn was diluted with cold carrier to an appropriate specific activity (typically 200–600 cpm/nmol) and added to the culture at a final concentration of 250 μm, unless otherwise noted. The cells were incubated with labeled precursors for various times as indicated in individual experiments, followed by centrifugation three times in cold 2% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100 to remove unincorporated radioactivity. The recovered cells were then analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry to measure total lyso-PtdEtn uptake. As required, the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described below. Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Lipids were extracted by the ethanolic Bligh-Dyer method previously described (20Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were either resolved by one-dimensional TLC on Silica-60 plates in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/0.25% KCl/triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v/v/v/v) or resolved in two dimensions with chloroform/methanol/28% (w/v) ammonium hydroxide (65:25:4, v/v/v) in the first dimension, chloroform/glacial acetic acid/methanol/water (90:30:6: 2.6, v/v/v/v) in the second dimension. After lightly spraying the plate with 0.05% (w/v) anilinonapthalene-sulfonic acid in water, the fluorescent bands were visualized under ultraviolet light, and the lipid spots were scraped from the plate and either analyzed for phosphorus content as described (21Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) or scraped into vials for liquid scintillation spectrometry. Preparation of Homogenates and Acyltransferase Assays— The yeast strain PTY44 (22Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was grown to an A600 of 1.0–1.5 in YPDAUE medium and washed with homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, and leupeptin). The cells were suspended in 2-ml aliquots and disrupted in a Mini-Bead-Beater-8 apparatus (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) at setting 6, for 6 bursts of 30 s, with cooling on ice between pulses. Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and debris, and the protein concentration of the cell homogenate was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The cell homogenates were assayed for acyltransferase activity in 200-μl reactions containing 0.2 mm oleic acid, 0.2 mm CoA, 0.4 mm MgATP, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100,000 cpm oleoyl-lyso-Ptd[U′-14C]Etn. In this system the endogenous long chain acyl-CoA synthetase is used to generate acyl-CoA in situ. The assays were conducted for 1 h at 37°C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of methanol and 250 μl of chloroform, followed by vigorous vortexing and centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube to separate the phases. The chloroform phase was recovered and subjected to TLC and quantification of radioactivity by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Yeast Strains Auxotrophic for Etn Preferentially Use Exogenous Lyso-PtdEtn as a Precursor of PtdEtn and PtdCho—Previous studies have demonstrated that Etn is a relatively poor precursor for replenishment of the mitochondrial PtdEtn pool in strains harboring a psd1Δ mutation (10Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments tested whether lyso-PtdEtn is transported and metabolized by yeast, and whether it efficiently restores the mitochondrial pool of PtdEtn. As shown in Fig. 1A, the growth of PtdEtn deficient strains on agar plates is supported equally well by either 0.5 mm lyso-PtdEtn or 5 mm Etn. As demonstrated previously (5Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a psd1Δ psd2Δ strain displays a stringent requirement for Etn (or Cho) in the growth medium. However, this strain still produces PtdEtn via the Kennedy pathway in the absence of Etn, by generating P-Etn from dihydrosphingosine through action of the Dpl1p enzyme (9Kitamura H. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33720-33726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Deletion of the DPL1 gene in the psd1Δ psd2Δ background blocks this pathway, resulting in a stringent Etn auxotrophy that is not rescued by Cho (10Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A demonstrates that lyso-PtdEtn rescues this psd1Δ psd2Δ dpl1Δ triple mutant, implying that this compound can serve as the precursor of all PtdEtn and PtdCho biosynthesis needed to support the growth of the strain. To determine whether lyso-PtdEtn supports growth more efficiently than Etn, we next determined the minimum effective concentration of these compounds required for growth of psd1Δ psd2Δ in liquid medium containing either a respiratory (lactate) or fermentable (glucose) carbon source. As shown in Fig. 1B, the effectiveness of lyso-PtdEtn and Etn for supporting growth on glucose is essentially identical, with saturating growth being achieved at ∼0.25 mm initial concentration for both supplements. However, for growth under respiratory conditions (with lactate as carbon source) the dose-response curves indicate that Etn is a poorer substrate (≥2 mm required for optimum growth) for generating a critical pool of PtdEtn relative to lyso-PtdEtn (≃0.5 mm required for optimum growth). Mitochondrial membranes contain a large mole fraction of PtdEtn (11Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial number and size increases substantially during growth on a nonfermentable carbon source such as lactate. Thus, the results in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate that lyso-PtdEtn gives rise to a pool of PtdEtn that is better able to support mitochondrial function than PtdEtn produced via the Kennedy pathway. The Rate of Lyso-PtdEtn Uptake Is Sufficient to Supply All PtdEtn and PtdCho Biosynthesis in Rapidly Dividing Cells—To determine the rate of uptake of lyso-PtdEtn, we measured the time-dependent incorporation of radiolabeled lipid into cells of the psd1Δpsd2Δ strain. A culture of strain PTY44 was incubated with [9,10-3H]palmitoyl-lyso-PtdEtn for 2 h, and at 30-min intervals, an aliquot of cells was diluted and washed in cold bovine serum albumin/detergent solution to stop further uptake and also remove nonspecifically bound lipid. The result in Fig. 2 demonstrates that the total amount of radioactivity associated with cells increases in a linear fashion up to at least 120 min. These assays (determined at 0.25 mm lyso-PtdEtn) give a value for the uptake rate of ∼45 nmol/2 h/A cells. The starting cell number corresponds to 15 nmol of total 600PtdEtn and PtdCho. Thus, the rate of lyso-PtdEtn uptake is severalfold more than that needed to support growth of a strain with a 1.5–2-h doubling time. Lyso-PtdEtn Utilization Is Independent of the Kennedy Pathway—From the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, we considered two biochemical pathways as the routes for PtdEtn synthesis to mechanistically explain these initial results. First, yeast may import and subsequently degrade lyso-PtdEtn, releasing either Etn or P-Etn that could then be reassimilated via the Kennedy pathway. Second, yeast might take up and acylate the intact lyso-PtdEtn directly by the action of a lysophospholipid acyltransferase (24Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Richard M.G. McMaster C.R. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test the first possibility, we constructed a yeast strain with deletions of the PSD1, PSD2, and ECT1 genes, resulting in an absolute inability to form PtdEtn by the PSD pathways and a very limited ability to use Etn for PtdEtn synthesis. The use of Etn by the triple deletion strain could potentially occur as a consequence of low activity of Cct1p toward P-Etn. If the mechanism of lyso-PtdEtn utilization involves degradation and recycling of Etn or P-Etn, then we would expect this triple mutant to fail to grow on either Etn or lyso-PtdEtn. However, a direct acylation mechanism would allow for growth with lyso-PtdEtn supplementation but not Etn supplementation. These predictions were tested by analysis of the growth phenotype of this psd1Δ psd2Δ ect1Δ triple mutant. The experiment shown in Fig. 3A reveals that the triple mutant strain is incapable of using Etn to fulfill its requirements for PtdEtn and/or PtdCho biosynthesis. However, the triple mutant is fully viable with lyso-PtdEtn supplementation and shows an absolute auxotrophic requirement for this lipid. In addition to evaluating the growth phenotype, we tested the ability of the psd1Δ psd2Δ ect1Δ strain to import and convert Etn and lyso-PtdEtn to PtdEtn and PtdCho. Fig. 3B provides further direct evidence that the Kennedy pathway is not required for the utilization of lyso-PtdEtn because the absence of a functional Ect1p enzyme did not affect incorporation of label from lyso-Ptd[U′-14C]Etn into PtdEtn and PtdCho. This is in contrast to the incorporation of [1,2-3H]Etn into PtdEtn and PtdCho, presented in Fig. 3C, which shows a 70% decline in Etn incorporation into phospholipids. The low level of incorporation of [1,2-3H]Etn into phospholipids is most likely due to a limited ability of the phosphorylcholine preferring cytidylyltransferase Cct1p to use P-Etn as a substrate. It should be appreciated that this residual level of activity is insufficient to support cell growth. Taken together, the physiological and biochemical phenotypes of the psd1Δ psd2Δ ect1Δ strain provide strong evidence supporting the direct uptake and acylation of lyso-PtdEtn as the primary mechanism by which yeast uses this compound. The Majority of Cellular Lyso-PtdEtn Acyltransferase Activity Is Acyl-CoA-dependent—We next wanted to determine what type of acyl transfer activity is involved in the acylation of lyso-PtdEtn. We tested two major possibilities, the first being a transacylation mechanism in which the fatty acid of one lyso-PtdEtn molecule is transferred to another, forming PtdEtn and glycerophospho-Etn (26Erbland J.F. Marinetti G.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Erbland J.F. Marinetti G.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the second being a more direct mechanism involving acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase(s). Initially, we tested the ability of an inhibitor of acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases to block lyso-PtdEtn utilization. The acyltransferase inhibitor CI-976 (28Field F.J. Albright E. Mathur S. Lipids. 1991; 26: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has recently been shown to inhibit a Golgi-localized acyl-CoA-dependent lyso-PtdCho acyltransferase activity in mammalian cells (29Chambers K. Brown W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Drecktrah D. Chambers K. Racoosin E.L. Cluett E.B. Gucwa A. Jackson B. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This finding led us to test whether CI-976 decreased the efficiency with which yeast used lyso-PtdEtn. As shown in Fig. 4, this compound has no significant effect on the minimum effective concentration of Etn required for growth, and therefore it is neither toxic at this concentration nor directly involved in Etn utilization. However, the addition of 0.5 mm CI-976 modestly increased the concentration of lyso-PtdEtn required for half-maximal growth. CI-976 is a competitive inhibitor and structural mimic of acyl-CoA (28Field F.J. Albright E. Mathur S. Lipids. 1991; 26: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results suggest that a portion of the total lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase activity is acyl-CoA-dependent and CI-976-sensitive. However, this effect is much weaker than expected based on data derived from mammalian cells (29Chambers K. Brown W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This result could indicate that the yeast cell is relatively impermeable to CI-976 or that the bulk of the acyltransferase activity is insensitive to the compound. We also directly tested the rate of lyso-PtdEtn acylation in yeast homogenates in the absence and presence of an acyl-CoA-generating system. This provided a direct test of the activity of the transacylation mechanism versus the acyl-CoA-dependent mechanism. The transacylation reaction is CoA-independent, whereas the acyltransferase reaction is CoA-dependent. As presented in Fig. 5, the acylation of lyso-PtdEtn is almost entirely acyl-CoA-dependent, as judged by the >98% conversion of the substrate to PtdEtn in the presence of oleic acid, MgATP, and CoA (Fig. 5). This experiment provides another insight into the major catalytic activities present in the system, insofar as incubation of the labeled lyso-PtdEtn with crude yeast homogenate gave no significant loss of radiolabel. This latter result demonstrates that the in vitro rate of lyso-PtdEtn degradation by phospholipases is negligible relative to the rate of acyl-CoA-dependent acylation. Collectively, these findings further argue against a prominent role for lyso-PtdEtn degradation to form Etn or P-Etn for the synthesis of PtdEtn. PtdEtn and PtdCho Derived from Lyso-PtdEtn Are Not Subject to Extensive Acyl Chain Remodeling—To study the rate of remodeling (if any) of the products of lyso-PtdEtn incorporation, we added lyso-[9′,10′-3H]palmitoyl-PtdEtn and lyso-Ptd[U′-14C]Etn to yeast at a fixed ratio (3H:14C = 2.5:1) and measured this same ratio in the products PtdEtn, PtdEtn(Me)2, and PtdCho isolated by two-dimen"

Biochem. 1995; 215: 277-284Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As a subgroup of the mammalian MAPKs, p38 has been found to be involved in inflammation, cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle, cell death (6New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hsp27 usually exists as oligomers and plays a role in regulation of many cellular functions such as inhibition of the death receptor-mediated apoptosis (8Ricci J.E. Maulon L. Battaglione-Hofman V.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C1032-C1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has shown that hsp27 is a terminal substrate of the p38 MAPK cascade, and activation of p38 results in phosphorylation of Hsp27 that may change its intracellular distribution (11Nakatsue T. Katoh I. Nakamura S. Takahashi Y. Ikawa Y. Yoshinaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), modulate F-actin polymerization (12Pichon S.

Huisamen B. Maritz S. Moolman J.A. Lochner A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2004; 100: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Besides that, it has been well accepted that p38 MAPK is activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif by MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6 (14Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 15Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). Activated p38 phosphorylates MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), which in turn phosphorylates heat shock protein 27 (16Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Thus, p38, MK2, and hsp27 are in a same signaling pathway. Overwhelming evidence suggests that many signaling proteins form multimeric complexes held together by scaffolding proteins. Scaffolding proteins have been found for ERKs and JNKs, the two other members of the MAPK family (18Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J.

Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays have demonstrated that the serine/threonine kinase Akt, p38, MK2, and hsp27 form a complex in neutrophils, and the activation of Akt results in dissociation of hsp27 from the complex upon neutrophil activation by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. It has been suggested that this complex plays an important role in controlling stress-induced apoptosis (20Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Pierce W. Ping P. McLeish K.R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27828-27835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The complex may provide a quick communication channel for hsp27 to implement its cellular functions in response to extracellular stimuli, such as protecting neuronal cells from heat shock and nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis (22Mearow K.M. Dodge M.E. Rahimtula M. Yegappan C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), reorganizing actin cytoskeleton under oxidative stress (23Nguyen A. Chen P. Cai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or in the PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation and migration of the aortic smooth muscle cells (12Pichon S. Bryckaert M. Berrou E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and modifying smooth muscle contraction (24Yamboliev I.A. Hedges J.C. Mutnick J.L. Adam L.P. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, several questions remain for better understanding of this signaling complex. First, how is this complex formed? In other words, who is indispensable for the formation of the complex among these four signaling proteins? Second, it is unclear whether the dissociation of hsp27 from the complex depends on the p38 kinase, because p38 is also activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (25Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, it has not been fully understood how the complex dissociates in the cells under different stimulation. In this report, as a simplified model system, we studied the complex by directly observing the interaction between p38 kinase and hsp27 in intact live cells under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Both FRET approach and immunoprecipitation analysis were used to investigate how the interaction was regulated. FRET represents direct radiation-less energy transfer from an excited donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore and occurs when the two fluorophores are very close, usually in 6 nm. Owing to its extreme sensitivity to distances, it has become a powerful method in measuring protein-protein interactions in living cell (27Jares-Erijman E. Jovin T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 29Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In this study, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-fused hsp27 and the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fused p38 MAPK were co-transfected transiently in mouse fibroblast cells, the interaction between these two chimeras was mainly observed by lifetime-based FRET. Together with immunoprecipitation studies, our results demonstrated that the interaction of hsp27 with p38 is mediated by MK2 and negatively regulated by phosphorylation of hsp27 that is induced by activation of either p38 or Akt. The pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 vectors were obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). pKS2711 and pKS2711-3A vectors expressing wild-type human hsp27 and mutated hsp27 (serines 15, 78, and 82 substituted with alanine) were kindly provided by Prof. L. A. Weber (Dept. of Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, VA). Protein A was purchased from Pierce. The p38 MAPK Assay kit and mouse monoclonal anti-p38, rabbit anti-MAPKAPK-2, anti-phospho-p38(Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-phospho-Akt(Ser-473), and anti-human phospho-hsp27 (Ser-82) antibodies were obtained from Cellular Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-human/mouse Hsp27, mouse anti-GFP, goat polyclonal anti-Akt1/2 antibodies, normal goat, and mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SB203580, wortmannin, arachidonic acid (AA), and lemptomycin B (LMB) were purchased from Sigma. cDNAs of hsp27 and p38 were obtained by PCR amplification from pKS2711 and pcDNA3-FLAG-p38 constructs respectively. Subcloning hsp27 cDNA into CFP-expressing vector, pECFP-C1, in EcoRI-BamHI sites, made the CFP-hsp27 fusion construct. The p38 cDNA was subcloned into YFP-expressing vector, pEYFP-C1, in Hind-XhoI sites to construct the YFP-p38 fusion protein expression vector. A glycine was inserted between YFP and p38 as linker in the chimera. pECFP-hsp27-3A and pEYFP-p38AGF mutant constructs were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The entire cDNA inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutation points are Ser-15 → Ala, Ser-78 → Ala, and Ser-82 → Ala for Hsp27 and Thr-180 → Ala and Tyr182 → Phe for p38. The vectors pcDNA3.0-hsp27 and pcDNA3.0-hsp27-3A were constructed by subcloning hsp27 cDNA and hsp27-3A cDNA, respectively, from pKS2711 and pKS2711-3A into pcDNA3.0 in EcoRI-BamHI sites. The mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) MK2-/- cells from MK2 knock-out mice and its wild-type control cells (MEF MK2+/+) were kindly provided by Prof. M. Gaestel (Medical School Hanover, Germany) (30Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These cells and mouse fibroblast L929 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. For FRET experiments L929 or MEF cells were co-transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA plasmids (CFP to YFP constructs ratio was 1:2) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in CO2 incubators at 37°C for 20 h before FRET observation. To analyze the kinase activity of YFP-p38 and YFP-p38AGF, cells were transfected using the GenePulser II electroporation system (Bio-Rad) under the conditions of 500 V and 14-ms single pulse duration. The transfection efficiency was ∼30%. For analysis of hsp27 phosphorylation in the cells expressing hsp27 or hsp27-3A, the cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.0-hsp27 and pcDNA3.0-hsp27-3A using Lipofectamine 2000 and selected with 400 μg/ml G418. An Olympus IX71 invert microscope equipped with the AquaCosmos Microscopic Image Acquisition and Analysis system (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) was used to observe the heat shock resistance of cells. Both intensity-based and lifetime-based FRET microscopy were used. The former was used as a more straightforward approach to demonstrate existence of the energy transfer between CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38. However, most of FRET data were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Intensity-based FRET Microscopy—All FRET observations were performed on a Leica DM IRE2 confocal laser scanning microscope system at 37 °C 20 h after cells were transfected. Excitation was provided by multimode argon ion laser beam using a double 458/514 nm diachronic splitter. Donor (CFP) was excited at 458 nm, and its fluorescence was detected in a bandwidth of 478-498 nm (CFP channel), whereas the excitation at 514 nm and emission at 545 ± 15 nm were used for detecting acceptor (YFP) (YFP channel). FRET was detected at the excitation of 458 nm and the emission of 545 ± 15 nm (FRET channel). Fluorescence images of the transfected cells were taken up at CFP-, YFP- and FRET channel sequentially. The net FRET signal was corrected against bleed-through of the non-FRET CFP and YFP fluorescence excited directly by 458 nm according to Equation 1 (31Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), NetFRETsignal=FRETsignal-A×YFPsignal-B×CFPsignal(Eq. 1) where coefficients A and B represent the ratios of FRET signal to YFP signal in the absence of CFP-hsp27 and FRET signal to the CFP signal in the absence of the YFP-p38, respectively. Dequenching of donor fluorescence by photobleaching of acceptor YFP was performed by illuminating the transfected cells at the YFP excitation wavelength (514 nm) for 2 min with full laser power, then CFP-hsp27 images were taken up at the same focal plane. FRET efficiency was calculated by using Equation 2, E=1-(FDA/FD)(Eq. 2) where FDA and FD are the fluorescence intensity of CFP in the cells expressing both donor and acceptor, and donor alone, respectively. Application of photobleaching to the cell expressing CFP alone showed an apparent 9.8 ± 1.9% (n = 6) increase in CFP signal. This non-FRET increase may be attributed to a possible photoactivation of CFP by the 514 nm bleaching light and should be subtracted from the FRET efficiency values reported. Therefore, the FRET value reported by acceptor photobleach is a relative estimation that serves to confirm FRET data from the lifetime-based approach. Time-correlated single-photon counting fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed to obtain CFP fluorescence lifetime images in the cells transfected with CFP-hsp27 chimera alone or co-transfected with both CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38 chimeras. This was carried out with a multiphoton confocal laser scanning microscope system (Leica DM IRE2 and Becker & Hickl SPC730). The femtoseconds pulsed laser (Coherent Mire 900) beam at 820 nm was used to excite donor CFP in the transfected cells. The two-photon excited fluorescence was detected with a 480 ± 30 nm band-pass filter (Chroma, Rockingham, VT). The laser power was adjusted to give an average photoncounting rate of 104-105 photons s-1 without detectable photobleaching of the samples. The cells with moderate fluorescence intensity were picked for observation to avoid any possible artifact caused by too much overexpression. Each fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) image of the cells was taken for 50 s and continued for 30 min at 5-min intervals. Data were collected and analyzed by software provided by the manufacturer. Two-exponential decay dynamics was applied to analyze fluorescence decay characteristics of CFP and to calculate its fluorescence lifetime at each pixel. The FRET efficiency was calculated by using Equation 3, E=1-(TDA/TD)(Eq. 3) where TDA and TD are the mean fluorescence lifetimes of CFP in the cells expressing donor plus acceptor and donor alone, respectively. Non-transfected or transfected cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, one aliquot of clear lysate was incubated with 5 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-p38 antibody or 5 μl of goat polyclonal anti-Akt1/2 antibody, while another aliquot of the clear lysate was incubated with 5 μl of normal mouse IgG or normal goat IgG overnight with continuous rotation at 4 °C. The latter was used for control experiments to examine nonspecific interaction. Protein A-Sepharose beads (30 μl) were then added, and the samples were gently rocked for an additional 3 h at 4 °C. After five washes by centrifugation in lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% bromophenyl blue, pH 6.8), and then boiled for 5 min. The proteins dissociated from the beads were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS/T buffer (20 mm Tris base, 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, adjust to pH 7.6 with HCl) for 1 h. The blots were probed sequentially by anti-hsp27 and anti-p38 bodies in the precipitate with anti-p38 antibody, or probed sequentially by anti-GFP, rabbit anti-Akt, and anti-MK2 antibodies (1:1000) in the precipitate with goat anti-Akt1/2 antibodies and finally with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% nonfat milk in TBS/T buffer after removal of the free primary antibodies. Specific protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. p38 activity was assayed by measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated phospho-p38 to phosphorylate activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) using the p38 MAPK assay kit. Briefly, untreated and H2O2-exposed cells were lysed with 500 μl of above-mentioned lysis buffer. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, cleared lysates were incubated with 30 μl of immobilized phospho-p38 monoclonal antibody bead with gentle rocking overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with 1× kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and then incubated with 50 μl1 × kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μl of ATF-2 at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer (containing 187.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% w/v SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% w/v bromphenol blue). 30 μl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated ATF-2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody supplied with the kit. The validated target sequences were: 5′-UGCCCUUCUACAACCAGGA-3′, 5′-UACCGAGAGUUGCGUCUGC-3′, 5′-UACCGUGAGCUGCGCCUAC-3′, and 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ for mouse Akt1 siRNA (32Katome T. Obata T.

They were chemically synthesized by Gene-Pharma Co. (Shanghai, China). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated overnight, then transfected with 100 nm siRNA for 12 h using 2 μl of VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing) per well. The expression of Akt and p38 in the transfected cells was assayed by Western blotting using goat anti-Akt1/2 and rabbit anti-p38 polyclonal antibody, respectively, 36 h after transfection. Phosphorylation of p38, hsp27, and Akt was determined using corresponding phospho-specific antibodies. Cells exposed to H2O2 or AA were lysed with 1× SDS sample buffer on ice. Then, the lysate was sonicated for 20 s on ice to shear DNA and reduce viscosity. The samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-hsp27, and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies, respectively. The fluorescence lifetime of CFP-hsp27 shown on each image is the average for whole cells. The FRET efficiency was calculated based on the fluorescence lifetimes obtained from three independent imaging of different single cells. In statistical analysis of the phosphorylation level of p38 and Akt obtained from Western blotting measurement, the average value and standard deviation was calculated based on three independent measurements. CFP-tagged Hsp27 Still Protects the Transfected L929 Cells from Heat Shock-induced Death—To examine if the CFP-tagged hsp27 still functions as a stress-response protein, the cells transiently transfected with either pECFP-hsp27 or pECFP-hsp27-3A and the non-transfected wild-type cells were subjected to heat shock at 44 °C for 30 min and imaged 30 h later. As Fig. 1A shows, only those fluorescent CFP-hsp27-expressing cells survived from the heat shock, whereas almost all non-fluorescent wild-type cells died. The result indicates that CFP-tagged hsp27 still protects the cells from heat shock-induced death (see upper panel). In contrast, expression of CFP-fused dominant negative mutant of hsp27 (CFP-hsp27-3A) failed to prevent cell death (see lower panel), indicating that hsp27-3A, in which the residues Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82 are mutated to alanines, is a functionally dead mutant. YFP-tagged p38 Has Normal Function of p38 MAPK—To examine if the YFP-tagged p38 is still a functional kinase, its ability to phosphorylate ATF-2, the substrate of p38 kinase, was checked. The cells were transiently transfected with pEYFP-p38 or pEYFP-p38AGF by electroporation. Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed with anti-p38 antibody in wild-type and transfected cells either unexposed or exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 30 min, and the immunoprecipitate was then used to phosphorylate ATF-2. As Fig. 1B shows, H2O2 activated p38 in all three types of cell, but the highest activation was detected in the pEYFP-p38-transfected cells. It was also noticed that the H2O2-induced p38 activation in the cells transfected with YFP-p38AGF, the mutant that is unable to be phosphorylated, was much weak than that in wild-type cells. The results indicate that YFP-tagged p38 still functions as MAPK, whereas the YFP-p38AGF acts as a competitor to suppress activation of the endogenous p38 kinase in the cells. The CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38 Still Form a Complex with MK2 and Akt in the Transfected Cells—To justify the FRET study on the interaction of YFP-p38 with CFP-hsp27 as a suitable approach to study the signaling complex consisting of p38 kinase, Akt, MK2, and hsp27, it should be checked if the fusion proteins, CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38, are part of the complex. Therefore, to see if the fusion proteins are associated with Akt and MK2, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed with either anti-Akt1/2 antibody or the normal IgG in lysate of the cells transiently co-transfected with pEYFP-p38 and pECFP-hsp27. The results are shown in Fig. 2A. The immunoblot probed by anti-GFP antibody in lysate of the cells transfected with CFP-hsp27 or YFP-p38 showed clear existence of CFP or YFP at the position corresponding to CFP-hsp27 or YFP-p38 (see lanes 2 and 3). Analysis of the immunoprecipitate with anti-Akt1/2 antibody from lysate of the CFP-hsp27/YFP-p38-co-transfected cells clearly showed that CFP-hsp27, YFP-p38, and MK2 were complexed with Akt (see lane 5). Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with normal IgG followed by Western blot analysis with anti-GFP and anti-MK2 antibodies revealed no detectable association of these proteins, indicating the specificity of Akt interactions with p38, hsp27, and MK2 (see lanes 4, 6, and 8). It was found that even YFP-fused p38 mutant (YFP-p38AGF) and CFP-fused hsp27-3A were also in the complex (see lanes 7 and 9). The immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that fusion with fluorescent protein does not prevent hsp27 and p38 from forming a complex with Akt and MK2. Same as in L929 cells, analysis of the immunoprecipitate with anti-Akt1/2 antibody in the lysate of the MEF MK2+/+ cells co-transfected with both CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38 clearly showed that CFP-hsp27, YFP-p38, and MK2 were complexed with Akt (see lane 4 in Fig. 2B). However, YFP-p38 could not be detected in the precipitate with anti-Akt1/2 antibody in the MEF MK2-/- cells co-transfected with both CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38 (lane 6 in Fig. 2B). The nonspecific binding of the probed proteins was also checked by the immunoprecipitation with IgG (lanes 3 and 5 in Fig. 2B). Interaction of p38 and hsp27 in Quiescent L929 Cells—Although association of hsp27 with p38 has been demonstrated by immunoprecipitation studies, direct observation of the interaction between these two proteins in intact living cell has not been reported. To conduct such an observation, cells were co-transfected with pECFP-hsp27 and pEYFP-p38. After incubation for 20 h in a CO2 incubator, the cells were imaged on a Leica DM IRE2 confocal laser-scanning microscope thermostatted at 37 °C. The cells co-expressing CFP-hsp27 and YFP-p38 were selected based on double-colored fluorescence. Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence image of cells in CFP, YFP, and FRET channels, respectively. CFP-hsp27 was localized in cytoplasm, whereas YFP-p38 was localized in whole cell but preferably in nucleus. The fluorescence from cytoplasm was clearly detected in the FRET channel after correction for bleed-through of CFP and YFP, indicating a direct interaction between p38 and hsp27 in living cells. To verify energy transfer from the excited hsp27-fused CFP to the p38-fused YFP, the acceptor YFP was photobleached, and the fluorescence intensity of the donor CFP was measured before and after the photobleaching. As Fig. 3B shows, no fluorescence could be detected in the YFP channel, and the fluorescence in the CFP channel increased after the p38-fused YFP was photobleached. The energy transfer efficiency from CFP to YFP was calculated based on the ratio of the cytoplasmic CFP fluorescence intensity of the cell before photobleaching of the YFP to that after photobleaching. The efficiency of 16% was obtained u"
https://openalex.org/W2021637659,"Obscurin (approximately 800 kDa) in striated muscle closely surrounds sarcomeres at the level of the M-band and Z-disk where, we hypothesize, it participates in the assembly of the contractile apparatus and membrane systems required for Ca2+ homeostasis. In this study, we used small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) technology to reduce the levels of obscurin in primary cultures of skeletal myotubes to study its role in myofibrillogenesis and the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). siRNA-treated myotubes showed a specific and dramatic reduction in the approximately 800 kDa form of obscurin by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. M-bands and A-bands, but not Z-disks or I-bands, were disrupted when the synthesis of obscurin was inhibited. Small ankyrin 1, an integral protein of the network SR that binds to obscurin, also failed to align around developing sarcomeres in treated myotubes. Myosin and myomesin levels were significantly reduced in treated myotubes but alpha-actinin was not, suggesting that down-regulation of obscurin destabilizes proteins of the M-band and A-band but not of the Z-disk. Our findings suggest that obscurin is required for the assembly of the M-band and A-band and for the regular alignment of the network SR around the contractile apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2043428491,"Oligomerization and aggregation of alpha-synuclein molecules are believed to play a major role in neuronal dysfunction and loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, alpha-synuclein oligomerization and aggregation have been detected only indirectly in cells using detergent extraction methods. Here, we show for the first time intracellular alpha-synuclein oligomerization using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Two forms of alpha-synuclein homomeric interactions were detected: an antiparallel amino terminus-carboxyl terminus interaction between alpha-synuclein molecules, and a close amino terminus-carboxy terminus interaction within single alpha-synuclein molecules. Coexpression of the chaperone protein Hsp70, which can block alpha-synuclein toxicity in several systems, causes alpha-synuclein to adopt a different, open conformation, but Hsp70 does not alter alpha-synuclein-alpha-synuclein interactions. Thus, the neuroprotective effect of Hsp70 can be explained by its chaperone activity on alpha-synuclein molecules, rather than alteration of alpha-synuclein-alpha-synuclein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1969078685,"Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is a natural nonviral gene transfer system that can mediate long-term transgene expression. Its potential utility in treating organ transplantation-associated long-term complications has not yet been explored. In the present study we generated an improved SB transposon encoding the human gene indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (hIDO), an enzyme that possesses both T cell-suppressive and antioxidant properties and selectively delivered the SB transposon in combination with a hyperactive transposase plasmid to donor lung using the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) as transfection reagent. This nonviral gene therapeutic approach led to persistent and uniform transgene expression in the rat lung tissue without noticeable toxicity and inflammation. Importantly, IDO activity produced by hIDO transgene showed a remarkable therapeutic response, as evident by near normal pulmonary function (peak airway pressure and oxygenation), histological appearance, and reduced collagen content in lung allografts. In addition, we established a hIDO-overexpressing type II cell line using the SB-based gene transfer system and found that hIDO-overexpressing lung cells effectively inhibited transforming growth factor-beta-stimulated fibroblast proliferation in vitro. In summary, the SB-based gene therapy with hIDO represents a new strategy for treating lung transplantation-associated chronic complications, e.g., obliterative bronchiolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2091251219,"We have investigated the glycosylation, disulfide bonding, and subunit structure of mouse TRPM8. To do this, amino-terminal c-myc or hemagglutinin epitope-tagged proteins were incorporated and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These modifications had no obvious effects on channel function in intracellular calcium imaging assays upon application of agonists, icilin or menthol, and cold temperatures. Unmodified TRPM8 migrates with an apparent mass of 129 kDa and can be glycosylated in Chinese hamster ovary cells to give glycoproteins with apparent masses of 136 and 147 kDa. We identified two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in TRPM8 (Asn-821 and Asn-934) and mutated them to show that only the site in the putative pore region at position 934 is modified and that glycosylation of this site is not absolutely necessary for cell surface expression or responsiveness to icilin, menthol, and cool temperatures. Enzymatic cleavage of the carbohydrate chains indicated that they are complex carbohydrate. The glycosylation site is flanked in the pore by two cysteine residues that we mutated, to prove that they are involved in a conserved double cysteine motif, which is essential for channel function. Mutation of either of these cysteines abolishes function and forces the formation of a non-functional complex of the size of a homodimer. The double cysteine mutant is also non-functional.

In mammals, temperature is sensed through primary afferent sensory neurons whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Signals from these cells are transmitted to the spinal cord and then to the brain where they are integrated and deciphered to evoke reflexive and cognitive responses. Growing evidence suggests that the principal molecular thermosensors in the sensory neurons belong to the family of transient receptor potential (TRP) 2The abbreviations used are: TRP, transient receptor potential; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; PFO, perfluorooctanoic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: TRP, transient receptor potential; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; PFO, perfluorooctanoic acid. channels. Six temperature-sensitive TRP channels have been identified so far, four belonging to the TRPV subfamily and sensing heat (TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4) and TRPM8 and TRPA1, which are sensitive to cold temperatures. Some of these channels are also sensitive to compounds that mimic the sensation of heat or cold, for example, TRPV1 responds to capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of “hot” chili pepper, and TRPM8 is sensitive to the cooling compounds menthol and icilin. The properties of TRPV1 have been extensively studied by electrophysiological, pharmacological, and biochemical methods (1Kuzhikandathil E.V. Wang H. Szabo T. Morozova N. Blumberg P.M. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8697-8706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRPM8 was cloned more recently (2Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I.

TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel predominantly expressed in a subpopulation of thermoceptive/nociceptive neurons found in dorsal root ganglia and in trigeminal ganglia. In dorsal root ganglia, TRPM8 is found in 5–10% of neurons that have a small diameter and do not stain with antibodies to neurofilament, CGRP or isolectin B4 or TRPV1 (2Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). In cultured dorsal root ganglia, the expression of TRPM8 and TRPV1 overlaps in about 50% of TRPM8 positive cells if they are grown in the presence of nerve growth factor (4Story G.M. Peier A.M.

Cell. 2003; 112: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). TRPM8 is activated by cold temperature in the innocuous range with a threshold of ∼22 °C, and when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, its response to icilin and cold, but not menthol, is modulated by changes in intracellular pH (5Andersson D.A. Chase H.W. Bevan S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5364-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TRPM8 activity is also influenced by transmembrane voltage (6Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) (7Brauchi S. Orio P. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Analysis of the biochemical properties of TRPM8 protein has been limited to in silico approaches. Hydrophobicity analysis of the protein reveals the presence of six hydrophobic, presumably transmembrane domains and a putative pore region between the last two transmembrane domains, which is presumed to be responsible for its ion permeation properties. In the present study, we address the question of whether TRPM8 undergoes post-translational modifications and investigate the importance of these in TRPM8 expression and function. The role of post-translational modification in members of the TRP family has not been extensively studied. It is known that differences in N-glycosylation pattern in TRPC3 and TRPC6 are responsible for the distinct functional properties of the two genetically closely related cation channels (8Dietrich A.

It is been reported also that TRPV1 (9Jahnel R. Dreger M. Gillen C. Bender O. Kurreck J. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5489-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (10Rosenbaum T.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 4264-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) are N-glycosylated at a single residue when expressed in heterologous systems, but the role of this modification is still unknown. We also examined the possible role of cysteine residues in intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bridges in TRPM8, which have been shown to be implicated in the function of members of this family of channels (12Vyklicky L. Lyfenko A. Susankova K. Teisinger J. Vlachova V. Neuroscience. 2002; 111: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (13Jin Y. Kim D.K. Khil L.Y. Oh U. Kim J. Kwak J. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 369: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To study the effect of post-translational modifications and tertiary and quaternary structure on TRPM8 function, we used a mutagenesis approach where potential motifs for N-glycosylation and cysteine residues were mutated. We also investigated if, by analogy with TRPV1, TRPM8 assembles in homo-tetrameric complexes. We hope that these studies will form the basis of an increased understanding of the important structural features of TRPM8 and the similarities and differences to other members of this intriguing family of proteins. Construction of c-myc-TRPM8 and Hemagglutinin (HA)-TRPM8 Expression Vectors—To enable immunoprecipitation and identification in Western blot experiments, c-myc and HA tags were inserted into the NH2-terminal coding region of TRPM8 using PCR. Mouse TRPM8 cloned in the expression vector pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) was used as template for PCR with the following primers: F1, CTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTGG; R1, GAAGAGAGCTTGCAGCGGGTGC; c-myc_F1, CAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAAGATCTGAACATATGCAAGTGTGGTTATGC; c-myc_R1, CAGATCTTCCTCGCTGATCAGCTTCTGCTCCATGGCCTTGGAGTC; HA_F1, TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCATGGAGAACATATGCAAG; HA_R1, GTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTTGGAGTCTCTGGTAAAGAAGAC (c-myc or HA tag encoding sequence is underlined). PCR modification of the protein was carried out as described (14Phillips E. Reeve A. Bevan S. McIntyre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17165-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the final PCR fragment was digested with NheI-NsiI and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT mouse TRPM8. Site-directed Mutagenesis of TRPM8—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), and sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cells and Transfections—The mouse TRPM8 cell line was generated as described previously (2Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). New constructs were transfected into CHO FRT cells as described previously (2Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Stable transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Lewes, UK) and 250 ng of each DNA together with 2 μg of recombinase-encoding plasmid pOG44. Cell lines expressing TRPM8 mutants were selected and grown in medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin-B (Invitrogen). Transient co-transfections were performed in 100 mm diameter plates with FuGENE 6 reagent and 6 μg of each DNA. Cells were used for co-immunoprecipitation 48 h after transfection. Western Blotting Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK), blocked with TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 10% dried nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-c-myc 9E10 1:5000 or anti-HA clone HA-7 1:5000, Sigma, Poole, UK) in TBS-T and 5% dried nonfat milk for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-T, and incubated with ImmunoPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Perbio Science, Cramlington, UK) in TBS-T and 5% dried nonfat milk for 1 h. The membranes were washed with TBS-T, processed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Perbio Science), and visualized on ECL film (Amersham Biosciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). Surface Biotinylation Assay—Cell-surface expression of TRPM8 was demonstrated by biotinylation of surface proteins on intact CHO cells, followed by solubilization, streptavidin precipitation, and Western blotting. Cells were rinsed in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4)) three times at room temperature then incubated in 2 ml of a solution containing 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Perbio Science) in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed and the reaction quenched by incubation in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine. After two further washes in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated with Immuno-Pure streptavidin beads (Perbio Science) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer without SDS and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 50 mm DTT, 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-c-myc antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation—Pairs of HA or c-myc-tagged mouse TRPM8-encoding constructs were co-transfected into CHO cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Combinations of alternatively HA and c-myc-tagged C929A, C940A wild type TRPM8 were co-expressed for pulldown experiments. 48 h after transfection cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed on 0.5 mg of total protein lysate overnight at 4 °C using monoclonal anti-HA-agarose conjugate (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-c-myc antibody as described above. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and PNGase Digestion—10 μgof total proteins from CHO expressing unmodified mouse TRPM8 or mutant N934Q were boiled for 10 min at 100 °C in presence of 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% SDS. Digestion was performed in a total volume of 35 μl with 0.2 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) in the presence of 50 mm sodium citrate or 0.03 unit of peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 50 mm sodium phosphate and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 2 h at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-c-myc antibody as described above. Perfluoro-octanoic Acid (PFO)-PAGE—PFO-PAGE was performed using the method described by Ramjeesingh et al. (15Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Total cell lysate from CHO cells expressing c-myc-TRPM8 construct was prepared in PBS using an homogenizer (Omni International Inc., Marietta, GA) for 10 s at maximum speed and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed. 15 μg of lysate was mixed with doubly concentrated sample buffer (100 mm Tris base, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue (pH 8.0)) and NaPFO (Sigma) was added to 0.8% (w/v). After 30 min at room temperature samples were electrophoresed on 5% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) using PFO running buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% (w/v) PFO (pH 8.5)). The transfer and immunostaining were performed as described above. Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) in cell populations was measured by fluorescence using a Flexstation (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were plated in 96-well plates (Corning, NY) at an approximate density of 25,000 cells per well and grown overnight. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for ∼1 h in the presence of 2.5 mm probenecid and 0.01% pluronic F-127 at 37 °C. Loading and experiments were performed in HEPES buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). Emission intensity at 520 nm was measured at intervals of 4 or 5 s, using excitation wavelengths of 380 and 340 nm. The [Ca2+]i in groups of individual cells was measured using a fluorescent microscope-based system. Cells were grown on glass cover slips covered with poly-d-lysine, loaded with Fura-2 AM as described above, and then placed in a laminar flow perfusion chamber and continuously perfused with HEPES buffer. Cold stimuli were applied locally (flow rate approximately 3 ml min–1) via a fine pipette positioned very close to the cells being studied. Cold stimulation consisted of a linear decrease in perfusate temperature from 36 to 12 °C at a constant rate of 1 °C per second, controlled by a regulated Peltier device (Marlow Industries, Dallas, TX). The temperature of the perfusate was monitored by a thermocouple positioned in the tip of the pipette and temperature traces recorded on a chart recorder. Images of a group of cells were captured every 2 s with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission measured at 520 nm using a PTI imaging system (South Brunswick, NJ). Analysis of ratios of emission intensity at 340 nm/380 nm excitation in individual cells was determined using the PTI ImageMaster software. Agonists—(–)-Menthol was from Sigma, and icilin was from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). Calculation and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. for the number of experiments indicated (n). Curve fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Ltd.). Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test for differences or using and equivalence test where no difference was expected between groups (16Lew M.J. Trends Pharmacol. 2006; 27: 274-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). TRPM8 Tagged with c-myc or HA Retains Activity—To facilitate identification of mouse TRPM8 protein, we inserted either a c-myc or a HA epitope tag in the NH2 terminus of mouse TRPM8, 14 amino acids after the initiating methionine. The resulting constructs were expressed in CHO cells and could be detected readily in a Western blot (Fig. 1A). Intracellular calcium measurements showed that the insertion of either epitope tag does not modify the responsiveness of the receptor to agonists, icilin and menthol, and cold (Fig. 1, B and C). TRPM8 Is a Glycoprotein—Western blotting of recombinant mouse TRPM8 in denaturing polyacrylamide gels showed a strong signal at 147 kDa and a weaker one at 136 kDa (Fig. 1A), which were larger than the size predicted from cDNA sequence of the tagged protein of 129 kDa. The higher molecular mass bands are likely to be due to glycosylation. To verify the presence of potential glycosylation motifs, we compared the predicted sequence of the mouse, rat, and human TRPM8 proteins and searched for conserved NXS/T motifs (where X is any amino acid except proline) and found asparagine within conserved motifs at positions Asn-821 and Asn-934 (Fig. 2). To test whether these motifs were glycosylated, we mutated the asparagine to glutamine at each site, expressed the resulting recombinant protein in CHO cells, and performed Western analysis on extracted proteins. Mutation of site Asn-821 made no difference to the observed pattern of bands upon Western blotting however mutation of site Asn-934 resulted in a single band of 129 kDa molecular mass that corresponds to the predicted size of unmodified TRPM8 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Analysis of glycosylation pattern of wild type TRPM8 and mutants.

C, cell-surface biotinylation assay of c-myc-tagged wild type TRPM8, N821Q, and N934Q mutants expressed in CHO cells. Cell-surface proteins were biotinylated and immunoprecipitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” D, agonist dose-response curves for icillin and menthol of c-myc-tagged TRPM8 and N934Q expressed in CHO cells. Data are expressed as the percentage of the maximal [Ca2+]i response (±S.E.; n = 8). E, response of c-myc-tagged TRPM8 and N934Q to cold. Data are expressed as the mean of the maximal [Ca2+]i response (±S.E.) from four independent experiments with 30–40 individual cells each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional analysis of TRPM8 and the N934Q mutant showed no significant difference in responses to menthol (p < 0.05) or icilin (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). The calculated pEC50 for menthol is 4.02 ± 0.35 and 3.81 ± 0.27 (n = 8) and for icilin is 6.37 ± 0.17 and 6.33 ± 0.25 (n = 6) for the c-myc-TRPM8 and N934Q mutant constructs, respectively. Analysis of [Ca2+]i increase due to cold activation showed that this mutant responds to cold with a threshold of activation similar to wild type (∼22 °C), but the amplitude of the response is generally smaller (Fig. 3E). We further investigated the pattern of N-glycosylation at position Asn-934 to determine whether it was susceptible to hydrolysis using Endo H or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Endo H cleaves between the two N-acetylglucosamine residues in the chitobiose core of N-linked high mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides, whereas PNGase F cleaves the amide bond between the asparagine and the first N-acetylglucosamine residue of all types of glycoproteins (17Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The N-glycosyl carbohydrate of mouse TRPM8 was not sensitive to Endo H hydrolysis whereas enzymatic digestion with PNGase F reduced the molecular mass to ∼130 kDa, close to the size predicted from the cDNA sequence. Neither enzyme affected the migration of the N934Q mutant (Fig. 3B). We concluded that position N821 is not significantly glycosylated, whereas position Asn-934 is a site of N-glycosylation. To test whether the reduced responsiveness of mutant N934Q to cold could be the result of a less efficient trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface, we performed a surface biotinylation assay. Mutant N934Q appears to have lower levels of cell-surface expression compared with wild type TRPM8 and N821Q mutant, and this could be related to the glycosylation state of the protein (Fig. 3C). We noticed that only the most heavily glycosylated form of TRPM8 (147 kDa) is expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 3C, pull-down fraction), whereas the less heavily glycosylated form of 136 kDa is not efficiently transported to the cell surface (Fig. 3C, post pulldown fraction). The TRPM8 Pore Contains Two Essential Cysteines—Comparison of the predicted protein sequence of TRPM8 from mouse, rat, and human reveals the presence of two conserved cysteine residues flanking the glycosylation site Asn-934 in the putative pore region, at positions Cys-929 and Cys-940 of the mouse TRPM8 (Fig. 2). To see if these cysteines are essential for channel activity and if they are normally linked by disulfide bonds, we mutated them to alanine both individually and together. Functional analysis of the clones showed that the presence of two cysteines in the pore is essential for responses to icilin or menthol (supplemental Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of the single mutants and the double mutant along with the unmutated form of TRPM8 showed that all of the TRPM8 variants are expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 4A). Non-denaturing gels show that the single cysteine mutants are capable of forming disulfide bonds to give a protein complex of the predicted size of a dimer (Fig. 4B). Surface biotinylation assay of the mutants shows that they are expressed on the cell surface at a level comparable with that of the wild type TRPM8, demonstrating that cysteines in the pore are not essential for transport of TRPM8 to the cell surface (Fig. 4C). Investigation of the glycosylation patterns of normal and mutant TRPM8 proteins by Western blotting reveals that TRPM8 and the C929A/C940A double mutant have similar migration patterns, whereas the C929A and the C940A mutants show weaker expression of the higher molecular mass glycosylated form of 147 kDa compared with the smaller glycosylated form of 136 kDa (Fig. 4A). Thus, the unpaired cysteines affect the degree and type of N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under non-reducing conditions, TRPM8 migrates as a monomer so we conclude that these cysteine residues are not normally responsible for intermolecular disulfide bridging. However, when either cysteine is mutated, a band corresponding to the size of a dimer is detectable, suggesting that a proportion of TRPM8 may be forced into a disulfide-bridged homo-dimer form. As expected, simultaneous mutation of both cysteines in the pore prevents putative dimers from forming (Fig. 4B). This suggests that under normal circumstances, these cysteines are likely to be either reduced or involved in an intramolecular disulfide bridge within the putative pore-forming loop of TRPM8. In an attempt to determine whether the high molecular mass band appearing under non-reducing condition in the single cysteine mutants is a homodimer, we co-transfected CHO cells with TRPM8 mutants tagged with either HA or c-myc. Thus, C929A tagged with either HA or c-myc, C940A tagged with either c-myc or HA, and unmutated TRPM8 with either tags were expressed and co-immunoprecipitated from CHO lysates to see if TRPM8 C929A and C940A could form a dimer that is not present in unmutated TRPM8. Upon pull-down of the tagged TRPM8 a band migrating with the mass of TRPM8 was visible for all constructs (Fig. 4D). Thus, there is strong self-association of TRPM8 subunits that is not cysteine-dependent, and this prevents observation of any disulfide bonding homodimer in this experiment. Since the essential conserved cysteine motif flanks the glycosylation site in the putative pore region, our data suggest that the cysteine residues may be able to form an intramolecular disulfide bond to create a loop within the putative pore-forming region of TRPM8 with a complex carbohydrate N-linked to its apex (Fig. 5). TRPM8 Forms a Homotetrameric Complex—To investigate the quaternary structure of TRPM8, we used a gel analysis technique that gently disrupts the plasma membrane with a weak detergent (PFO) while maintaining weak interactions between proteins before and during electrophoresis. PFO gel analysis of TRPM8 protein expressed in CHO cells reveals the presence of multimeric forms of the ion channel (Fig. 6). Careful size determination indicated proteins of 128 and 153, 303, 434, 520 kDa, which is consistent with the size expected for TRPM8 protein in the monomeric (both glycosylated forms) dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric forms. We analyzed wild type and all the mutants forms of TRPM8 by PFO-PAGE and found that all are able to form dimers, trimers, and tetramers despite the fact that some of them are non-functional (data not shown). These data show that neither glycosylation nor perturbation of the double cysteine motif modulate multimerization of TRPM8 in the PFO gel system. We have characterized the multimeric structure and the impact of post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, on the structure and function of TRPM8. This ion channel is gated by cooling compounds, such as icilin and menthol, and temperatures below 23 °C and may act as a coincidence detector of multiple sensory stimuli like the polymodal heat receptor, TRPV1 (2Peier A.M.

Here, we observed that a subpopulation of microglial cells expressed CD34 and B220 antigens during brain development. We thus hypothesized that microglia, or a subset of microglial cells, originate from blood circulating CD34+/B220+ myeloid progenitors, which could target the brain under developmental or neuroinflammatory conditions. Using experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model of chronic neuroinflammation, we found that a discrete population of CD34+/B220+ cells expands in both blood and brain of diseased animals. In EAE mice, intravenous transfer experiments showed that macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) -expanded CD34+ myeloid progenitors target the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) while keeping their immature phenotype. Based on these results, we then assessed whether CD34+/B220+ cells display in vitro differentiation potential toward microglia. For this purpose, CD34+/B220+ cells were sorted from M-CSF-stimulated bone marrow (BM) cultures and exposed to a glial cell conditioned medium. Under these experimental conditions, CD34+/B220+ cells were able to differentiate into microglial-like cells showing the morphological and phenotypic features of native microglia. Overall, our data suggest that under developmental or neuroinflammatory conditions, a subpopulation of microglial cells derive from CNS-invading CD34+/B220+ myeloid progenitors."

In this study we have found that loss of Lin-7 protein from the polarized epithelial cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney II by small hairpin RNA results in defects in tight junction formation as indicated by lowered transepithelial electrical resistance and mislocalization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 after calcium switch. The knock down of Lin-7 also resulted in the loss of expression of several Lin-7 binding partners, including PALS1 and the polarity protein PATJ. The effects of Lin-7 knock down were rescued by the exogenous expression of murine Lin-7 constructs that contained the L27 domain, but not the PDZ domain alone. Furthermore, exogenously expressed PALS1, but not other Lin-7 binding partners, also rescued the effects of Lin-7 knock down, including the restoration of PATJ protein in rescued cell lines. Finally, the effects of Lin-7 knock down appeared to be due to instability of PALS1 protein in the absence of Lin-7, as indicated by an increased rate of PALS1 protein degradation.

Taken together, these results indicate that Lin-7 functions in tight junction formation by stabilizing its membrane-associated guanylate kinase binding partner PALS1. Polarization of mammalian epithelia is characterized by the asymmetrical partitioning of proteins to specific membrane domains. The cellular boundary of the apical and basolateral membranes in polarized epithelia is demarcated by the tight junction that forms a fence between the two membrane compartments. Junctions within and between cells are defined by the localization of, and interactions between, specific protein complexes. The interaction of these proteins is mediated by evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction domains. Many studies have shown an important role for PDS-95/Discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins in tight junctions and the polarized localization of proteins (1Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J.

Mutation in any one of these genes led to a vulva-less phenotype, presumably due to mistargeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (3Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K.

Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Lin-7 binds to Lin-2 via an L27 domain (12Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, it is important to note that Lin-10 is not associated with Lin-2 and Lin-7 in mammalian epithelial cells (13Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recent work in mammalian cells as well as Drosophila has identified additional binding partners for the Lin-7 L27 domain. The L27 domain of Lin-7 has been demonstrated to bind a family of MAGUK proteins highly related to Lin-2, collectively referred to as PALS or Proteins Associated with Lin Seven (14Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The archetype for these proteins is known as PALS1 in mammalian cells and Stardust in Drosophila. PALS1/Stardust contains several protein interaction motifs, including two adjacent L27 domains, and binds to Lin-7 via the L27 domain nearer its carboxyl terminus (L27C) (15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal L27 domain (L27N) of PALS1/Stardust binds to the polarity protein PATJ (15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Additionally, the PDZ domain of PALS1/Stardust binds to the carboxyl terminus of Crumbs, an apical transmembrane protein (16Makarova O. Roh M.H. Liu C.J. Laurinec S. Margolis B. Gene. 2003; 302: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Hong Y. Stronach B. Perrimon N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 2001; 414: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Studies in mammalian and invertebrate systems have shown an important role for the Crumbs-PALS1-PATJ complex in polarity determination in epithelial cells (19Shin K. Fogg V.C. Margolis B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In turn, these proteins bind to the highly evolutionarily conserved Par3-Par6-atypical protein kinase C polarity effector complex via an interaction between PALS1 and Crumbs with Par6 (20Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 21Lemmers C. Michel D. Lane-Guermonprez L. Delgrossi M.H. Medina E. Arsanto J.P. Le Bivic A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the loss of PATJ or PALS1 via RNA interference knock down leads to loss of polarization of epithelial cells under certain experimental conditions (22Straight S.W. Shin K. Fogg V.C. Fan S. Liu C.J. Roh M. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Shin K. Straight S.W. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, the loss of these proteins results in defects in tight junction formation. Although PALS1 binds to Lin-7, the exact role of Lin-7 in tight junction formation and polarity determination by these proteins remains unclear. As mentioned, Lin-7 also binds to other MAGUK proteins related to Lin-2 and PALS1, including PALS2, DLG2, and DLG3 (14Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The role of these other Lin-7 binding partners in protein targeting and epithelial polarization is still unclear, although some clues have been provided by studies of invertebrate systems (24Konig C. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J. Wendler S. Campos-Ortega J.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Bachmann A. Timmer M. Sierralta J. Pietrini G. Gundelfinger E.D. Knust E. Thomas U. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1899-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).It is not clear at this time why Lin-7 binds to several mammalian MAGUK proteins. Recent reports of Lin-7 knock-out mice indicate Lin-7 might not be crucial for epithelial morphogenesis (26Olsen O. Moore K.A. Fukata M. Kazuta T. Trinidad J.C. Kauer F.W. Streuli M. Misawa H. Burlingame A.L. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Accordingly, further work on the exact roles of Lin-7 is indicated. In this study, we examined the role of Lin-7 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. After stable transfection of the mammalian epithelial cell line MDCKII with Lin-7 small hairpin RNA (shRNA), we found that the resulting loss of Lin-7 correlated with the loss of expression of several Lin-7-binding proteins, including PALS1. The loss of these polarity proteins resulted in defects in tight junction formation in the Lin-7 knockdown cell lines. From these data, we hypothesize that Lin-7 is essential for the stable expression of several MAGUK family members that are in turn required for proper formation of tight junctions in mammalian epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—To create the shRNA constructs, two 19-base pair sites within canine Lin-7C were chosen, and pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen custom primers. These oligonucleotides contained the following target sequences: 5′-GGCTCGGTGAAGCTGGTGG-3′, corresponding to the amino acids NH3-GSVKLVCOOH, and 5′-GGCCACAGTGGCAGCCTTC-3′, corresponding to the amino acids NH3-ATVAAF-COOH. These sequences were checked for significant homology to other genes in the canine genome data base, and none was found. The sense and antisense sequences were separated by a 9-base pair loop region, and each oligonucleotide was terminated with restriction endonuclease half-sites. After annealing the complementary oligonucleotides, the dimers were ligated into the pre-cut pSilencer 2.0-U6/neomycin plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX) as directed by the manufacturer, followed by amplification of the resulting plasmids. All plasmid sequences were verified by automated sequencing at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core.The various rescue plasmids used in this study express Myc-tagged constructs from a cytomegalovirus promoter in the plasmid pRK5-myc and contain the human or murine gene indicated in the text and figures.

In the case of the murine Lin-7 contructs, these contained such significant differences in their RNA sequence as to be unaffected by the canine Lin-7-targeted shRNA constructs.Cell Culture and Transfection—MDCKII cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. All cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. To create the cell lines stably expressing shRNA constructs, MDCKII cells were transfected with 5 μgof plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were transfected with either construct individually or with a mixture of the two constructs to create cell lines. After selection with 500 μg of active G418/ml (Invitrogen) for 14 days, surviving clones were isolated for the generation of cell lines. These lines were screened for loss of Lin-7 expression by both immunostaining and Western blot analysis using affinity purified anti-Lin-7 sera.Rescue clones were created by co-transfection of the C19 and C20 shRNA Lin-7 lines with 5 μg of the Myc-tagged rescue plasmid and 0.5 μg of zeocin resistance plasmid, followed by selection with 200 μg of zeocin/ml (Invitrogen) for 14 days and the isolation of cell lines. Clones were screened for the expression of the Myc-tagged protein and the maintained loss of endogenous Lin-7 expression using both immunostaining and Western blot analysis.For immunostaining or calcium switch assays, MDCKII cell lines were seeded at confluence onto 12- or 24-mm Transwell clear polyester filters (Corning Inc.; Corning, NY) in low calcium medium (with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 5 μm Ca2+). After allowing the cells to adhere to the substrate overnight, the non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing with PBS and the medium was replaced with normal growth medium. The cells were then grown at least 72 h so that a tightly packed columnar epithelial monolayer was formed.Calcium Switch Assay and Transepithelial Electrical Resistance Measurement—MDCKII cell lines were grown to confluence on 24-mm Transwell filters and were then washed extensively with PBS and grown in low calcium medium overnight to dissociate cell-cell contacts. The low calcium medium was replaced the next day with normal growth medium (containing 1.8 μm Ca2+), and the cells were prepared for immunostaining at various times afterward (typically 0, 3, 6, or 29 h).To measure the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) a similar experiment was performed using 12-mm Transwell filters. The TER was determined with a Millicell-ERS volt-ohm meter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) immediately after the addition of normal growth medium (time = 0) and at 30-60-min intervals for up to 48 h. Prior to each measurement, the Millicell was “zeroed” according to the manufacturer's directions and the background resistance was determined using cell-free filters. Each cell line was measured in triplicate, background was subtracted, and the means and the S.D. from the means (n = 3) for each time point were plotted using Microsoft Excel.Antibodies—Lin-7 (UM199)-, Lin-2 (UM195 and UM196)-, PALS1 (UM349)-, PATJ (UM356)-, and CRB3 (UM369)-specific antisera were generated in rabbits and affinity purified as previously described (5Borg J.P.

Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies used for immunofluorescence were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used in immunoblotting were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MDCKII cell lysates were prepared from confluent 15-cm dishes with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture) (Sigma) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. A portion of the lysate was reserved, mixed with LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen), and used as input.For immunoprecipitation, 1-5 ml of antibody was mixed with 200 μl of lysate and 50 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; San Francisco, CA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold HNTG and resuspended in LDS loading buffer.Samples were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE NOVEX gels (Invitrogen) in MOPS-SDS running buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in Bicine-MeOH. The transfer efficiency was assessed by staining with 0.5% Ponceau S red in 10% acetic acid, and then the membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem; San Diego, CA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The membranes were incubated with primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 2 h at room temperature and then washed with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody in 5% skimmed milk/TBS for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS. Protein bands were visualized using ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).CRB3 Peptide Beads—CRB3 peptide-coupled agarose beads were created using the SulfoLink Coupling gel kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and were linked via a terminal cysteine residue added to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of CRB3 (wild type, NH3-CARVPPTPNLKLPPEERLI-COOH) or the same sequence missing the terminal ERLI. The CRB3 peptides were synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein Structure Facility.For the CRB3 peptide bead pulldown assays, 20 μl of 50% slurry of CRB3 peptide beads were added to 200 μl of cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold HNTG (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCL, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and resuspended in LDS loading buffer. Samples were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE NOVEX gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for Western blotting as described above for immunoprecipitations.Pulse-Chase Labeling—The rate of degradation of PALS1 protein was determined using a pulse-chase protocol. MDCKII cell lines grown to confluence on 15-cm dishes were incubated for 2 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then pulse labeled for 1 h at 37°C by the addition of 250 mCi/ml 35S-Easytag Express label (PerkinElmer). Unincorporated label was washed away, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0-12 h in complete growth medium. Cell lysates were collected and utilized as described above for immunoprecipitation. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was fixed in 30% methanol/10% acetic acid, soaked for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and dried. Densitometry was performed using a Molecular Dynamics laser scanner, model STORM860, and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Each sample was prepared in triplicate (n = 3) so that the standard deviation from the means could be determined.Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on Transwell filters were cut from the support with a scalpel, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with either 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS or 1% SDS/PBS for 15 min, and then blocked with 2% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. The filters were then incubated with primary antibodies in goat serum/PBS for overnight at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. After washing extensively with goat serum/PBS, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies in goat serum/PBS were added overnight at 4 °C. Finally, filters were washed with PBS and mounted onto glass slides using ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).All images were obtained using an Olympus FluoView 500 confocal laser-scanning confocal microscope at the Morphology and Image Analysis Core of the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center. Samples were scanned with appropriate lasers and filter sets, and images were collected at 0.5-μm intervals on an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope using a ×100 oil objective. FluoView v4.3 software was used to collect images, and subsequent preparation was performed using Adobe Creative Suite software.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Messenger RNA from cell lines was isolated following the manufacturer's protocol found in the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was reversed transcribed from isolated mRNA by Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix (Invitrogen) according to the published protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix UDG with Rox (Invitrogen) in an Applied Biosystem 7300 real-time PCR system with the following parameters: 50 °C (2 min), 95 °C (10 min), 40 cycles of 95 °C (15 s), 54 °C (30 s), 72 °C (1 min), followed by a dissociation cycle to verify one product by melting curve analysis. Primers to desired amplicons were designed using PerlPrimer software (27Marshall O.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2471-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and are as follows: Canis familiaris Lin-7C (5′-GCC TTA CAA AGA GTC CTT CA-3′ (forward)), (5′-TGA TGT CCA CAG TCT CAT AG-3′ (reverse)); C. familiaris PALS1 (5′-TAG AAC CCT TTA CAG ATG AGA G-3′ (forward)), (5′-ACT ATC CGA CTA ATG ATG ACA G-3′ (reverse)); C. familiaris glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-ATT CTA TCC ACG GCA AAT CC-3′ (forward)), (5′-GGA CTC CAC AAC ATA CTC AG-3′(reverse)). Primer pairs were validated by subjecting the quantitative PCR reactions to agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of single products at the expected size. In addition, each amplicon was sequenced to verify its identity. Experimental samples were performed in duplicate. Results were compiled from two independent experiments.RESULTSLin-7 shRNA Affects the Formation of Tight Junctions—Previous work from our group had shown that MDCKII cells, a canine kidney-derived epithelial cell line, express only one of the three Lin-7 genes, Lin-7C (13Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lin-7B is not expressed in the kidney tubule (28Olsen O. Wade J.B. Morin N. Bredt D.S. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F345-F352Google Scholar); Lin-7A is larger than Lin-7C, and this size is not seen on Western blotting of MDCKII cell lysates with anti-Lin-7 antibodies (13Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated shRNA expression plasmids to specifically target the canine Lin-7C sequence (Fig. 1A) based on the genomic information available in the public data base. These shRNA constructs had several mismatches with mouse Lin-7C allowing for eventual rescue of the phenotype using murine Lin-7 constructs (Fig. 1A). We chose two different shRNA constructs (shRNA 1 and shRNA 2, respectively) and transfected them into MDCKII cells separately and in combination in order to knock down the endogenous expression of Lin-7. We isolated several stable cell lines, including both controls, that exhibited little or no knock down (clones 1, 12, and 21), and Lin-7 knockdown clones that had greatly reduced expression of Lin-7 (Fig. 1B, clones 6, 10, 17, 19, and 20). Immunostaining with affinity-purified anti-Lin-7 antibodies confirmed markedly reduced Lin-7 at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1C). In contrast, E-cadherin was correctly localized to lateral cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Lin-7 shRNA had little or no effect on the integrity of adherens junctions.We next tested the MDCKII cell lines for the formation of tight junctions using a calcium switch assay in which cells were placed in low calcium medium overnight to dissociate the cells by breaking adherens junctions, followed by the readdition of calcium to allow the MDCKII cells to form junctions. Tight junction function is measured by the establishment of TER. Cell lines in which Lin-7 had been knocked down had markedly abnormal TER profiles (Fig. 2A, solid lines) compared with wild-type and control cells (dashed lines). However, Western blotting indicated no change in expression of several tight junction component proteins including claudin-1, claudin-4, and occludin in cells with or without Lin-7 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, immunostaining of the MDCKII cells that had been grown on filters for 7 days showed that the tight junction marker proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 were similarly localized in both control and Lin-7 knockdown cell lines (results not shown). However, using the calcium switch assay, abnormal, incomplete localization of ZO-1 was observed in the Lin-7 knockdown cells (Fig. 2C) in contrast to control cells. In conjunction with the TER data, this suggests that Lin-7 plays a role in the formation of tight junctions and the loss of Lin-7 expression results in a delay in tight junction formation during polarization.FIGURE 2Lin-7 shRNA affects tight junction formation in polarizing MDCKII cells.

https://openalex.org/W2067133971,"Tor1,2 control of type 2A-related phosphatase activities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been reported to be responsible for the regulation of Gln3 phosphorylation and intracellular localization in response to the nature of the nitrogen source available. According to the model, excess nitrogen stimulates Tor1,2 to phosphorylate Tip41 and/or Tap42. Tap42 then complexes with and inactivates Sit4 phosphatase, thereby preventing it from dephosphorylating Gln3. Phosphorylated Gln3 complexes with Ure2 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. When Tor1,2 kinase activities are inhibited by limiting nitrogen, or rapamycin-treatment, Tap42 can no longer complex with Sit4. Active Sit4 dephosphorylates Gln3, which can then localize to the nucleus and activate transcription. The paucity of experimental data directly correlating active Sit4 and Pph3 with Gln3 regulation prompted us to assay Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and intracellular localization in isogenic wild type, sit4, pph3, and sit4pph3 deletion strains. We found that Sit4 actively brought about Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation in both good (glutamine or ammonia) and poor (proline) nitrogen sources. This Sit4 activity masked nitrogen source-dependent changes in Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation which were clearly visible when SIT4 was deleted. The extent of Sit4 requirement for Gln3 nuclear localization was both nitrogen source- and strain-dependent. In some strains, Sit4 was not even required for Gln3 nuclear localization in untreated or rapamycin-treated, proline-grown cells or Msx-treated, ammonia-grown cells.

Applications of clinically important derivatives of the antiinflammatory and anti-neoplastic drug rapamycin have steadily grown in concert with our increased understanding of how cellular processes are regulated by their target, mTor (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) (1Schluter M.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GATA family transcription activator, Gln3 is widely used as a reporter in studies investigating Tor function (5Thomas G. Sabatini D. Hall M.N. TOR: Target of Rapamycin: Current Topics in Microbiology & Immunology. 279. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004Google Scholar, 6Inoki K. Ouyang H. Li Y. Guan K.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

A major function of Gln3 is to activate Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) 2The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; Msx, l-methionine sulfoximine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. -sensitive transcription needed to exploit poor nitrogen sources in the environment when nothing better is available (biology reviewed in Refs. 7Hofman-Bang J.

In the presence of good nitrogen sources (e.g. glutamine or ammonia in some strains) genes encoding permeases and enzymes required for the transport and degradation of poor nitrogen sources (e.g. proline) are minimally expressed. In contrast, when good nitrogen sources are limiting or only poor sources are available, expression of these genes increases (7Hofman-Bang J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Magasanik B. Kaiser C.A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Two pivotal observations opened a new era of investigation into the mechanisms regulating Gln3 function. (i) During times of high NCR, GATA sequences (binding sites for Gln3 and Gat1/Nil1) in the promoter of an NCR-sensitive gene (CAN1) are unoccupied by Gln3 and Gat1, and thus available to serve as surrogate TATA-binding protein (TBP) binding sites (12Cox K.H.

Gln3 and Gat1 occupancy of CAN1 GATA sequences correlates with Gln3 and Gat1 localization to the cytoplasm of cells in which NCR-sensitive transcription is low, and to their nuclei when expression is high (12Cox K.H.

(ii) Treating YPD-grown wildtype cells with rapamycin induces Gln3 dephosphorylation, Gln3 nuclear localization and high level NCR-sensitive transcription. In contrast, Gln3 is phosphorylated, localizes to the cytoplasm, and NCR-sensitive transcription is low in similarly grown, untreated cells (14Beck T. Hall M.N.

The above correlations along with the protein-protein association and phosphorylation relationships between Tor1,2, Tap42, Tip41, Sit4, and Sit4-associated proteins (Saps), led to a proposal describing Tor1,2 regulation of Gln3 phosphorylation via control of the type 2A-related protein phosphatases, Sit4 and/or Pph3 (Fig. 1) (5Thomas G.

A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In bare outline, the model posits that signals of nitrogen excess (glutamine or a metabolite of it) are sensed by Tor1,2, which become active and phosphorylate Tap42 and/or Tip41 (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The outcome of these phosphorylations is the association of Tap42 with Sit4, thereby inactivating the phosphatase (18Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 20Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this inactive form, Sit4 is unable to dephosphorylate Gln3, resulting in its sequestration in the cytoplasm as a Gln3·Ure2 complex (Fig. 1) (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol.

When cells are treated with rapamycin, or the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine (Msx), which inhibits the synthesis of glutamine, Tor1,2 are inhibited and cease phosphorylating Tap42. Dephosphorylated Tap42 dissociates from Sit4 thereby allowing Sit4 to be active and dephosphorylate Gln3, resulting in or permitting Gln3 to dissociate from Ure2 and enter the nucleus (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol.

Experimentally, Sit4 was first implicated in Gln3 regulation by the demonstration that neither rapamycin-induced Gln3 nuclear localization, nor dephosphorylation occurred in a YPD-grown sit4 mutant (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In a subsequent report, rapamycin was observed to induce modestly less GAP1 expression in a pph3 mutant than wild type, implicating the second type 2A-related phosphatase in Gln3 regulation (17Bertram P.G.

Most recently, Msx-induced Gln3 nuclear localization was reported not to occur in a sit4 mutant growing in S.D. medium (22Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although impressive progress has been made in identifying additional proteins involved in Tor1,2 global influence on cellular processes, several observations do not fit comfortably with expectations generated by the model (23Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005. 2005; 102: 16537-16538Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among them are: (i) In genetic studies, Tap42 behaves more like a positive than a negative regulator of Sit4 (18Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). (ii) Sit4 association with Tap42 is required for Sit4 activity (18Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T.

(iii) Detectable Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and intracellular localization do not correlate with one another in good versus poor nitrogen sources, during nitrogen starvation, following Msx treatment, and beyond 30 min of rapamycin treatment (26Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (iv) Msx increases Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation whereas rapamycin decreases it even though both inhibitors elicit nuclear localization of Gln3-Myc13 (27Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As noted in Fig. 1, type 2A-related Sit4 (and Pph3) protein phosphatase activities have been proposed to directly regulate Gln3 phosphorylation and localization (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The correlations upon which this conclusion rests are the failure of Gln3 dephosphorylation, nuclear localization, and NCR-sensitive transcription to occur in YPD-grown, rapamycin-treated sit4 cells. There are, however, several important gaps in our understanding of Sit4 participation in the Tor1,2 control pathway regulating Gln3: (i) Is Sit4 required for Gln3 dephosphorylation and/or nuclear accumulation of Gln3 when cells are provided with a poor nitrogen source or treated with Msx?, (ii) Is Sit4 inactive under conditions where Gln3 is restricted to the cytoplasm (i.e. nitrogen excess)? (iii) What are the relative requirements of Sit4 and Pph3 for Gln3 dephosphorylation and nuclear localization in response to growth with various nitrogen sources, rapamycin and Msx treatment? (iv) Does the Tap42-Sit4-requirement for Gln3 regulation found in some instances but not others reflect strain-specific differences when experiments are performed under identical conditions (14Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 15Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C. Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar)? To fill in some of the gaps in our understanding of type 2A-related phosphatases and their relationship to Gln3 regulation, we performed a systematic analysis of Gln3 phosphorylation and intracellular localization, comparing these parameters in wild type, single and double sit4 and pph3 mutant cells. Our data demonstrate that: (i) Sit4 is active with respect to Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation levels under conditions of excess nitrogen in which Tor1,2 are active, (ii) Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation is nitrogen source-dependent in a sit4Δ, indicating that Sit4 activity is unlikely to be the major determinant responsible for nitrogen-dependent changes in Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation, (iii) rapamycin-induced alteration of Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation levels requires Sit4, whereas alterations elicited by Msx or the nitrogen source do not, (iv) the extent of the Sit4 requirement for Msx- and rapamycin-induced nuclear localization of Gln3-Myc13 is nitrogen source-dependent, (v) the Sit4 requirement for nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization is strain dependent, and (vi) demonstrable Pph3 influence on Gln3 regulation was minimal compared with that of Sit4. Strains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in YNB (without amino acids or ammonium sulfate) medium, containing 2% glucose, required auxotrophic supplements (120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 20 μg/ml arginine, and the nitrogen source (0.1% final concentration) indicated. YPD medium consisted of 10 g yeast extract, 20 g bactopeptone, and 20 g dextrose per 1000 ml. Rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added to the cultures, where indicated, to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml for 20 or 30 min prior to cell harvest.

Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The kanMX or natMX cassettes, flanked by about 500 bp corresponding to the promoter and terminator regions of the target genes, were synthesized by a two-step PCR procedure (primer coordinates are in Table 1). DNA fragments (blunt-ended PCR products) containing the various constructs were used to transform the appropriate strains. Transformants were selected on YPD medium containing 200 μg per ml of geneticin or 100 μg per ml of nourseothricin. Correct targeting of the deletions was verified by PCR analysis, using whole cells as the source of template DNA and two sets of primers: (i) a primer 5′ of the deletion cassette, a second at the 5′-end of the Kan gene, and a third at the beginning of the coding sequence of the gene that was deleted, and (ii) a primer at the 3′-end of the Kan gene, a second at the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the deleted gene, and a third 3′ of the deletion cassette. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted as described earlier (34Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Foury and Talibi (35Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DIG-DNA probes of about 500 bp were generated by PCR, using primers: 5′-CATAACCAGTTGGTGAGCCC-3′ and 5′-ACCCCCGTTACTGTATGTGG-3′ for SIT4, 5′-TGGGCGATTTTGTGGATAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCACTAATCCACCGTCG-3′ for PPH3, 5′-AAACAGCAAGAAAGTCCACTGG-3′ and 5′-ACCTCTTAATCTTCTAGCCAAC-3′ for HHT1, and labeled using a PCR DIG (digoxigenin) probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were carried out according to standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Detection of DIG-labeled nucleic acids was performed by enzyme immunoassay with luminescence following the suppliers procedure (Roche Applied Science). The Hybond-N+ nylon membranes were exposed 120 min and analyzed with a chemiluminescence camera (Chemi-Smart from Vilbert-Lourmat). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested by the filtration method of Tate et al. (27Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and crude cell extracts prepared as described by Cox et al. (26Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As noted earlier (27Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we prefer to assess the relative amounts of various Gln3-Myc13 species within a particular lane and then compare the pattern of Gln3-Myc13 distribution with that observed in another lane, rather than quantitatively comparing the amounts of particular Gln3-Myc13 species observed in one lane with those in another. Further, although we occasionally compared the overall patterns of data observed in one Western blot to that of another, detailed comparisons were restricted to lane profiles contained within a single Western blot membrane unless specifically indicated otherwise. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell preparation and assay of Gln3-Myc13 by indirect immunofluorescence was initially performed as described earlier (31Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19294-19301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although this method (used in Fig. 2 of this text and Fig. S1 of the supplemental materials) performs well for wild-type strains, it was inadequate for analysis of Gln3-Myc13 intracellular distribution in phosphatase mutants. sit4Δ, and to a lesser extent pph3Δ, mutants possess characteristics that, if not circumvented, seriously compromise analysis of Gln3-Myc13 intracellular distribution. Gln3-Myc13 and DAPI stained material (DNA) were asymmetrically distributed to the daughters and mothers, respectively, of sit4Δ cells with small to medium sized buds (Fig. 2). The frequency of this morphology was increased by rapamycin treatment. This phenomenon and data suggesting that it derives from differential sensitivity of mother and daughter cells walls to zymolyase digestion as well as differential affinity for lysine-coated slides are described under supplemental materials. Therefore, we used a modified form of another method (38Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in all but Fig. 2. The modifications were: (i) fixation in the growth medium for 60 min, (ii) addition of β-mercaptoethanol (20 mm final concentration) to the zymolyase digestion mixture, and (iii) increased digestion of mutant cells (34-37 min) and decreased digestion (15-17 min) for the wild type. Digesting wild type cells for the same length of time as the sit4Δ resulted in significant degradation of cell integrity. Determination of Intracellular Gln3-Myc13 Distribution—To determine the intracellular distribution of Gln3-Myc13 generated by the experimental conditions used, an average of 150-200 cells, from randomly chosen fields of each experimental condition, were scored in a double blind manner to determine the distribution of Gln3-Myc13. Experiments were independently repeated from two to seven times. Cells were classified into three categories, those in which Gln3-Myc13 was cytoplasmic, nuclear-cytoplasmic, or nuclear. Recognizing that boundaries between the middle category and those flanking it would be unavoidably subjective, we performed two control experiments to determine the precision with which we placed cells into two adjacent categories. First, we categorized Gln3-Myc13 as being cytoplasmic or nuclear-cytoplasmic in cells from one microscopic image and then repeated the count a second time using the same image. Next, we repeated this procedure using a second, randomly selected image derived from the same slide as the first image. The cell sample used in this experiment contained approximately equal numbers of cells in which Gln3-Myc13 was categorized as cytoplasmic and nuclear-cytoplasmic, respectively. The two counts yielded four sets of values, two from each image used above. The four sets of values varied from one another by plus or minus 2-3%. Finally, we performed an analogous experiment using two images of a cell sample which contained approximately equal numbers of cells in which Gln3-Myc13 was categorized as being nuclear-cytoplasmic and nuclear, respectively. The same variation (±2-3%) was observed in this second experiment as well. These results argued that we could categorize Gln3-Myc13 localization with acceptable precision. The patterns of Gln3-Myc13 distribution between cell compartments in response to various experimental conditions (strains, nitrogen source, inhibitor treatment) were also reproducible as was the quantitative distribution of Gln3-Myc13 among the three intracellular categories in repeated scoring of images from a single cell sample. Experiment-to-experiment variation was 2-10%, except when proline was used as nitrogen source. Here, experiment-to-experiment values occasionally varied into the 20% range for isolated samples. Therefore, our attempts to achieve as accurate and precise data as possible notwithstanding, we attribute less significance to the precise percentages of Gln3-Myc13 distribution among the three possible intracellular categories than to the patterns of change observed in the distribution of Gln3-Myc13 when comparing one experimental condition to another, i.e. presence versus absence of inhibitor, nitrogen source identity, wild type versus mutant strains. Sit4 Phosphatase Brings about Gln3-Myc13 Dephosphorylation in Cells Provided with Good Nitrogen Sources—Our initial experiment investigated central, but previously untested, tenants of the Tor1,2 pathway model, i.e. (i) in the presence of a good nitrogen source, Tor1,2 are active and (via Tap42 and/or Tip41) inhibit Sit4 activity, thus preventing it from dephosphorylating Gln3, and (ii) Sit4 is active when the Tor1,2 kinases are inhibited by growth in limiting nitrogen, thereby making it available to dephosphorylate Gln3. Wild type and isogenic sit4Δ cultures were grown in YNB-glutamine medium in the presence and absence of rapamycin. As expected, and previously shown by multiple laboratories, rapamycin treatment elicited Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A, lanes A versus D). In sit4Δ cultures, two unexpected results were observed: (i) Sit4 was clearly active in cells provided with a good nitrogen source, because deleting SIT4 increased Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation relative to wild type (Fig. 3A, lanes A versus B). (ii) Rapamycin induced partial Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation in a sit4Δ (Fig. 3A, lanes B versus C), indicating that more than Sit4 alone was responsible for rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation. Together, these data indicated that type 2A phosphatase participation in the regulation of Gln3 phosphorylation was likely more complicated or different than previously reported and motivated a more thorough investigation. Most importantly, these data showed that Sit4 is active in glutamine-grown cells in which Tor1,2 were posited to actively phosphorylate Tap42 (and/or Tip41), thereby bringing about inhibition of Sit4 protein phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W1986002092,"Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by filament capping proteins is critical to myriad dynamic cellular functions. The ability of these proteins to bind both filaments as well as monomers is often central to their cellular functions. The ubiquitous pointed end capping protein Tmod3 (tropomodulin 3) acts as a negative regulator of cell migration, yet mechanisms behind its cellular functions are not understood. Analysis of Tmod3 effects on kinetics of actin polymerization and steady state monomer levels revealed that Tmod3, unlike previously characterized tropomodulins, sequesters actin monomers with an affinity similar to its affinity for capping pointed ends. Furthermore, Tmod3 is found bound to actin in high speed supernatant cytosolic extracts, suggesting that Tmod3 can bind to monomers in the context of other cytosolic monomer binding proteins. The Tmod3-actin complex can be efficiently cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide in a 1:1 complex. Subsequent tryptic digestion and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry revealed two binding interfaces on actin, one distinct from other actin monomer binding proteins, and two potential binding sites in Tmod3, which are independent of the previously characterized leucine-rich repeat structure involved in pointed end capping. These data suggest that the Tmod3 isoform may regulate actin dynamics differently in cells than the previously described tropomodulin isoforms.

These data suggest that the Tmod3 isoform may regulate actin dynamics differently in cells than the previously described tropomodulin isoforms. Cells regulate a number of important processes in space and time via the actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton and its dynamic reorganization are in turn regulated by a variety of actin-binding proteins, each of which participates in one or more of the aspects of the polymerization and depolymerization of filaments (1Carlier M.F. Le Clainche C. Wiesner S. Pantaloni D. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One of the least understood components in this system is regulation of the monomer pool (2Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33519-33527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In part this is because of the complication that although many actin-binding proteins perform functions specific to filaments (e.g. capping and severing), they interact with actin in both the monomer and polymer states. For example, gelsolin, a multifunctional actin-regulatory protein, severs filaments and caps their barbed ends but also binds to actin monomers (3Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For some classes of actin regulatory proteins such as the cofilin/ADF family, the ability to bind to both monomer and polymer is critical to their known cellular functions (4Blondin L. Sapountzi V. Maciver S.K. Lagarrigue E. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4194-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Aguda A.H. Burtnick L.D. Robinson R.C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In other cases, actin filament-binding proteins bind to monomers but with uncertain functional or biological consequence, as with capping protein/CapZ (6Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 418-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, the actin-binding protein in question forms an interface with the actin monomer that dictates how the complex interacts with actin and with other actin regulators and therefore its effects on actin polymerization dynamics (7Paavilainen V.O. Bertling E. Falck S. Lappalainen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Further complicating the understanding of these multifunctional roles are the divergent functions of actin-binding proteins among members of a given family. For example, formins have evolved very different activities with respect to actin dynamics, despite great homology between the various isoforms (8Harris E.S. Higgs H.N. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 190-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Even among actin monomer-binding protein families, much diversity of action exists, as illustrated by the WH2 domain containing proteins, which can either promote or inhibit actin assembly (9Hertzog M. van Heijenoort C. Didry D. Gaudier M. Coutant J. Gigant B. Didelot G. Preat T. Knossow M. Guittet E. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 117: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Tropomodulins (Tmods) 2The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; NHS, N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; PDB, Protein Data Bank; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; LatA, latrunculin A.2The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; NHS, N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; PDB, Protein Data Bank; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; LatA, latrunculin A. are a unique family of ∼40-kDa proteins that cap filament pointed ends in many types of actin networks and structures and are found in nearly all tissues of vertebrates, as well as in flies and worms (10Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tmods also bind tropomyosin and cap pointed ends of tropomyosin-coated filaments with over a 1000-fold greater affinity than pointed ends of tropomyosin-free actin filaments (11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of Tmods have been best studied for the Tmod1 isoform, which caps actin filament pointed ends but does not bind actin monomers (11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Tmods contain two major structural domains with unique functions in regulating actin polymerization. First, the C-terminal half of Tmods consists of a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRR) that form a compact, globular domain that caps pointed ends of actin filaments, independent of tropomyosin (13Krieger I. Kostyukova A.S. Maeda Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 743-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 14Fujisawa T. Kostyukova A. Maeda Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This structure has been defined by x-ray crystallography and is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans through vertebrates (16Krieger I. Kostyukova A. Yamashita A. Nitanai Y. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2716-2725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Lu S. Li S. Carson M. Chen L. Meehan E. Luo M. Proteins. 2004; 56: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Second, the N-terminal portion of Tmods is flexible and extended in solution (14Fujisawa T. Kostyukova A. Maeda Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and contains the tropomyosin binding activity as well as the ability to cap tropomyosin-actin filament pointed ends with high affinity (18Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5066-5071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, a structure determination of Tmod1 residues 1-90 by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy has revealed the presence of a short α-helix that is important for tropomyosin binding and another short region with α-helical propensity that is involved in high affinity capping of tropomyosin-actin filaments (21Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Kostyukova A.S. Rapp B.A. Choy A. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that this N-terminal region is well conserved across isoforms (greater than 75% homology), Tmod isoforms demonstrate significant differences in their binding affinities for different tropomyosin isoforms (18Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vertebrates there are four Tmod isoforms (Tmods1-4), each of which are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. The cell types and actin networks these isoforms are found in can be characterized as either relatively dynamic (Tmod2 and Tmod3) or stable (Tmod1 and Tmod4). The cellular function of Tmod depends on the actin network in which it is found. For example, in stable actin structures like the cardiac muscle sarcomere, Tmod1 regulation of actin exchange at pointed ends controls thin filament lengths and stability (23Littlefield R. Almenar-Queralt A. Fowler V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), such that the lack of Tmod1 in mice is lethal because of defective sarcomere assembly and aborted cardiac development (24Chu X. Chen J. Reedy M.C. Vera C. Sung K.L. Sung L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1827-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Fritz-Six K.L. Cox P.R. Fischer R.S. Xu B. Gregorio C.C. Zoghbi H.Y. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conversely, in dynamic actin networks such as the lamellipodia of motile endothelial cells, Tmod3 is present in concentrations similar to other actin regulators, such as ADF/cofilin, and acts as a negative regulator of cell migration (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As yet, Tmod3 is the only protein known to perform this negative regulatory function in dynamic actin networks like those found in lamellipodia (10Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism of negative regulation of cell migration by Tmod3 is reduction in pointed end disassembly (10Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is attractive when considered with the presumption that disassembly of the pointed ends is likely to be the rate-limiting step in network turnover (1Carlier M.F. Le Clainche C. Wiesner S. Pantaloni D. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, a puzzling observation has been that Tmod3 levels in the endothelial cells were inversely correlated with levels of F-actin and free barbed ends in lamellae. Based on the ability of Tmod3 to cap pointed ends and slow down pointed end disassembly in vitro, it might have been expected that Tmod3 levels would be directly correlated with F-actin levels, i.e. more Tmod3 would lead to more F-actin and less Tmod3 to less F-actin. Moreover, despite the presence of a large soluble pool of Tmod3 at endogenous levels, these motile cells contained an abundance of free pointed ends (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the existence of novel actin regulatory mechanisms for Tmod3, and/or other binding partners available to Tmod3 that prevented it from capping a subset of the actin pointed ends in cells. Here we show that Tmod3, unlike the Tmod isoforms found in stable actin structures, binds to actin monomers both in vivo and in vitro. Tmod3 competitively inhibits thymosin β4(tβ4) binding to actin monomers, with an affinity for the monomer similar to its affinity for filament pointed ends. Kinetic modeling further shows that the Tmod3-actin monomer complex is surprisingly stable in contrast to the association of Tmod3 with actin filament pointed ends. Using zero length cross-linkers, we find that Tmod3 forms a 1:1 complex with actin monomer. Tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS of this cross-linked complex identified two putative Tmod3-binding peptides, both contained in the N-terminal domain of Tmod3, which was alone sufficient to sequester monomers. These data indicate that Tmod3, unlike other Tmods, binds efficiently to actin monomers as well as filament pointed ends. Proteins—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder as described previously (27Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Purified non-muscle actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared and stored as described (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Prior to use in assays, actin was dialyzed several times against freshly prepared buffer A (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 2mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm ATP). Purified recombinant chicken Tmod1 and -4, rat Tmod2, and human Tmod1 and Tmod3 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (28Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tmod3-(1-92) and Tmod3-(1-189) were made by mutating codons 93 or 190 and 191 into stop codons, within the context of the glutathione S-transferase fusion expression plasmid, and purified as above. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically by absorption as described (15Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Actin Polymerization Assays—Pyrenyl-actin was converted to Mg2+-actin as described previously (29Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and polymerization reactions were performed in a polymerization buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1mm NaN3, 1mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm CaCl2). Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 10× polymerization buffer to achieve the final buffer concentration. Fluorescence measurements (λEx = 366.5 nm, λEm = 407 nm) were made using a Fluoromax 3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). Nucleation reactions were performed by addition of various amounts of Tmod3 to 2 μm G-actin (8% pyrenyl), prior to the addition of salts (15Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For pointed end elongation measurements, gelsolincapped actin filaments (1:10 gelsolin:actin) (11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) were added to 2 μm G-actin (8% pyrenyl) in the presence or absence of Tmod3 followed by addition of polymerization salts as described (11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For barbed end elongation experiments, spectrin-actin seeds (30Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Yang C. Brown K. Huang M. Pring M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or F-actin seeds (31Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) were prepared and were added to a total concentration of 1.5 μm G-actin (8% pyrenyl) in the presence or absence of Tmod3 followed by addition of polymerization salts. In the case of steady state reactions, the final concentration of actin was as stated in the figure legends. For steady state measurements, filament seeds (∼9nm barbed ends, as determined by kinetic modeling; see below) or spectrin-actin seeds (200 nm) were added to 3 μm actin (10% pyrenyl), with or without Tmods, and allowed to polymerize to steady state for 30-36 h at room temperature prior to measurement of total fluorescence. At times longer than 60 h, a slight decrease in F-actin as reported by pyrene fluorescence was observed, probably due to accumulation of ADP-actin monomers. Tmods were included in the polymerization mixture either at the beginning or after 12 h. We observed no significant difference between these two regimes. We also observed no measurable difference in G-actin fluorescence in the presence of Tmod3 (data not shown). Nucleation, pointed end, and barbed end elongation experiments were performed similarly, except that the fluorescence was monitored immediately upon addition of polymerization salts. Representative experiments from each series are shown for clarity. Averages from different days are not reported, because of variation in pyrenyl-actin from day to day (32Lal A.A. Korn E.D. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8794-8800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of Actin and Tmod3—Purified proteins were dialyzed three times against 1 liter of Buffer A and then against cross-linking buffer (2 mm KHPO4, pH8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP) at 4 °C. To test if divalent cation differences were important for complex formation, some samples were briefly dialyzed against cross-linking buffer with 1 mm MgCl2 at pH ∼7.5 (because the optimum pH for the EDC cross-linking reaction is 7.5 or lower). In our experience, this did not dramatically affect the cross-linking reaction. Immediately before the reactions, the proteins were dialyzed against the appropriate cross-linking buffer without ATP and DTT for 2 h at 4 °C (33Vandekerckhove J.S. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Each protein sample was centrifuged at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to remove aggregates, and concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry. The proteins were combined at a 1:1 molar ratio at concentrations between 10 and 20 μm. l-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC; Pierce) and N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide (NHS; Pierce) stock solutions were prepared immediately before addition to reactions and were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of either 200 mm (final concentration) glycine or 10 mm hydroxylamine. Samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on either 10 or 7.5-15% gradient gels. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with antibodies to Tmod3 or actin, as described (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In-gel Trypsin Digestion, HPLC Peptide Mapping, and LC-MS/MS—Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands were excised and digested with modified trypsin essentially as described previously (34Speicher M.R. Petersen S. Uhrig S. Jentsch I. Fauth C. Eils R. Petersen I. Lab. Investig. 2000; 80: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, gel bands were: destained using 200 μl of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile for 30 min at 37 °C; dried under vacuum; reduced using 100 μl of 20 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 15 min at 37 °C; alkylated using 100 μl of 40 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 37 °C; washed twice with 200 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min each and washed once with 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate; dried under vacuum, and digested with 20 μl of 0.02 μg/μl modified trypsin (Promega) in 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight with shaking at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed to a clean tube, and 20 μl of 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added for 30 min with shaking at 37 °C. The supernatants were combined, and 4 μl of neat acetic acid was added for LC-MS/MS samples or 4 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid for subsequent microbore HPLC analysis. All samples were stored at -20 °C until analyzed. For microbore HPLC with UV detection, typically 80% of the extracted tryptic peptide solution was injected onto a Beckman Coulter Gold System 126 with a 5-μm, 2.1 × 150-mm Zorbax 300 SB-C18 column. Peptides were eluted using a trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile gradient at 200 μl/min using detection at 214 nm. Peaks were collected into precleaned microcentrifuge tubes, and selected peaks of interest were analyzed by MALDI-MS using conventional methods. LC-MS/MS peptide mapping and identification was performed using either an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer or LTQ FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). The tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase-HPLC on a nanocapillary column, 75 μm inner diameter × 15 cm PicoFrit (New Objective, Woburn, AM), packed with MAGIC C18 resin, 5-μm particle size (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). The mass spectrometers were set to repetitively scan m/z from 375 to 2000 m/z followed by data-dependent MS/MS scans on the six most abundant ions with dynamic exclusion enabled. The resulting masses and MS/MS spectra were searched using SEQUEST Browser (Thermo Electron Corp.) with a custom unindexed data base consisting of the exact sequences of the two proteins. Separate searches using trypsin specificity with one allowed missed cleavage and no enzyme were performed. In general, searches were performed using a static modification of Cys as the carboxamidomethyl derivative and dynamic modifications as follows: Met to methionine sulfoxide (+16 Da), methylation of His (+14 Da) for the methylated actin His, and pyroglutamic acid (-17 Da) for the partial N-terminal cyclization of tryptic peptides with N-terminal glutamines. Resulting data were filtered to eliminate all matches where Sf was <0.20, 0.50, and 0.70 for +1, +2, and +3 charge stages, respectively, and p > 25 for all charge states. All assigned sequences that affected potential interpretations were manually inspected to confirm the assigned peptide sequence. tβ4 Fluorescence Anisotropy Competition Assays—Measurement of Tmod3 competition for actin monomer binding with tβ4 was measured by fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide-labeled tβ4, as described previously (2Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33519-33527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to full-length tβ4, a synthetic, truncated ϵ-amino rhodamine-labeled peptide (1-25 rhod-tβ4 peptide) was also used in some assays. Standard curves of the fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled tβ4 peptide as a function of Mg2+-actin concentration in F buffer (5.0 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.125 mm EGTA, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8) were generated with vertically excited polarized light at 546 nm in an L or T format steady state fluorimeter. The horizontal (Ih) and vertical (Iv) components of the emitted light were detected at 568 nm for 0.3-ml samples in glass cuvettes. The fluorescence anisotropy, r, was calculated as described previously (2Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33519-33527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the bound actin does not change the total fluorescence intensity of the rhodamine-labeled tβ4, the observed anisotropy is a linear function of the fraction of tβ4 that is bound to actin. Modeling of Barbed End and Pointed End Elongation Rates—We used BerkeleyMadonna version 8.01 to generate ordinary differential equation models of the barbed end elongation rates. In the case of barbed end elongation experiments, we determined the number of free barbed ends added to the reaction by using the published on and off rates for actin monomers (35Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) onto the barbed ends, and we allowed the amounts of free barbed ends to vary to fit the experimental data of polymerization reactions in the presence of no Tmod3. We then used this amount of free barbed ends for all subsequent barbed end elongation models of data from experiments performed the same day. Similarly, for pointed end elongation reaction models, even though we used a known amount of seeds for the reaction, we modeled the number of free pointed ends in the reaction using the published on and off rates for the pointed end (assuming that the barbed end was permanently capped by gelsolin (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)), and we modeled the free pointed ends to polymerization curves with no Tmod3. We then used this number of free pointed ends to model pointed end capping reactions from parallel reactions with Tmod3 collected the same day. A is the actin monomer concentration at time t; Nb is the barbed end concentration; Np is the pointed end concentration; TNp is the concentration of Tmod3-capped pointed ends, and TA is the concentration of the Tmod3-actin monomer complex. In each set of reactions (see Fig. 5), we allowed the model to reach equilibrium (60,000 s). For each set of off and on rates, a range is given that reflects data derived from independent experiments. Cytosolic Extract Preparation and FLAG-Tmod3 Pulldown Assays—HEK 293 cells were cultured and maintained as described previously (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FLAG-Tmod3 expression vector was made by subcloning the human Tmod3 cDNA in-frame into the pCMV-Tag vector (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). For transfection with FLAG-tagged Tmod3, HEK 293 cells were plated at subconfluence, and the cells were transfected with FLAG-Tmod3 expression vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer protocols. At 24-30 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, followed by centrifuging the low speed supernatant for 2 h at 300,000 × g. This centrifugation regime is sufficient to remove actin seeds and nuclei and is routinely used to prepare nuclei-free G-actin for polymerization assays, which are particularly sensitive to nuclei content. The cleared lysate was then used for immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Tmod3 using anti-FLAG antibodies (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In experiments with latrunculin A (LatA), the lysates were preincubated with 10 μm LatA prior to the addition of FLAG antibodies. Immunoblots were performed essentially as described (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with either C4 anti-actin or anti-FLAG antibodies. Tmod3 Sequesters Monomers in Vitro—Previously we have demonstrated that Tmod3 caps pointed ends of actin filaments in vitro (26Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, as discussed above, the cellular effects of Tmod3 on lamellipodial actin in migrating cells suggested the possibility of a more complex regulatory role. To investigate whether Tmod3 interacts with actin monomers, we tested the ab"
https://openalex.org/W2013170724,"Recoverin is a Ca2+-regulated signal transduction modulator expressed in the vertebrate retina that has been implicated in visual adaptation. An intriguing feature of recoverin is a cluster of charged residues at its C terminus, the functional significance of which is largely unclear. To elucidate the impact of this segment on recoverin structure and function, we have investigated a mutant lacking the C-terminal 12 amino acids. Whereas in myristoylated recoverin the truncation causes an overall decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity, results for the non-myristoylated mutant indicate that the truncation primarily affects the high affinity EF-hand 3. The three-dimensional structure of the mutant has been determined by x-ray crystallography. In addition to significant changes in average coordinates compared with wild-type recoverin, the structure provides strong indication of increased conformational flexibility, particularly in the C-terminal domain. Based on these observations, we propose a novel role of the C-terminal segment of recoverin as an internal modulator of Ca2+ sensitivity.

Many biological processes are triggered or regulated by transient intracellular Ca2+ signals. Because these signals elicit specific cellular responses, the precise detection of changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is a crucial step in many signaling pathways and requires sensing of Ca2+ within very different concentration ranges. Ca2+-binding proteins work as intracellular Ca2+ sensors and regulate their targets with high specificity and high spatial and temporal resolution. To achieve these remarkable tasks, Ca2+ is recognized by specific amino acid sequence motifs, for example the C2 domain and the EF-hand motif (1Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 2Lewit-Bentley A. Réty S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These motifs can detect subtle changes in Ca2+ concentration and allow a fine tuning of Ca2+ signaling. However, it remains a challenging problem to understand at a structural level how minimal changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ are reliably detected. The EF-hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins includes, among others, the family of neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) 3The abbreviations used are: NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; CBL, calcineurin B-like protein; CIPK, CBL-interacting protein kinase; CN, calcineurin; GCAP, guanylate cyclase activating protein; KChIP, potassium channel interacting protein; ROS, rod outer segment; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 3The abbreviations used are: NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; CBL, calcineurin B-like protein; CIPK, CBL-interacting protein kinase; CN, calcineurin; GCAP, guanylate cyclase activating protein; KChIP, potassium channel interacting protein; ROS, rod outer segment; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank. proteins (3Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which are named because of their predominant expression in neuronal tissue. NCS proteins are grouped into five subfamilies and show a rather heterogeneous localization and function in the nervous system (4Burgoyne R.D. O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 203-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina, for instance, recoverin and several isoforms of guanylate cyclase activating protein (GCAP) detect changes in Ca2+ concentration during or after illumination and regulate their target proteins in Ca2+-dependent feedback loops (5Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recoverin inhibits rhodopsin kinase at high cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (6Kawamura S.

Biol. 2002; 514: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a process that is thought to contribute to light adaptation of photoreceptor cells (9Senin I.I. Koch K.W. Akhtar M. Philippov P.P.

Recoverin harbors a myristoyl group at its N terminus (11Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is buried in a hydrophobic cleft in the Ca2+-free state (12Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding to the two functional EF-hands (EF-hand 2 and EF-hand 3) (13Permyakov S.E. Cherskaya A.M. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Alekseev A.M. Zinchenko D.V. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. Uversky V.N. Permyakov E.A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) the acyl chain is exposed to the solvent. This so-called Ca2+-myristoyl switch is a multistep process, in which the EF-hands are sequentially filled by Ca2+ and recoverin undergoes a major conformational change (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interaction of recoverin with membranes occurs with low to moderate affinity and therefore appears to be driven mainly by hydrophobic forces (17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Lange C. Koch K.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recoverin contains a remarkable cluster of basic residues at its C terminus, which have been suggested to provide the positive charges for an electrostatic interaction with the membrane (19Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, solid state NMR studies on myristoylated recoverin attached to phospholipid bilayers revealed that the positive charges at the C terminus do not make contact with the membrane (20Valentine K.G. Mesleh M.F. Opella S.J. Ikura M. Ames J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6333-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that the positively charged C terminus does not influence the membrane binding per se, but controls the Ca2+ binding characteristics of the EF-hands. Consequently, all Ca2+-dependent properties of recoverin would depend on the presence of this portion of the protein. In the present study, we address the impact of the charged C-terminal segment on structure and function of recoverin. To this end, we have determined the crystal structure of a truncated mutant lacking the C-terminal cluster of charged residues and compared it with available structures of wild-type recoverin (12Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M.

Furthermore, we have investigated key biochemical properties of the mutant, such as Ca2+ binding, association with rod outer segment (ROS) membranes and inhibition of rhodopsin kinase. Based on these data, we propose a novel function of the C terminus of recoverin as an internal modulator of EF-hand function. Protein Expression and Purification—The expression construct for the truncated bovine recoverin mutant Rc2-190 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTGGATCCTTAAGGCTCGAATTG-3′ (containing stop codon and BamHI restriction site). The DNA fragment was inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of a pET-11d plasmid vector. The integrity of the insert was checked by sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3100-Avant genetic analyzer. Heterologous expression and purification of all myristoylated and non-myristoylated recoverin variants was performed and analyzed as described previously (17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When necessary, recoverin forms were further purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac 238TP C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) to obtain homogeneous myristoylated forms of wild type and mutant recoverin. Denatured protein (after elution from a reverse phase column) was refolded as described previously (23Neubert T.A. Walsh K.A. Hurley J.B. Johnson R.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ Binding Assay—Binding of 45Ca2+ to recoverin was investigated as described previously (17Senin I.I. Fischer T.

In summary, 43 μm protein was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol and transferred to Centricon 10 devices (Amicon). Radioactive 45CaCl2 was added, the samples were centrifuged for 1 min (5000 rpm, tabletop centrifuge Biofuge pico, Heraeus) and radioactivity of the filtrate was counted (free Ca2+). Next, non-radioactive CaCl2 was added, and the centrifugation procedure was repeated. Protein-bound Ca2+ versus free Ca2+ was determined from the excess Ca2+ in the protein sample over that present in the ultrafiltrate. Data were analyzed as described (17Senin I.I. Fischer T.

Equilibrium Centrifugation Assay—Binding of recoverin to ROS membranes was investigated according to a published procedure (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μm recoverin was mixed with bleached urea-washed ROS membranes (50 μm rhodopsin) and incubated at 30 °C (Gnom, DNA-technology thermomixer, 1000 rpm) for 15 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm BAPTA and 0-50 mm CaCl2 (total volume 75 μl). Membranes were separated by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 rpm, Heraeus tabletop centrifuge), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—Binding of recoverin variants to immobilized liposomes was monitored by SPR spectroscopy. The immobilization of liposomes on sensor chip surfaces, recording of suitable controls and evaluation of SPR data have been described in detail (17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Thermal stability of recoverin variants was studied by recording the wavelength maximum (λmax) of tryptophan fluorescence emission at different temperatures essentially as described before (13Permyakov S.E. Cherskaya A.M. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Alekseev A.M. Zinchenko D.V. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. Uversky V.N. Permyakov E.A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian Inc.), equipped with a Peltier-controlled cell holder. All spectra were corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the instrument and fitted to log-normal curves. Positions of λmax were obtained from these fits. Spectrofluorometric temperature scans were performed stepwise allowing the sample to equilibrate at each temperature. The average heating rate was 0.5 °C/min. Temperature was monitored inside the cuvette. Protein concentration was 7-15 μm. Measurements were made in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0 in the presence of either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. Excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm. Rhodopsin Kinase Assay—The kinase assay was performed as described before (22Weiergräber O.H. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. Granzin J. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22972-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture in a final volume of 50 μl contained 10 μm rhodopsin (urea-washed ROS), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm [γ32P]ATP (30-100 dpm/pmol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3-0.5 units of rhodopsin kinase. The respective recoverin variant and a Ca2+/bisaminobromo-phenoxyethane tetraacetate (BAPTA) buffer were added, as appropriate (17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and samples were incubated under continuous light for 10 min at 30 °C. Incubation was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed 3-4 times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid; the pellet was used for Cherenkov counting. Crystallization of Rc2-190—The protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml and the reservoir containing 2.4 m sodium malonate (pH 7.0) and 2 mm CaCl2. This condition yielded plate-shaped crystals with a half-circle profile and a maximum diameter of 300-400 μm. Data Collection—The x-ray diffraction dataset was collected at 100 K. Prior to cryocooling, crystals were step-soaked in reservoir solution containing 5-15% (v/v) glycerol. Native data were recorded at beamline ID14-1 of the ESRF (Grenoble, France) tuned to a wavelength of 0.934 Å on an ADSC-Q4R detector. Because of the shape of the crystal, diffraction was extremely anisotropic, reducing the overall completeness of the dataset to ∼85%. Data processing including reflections up to 3.0-Å resolution was carried out using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EAMCB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA, which is part of the CCP4 (25Collaborative computational project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) software suite. Structure Determination—Crystals of Rc2-190 belonged to space group P21. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (CCP4) with a single native dataset. The search model was created from the crystal structure of wild-type bovine recoverin (PDB code 1OMR, Ref. 22Weiergräber O.H. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. Granzin J. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22972-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by deleting residues 191-202. Crystals were found to contain four molecules per asymmetric unit, related by a proper 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. Following rigid body refinement using the CNS package (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), the model was improved in an iterative manner including several cycles of positional refinement with CNS and manual rebuilding using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). In this process, strict non-crystallographic symmetry was applied throughout, i.e. all four molecules were assumed to be identical.

According to Ramachandran plots generated with PROCHECK (CCP4), the model exhibits good geometry with none of the residues in the disallowed regions. The figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (29Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar) using secondary structure assignments given by the DSSP (30Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) program. The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 2HET) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. A truncated version of bovine recoverin lacking 12 amino acids at its C terminus (Rc2-190) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity from a bacterial cell extract. As expected, the purified protein showed an increased electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE compared with the wild-type because of its lower molecular mass (not shown). Expression and purification of a myristoylated form of this mutant yielded preparations with the same high degree of purity. The extent of myristoylation was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and was found to be more than 95%. Furthermore, the myristoylated Rc2-190 could be easily distinguished from the non-myristoylated protein by its slightly higher electrophoretic mobility. Homogeneous preparations of myristoylated and non-myristoylated recoverin variants were used to determine some of their key biochemical properties. Non-myristoylated Rc2-190 was subjected to crystallization trials. 45Ca2+ Binding—The myristoylated form of Rc2-190 bound 2 Ca2+ ions in a cooperative manner, resembling the wild-type protein in this respect (Fig. 1A). However, the mutant showed a significantly lower affinity for Ca2+ indicated by a shift of the binding isotherm to higher free Ca2+ concentration; half-saturation was at 31.3 ± 4.2 μm for the mutant (three independent determinations) and 15.5 ± 2.1 μm for wild-type recoverin (two independent determinations). In the absence of the myristoyl group, the same principle observation was made, i.e. Rc2-190 bound Ca2+ with lower affinity and maximal stoichiometry was 2 Ca2+ per Rc2-190 (Fig. 1B). Binding of Ca2+ to the non-myristoylated mutant was non-cooperative, and data were fitted according to the two-site model as it has been previously applied to non-myristoylated wild-type recoverin (17Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the low affinity EF-hand 2 of wild-type recoverin and of Rc2-190 display the same intrinsic affinity for Ca2+ (Kd2 = 6.0 ± 0.2 μm), whereas the affinity of EF-hand 3 was more than 6-fold lower in Rc2-190 (Kd1 = 1.4 ± 0.07 μm) than in wild-type recoverin (Kd1 = 0.21 μm). These data show that EF-hands 2 and 3 are intact in the mutant, but that the C terminus influences the high affinity EF-hand 3. Thermal Stability of Rc2-190—To test whether the C-terminal truncation of recoverin might lead to a general destabilization of its structure, we compared the thermal stability of myristoylated wild-type recoverin and myristoylated Rc2-190 by recording the temperature dependence of tryptophan fluorescence in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). A change of the wavelength maximum of fluorescence emission (λmax)at increasing temperature indicates thermal unfolding of the protein (13Permyakov S.E. Cherskaya A.M. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Alekseev A.M. Zinchenko D.V. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. Uversky V.N. Permyakov E.A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission of the mutant was slightly blue-shifted by 2 nm at temperatures below the transition point, which indicates small changes in the microenvironment of tryptophan residues caused by the removal of twelve C-terminal amino acids. At the same time, wild-type recoverin and the mutant Rc2-190 showed transitions from the folded to the unfolded state at the same temperature (Fig. 1C). For the Ca2+-free forms, this transition occurred at lower temperature than for the Ca2+-loaded forms indicating that the Ca2+-loaded form of both recoverin variants is more stable. The overall thermal stability of the nonmyristoylated forms did not differ from the myristoylated forms; the λmax was slightly more shifted in the case of Ca2+-free recoverin, but the transition point was almost identical (not shown). These results demonstrate that the Rc2-190 mutant does not differ from wild-type recoverin in thermal stability. The changes in Ca2+-affinity reported above do therefore not reflect a general destabilization of the mutant structure. However, we recognized that further shortening of the C terminus finally results in a thermally more unstable mutant, when more than 20 amino acids were deleted (data not shown). Ca2+-dependent Binding of Rc2-190 to Membranes—The change in the affinity for Ca2+ in myristoylated Rc2-190 suggested that the mutant should perform a Ca2+-myristoyl switch with a shift in the Ca2+ dependence to higher free Ca2+ concentration. To test this assumption, we analyzed the binding of myristoylated recoverin forms to native washed ROS membranes by an equilibrium centrifugation assay. Binding of the mutant to ROS membranes showed a more than 2-fold shift to higher Ca2+ concentration, but finally reached the same maximal value as in the case of wild-type recoverin (Fig. 2A). In a second approach, we studied interaction of Rc2-190 with immobilized lipids using SPR spectroscopy (Fig. 2B). A lipid mixture that resembles the ROS disc membrane composition was immobilized on an L1 sensor chip. Injection of Rc2-190 onto the membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+ (black bar) caused an increase in resonance units indicating binding of Rc2-190 to the surface. Wild-type recoverin, however, bound to the same lipid surface with higher amplitude. If a decrease in Ca2+ affinity of Rc2-190 was responsible for this effect, the mutant should reach the same maximal amplitude as wild-type recoverin at higher Ca2+ concentration. Indeed, increasing the free Ca2+ concentration caused the SPR signal of the truncated mutant to converge to the wild-type level (Fig. 2C, see dashed line). Inhibition of Rhodopsin Kinase—Recoverin is known to inhibit rhodopsin kinase activity at high Ca2+ concentration; this inhibitory effect is relieved when Ca2+ is lowered thereby allowing the kinase to phosphorylate its substrate rhodopsin. From the results concerning the modified Ca2+ sensitivity of Rc2-190 we predict that this mutant should be able to inhibit rhodopsin kinase, but with a shift in Ca2+ dependence of the dose-response curve. We tested this assumption by measuring the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase in the presence of Rc2-190 or wild-type recoverin as a function of free Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Again, the truncated mutant exhibited a change in its Ca2+ sensitivity and inhibited rhodopsin kinase at higher Ca2+ concentration. Crystal Structure of Rc2-190—The above experiments demonstrated that truncation of the C-terminal 12 amino acids of recoverin affected its Ca2+ binding characteristics and, as a result, its Ca2+-dependent biochemical properties such as performance of the Ca2+-myristoyl switch and inhibition of rhodopsin kinase. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these functional alterations, we have crystallized the Rc2-190 mutant and determined its three-dimensional structure by x-ray crystallography. Rc2-190 forms plate-shaped crystals of space group P21 with four molecules per asymmetric unit. These are positioned in a head-to-tail fashion around a 4-fold non-crystallographic axis (perpendicular to the xy plane) resulting in a toroidal assembly encompassing a wide central channel (Fig. 4A). Crystallographic symmetry causes the tetramers to form layers parallel to the xy plane (two staggered layers per unit translation along z). This arrangement, which has not been observed before in crystal structures of NCS proteins, results in unique packing interactions, the structural implications of which are discussed below. Crystallization of Rc2-190 was performed in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. While the electron density indicated the presence of a Ca2+ ion in EF-hand 3, the lower affinity EF-hand 2 turned out to be unoccupied. Therefore, like the crystal structure of wild-type recoverin (22Weiergräber O.H. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. Granzin J. Koch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22972-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), our structure of Rc2-190 represents an intermediate state resulting from Ca2+ binding to the high affinity EF-hand 3. The N-terminal 8 amino acids could not be located in the electron density and are thus likely to be disordered. Superposition of the Cα traces of wild-type recoverin and the Rc2-190 mutant (Fig. 4B) reveals significant differences in several regions (highlighted in red). Generally, the C-terminal 12 amino acid truncation leads to increased flexibility in its neighborhood. This is particularly evident for the loop connecting the N- and C-terminal domains (region III), which is well-ordered in the wild-type protein. In contrast, the corresponding portion in the mutant not only adopts a different conformation, but also exhibits strongly enhanced mobility, indicated by large B factors 4The B factor associated with an atom in a crystallographic model is proportional to the mean square displacement of this atom from its average position, assuming a simple harmonic motion. While also incorporating effects of static disorder and data quality, it is primarily taken as an indicator of thermal mobility. and very weak electron density. For a plot of main chain B factors per residue (normalized to the mean B value of all main chain atoms) please refer to Fig. 5. Another part of the structure directly contacting the C terminus in the wild-type is the loop between EF-hands 3 and 4 (region IV, colored orange in Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the changes in average coordinates because of the truncation are rather modest in this segment. While relative main chain B factors in region IV are similar for both prot"

Here we clarified the kinetic mechanism of the ATPase cycle of human myosin IIIA. The steady-state ATPase activity was markedly activated ∼10-fold with very low actin concentration. The rate of ADP off from actomyosin IIIA was 10 times greater than the overall cycling rate, thus not a rate-determining step. The rate constant of the ATP hydrolysis step of the actin-dissociated form was very slow, but the rate was markedly accelerated by actin binding. The dissociation constant of the ATP-bound form of myosin IIIA from actin is submicromolar, which agrees well with the low Kactin. These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis predominantly takes place in the actin-bound form for actomyosin IIIA ATPase reaction. The obtained Kactin was much lower than the previously reported one, and we found that the autophosphorylation of myosin IIIA dramatically increased the Kactin, whereas the Vmax was unchanged. Our kinetic model indicates that both the actin-attached hydrolysis and the Pi release steps determine the overall cycle rate of the dephosphorylated form. Although the stable steady-state intermediates of actomyosin IIIA ATPase reaction are not typical strong actin-binding intermediates, the affinity of the stable intermediates for actin is much higher than conventional weak actin binding forms. The present results suggest that myosin IIIA can spend a majority of its ATP hydrolysis cycling time on actin.

Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and a majority of the cell biological work related to class III myosin has been done with the Drosophila system. Class III myosin was subsequently identified from humans (2Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Dose A.C. Burnside B.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4548-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrate, two isoforms of class III myosin, myosin IIIA and myosin IIIB, have been cloned (2Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2002; 79: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among them, most studies have been done with myosin IIIA. Both isoforms are highly expressed in the retina. Myosin IIIA is also expressed in inner ear hair cells, and it is responsible for progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans (6Walsh T. Walsh V. Vreugde S. Hertzano R. Shahin H. Haika S. Lee M.K. Kanaan M. King M.C. Avraham K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7518-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that myosin IIIA is concentrated in the distal ends of rod and cone ellipsoid and colocalizes with the plus-distal ends of inner segment actin filament bundles, where actin forms the microvilli-like calycal processes (4Dose A.C. Hillman D.W. Wong C. Sohlberg L. Lin-Jones J. Burnside B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transfection of green fluorescent protein-myosin IIIA into HeLa cells revealed that myosin IIIA localizes at the tip of filopodia (7Les Erickson F. Corsa A.C. Dose A.C. Burnside B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that myosin IIIA accumulates at the plus end of actin bundles. The major cytoskeletal structure of filopodia is the actin bundles, and the plus ends of the actin filaments are localized at the tip; therefore, the localization of myosin IIIA at the tip of filopodia suggests that this myosin traveled on actin filaments and accumulated at the end of the actin track. This is consistent with our result that myosin IIIA is a plus end-directed motor (8Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The physiological function of myosin III is still unknown, but there are several possibilities for the function of myosin III. Myosin III may play an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of microvillar apparatus of photoreceptor cells, since retinal degeneration occurs in ninaC mutant flies (9Porter J.A. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Porter J.A. Hicks J.L. Williams D.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies have suggested that myosin III functions as a cargo carrier. It has been known that the two important signaling proteins show light-dependent translocation in photoreceptor cells of both vertebrate and invertebrate. One is G-protein transducin in vertebrate and Gq in invertebrate. G-proteins mediate phototransduction signaling. Recent studies have revealed that transducin and Gq translocate between the signaling compartments, and this plays a role in an adaptation mechanism (12Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4797-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The other is visual arrestin that is responsible for termination of the photoresponse. Visual arrestin translocates in the direction opposite to the G-protein translocation (15Lee S.J. Xu H. Kang L.W. Amzel L.M. Montell C. Neuron. 2003; 39: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Peterson J.J. Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Shelamer C.L. Dugger D.R. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A.

Although the mechanism of the translocation of these molecules is unknown, myosin III has been thought to be a candidate of the transporter of this process. Like most other myosins, myosin III heavy chain consists of the motor domain, the neck domain, and the C-terminal tail domain. The most intriguing feature of myosin III is that it contains a protein kinase homology domain at the N-terminal side of the myosin homology domain. The protein kinase activity of this domain has been biochemically identified in our laboratory for ninaC (18Ng K.P. Kambara T. Matsuura M. Burke M. Ikebe M.

Although it had been questioned whether myosin III has motor activity, the motor function of human myosin IIIA was identified previously (8Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Following the motor domain, there is a neck domain containing various numbers of IQ motifs that serve as a light chain/CaM 2The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; mantATP, methylanthraniloyl-ATP; mantADP, methylanthraniloyl-ADP; HuM3MD, human myosin III motor domain; M3KD, the kinase domain of human myosin III; GST, glutathione S-transferase. binding site. It has been shown that myosin IIIA interacts with CaM (4Dose A.C. Hillman D.W. Wong C. Sohlberg L. Lin-Jones J. Burnside B. Mol. Biol.

There is no coiled-coil region in the tail region, suggesting that myosin III is a single-headed structure. Lin-Jones et al. (19Lin-Jones J. Parker E. Wu M. Dose A. Burnside B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5825-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) found that the tail domain of myosin IIIA is required for the localization at the rod calycal processes. Consistently, the tail domain is required for the localization of myosin IIIA to the distal filopodial tips. Furthermore, the tail domain of myosin IIIA co-localized with actin structures, suggesting that the tail domain may interact with actin (7Les Erickson F. Corsa A.C. Dose A.C. Burnside B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, the short tail peptide conjugated to GST co-sedimented with F-actin in vitro. The actin binding site in the tail was identified as the motif DFRXXL that was originally identified in myosin light chain kinase (20Smith L. Su X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal end of the tail, and a point mutation of the conserved Arg abolished the interaction with actin in vitro. This raises a hypothesis that the actin binding site at the tail serves as a tethering site and plays a critical role in preventing myosin IIIA from dissociating from the actin track during the movement, thus supporting processive movement as is shown for the processive movement of kinesin (21Thorn K.S. Ubersax J.A. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the motor function of myosin III at a molecular basis is largely unknown. In the present study, we expressed the motor domain of human myosin IIIA using the baculovirus expression system and clarified the mechanoenzymatic characteristics of myosin IIIA by analyzing the actomyosin IIIA ATPase reaction. The results suggest that myosin IIIA is not a conventional high duty ratio motor, but it spends a majority of its ATP hydrolysis cycle time on actin. Reagents and Proteins—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified according to Spudich and Watt (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and actin filaments were stabilized by phalloidin. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described (23Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Myosin III—To create myosin III motor domain (HuM3MD), a fragment of human myosin IIIA cDNA encoding Met311–Lys1058 was subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). A Myc tag and an octahistidine tag were inserted at the C terminus. The HuM3MD construct contains only the motor domain of human myosin IIIA (Fig. 1A). The molecular mass is calculated to be 90.6 kDa from the amino acid sequence. To express HuM3MD, 300 ml of Sf9 cells (∼1 × 109) were infected with the virus expressing HuM3MD. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 72 h. The cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded onto an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) and washed with 20-fold column volume of buffer containing 30 mm imidazole-HCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin. HuM3MD was eluted with a buffer containing 0.2 m imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and then the sample was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin. Typically, 0.5 mg of protein was obtained from a 300-ml culture. The purified HuM3MD was stored on ice and used within 1 day. Protein concentration was determined by densitometry of a Coomassie-staining gel. Purity was more than 97% in most preparations. The cDNA for human myosin IIIA (8Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was truncated at Gly327, generating a construct containing the kinase domain of myosin IIIa (M3KD). A Myc tag and an octahistidine tag were inserted at the C terminus and subcloned into pFastBac1 vector. M3KD was purified by the same procedure with HuM3MD described above. The protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Steady-state ATPase Assay—The ATPase assays were performed at 25 °C in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). Liberated 32P was measured as described previously (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase assays of HuM3MD in the presence of M3KD were measured in buffer A with 1 mm ATP, 1 μm microcystin-LR (20 units/ml), and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (25Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin Binding Assay—Various concentrations of actin (0.3–1.5 μm) was mixed with 0.5 μm HuM3MD in buffer A containing 1 mm ATP, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged with the Beckman Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge at 300,000 × g for 5 min. Equal proportions of supernatant and dissolved pellet were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and then the band intensities were quantified using the ImageJ software to determine the percentage of HuM3MD bound to pelleted actin. The fraction of HuM3MD bound with actin (F) was plotted as a function of total actin concentration ([A]o). The dissociation constant, Kd, was determined by fitting with Equation 1, [A]o[M]o-([M]o+[A]o+Kd)[AM]+[AM]2=0(Eq. 1) where [M]o represents total HuM3MD concentration, and [AM] = [M]oF. Kinetic Experiments—All transient kinetic experiments were done in buffer A at 25 °C using a Kin-Tek SF-2004 stopped flow apparatus with 150-watt mercury-xenon arc lamp. Fluorescence changes of mantATP and mantADP were measured by fluorescence energy transfer by exciting at 280 nm, and the emission was detected at 400 nm with a long pass filter (Oriel). Pyrene-actin was exited at 360 nm, and the emission was detected at 400 nm with a long pass filter. For 90° light scattering, the excitation beam was passed through a 400-nm interference filter. Quenched flow measurements were performed with KinTek RQF-3 apparatus (KinTek Corp.). Samples of HuM3MD or acto-HuM3MD were mixed with an equal volume of [32P]ATP in buffer A. After aging in the delay line, reactions were stopped by mixing it with a solution containing 0.3 n perchloric acid, and the liberated 32P was measured. All of the transients shown are the average of 3–6 independent mixings. Single exponential data were fit to the equation y = c + a (exp-kobst), and two-exponential data were fit to y = c + a1(exp-kobs1t) + a2(exp-kobs2t), where c is constant and a, a1, and a2 are the amplitude coefficients of reactions with rate constant kobs, kobs1, and kobs2, respectively. Kinetic modeling and simulation based upon Scheme 1 were performed using STELLA software version 8.1.1 (Isee Systems). Expression and Purification of Myosin III Construct—We expressed and purified HuM3MD construct (Fig. 1) that contains only the motor domain. It has been shown that the kinase domain of myosin III autophosphorylates the C-terminal region of the motor domain (8Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we could avoid the potential complexity arising from phosphorylation due to the presence of the N-terminal kinase domain by using the HuM3MD construct without the N-terminal kinase domain. We found that the affinity of CaM light chain for human myosin III heavy chain is relatively low, and the isolated myosin III construct having IQ motifs does not contain saturated amounts of CaM (data not shown). Therefore, we used the HuM3MD construct having the entire motor domain but no IQ domain to avoid complexity arising from the heterogeneity of the molecules in terms of bound CaM. It should be noted that HuM3IQ2, having two IQ motifs in addition to HuM3MD, showed similar Kactin and Vmax to those of HuM3MD in the presence of exogenous calmodulin (not shown). Our approach in this study allowed us to examine the basal kinetic mechanism of human myosin III ATPase cycle. The isolated HuM3MD had an apparent molecular mass of 90.6 kDa, and no small molecular mass bands were observed (Fig. 1B). Steady-state ATPase and Actin Binding Activity of HuM3MD—The steady-state ATPase activity as a function of the actin concentration was measured for HuM3MD (Fig. 2A, Table 1). The basal ATPase activity (0.05 s–1) was markedly activated by actin. The maximum rate of ATPase activity (Vmax) is 0.54 s–1 with Kactin of 0.13 μm. The ATP concentration at half-maximum of the steady-state ATPase rate (KATP) is ∼7-fold increased by actin. The KATP is 8.0 and 53.0 μm in the absence and presence of saturated actin, respectively (Table 1). The addition of exogenous CaM did not influence the actin-activated ATPase activity, consistent with the construct with no IQ motifs. The time course of Pi liberation by acto-HuM3MD was linear within the reaction time (30 min) without the ATP regeneration system, in contrast to myosin V (26De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Steady-state ATPase activity of HuM3MDVmaxKATPKactins-1μmμmWithout actin0.05 ± 0.0028.0 ± 0.4With actin0.54 ± 0.0253.0 ± 2.40.13 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab The steady-state actin binding activity of HuM3MD was examined by the actin co-sedimentation assay in the presence of 1 mm ATP and the ATP regeneration system. The amount of actin-co-precipitated HuM3MD was saturated at a low concentration of actin in the presence of ATP. Fig. 2B shows the fraction of bound HuM3MD plotted against total actin concentration. Based upon Equation 1, a fraction of bound HuM3MD follows the parabolic saturation curve against total actin concentration. Based upon the obtained results, the affinity of HuM3MD to actin was estimated to be 0.15 μm. The value agrees well with the Kactin value of the actin-activated ATPase activity. These results suggest that HuM3MD keeps attaching to actin with high affinity during the ATPase cycle. Actin Binding to HuM3MD—The rate of actin binding to HuM3MD was measured using pyrene-actin. The fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin was rapidly decreased upon the addition of HuM3MD as a result of the binding of HuM3MD to pyrene-actin, as is known for other myosins (27El Mezgueldi M. Tang N. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe S. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7151-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HuM3MD was mixed with pyrene-actin in the presence and absence of ADP, and the time course of the change in the fluorescence intensity was monitored (Fig. 3A, inset). The time course of the change in fluorescence intensity followed a single exponential, and the observed apparent rate constants at various actin concentrations were plotted (Fig. 3A). The binding rate constant increased linearly with actin concentration to yield the second order rate constant (k–6) of 29.8 μm–1 s–1. The dissociation rate constant (k+6) was estimated from the y intercept to be 2.3 s–1. The actin binding rate constant and the dissociation constant were not significantly affected by ADP binding (Fig. 3A). The dissociation of HuM3MD from pyrene-actin was measured by monitoring the increase in the fluorescence intensity upon the addition of unlabeled actin filament in the presence and absence of ADP (Fig. 3B). The change in fluorescence was followed by two exponential kinetics. The value of the fast phase agrees well with the one obtained from the binding assay (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we assessed k+6 = 2.05 s–1, and k+10 = 1.7 s–1 (Table 2). The dissociation constant for the actin binding was thus calculated to be K6 = 68.8 nm in the absence of nucleotide and K10 = 71.4 nm in the presence of ADP.TABLE 2Kinetic and equilibrium constants for actin-activated ATPase of HuM3MDConstantValueSignal/MethodATP bindingK1k+2 (μm-1 s-1)0.14 ± 0.003Mant ATP bindingk-2 (s-1)0.20 ± 0.06Mant ATP bindingK1'k+2'FAST(μ<SC>m</SC>-1s-1)0.16 ± 0.01Mant ATP bindingk-2'FAST(s-1)7.40 ± 0.62Mant ATP bindingK1'k+2'SLOW(μ<SC>m</SC>-1s-1)0.03 ± 0.003Mant ATP bindingk-2'SLOW(s-1)0.53 ± 0.16Mant ATP bindingHydrolysisK32.1Quenched flowk+3 + k-3 (s-1)0.15Quenched flowk+3 (s-1)0.1Quenched flowk-3 (s-1)0.05Quenched flowK3'1.7Quenched flowk+3'+k-3'(s-1)4.3Quenched flowk+3'(s-1)2.7Quenched flowk-3'(s-1)1.6Quenched flowPhosphate releasek+4 (s-1)0.14-0.16Simulationk+4'(s-1)1.14-1.26SimulationADP releasek+5 (s-1)6.5 ± 0.7MantADP offk+5 (s-1)6.5 ± 0.9y intercept of mantADP bindingk-5 (μm-1 s-1)0.40 ± 0.04MantADP bindingK5 (μm)16.3k+5/k-5k+5'(s-1)6.2 ± 0.5MantADP offk+5'(s-1)6.7 ± 1y intercept of mantADP bindingk-5'(μ<SC>m</SC>-1s-1)0.58 ± 0.04MantADP bindingK5'(μ<SC>m</SC>)11.1k+5/k-5'Actin bindingk-6 (μm-1 s-1)29.8 ± 1.4Pyrene-actin bindingk+6 (s-1)2.3 ± 0.5y intercept of pyrene-actin bindingk+6FAST(s-1)1.8 ± 0.2Pyrene-actin offk+6SLOW(s-1)0.20 ± 0.03Pyrene-actin offk+6 (s-1)2.05Average of two different methodsK6 (nm)68.8k+6/k-6k-8FAST(μ<SC>m</SC>-1s-1)92.9Light scatteringk+8FAST(s-1)8.6Light scatteringK8FAST(μ<SC>m</SC>)0.09k+8FAST/k-8FASTk-8SLOW(μ<SC>m</SC>-1s-1)5.7Light scatteringk+8SLOW(s-1)1.23Light scatteringK8SLOW(μ<SC>m</SC>)0.22k+8SLOW/k-8SLOWK9 (μm)0.1-0.3Simulationk-10 (μm-1 s-1)23.8 ± 1.2Pyrene-actin bindingk+10 (s-1)1.4 ± 0.4y intercept of pyrene-actin bindingk+10FAST(s-1)2.0 ± 0.1Pyrene-actin offk+10SLOW(s-1)0.18 ± 0.04Pyrene-actin offk+10 (s-1)1.7Average of two different methodsK10 (nm)71.4k+10/k-10 Open table in a new tab MgATP Binding to HuM3MD and Acto-HuM3MD—The rate of ATP binding to HuM3MD was measured by using the fluorescent nucleotide mantATP (Fig. 4A). The increase in the fluorescence intensity of mantATP upon binding to HuM3MD followed a single exponential (Fig. 4A, inset), and the observed rates are linearly increased with mantATP concentration to yield the second order rate constant for mantATP binding (K1k+2) of 0.14 μm–1 s–1. The extrapolation of the straight line intercepting the y axis at 0.2 s–1 in the absence of actin suggests the presence of the reverse reaction (k–2). The time course of mantATP binding to acto-HuM3MD was best fit to two exponentials (Fig. 4B, inset). The two exponentials are not due to the presence of mantATP isomers (35Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), because the two-exponential fluorescence changes were also observed using 2′-deoxy-mantATP having a single isomer. The amplitude of the fast phase is 60–70%, and the rates are linearly related to the mantATP concentration (Fig. 4B). The obtained second order rate constant determined from the slope (K1′k+′2) was 0.16 μm–1 s–1. The y intercept indicates the dissociation rate of mantATP from acto-HuM3MD (k1′+2) to be 7.4 s–, suggesting that the ATP dissociation rate is significantly increased in the presence of actin. On the other hand, the second order rate constant of the slow phase was 0.03 μm–1 s–1. At present, we do not understand the origin of this slow change in the fluorescence intensity. A large rate constant of the reverse reaction is consistent with the high steady-state KATP value (53 μm) (Table 1) in the presence of actin. MgATP-induced Dissociation of Acto-HuM3MD—It is known that myosin quickly dissociates from actin upon the binding of ATP. The kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of acto-HuM3MD was monitored by measuring the change in the light scattering of acto-HuM3MD after mixing the complex with ATP. The decrease in the light scattering due to the dissociation of HuM3MD from actin followed two exponentials (Fig. 5, inset). The rates of the fast phase are dependent hyperbolically on ATP concentration (Fig. 5). The experiment was done with two different actin concentrations. When acto-HuM3MD (0.03 μm actin) was mixed with ATP, the maximum rate was 11.4 s–1. This value is significantly lower than the rate of ATP binding, suggesting that the maximum value represents the actin dissociation step (k+8 + k–8[actin]). The observed maximum rate constant was significantly increased at higher actin concentration (0.1 μm) to 17.9 s–1. Hence, the second order rate constant for the association step (k–8) was determined to be 92.9 μm–1 s–1. Accordingly, the rate constant for the dissociation acto-HuM3MD (k+8) was calculated to be 8.6 s–1. Based upon these values, 0.09 μm was obtained for the dissociation constant of acto-HuM3MD·ATP (K8). This value is in good agreement with the Kactin determined by the steady-state ATPase and actin binding experiments (Fig. 2). The association rate constant for ATP binding to acto-HuM3MD determined from initial slope (K1′k+′2) was 0.14 ± 0.01 μm–1 s–1, which is consistent with that obtained by measuring directly using mantATP (Fig. 4). The rates of the slow exponential phase were also hyperbolically related to ATP concentration. It could be due to the presence of a different conformer of AM species. But we do not have enough evidence to justify the presence of such a conformer. Quench Flow Measurements of ATP Hydrolysis by HuM3MD and Acto-HuM3MD—Fig. 6 shows the time course of Pi release of a HuM3MD ATPase reaction measured by a quenched flow experiment. Both in the absence and presence of actin, the time course of Pi release showed an initial rapid phase followed by a slow linear phase. It has been known that the initial rapid Pi release phase (Pi-burst) is due to the formation of myosin·ADP·Pi complex, in which the bound Pi is released by acid quench. The observed Pi-burst size was 0.63 mol/mol, suggesting that a significant fraction of HuM3MD is in prehydrolysis form (M·ATP). The ATP binding rate at the given ATP concentration was 2.8 s–1, and the rate of reverse reaction was 0.2 s–1 (Fig. 4), indicating that ∼7% of HuM3MD is present in the ATP-unbound form. Based upon these numbers, the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (K3) was estimated to be 2.1. The observed steady-state rate of Fig. 6A was consistent with that determined by the conventional method (Fig. 2, Table 1). The observed rate constant of the initial phase was 0.14 s–1. This value was rectified by using the rate constants of the ATP binding step at a given ATP concentration to yield 0.15 s–1 for the hydrolysis step (k+3 + k–3). Based upon the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (K3) estimated above, k+3 and k–3 were estimated to be 0.1 and 0.05 s–1, respectively. The rate of ATP hydrolysis step in the absence of actin was quite slow compared with other myosins, such as myosin II, myosin V, and myosin VI, and predominantly explains the steady-state ATPase turnover rate. On the other hand, the initial ATP hydrolysis rate was markedly increased in the presence of actin (Fig. 6B). The observed Pi-burst size was 0.19 mol/mol. Based upon the result of Fig. 4, the rate constants of ATP binding to and ATP dissociation from acto-HuM3MD in the assay conditions are 3.2 and 7.4 s–1, respectively. Accordingly, ∼70% of HuM3MD is the nucleotide-unbound form in the assay conditions. In the presence"

However, the molecular pathways by which platelet factors contribute to tissue regeneration have not been fully elucidated. We have studied the effect of thrombin-activated platelets (TAPs) on cell growth in vivo and in cultured cell systems. Application of TAPs to ulcerative skin lesions of diabetic patients induced local activation of ERK1/2 and Akt/PKB. Moreover, when applied to cultured human skin fibroblasts, TAPs promoted cell growth and DNA synthesis and activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor tyrosine kinases. PDGF was released by TAPs and rapidly achieved a plateau. At variance, the release of IGF-1 was mainly provided by the TAPs-stimulated fibroblasts and progressively increased up to 48 h. The PDGF-R blocker Ag1296 reduced the activation of Akt/PKB and, at a lesser extent, of ERK1/2. Conversely, inhibition of IGF-1 signaling by Ag1024 and expression of a dominant-negative IGF-1R mutant selectively reduced the stimulation of ERK1/2 by TAPs and fibroblast-released factors, with minor changes of Akt/PKB activity. Thus, platelet factors promote fibroblast growth by acutely activating Akt/PKB and ERK1/2. Sustained activation of ERK1/2, however, requires autocrine production of IGF-1 by TAPs-stimulated fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2040489780,"Prostacyclin plays important roles in vascular homeostasis, promoting vasodilatation and inhibiting platelet thrombus formation. Previous studies have shown that three of six cytoplasmic cysteines, particularly those within the C-terminal tail, serve as important lipidation sites and are differentially conjugated to palmitoyl and isoprenyl groups (Miggin, S. M., Lawler, O. A., and Kinsella, B. T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 6947-6958). Here we report distinctive roles for extracellular- and transmembrane-located cysteine residues in human prostacyclin receptor structure-function. Within the extracellular domain, all cysteines (4 of 4) appear to be involved in disulfide bonding interactions (i.e. a highly conserved Cys-92-Cys-170 bond and a putative non-conserved Cys-5-Cys-165 bond), and within the transmembrane (TM) region there are several cysteines (3 of 8) that maintain critical hydrogen bonding interactions (Cys-118 (TMIII), Cys-251 (TMVI), and Cys-202 (TMV)). This study highlights the necessity of sulfhydryl (SH) groups in maintaining the structural integrity of the human prostacyclin receptor, as 7 of 12 extracellular and transmembrane cysteines studied were found to be differentially indispensable for receptor binding, activation, and/or trafficking. Moreover, these results also demonstrate the versatility and reactivity of these cysteine residues within different receptor environments, that is, extracellular (disulfide bonds), transmembrane (H-bonds), and cytoplasmic (lipid conjugation).

Despite significant progress in our understanding of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in general, the details of human prostacyclin receptor structure-function remains largely unknown.Cysteine chemistry is both fascinating and intriguing. The sulfhydryl or thiol (SH) reactive groups of this amino acid are very susceptible to oxidation and can readily form stable dimers (i.e. disulfide S-S bridges), which play important roles in the organization and maintenance of protein tertiary structure. Somewhat analogous to hydroxyl groups (OH) found on serines, sulfhydryl (SH) side chains are also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions and can additionally coordinate trace metals (e.g. zinc) (6Stojanovic A. Stitham J. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35932-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sulfur atoms are also quite nucleophilic and react readily with electrophilic molecules to form a variety of thiol-linked derivatives (e.g. thioethers, thioesters, and thioacetals). Thus, cysteine side chains are common sites for various biological coupling and conjugation reactions, including palmitoylation, isoprenylation, disulfide cross-linking, and thiol-disulfide exchange (7Hayes J.S.

In this study our goal was to assess the structural and functional contributions of cysteines within the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP) receptor. Early mutagenesis studies in bovine rhodopsin (using Cys→ Ser mutations) revealed the importance of amino acids Cys-110 and Cys-187, which are essential in the formation of normal functional rhodopsin protein (10Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It was later shown that these two highly conserved cysteine residues form a disulfide bond in the extracellular domain (11Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17520-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further mutagenesis and mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of this disulfide bond and its importance in stabilizing rhodopsin (12Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Hwa J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of the initial discovery of this imperative disulfide bond within rhodopsin, many other investigations have gone on to demonstrate the presence and importance of similar S-S bonds in other GPCRs (14Fay J.F. Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8757-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Lisenbee C.S. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the thromboxane receptor (TP) at the conserved extracellular S-S cysteine positions (Cys-105 and Cys-183) revealed decreased binding affinity and low amplitude calcium signaling (19D'Angelo D.D.

Biophys. 1996; 334: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to this conserved disulfide bridge, further studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor as well as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor have suggested the presence of a second, non-conserved disulfide bond (8Cook J.V.F. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2800-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R. Karnik S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The C-terminal tail of the human prostacyclin receptor contains six resident cysteines, which have been extensively studied. Five of these cysteine residues are located within CAAX consensus motifs thought to comprise sites for lipid anchoring (e.g. palmitoylation or isoprenylation). Given that a good deal of evidence has already been presented for both palmitoylation as well as isoprenylation at these C-terminal cysteine sites on the human prostacyclin receptor (1Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6947-6958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we have opted to exclude this region from our current investigation. The remaining 12 cysteine residues within the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the hIP receptor were individually converted to alanine using site-directed PCR mutagenesis. We report that in addition to the highly conserved disulfide interaction between Cys-92 (top of transmembrane (TM) III) and Cys-170 (exoloop 2), an additional, putative non-conserved disulfide bridge may exist between Cys-5 (N terminus) and Cys-165 (exoloop 2), within the extracellular domain of the hIP, as well as other prostanoid receptors (hDP and hEP2). Moreover, this interaction seems to serve a critical, yet distinct purpose compared with its conserved counterpart. Furthermore, in the transmembrane domain Cys-118 (TMIII), Cys-202 (TMV), and Cys-251 (TMVI) were found to be necessary for preserving normal receptor binding affinity, activation capacity, and/or cell-surface expression through probable hydrogen bonding networks. Such observations provide further insights into the molecular functioning of the hIP receptor and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of how the hIP protein is stabilized during the continuum of conformational changes that occur upon agonist-induced activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Radiolabeled [3H]iloprost (17.0 Ci/mmol) and nonradiolabeled iloprost were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX), whereas hIP cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Abramovitz (Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada).Cysteine-to-Alanine Mutations—Twelve (within the extracellular and transmembrane domains) of a total of 18 cysteine residues were individually mutated to alanine (Fig. 1A). The choice of amino acid substitution was critical as cysteine-to-serine (Cys→ Ser) mutations in rhodopsin have been shown to have greater adverse effects on receptor conformation than cysteine-to-alanine (Cys→ Ala) substitutions (10Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, the C-terminal residues were not included in this study because these have been extensively characterized (1Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6947-6958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Human IP cDNA tagged at the C terminus with the 1D4 epitope tag (last 14 amino acids of rhodopsin) was cloned into the plasmid vector pMT4, and point mutations were generated using conventional methods of PCR mutagenesis as previously described (23Stitham J. Martin K.A. Hwa J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ten microliters of the PCR product was used to transform competent DH5α Escherichia coli cells (∼2 × 109 cells) followed by DNA extraction from selected clones. Large plasmid preparations were performed using Wizard® Plus Maxiprep kits (Promega, Madison, WI), and all mutant constructs were confirmed via PCR DNA dideoxynucleotide chain-termination sequencing (Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH).Transfection of COS-1 Cells and Membrane Preparations—Transient transfections were performed on COS-1 cells as previously described (24Stitham J. Stojanovic A. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15439-15444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in DNA (10 or 20 μg/plate) in diethylaminoethyldextran (DEAE-dextran; Sigma) (0.2 mg/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and harvested 72 h post-transfection. Transfected COS-1 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Vortexing (providing shear forces) for 3 min in sucrose (0.25 m) was followed by low speed spin (∼1260 × g) for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. After a high speed centrifugation (∼30,000 × g for 15 min) the pellet was then washed twice in 1× HEM (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EGTA, and 12.5 mm MgCl2) followed by re-suspension in 1× HEM containing 10% glycerol and stored at -70 °C (25Stitham J. Stojanovic A. Merenick B.L. O'Hara K.A. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4250-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Either Bradford or BCA protein assays were performed to quantitate membrane proteins.Ligand Binding Affinity—Ligand binding characteristics for the expressed receptors were initially determined through a series of competition binding assays using the radiolabeled ligand [3H]iloprost. Analysis involved construction of reaction mixtures (in duplicate wells) containing 50 μg of membrane, HEM buffer, and 15 nm [3H]iloprost along with 1 of 11 different concentrations of cold (nonradiolabeled) iloprost ranging from 10 μm to 0.1 nm. After 1.5 h of incubation at 4 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and filtered onto Whatman® GF/C glass-fiber filters using a Brandel® cell harvester. The filters were washed 5 times with ice-cold Tris/HCl buffer, and radioactivity was measured in the presence of 5 ml of Ecoscint™ H scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 500-fold excess of nonradiolabeled iloprost. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® software (GraphPad software, Inc., San Diego, CA). IC50 values were converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, and Ki values were expressed as a mean ± S.E. For saturation binding experiments to determine Bmax and KD, the concentration of [3H]iloprost was varied from 1 to 100 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 500-fold excess of nonradiolabeled iloprost. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® software (GraphPad Software). Analysis of variance and Student's t tests were used to determine significant differences (p < 0.05).Receptor Activation cAMP Determination—The wild-type and cysteine mutant constructs were analyzed for signal transduction capabilities. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of receptor DNA in 25-mm plates as described above. [3H]cAMP was used in competition for a cAMP-binding protein against known concentrations of nonradiolabeled cAMP followed by determination of the unknowns. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. Charcoal was used to remove excess unbound cAMP. Samples were counted in 5 ml of Ecoscint™ H (National Diagnostics). Results were analyzed with GraphPad Prism® software. For the dose response, a non-linear, curve-fitting program (GraphPad Prism®) was used, and the EC50 (mean ± S.E.) was determined for wild-type hIP1D4 and mutant constructs. Analysis of variance and Student's t tests were used to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-1 cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates containing sterilized poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-treated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1.0 μg/ml wild-type or mutant (C5A, C92A, C165A, and C170A) hIP DNA according to the aforementioned transfection protocol. Cells were fixed and permeabilized 48 h post-transfection in ice-cold methanol. Prostacyclin receptors were labeled using anti-1D4 monoclonal antibody (C-terminal-tagged hIP), 1:1000 dilution, for 60-90 min followed by goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 AlexaFluor®568 fluorescent antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) 1:200 dilution, for 60-90 min. The endoplasmic reticulum was labeled using anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies), 1:400 dilution, for 60-90 min followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor®488 fluorescent antibody (Molecular Probes), 1:200 dilution, for 60-90 min. Cells were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka) for 5 min, mounted with ProLong Gold with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and examined via confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System (i.e. inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with two conventional photomultipliers and one meta polychromatic multi-channel detector) (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Representative cells were selected, and images were captured at high resolution (63×) for cytoplasmic or plasma membrane localization.Molecular Modeling of hIP Receptor—A theoretical, three-dimensional homology model of the seven transmembrane α-helices of the hIP was constructed using the internet-based protein-modeling server, SWISS-MODEL (GlaxoSmithKline) (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar). The homology model was generated using the 2.8-Å-resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of bovine rhodopsin as the template (PDB code 1HZX). The transmembrane domains were energy-minimized, utilizing the Gromos96 force field to improve the stereochemistry of the model and remove unfavorable clashes (SWISS-MODEL). Polypeptide chains corresponding to the extracellular and cytoplasmic loop regions were manually constructed. The large C-terminal tail region of the hIP was excluded from this particular model. Initial torsion angles were derived from full polypeptide secondary structure prediction using the JPred multiple sequence alignment consensus server (27Cuff A.a.C.M.E.J. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The subsequent loop peptides were energy-minimized using the NAMD molecular dynamics simulator (28Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12926) Google Scholar). Resulting structures were sequentially attached to the transmembrane homology model. Compiled structures were energy-minimized using NAMD, including constraints for either 1) no extracellular disulfide bonds, 2) a single, conserved extracellular disulfide bond (Cys-92-Cys-170), or 3) dual extracellular disulfide bonds (Cys-92-Cys-170 and Cys-5-Cys-165). This latter structure, with dual extracellular (disulfide) constraints, yielded the lowest energy conformation and was utilized as the preferred hIP receptor model for subsequent comparisons. Although our model was a useful first pass tool in providing preliminary insights and predictions of sulfhydryl hIP structure function, biochemical and molecular pharmacological techniques were necessary to confirm our hypothesis.RESULTSOur current knowledge of the hIP receptor is limited. Of particular interest has been the role of cysteine residues within the extracellular and TM domains of the protein. Cysteines contain a highly nucleophilic sulfhydryl or thiol (SH) side chain that is capable of acting as a nucleophilic catalyst. Moreover, with a pKa of ∼8, the chemical reactivity of cysteine sulfhydryls is easily modified by environmental conditions. Within a reducing environment, cysteine residues may be involved in bioconjugation reactions, whereas conversely, within an oxidizing environment, side chains may dimerize to form disulfide (S-S) linkages. These latter interactions play an invaluable role in intramolecular cross-linking of proteins that can increase molecular stability within harsh environments as well as confer resistance to proteolytic cleavage. We wished to elucidate the differential contributions of conserved and non-conserved cysteines within the transmembrane region of the hIP receptor as well as explore the potential existence of a second, putative non-conserved disulfide bond within the extracellular domain.Extracellular Cysteines Are Required for Receptor Trafficking, Binding, and Activation—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed targeting all cysteine residues present within the hIP receptor, excluding those located in the C-terminal tail. Thus, 12 of the total 18 cysteine residues (Table 1, Fig. 1A) were individually mutated to alanine (Cys→ Ala) and assessed for functional effects on agonist binding (affinity) and receptor activation (potency), as measured via cAMP production. Binding affinity (Ki) could not be detected using competition binding (15 nm [3H]iloprost) for individual mutations of all four extracellular cysteines (C5A, C92A, C165A, and C170A) (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Only with saturation binding using increasing concentrations of [3H]iloprost could binding affinities (Table 2, Fig. 2B) be determined. These binding affinities are estimates due an inability to saturate the expressed receptors (Fig. 2B). They nevertheless indicate severe defects in binding affinity. Related to the severe binding defects, potency (EC50) values could not be determined due to negligible efficacy (Table 1). These results demonstrate the severity of functional perturbation with mutation of any one of the four extracellular cysteine residues within the hIP and lend preliminary support to the notion that 1) the highly conserved Cys-92 and Cys-170 may form a disulfide bond (Fig. 1B), and 2) an alternative interaction may exist between the remaining extracellular cysteines Cys-5 and Cys-165 (perhaps a second disulfide bond), which appears to be equally important for hIP receptor binding and activation.TABLE 1Functional comparison of binding affinity (Ki from competition binding using 15 nm [3H]iloprost and 1 μg of DNA/ml transfection solution) and dose-response (EC50), characteristics for wild-type hIP and cysteine-to-alanine mutationsKi ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Estimates of cell surface trafficking using saturation binding on plasma membrane preparations confirmed decreased plasma membrane expression for all four extracellular Cys→ Ala substitutions compared with wild-type hIP (Table 1). The additional use of confocal microscopy corroborated reduced cell surface expression and demonstrated defective trafficking with endoplasmic reticulum co-localization (calnexin) and retention (Fig. 2C). Wild-type hIP predominantly trafficked to the cell surface as observed with the red fluorescence surrounding the cell in the phase contrast micrograph overlay (Fig. 2C). Because of the nature of overexpression systems, some wild-type hIP was also detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum as observed with co-localization with the green fluorescence. Both C5A and C165A showed a marked reticular pattern co-localized predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum, with reduced cell surface. C92A and C170A were also found predominantly in an endoplasmic reticulum location (perinuclear), again with reduced cell surface expression. Thus, in conjunction with the findings from previous binding and activation studies, these results also show defects for the four extracellular cysteines, suggesting that there may be dual functional connections between the highly conserved Cys-92-Cys-170 and the less conserved Cys-5-Cys-165.Sequence Alignments and Treatment with Reducing Agents Suggest Formation of Dual Extracellular Disulfide Bonds (Cys-5 to Cys-165 and Cys-92 to Cys-170)—In addition to our initial experimental findings, further supportive evidence that a second disulfide bond exists between the non-conserved extracellular cysteine residues Cys-5 and Cys-165 can be found in human prostanoid receptor sequence alignments (Fig. 1B), which shows that both residues are either exclusively present or exclusively absent within the various prostanoid receptors. One of the cysteines (Cys-5 or Cys-165) is always found in the presence of the other. Thus, at equivalent positions within the human IP, EP2, and DP receptors, both the Cys-5 and Cys-165 residues are found, whereas conversely, at equivalent positions within the human EP1, EP3, EP4, TP, and FP receptors, both cysteines are absent (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Cys-92 and Cys-170 are conserved at equivalent positions among all the prostanoid receptors, suggesting that Cys-92 interacts with Cys-170, and (when present) Cys-5 interacts with Cys-165.If critical disulfide (S-S) bonds are present within the extracellular domain of the hIP receptor, then chemical reduction of the wild-type receptor should be associated with defects in structure (folding-conformation-stability) and function (binding and activation). Competition binding was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1.4-140 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME; Fig. 3A) and 1-100 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (Fig. 3B), which break disulfide (S-S) bonds and maintain sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced state. As can be viewed in Fig. 3, a sequential decrease in agonist binding was observed for wild-type hIP receptors treated with increasing concentrations of either 1,4-dithiothreitol or β-ME. The significant difference and decline in raw counts (specific binding) in response to increasingly higher concentrations of reducing agent is indicative of an increasing pool of defective IP (i.e. reduced S-S bonds to SH). Clear sigmoidal competition binding curves suggest a population of receptors in which the disulfide bond remained intact. As shown, the IC50 values, measured in log-fold molar concentrations of iloprost agonist, log[iloprost](m), remained unchanged for wild-type hIP -7.4 ± 0.2 log m (untreated), -7.4 ± 0.2 log m (1.4 mm β-ME), -7.6 ± 0.3 log m (14 mm β-ME), and -7.8 ± 0.4 log m (140 mm β-ME) (Fig. 3A). A corresponding decrease in cAMP signaling levels was also observed, demonstrating a parallel reduction in the levels of functioning receptor (Fig. 4B) with no significant change in EC50 -9.3 ± 0.4 log m (wild-type hIP-untreated), -9.4 ± 0.8 log m (140 mm β-ME), and -9.5 ± 0.8 log m (14 mm β-ME). Additional evidence, albeit indirect, for the presence of dual disulfide bonds can be gleaned from the observation that the low levels of specific binding for both the C92A and C170A mutations quickly dissipates upon the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5), implying further reduction of a"
https://openalex.org/W2079834807,"Kinesin-3 motors have been shown to transport cellular cargo along microtubules and to function according to mechanisms that differ from the conventional hand-over-hand mechanism. To find out whether the mechanisms described for Kif1A and CeUnc104 cover the full spectrum of Kinesin-3 motors, we characterize here NcKin3, a novel member of the Kinesin-3 family that localizes to mitochondria of ascomycetes. We show that NcKin3 does not move in a K-loop-dependent way as Kif1A or in a cluster-dependent way as CeUnc104. Its in vitro gliding velocity ranges between 0.30 and 0.64 μm/s and correlates positively with motor density. The processivity index (kbi,ratio) of ∼3 reveals that not more than three ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per productive microtubule encounter. The NcKin3 duty ratio of 0.03 indicates that the motor spends only a minute fraction of the ATPase cycle attached to the filament. Unlike other Kinesin-3 family members, NcKin3 forms stable dimers, but only one subunit releases ADP in a microtubule-dependent fashion. Together, these data exclude a processive hand-over-hand mechanism of movement and suggest a power-stroke mechanism where nucleotide-dependent structural changes in a single motor domain lead to displacement of the motor along the filament. Thus, NcKin3 is the first plus end-directed kinesin motor that is dimeric but moves in a nonprocessive fashion to its destination. Kinesin-3 motors have been shown to transport cellular cargo along microtubules and to function according to mechanisms that differ from the conventional hand-over-hand mechanism.

The NcKin3 duty ratio of 0.03 indicates that the motor spends only a minute fraction of the ATPase cycle attached to the filament. Unlike other Kinesin-3 family members, NcKin3 forms stable dimers, but only one subunit releases ADP in a microtubule-dependent fashion. Together, these data exclude a processive hand-over-hand mechanism of movement and suggest a power-stroke mechanism where nucleotide-dependent structural changes in a single motor domain lead to displacement of the motor along the filament. Thus, NcKin3 is the first plus end-directed kinesin motor that is dimeric but moves in a nonprocessive fashion to its destination. The kinesin superfamily of proteins contains molecular motors that move along microtubules. Members of the founding class, Kinesin-1 (conventional), move according to the socalled hand-over-hand mechanism that leads to processive motility (1Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves two motor heads that alternately bind to the microtubule and produce a stepwise progression of the motor. It implies that the catalytic cycles of the motor heads alternate because the nucleotide state of the catalytic domain determines the microtubule affinity (2Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This mechanism is referred to as alternating site catalysis, and has been proven by measuring the consecutive release of ADP from head 1 and 2 of the kinesin dimer (3Hackney D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). ADP release experiments show that half of the enzyme-bound ADP is liberated upon interaction with the microtubule and the other half upon addition of ATP. Afterward, the motor continues to perform processive catalytic cycles because of the interlaced interaction of both motor heads. In agreement, the rate of the second ADP release is at least as fast as the stepping rate. The kinetic model of alternating site catalysis is consistent with the hand-over-hand mechanism that predicts shifted phases of the kinetic cycles of both motor heads. All Kinesin-1 motors investigated so far conform to this model.Conversely, the nonprocessive Kinesin-14 motor Ncd does not show the ADP release pattern typical for alternating site catalysis. Ncd is a homodimeric kinesin from Drosophila melanogaster and is involved in mitosis and meiosis (6Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walker R.A. Salmon E.D. Endow S.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It moves to the microtubule minus end, and it most likely generates motility because of a molecular power stroke (9McDonald H.B. Stewart R.J. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 1990; 63: 1159-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Endres N.F. Yoshioka C. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 2006; 439: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ADP release also occurs in two steps, one that is triggered by microtubule binding, and one that is induced by nucleotide binding. By contrast to conventional kinesin, however, Ncd dissociates from the microtubule at a rate in the range of kcat, implying that the motor dissociates after one kinetic cycle. The ADP release behavior of Kinesin-1 and Ncd therefore reveals two opposing motility mechanisms, namely processive hand-over-hand motility and nonprocessive power stroke motility. These types of motility, however, do not cover the entire spectrum of kinesin mechanisms. The Kinesin-3-type motor KIF1A has been reported to move continuously along microtubules in a quasi-processive manner, although the constructs used were monomeric (16Kikkawa M. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 100: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These truncated motor constructs also change their microtubule affinity in a nucleotide-dependent fashion but do not dissociate from the filament in their weak microtubule-binding state. They do not avoid dissociation by alternating microtubule interactions but by the action of a positively charged, lysine-rich region (K-loop). This loop binds to the negatively charged, glutamate-rich C terminus of tubulin, the E-hook. This interaction allows lateral sliding of Kinesin-3 proteins to the next binding site and prevents detachment from the microtubule.It is controversial whether all Kinesin-3 motors work as described for KIF1A. Dictyostelium discoideum DdUnc104, for example, is constitutively dimeric, and thus could move in principle by a hand-over-hand mechanism (21Pollock N. de Hostos E.L. Turck C.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Caenorhabditis elegans CeUnc104 has been reported to move nonprocessively (22Pierce D.W. Hom-Booher N. Otsuka A.J. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5412-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CeUnc104 becomes a processive motor if dimerization is enforced either by high local motor concentrations or by insertion of an artificial dimerization domain (23Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In vivo the switch between the monomeric and the dimeric state might regulate cargo transport (24Klopfenstein D.R. Tomishige M. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Remarkably, C. elegans or D. discoideum Unc104 have not been investigated in stoichiometric or kinetic ADP release assays that might support or disprove half-site catalysis. All KIF1A and KIF1C constructs that have been characterized previously were monomeric (25Rogers K.R. Weiss S. Crevel I. Brophy P.J. Geeves M. Cross R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5101-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, half-site catalysis cannot occur.Given the fundamental functional differences among different Kinesin-3 motors, it is interesting to know whether this class of kinesins is based on a common underlying mechanism. If not, it is interesting why phylogenetically related proteins developed divergent mechanisms. To address these questions, we cloned a novel Kinesin-3 member, NcKin-3 from Neurospora crassa, which is involved in transporting and shaping mitochondria (26Fuchs F. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We show that NcKin3 is a dimeric, plus end-directed microtubule motor whose gliding velocity correlates positively with the motor density on the coverslip. Comparison of Km,ATP values in gliding and ATPase assays indicates a low duty ratio. This, together with a low processivity index (kbi,ratio), suggests that NcKin3 is not processive. In agreement, the motor detaches at a rate comparable with the steady-state ATP turnover rate from the filament. Remarkably, only one of the motor heads releases ADP in a microtubule-dependent fashion. The second head loses ADP at a constant microtubule-independent rate. Together, our study presents the first description of a nonprocessive, plus end-directed kinesin vesicle motor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The DNA encoding NcKin3 was isolated from a mycelial cDNA library of N. crassa (27Orbach M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (NCU03715.2 in N. crassa genome release 7). For recombinant expression NcKin3 was cloned into a pT7.7 vector (28Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). A C-terminal truncated version of NcKin3, consisting only of 558 amino acids (NcKin3-558), was generated from pT7.7-NcKin3 by PCR. A short peptide sequence was added to NcKin3-558 that adds a reactive cysteine to the protein. This allows labeling with maleimide compounds (PSIVHRKCF (29Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). At the C terminus of NcKin3-558, an NgoMIV restriction site was inserted for the addition of amino acids 432-546 of human kinesin tail (hTail). 3The abbreviations used are: hTail, human kinesin tail; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Aces, 2-[(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. The hTail DNA was transferred from an NcKinhTail pT7-based plasmid (30Bathe F. Hahlen K. Dombi R. Driller L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and inserted into pT7.7-NcKin3-558 via the NgoMIV and HindIII restriction sites.For protein expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene Inc., San Diego). Cells were grown in ampicillin and chloramphenicol containing TPM medium (20 g/liter tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, 2.5 g/liter Na2HPO4, 1 g/liter NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose). Expression was induced at an A580 of 0.4 to 0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 22 °C. Cells were harvested and stored at -70 °C.Proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a High Trap SP-Sepharose column as described (Fig. 1B) (31Schafer F. Deluca D. Majdic U. Kirchner J. Schliwa M. Moroder L. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Peak fractions were supplied with 10% glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and via the absorption at a wavelength of 280 nm.Determination of the Oligomerization State—To characterize the oligomerization state of NcKin3, the Svedberg coefficient and the Stokes radius were determined by density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration (32Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The molecular weight was calculated according to Equation 1 (33Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. 2. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 591-685Google Scholar), Mr=(sw,20×nA×6π×η×rStokes)/(1-ν×ρ)(Eq. 1) where nA is Avogadro's number; η is viscosity (10-3 n ms-2); ν is specific volume of the sample (0.725 cm3/g), and ρ is the density of the medium (1.0 g/cm3).Gliding Assays and Polarity Marked Microtubules—For gliding assays at high NcKin3 concentrations, NcKin3-558cys was labeled with biotin-maleimide (32Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein was incubated with a 4-fold excess of maleimide conjugate on ice for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol. Active motors were selected in a microtubule binding and release step (34Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar).A flow cell was incubated with 1 mg/ml streptavidin (Sigma) in BRB80+ (80 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA), which was filled with biotin-labeled NcKin3 in motility buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 20 μm paclitaxel, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mg/ml casein in BRB80+) after washing with blocking buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mg/ml casein in BRB80+), incubated for additional 5 min, and filled with microtubules in motility buffer. Gliding of the microtubules was observed in a Zeiss Axiophot using video-enhanced phase contrast microscopy at 22 °C and analyzed manually (32Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To measure the concentration dependence of the velocity, the hTail-tagged version of NcKin3-558 was used. Fluorescently labeled microtubules were observed in a total internal reflection microscope, and their velocity was measured using software from Olympus Biosystems (Planegg, Germany). For statistical analysis Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego) were used.Basal ATPase Activity—Slow steady-state ATPase rates in the absence of polymerized tubulin were measured using [γ-32P]ATP (35Shimizu T. Thorn K.S. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5265-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NcKin3 (5 μm) was incubated in 12A25+ buffer (12.5 mm Aces-KOH, 25 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m EGTA, pH 6.8) with 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP at 22 °C. After various time points, the reaction was quenched in 0.3 m perchloric acid. A suspension of charcoal in 1 mm NaH2PO4 was added, mixed, and centrifuged to separate the charcoal. After determination of the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP solution, γ-32P-labeled inorganic phosphate in the supernatant was quantified by scintillation counting. The ATPase rates were calculated from the hyperbolic fits of the time traces.Steady-state ATPase—Microtubule activated steady-state ATPase rates were determined in a coupled enzymatic assay (36Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 12A25+ buffer at 22 °C. K0.5,MT was determined at an ATP concentration of 1 mm. The microtubule concentration was maintained at ∼10 μm for titrations with ATP. NcKin3 concentrations were typically 1 μm. Tubulin was purified from pig brain as described (37Mandelkow E.M. Herrmann M. Rühl U. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Microtubules were obtained by spinning a freshly thawed tubulin aliquot at 120,000 × g and 4 °C, supplementing the supernatant with 1 mm GTP and 20 μm paclitaxel, and removing excess nucleotides by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Finally, the microtubule pellet was suspended in 12A25+, 20 μm paclitaxel, and the protein concentration determined at 280 nm (3Hackney D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Stochiometry of Mant-ADP Release—NcKin3 was incubated with equimolar amounts of mant-ATP for 30 min on ice. The final kinesin concentration in the assay was 0.9 μm. The fluorescence decrease caused by mant-ADP release was observed in an Aminco Bowman spectrofluorometer (32Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was excited at 356 nm and the emission detected at 445 nm. All experiments were performed at 22 °C in 12A25+ buffer. Microtubules were treated with apyrase prior to the centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Microtubule concentrations ranged between 1 and 11 μm. To release mant-ADP from the second head, an excess of unlabeled ATP (1 mm) was added subsequently.Pre-steady-state Mant-ADP Release—NcKin3 was incubated with a 4-fold excess of mant-ATP for 30 min on ice. Excess nucleotide was removed by gel filtration in Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The labeling ratio was calculated from the extinctions at 280 nm (ϵ = 38,000 m-1 cm-1) and 356 nm (ϵ = 5,800 m-1 cm-1). Pre-steady-state mant-ADP release was measured in a BioLogic stopped-flow apparatus (SFM-3; BioLogic Inc., Grenoble, France) at 22 °C in 12A25+ buffer. Fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected at 442 nm using a band pass interference filter of ±10 nm width (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). A final concentration of 400 nm mant-ADP-labeled NcKin3 was rapidly mixed with 0-12 μm microtubules in the presence of 1 mm ATP (final concentrations). The traces shown are averages of at least five stopped-flow traces. All traces obeyed single exponential behavior and were fitted using either the software BioKine (BioLogic Inc., Grenoble, France) or TableCurve2D (Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA). The rates showed a hyperbolic dependence on the microtubule concentration and were fitted according to Equation 2, y=B+kmax[Mt]/([Mt]+K0.5,MT)(Eq. 2) The constants presented in this work are averages from three independent experiments.Cosedimentation Assay—Increasing amounts of NcKin3-558 (1-25 μm) in BRB80+ buffer were mixed with 2 μm microtubules in the presence of 1 mm ADP or 1 mm AMP-PNP. The samples were mixed and then centrifuged in a Beckman Optima 100 ultracentrifuge (100,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were carefully removed and mixed with SDS sample buffer. The pellets were resuspended in BRB80+ and stopped in PAGE sample buffer. Pellet and supernatant samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Colloidal Blue staining (Invitrogen). Gel photos were taken with the EagleEye CCD camera system (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) and quantified using the ImageJ software. The concentrations of motors in pellet and supernatant were analyzed with SigmaPlot Software (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Binding parameters were calculated from a hyperbolic curve fit.Detachment Rates—The microtubule detachment kinetics of NcKin3 was determined by the change of light scattering in two assays. (i) For stopped-flow assays, the NcKin3 microtubule complex was formed by incubating NcKin3-558 with a 1.5-fold excess of microtubules in the presence of 0.01 unit/ml apyrase (Sigma). Subsequently, 0.4 μm of the complex (final concentration) was mixed with ATP (0-64 μm) in a stopped-flow apparatus (BioLogic Inc., Grenoble, France). The sample was illuminated at a wavelength of 436 nm, and the light scattering signal was observed through a 440 ± 10 nm band-pass filter. At least five traces of each ATP concentration were used for averaging. Averaged traces were analyzed by single exponential curve fitting using the TableCurve2D software (Systat Software Inc.). The observed rates were plotted against the ATP concentration and fitted according to Equation 3, y=kmax,binding+kmax,detachment×[ATP]/([ATP]+[K0.5,ATP])(Eq. 3) Detachment of NcKin3 from the microtubule was also (ii) measured via the light scattering signal in a flash-photolysis apparatus, described in detail in the Supplemental Material.RESULTSUnusual Structural Features of NcKin3—NcKin3 was found at mitochondria of the ascomycete N. crassa, suggesting that it is an organelle motor and responsible for the transport and shaping of mitochondria (26Fuchs F. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To study the mechanistic basis of this motor, we isolated the DNA from a mycelial cDNA library and cloned it into a bacterial expression vector (27Orbach M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Galagan J.E. Calvo S.E. Borkovich K.A. Selker E.U. Read N.D. Jaffe D. FitzHugh W. Ma L.J. Smirnov S. Purcell S.

Nature. 2003; 422: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The coding sequence includes 1947 bp that code for a protein of 647 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa. Note-worthy, the cDNA sequence consists of a 5′ extension that codes for 37 N-terminal amino acids that are not part of the conserved motor domain (Fig. 1). The NcKin3 motor domain sequence reveals a clear membership in the Kinesin-3 subfamily (39Schoch C.L. Aist J.R. Yoder O.C. Gillian Turgeon B. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2003; 39: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the molecule shows several unusual features. For example, BLAST searches with the N-terminal extension in the GenBank™ data base fail to detect any similarities outside fungal Kinesin-3s. The functional role is unclear because a truncated mutant (amino acids 38-558) of NcKin3 lacking the extension shows the same microtubule-activated steady-state ATPase rate and half-maximal activation constant for microtubules as the construct with the extension (amino acid 1-558; data not shown). As another distinctive feature, NcKin3 and other short fungal Kinesin-3 motors possess a much shorter and less charged K-loop region (typically 1 Arg and 1 Lys residue, separated by 2-3 residues; Fig. 1A). Finally, the C-terminal nonmotor part is unusually short (about 200 amino acids), does not contain forkhead-associated or pleckstrin homology domains, and does not show homology to other Kinesin-3 clades. Curiously, the last 90 residues form a cluster that contains 21 Asp and 7 Glu residues that result in a highly negative net charge of the tail.The recombinant full-length protein was active in ATPase and gliding assays but poorly expressed. Also, the preparation contained significant degradation products. Therefore, we cloned truncated versions lacking parts of the C terminus (Fig. 1B). The longest truncation, NcKin3-558 was used in most experiments described here, and a reactive cysteine was added at the C terminus, allowing modifications with maleimide labels (29Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Bathe F. Hahlen K. Dombi R. Driller L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The truncated, biotin-tagged NcKin3-558 kinesin was equally fast in gliding assays as the recombinant full-length NcKin3 protein.NcKin3 Is a Dimer—Automatic and manual analysis of the NcKin3 stalk sequence predicts the formation of a two-stranded coiled coil between residues 437 and 513, although some heptads deviate significantly from the ideal repeat pattern, and the start of the helix is uncertain (Fig. 1A). Coiled coils contain characteristic periodic repeats of seven amino acid residues numbered a-g, where positions a and d are mostly hydrophobic, and e and g are often charged or hydrophilic (40Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3450) Google Scholar, 42McDonnell A.V. Jiang T. Keating A.E. Berger B. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the case of NcKin3, the start of the coiled coil can be predicted as early as at residue 427, but then a change of the coil phase would occur after residue 441 (shift from a to f position).In agreement with the prediction, gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation assays revealed that NcKin3 is dimeric (Fig. 2) (43Andrews P. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1970; 18: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two longest constructs, NcKin3-558 and -513 are stable dimers, suggesting that the full-length protein is also dimeric. Shorter constructs (NcKin3-415, -434, -457, -470, and -488) are monomeric, implying that the last three predicted coil heptads are crucial for dimer stability (Fig. 1). Conversely, the first seven predicted heptads are not sufficient for dimerization in truncated constructs but, as shown below, are still functionally important. With the exception of D. discoideum Unc104, all other Kinesin-3 motors have been reported to be primarily monomeric (21Pollock N. de Hostos E.L. Turck C.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D.

Res. 2005; 65: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As NcKin3 does not show similarity to DdUnc104 outside the motor domain, it contains a so far unknown dimerization domain.FIGURE 2Dimerization of NcKin3. The upper part of the figure shows example elution profiles of truncated NcKin3 mutants on a gel filtration column (A) and an SDS gel of a sucrose density gradient centrifugation (B). The quantification (“Experimental Procedures”) resulted in Stokes radii, and sedimentation coefficients summarized in the table (C) and served to calculate the oligomerization state of the constructs. Only proteins containing more than two-thirds of the predicted coiled coil form dimers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Features of NcKin3 Motility—To find out whether NcKin3 is a microtubule motor, we performed multiple motor gliding assays. At saturating motor densities on the surface of the flow chamber, microtubules were transported with a maximum velocity of 0.59 ± 0.09 μm/s (average ± S.E., n = 65 microtubules), which is slow compared with gliding velocities of other Unc104 motors (v = 1.2 to 2.5 μm/s (19Okada Y.

https://openalex.org/W2147509503,"Gastric mucosal inflammation causes hypergastrinemia, and gastrin receptors have been detected in several leukocyte types. We have analyzed whether gastrin affects the leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in vivo by monitoring leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and emigration in rat mesenteric venules using intravital microscopy. Mesenteric superfusion with exogenous gastrin increased these processes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, effects prevented by the cholecystokinin (CCK)-2 receptor antagonists (proglumide, L-365,260) but not by the CCK-1 receptor antagonist devazepide. A similar response was induced by exogenous CCK or endogenously released gastrin. CCK-2 receptors were localized in mesenteric macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This effect of gastrin is not modulated by somatostatin and is independent of the endogenous release of histamine. To analyze whether hypergastrinemia elicited by Helicobacter pylori (HP) modulates the inflammation induced by the germ, rats were chronically administered with an extract of a CagA+/VacA+ strain of HP. This protocol increased gastrinemia and induced an inflammatory response in the rat mesentery. Blockade of CCK-2 receptors attenuated this response and induced a qualitative change in the leukocyte infiltrate suggestive of a receding inflammatory process. Our results reveal a new proinflammatory role of gastrin that seems to contribute to the maintenance of the inflammation elicited by HP components."

Nmd3p binds to the pre-60 S subunit in the nucleus. After export to the cytoplasm, the release of Nmd3p depends on the ribosomal protein Rpl10p and the GTPase Lsg1p. Here, we have carried out a mutational analysis of Nmd3 to better define the domains responsible for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and ribosome binding. We show that mutations in two regions of Nmd3p affect 60 S binding, suggesting that its binding to the subunit is multivalent.

We show that mutations in two regions of Nmd3p affect 60 S binding, suggesting that its binding to the subunit is multivalent. Yeast Nmd3p is a 59-kDa shuttling protein that is required for export of 60 S ribosomal subunits out of the nucleus (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell.

Nmd3p binds to nascent 60 S subunits in the nucleus and provides a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) 4The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; aa, amino acids; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein. that is recognized by the export receptor Crm1. This export function of Nmd3p is conserved in metazoans (3Thomas F. Kutay U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2409-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4Trotta C.R. Lund E. Kahan L. Johnson A.W. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, Nmd3p homologs are also present in archaea, suggesting a more ancient function of this protein that predates the development of the nuclear envelope. We have recently shown that release of Nmd3p depends on the loading of the essential large subunit protein Rpl10p (5Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6West M. Hedges J.B. Chen A. Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3802-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, Nmd3p may stabilize an intermediate of ribosome assembly prior to Rpl10p loading. Interestingly, in the euryarchaea, Nmd3p is expressed as a fusion to an eIF5A-like domain (7Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the function of eIF5A in translation is not well established, the association of Nmd3 and eIF5A in archaea suggests that they have related functions. Yeast Nmd3p is 518 amino acids in length. The leucine-rich NES is within its C-terminal 50 amino acids (amino acids 470–518) (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix. Upstream of the NES is a putative coiled-coil region (aa 426–465) that could mediate intra- or intermolecular protein interactions, possibly to facilitate interaction of the NES or NLS with transport receptors. It has been suggested that this domain contains a secondary NES (NES2) (2Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) that can functionally substitute for the primary NES. Additionally, Nmd3p contains a highly basic region (aa 399–419) that is necessary for efficient import of Nmd3p into the nucleus (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in a Kap123p-dependent manner (8Sydorskyy Y. Dilworth D.J. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Wozniak R.W. Aitchison J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2042-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These C-terminal shuttling motifs are found in the eukaryotic Nmd3 proteins but not in their archaeal counterparts. The N-terminal 27 kDa of Nmd3p comprises the domain that is conserved in all archaeal Nmd3 proteins. An additional 9 kDa is conserved among the euryarchaeotic proteins that also contain a C-terminal eIF5A-like domain (7Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The highly conserved N-terminal domain contains four Cys-X2-Cys repeats that are probably zinc binding motifs reminiscent of Type IV zinc fingers (9Teakle G.R. Gilmartin P.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 100-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and treble clef motifs (10Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This potential zinc-coordinating domain in Nmd3p is probably required for protein-RNA and/or protein-protein interaction with the 60 S subunit; however, this has not been established experimentally. In lieu of three-dimensional structural information for Nmd3p, we present a mutational analysis of the functional organization of Nmd3p, utilizing point mutations as well as deletion mutations.

All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Loss of Function Mutants—The NMD3 open reading frame was mutagenized by PCR using TaqDNA polymerase and primers AJO106 (GCCGCTCGAGACACCATGGAATTCACACCTATA) and AJO305 (TCCCCCGGGCTGCTGAGATTCAACGGG) as described previously (14Page A.M. Davis K. Molineux C. Kolodner R.D. Johnson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3707-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cotransformed with BsgI-digested pAJ538 into the nmd3Δ ade2 ade3 strain AJY1414 containing pAJ363 (NMD3, URA3, ADE3). The presence of this plasmid results in red colonies, whereas cells that have lost the plasmid give rise to white or sectored colonies. Transformants that gave rise to solid red colonies, indicating an inability to lose the wild-type NMD3 plasmid, were picked for further analysis. Extracts were prepared from cultures of these mutants and screened by Western blotting for the expression of the C-terminal c-Myc tag. Isolates that did not express the c-Myc tag were assumed to contain truncation mutants and discarded. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were monoclonal α-c-Myc (9E10) for the primary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Covance), and the secondary antibody was Cy2-conjugated α-mouse antibody (1:300 dilution; Jackson IRL). DNA was stained with DAPI. Fluorescence was visualized on a Nikon E800 microscope fitted with a ×100 objective and a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT II camera controlled with SPOT software. Images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. GFP Localization—Culture conditions are given in the corresponding figure legends. Cultured cells were fixed with a 1:9 volume of 37% formaldehyde for 40 min. The cells were washed twice with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, 1.2 m sorbitol. 0.05% Triton X-100 was added to permeabilize cells. After 4 min, 1 μg/ml DAPI was added to stain nuclei. After an additional 2 min, cells were washed twice with PBS and visualized as described for indirect immunofluorescence. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations of Myctagged Nmd3 proteins, cultures were grown as indicated in the respective figure legends. All subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells were thawed and washed in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A). The cells were resuspended in one volume of immunoprecipitation buffer, and extracts were made by glass bead lysis (5 × 50 s with 1-min intervals on ice). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 1.5 μl of α-c-Myc (9E10 monoclonal; Covance) antibody was added to equal A260 units of sample supernatants and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were then added, and rocking was continued for an additional 1 h. Beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted in 50 μlof1× Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting using α-c-Myc or α-Rpl8p antibodies. Leptomycin B (LMB) Treatment—For LMB treatment, overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 of ∼0.1 and incubated for 6 h at 30 °C. They were then concentrated 10-fold in fresh medium. LMB (from M. Yoshida or LC Laboratories) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml, and cultures were incubated an additional 20 min before fixation, antibody staining, and visualization as described for indirect immunofluorescence. Deletion Analysis—A series of c-Myc-tagged N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Nmd3p (Fig. 1A) was expressed in yeast from low copy centromeric (CEN) plasmids under control of the NMD3 promoter. All of the N-terminal deletions tested (NΔ123, NΔ167, NΔ192) were unable to complement an nmd3 deletion (data not shown). The C-terminal truncations (nmd3Δ50, nmd3Δ100, and nmd3Δ120) have been described previously (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Selected truncated proteins were tested for their ability to bind to 60 S subunits using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting for Nmd3p and for Rpl8p as a reporter for 60 S subunits. Removal of up to 120 amino acids from the C terminus of the protein did not affect binding to 60 S subunits (Fig. 1B). However, removal of an additional 74 amino acids (NMD3CΔ194) completely disrupted 60 S interaction in this assay. Deletion of 123 amino acids from the N terminus of Nmd3p, including the first three Cys-X2-Cys motifs, led to reduced binding to 60 S subunits, whereas deletion of 167 or more amino acids, including all four Cys-X2-Cys motifs, completely abolished 60 S binding as indicated by the lack of coimmunoprecipitation of Rpl8p (Fig. 1B). From these results, we conclude that the N terminus of Nmd3p (aa 1–398), which contains two putative zinc-coordinating domains and is conserved in archaeal Nmd3p orthologs, is required for 60 S binding. Nuclear Export—The C-terminal 33 amino acids of Nmd3 contain a leucine-rich NES (Fig. 2, A and B) (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Deletion of this region was lethal in some strain backgrounds (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) but supported extremely weak growth in the S288c-related background BY4742 (Fig. 2D and data not shown). A helical projection of this sequence shows its predicted amphipathic structure (Fig. 2C). We introduced point mutations into the NES that were predicted to disrupt the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix (Fig. 2B). Changing the hydrophobic residues Leu496 and Leu497 had little effect on cell growth, whereas changing Ile493, Leu497, and Leu500 all to alanine significantly impaired growth. Remarkably, changing the single leucine at position 505 to alanine also had a profound affect on growth (Fig. 2C). To ask what is sufficient for nuclear export, we subcloned amino acids 489–501 (PQINIDELLDELD) and 485–505 (DEDAPQINIDELLDELDEMTL) separately into a reporter composed of the 175-kDa cytoplasmic protein Xrn1p fused to the well characterized NLS of SV40 large T antigen and GFP. The Xrn1-NLS-GFP reporter (13Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) alone was nuclear, and the addition of the shorter peptide (aa 489–501) did not change this distribution. On the other hand, the longer peptide (aa 485–505) was functional as an NES, since it led to cytoplasmic accumulation of the reporter (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the double point mutation (L496A,L407A) blocked nuclear export of the Xrn1 reporter (Fig. 3), although it did not block export of full-length Nmd3 (Fig. 4). The triple point mutation significantly inhibited export of both the reporter (Fig. 3) and full-length Nmd3 (Fig. 4). Since the double mutation blocked export of the Xrn1 reporter but not in the context of full-length Nmd3p, we conclude that sequences outside its NES contribute to export activity. Based on sequence alignment and conservation, we previously suggested that Nmd3p contains a noncanonical NES. However, the importance of L505 for nuclear export leads us to propose a slightly different alignment that is a perfect match to canonical leucine-rich NESs (see Fig. 2C).FIGURE 3Cellular localization of NES mutants in an Xrn1-NLS-GFP reporter. Wild-type strain W303 containing vectors pAJ670 (XRN1-NLS-GFP; XNG), pAJ671 (XNG-NES-(489–501)), pAJ673 (XNG-NES-(485–519)), pAJ676 (XNG-NES-(485–505)), pAJ677 (XNG-NES[LL→AA]), or pAJ678 (XNG-NES[ILL→AAA]) was grown overnight and diluted 20-fold into 2 ml of fresh glucose-containing medium. Cultures were grown for 6 h, fixed, DAPI-stained, and visualized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The NLS used in these fusions is derived from the SV40 virus large T antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Localization of shuttling mutants.

Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) within a region predicted to form a short coiledcoil (aa 446–468). Deletion of this domain resulted in a reduction in cell growth rate (Fig. 2D) but did not lead to accumulation of the protein within the nucleus (Fig. 4). On the other hand, combining the coiled-coil deletion with the double point mutation in the NES (L496A,L497A) severely impaired growth, although this NES mutant alone grew at nearly wild-type rates (Fig. 2D). In addition, this mutant protein accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 4). Combining the coil deletion with the triple point mutation was lethal (Fig. 2D). Although the coiled-coil region does not support efficient export, it does significantly enhance the function of the canonical NES. Because coiled-coils are typically protein-protein interaction motifs, this region of Nmd3 may enhance the function of the canonical NES by recruiting an additional factor that stabilizes the interaction of Nmd3p with Crm1p. Residual interaction with this factor in the absence of the canonical NES may account for the weak export activity of this region. Nuclear Localization—We previously showed that deletion of the C-terminal 120 amino acids of Nmd3p was lethal and resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of the protein, due to removal of sequences that are necessary for nuclear localization (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Amino acids 399–418 are highly basic (50% Arg and Lys), typical of an NLS. To test if this region was entirely responsible for NLS activity, an internal deletion encompassing these residues was made. This mutant protein localized to the cytoplasm but accumulated in the nucleus upon treatment with LMB (Fig. 4). LMB blocks Crm1 interaction with its ligands (15Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 16Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), thereby trapping molecules dependent on Crm1 export in the nucleus. Furthermore, this mutant was viable, albeit slowly growing (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that nuclear import was impaired but not abolished in this mutant. Interestingly, when fused to GFP as a reporter, amino acids 399–418 were not sufficient to localize GFP to the nucleus (data not shown), but a larger region (aa 387–434) was sufficient (1Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This larger region included a highly conserved patch of hydrophobic residues immediately upstream of the basic region implicated in NLS activity. Nmd3p deleted of the hydrophobic patch (aa 384–398) or both the hydrophobic patch and the basic region (aa 383–418), was non-complementing (Fig. 2D) but retained 60 S binding (data not shown). However, only removal of the entire region (aa 384–418) resulted in a complete inability of Nmd3p to localize to the nucleus, even in the presence of LMB (Fig. 4). Thus, the hydrophobic patch (aa 384–398) and the basic region (aa 399–418) are necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization activity. Nmd3 Loss of Function Mutants—Deletion analysis identified the shuttling sequences of Nmd3p and demonstrated that the conserved amino-terminal domain was responsible for 60 S subunit binding. However, it did not provide finer mapping of residues within this domain that are responsible for binding to the 60 S subunit. To address this, we screened for missense mutations that led to loss of function, with the expectation that among these would be mutants with reduced 60 S binding. We used PCR mutagenesis and a colony color-based plasmid shuffle technique to identify mutants (see “Experimental Procedures”). From this screen, we identified 16 independent missense mutants (Table 1). These mutations can be grouped roughly into three classes: mutations of cysteines within the Cys-X2-Cys motifs; mutations clustered in the region of aa 80–115; and mutations of hydrophobic residues in the region of aa 230–340. Several mutants showed incomplete loss of function. In addition, because several mutants appeared to adversely affect growth of wild-type cells, we scored all mutants for dominant negative effects when expressed in wild-type cells (Table 2). Interestingly, both loss of function and dominant gain of function mutants were obtained by different substitutions at His108 (Table 2). Although these mutants did not show obvious differences in 60 S binding by an immunoprecipitation assay, H108R suppresses lsg1 and rpl10 mutants (see below). We have shown that one mechanism of suppression of rpl10 and lsg1 mutants is by facilitating release of Nmd3p from 60 S subunits (5Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the dominant H108P mutant may impair release of Nmd3p from 60 S subunits in the cytoplasm.TABLE 2NMD3 loss of function allelesLoss of function alleleΔnmd3 complementationDominant negativeCellular localization60 S bindingrpl10[G161D] suppressionLSG1[K349T] suppressionWithout LMBWith LMBWild type+++-n/can, nucleoplasmic; c, cytoplasmic.n+++-+C35R+-c (foci)n+++--C58R,Y,S--c (foci)n+--L82P+-n/cn++++E106K++n/c+++-+H108P-++n/c (foci)n+++--H108R++-n/cn+++++++S109F-++cn+++--C146R+-cn+--S230P-++cn++--V340D--c (foci)n---I103V,Q142R,Q160H++n/cn++++++I139T,L259S,L296P--c (foci)n---L263P,F318INDbND, not determined.-c (foci)n---a n, nucleoplasmic; c, cytoplasmic.b ND, not determined.

The mutants showed variable levels of 60 S binding with a general correlation between the degree of loss of 60 S binding and the lack of complementation (Fig. 5 and Table 2). All mutants that retained partial in vivo function also retained 60 S binding, whereas mutants that showed a significant loss of 60 S binding were unable to complement an nmd3 deletion mutant. Cysteine Mutants—The screen for loss of function mutants identified five mutations that affected three of the universally conserved cysteine residues (Cys35, Cys58, and Cys146). Because of the high frequency of cysteine mutants, we decided to mutate each of the eight cysteines in these putative zinc binding motifs to serine, an amino acid of similar size but unable to coor"

In order to facilitate structural characterization, the present study reports the first direct analysis of human phagocyte Cyt b by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry. Mass analysis of in-gel tryptic digest samples provided 73% total sequence coverage of the gp91phox subunit, including three of the six proposed transmembrane domains. Similar analysis of the p22phox subunit provided 72% total sequence coverage, including assignment of the hydrophobic N-terminal region and residues that are polymorphic in the human population. To initiate mass analysis of Cyt b post-translational modifications, the isolated gp91phox subunit was subject to sequential in-gel digestion with Flavobacterium meningosepticum peptide N-glycosidase F and trypsin, with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry used to demonstrate that Asn-132, -149, and -240 are genuinely modified by N-linked glycans in human neutrophils. Since the PLB-985 cell line represents an important model system for analysis of the NADPH oxidase, methods were developed for the purification of Cyt b from PLB-985 membrane fractions in order to confirm the appropriate modification of N-linked glycosylation sites on the recombinant gp91phox subunit. This study reports extensive sequence coverage of the integral membrane protein Cyt b by mass spectrometry and provides analytical methods that will be useful for evaluating posttranslational modifications involved in the regulation of superoxide production."
https://openalex.org/W2168831377,"Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) was originally identified as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein with gram-negative bactericidal activity in the leukocytes. In this study, we characterized the previously unknown effects of BPI in the eye and the molecular mechanisms involved in its action. BPI mRNA was detected in bovine retina; retinal pigment epithelium; and primary cultures of bovine retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), pericytes (RPC), and endothelial cells (REC); while BPI protein was measured in human vitreous and plasma. BPI, but not control protein thaumatin, activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT, and increased DNA synthesis in RPE and RPC but not in REC. A human recombinant 21 kDa modified amino-terminal fragment of BPI (rBPI21) reduced H2O2-induced apoptosis in RPE and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in REC when preincubated with VEGF. Intraperitoneal (i.p.)-injected rBPI21 reduced ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization and diabetes-induced retinal permeability. Since BPI has unusual dual properties of promoting RPC and RPE growth while suppressing VEGF-induced REC growth and vascular permeability, the mechanistic understanding of BPI's action may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration."

The molybdenum nitrogenase performs the majority of biological nitrogen fixation (N2 → NH3) and has two component [Fe-S] proteins: dinitrogenase (also termed MoFe protein) and dinitrogenase reductase (also termed Fe protein) (1Bulen W.A.

Dinitrogenase reductase is a 63-kDa α2 dimer of the nifH gene product that contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated between the two subunits (5Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D.

FeMo-co, found within the active site of NifDK, is one of the most complex metalloclusters known in biology, and is composed of seven iron atoms, nine sulfur atoms, one molybdenum, one R-homocitrate, and one light atom (nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon) (6Chan M.K.

A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Several nitrogen fixation (nif) genes have been shown to be involved in FeMo-co biosynthesis and the formation of an active nitrogenase enzyme (see Refs. 10Dos Santos P.C. Dean D.R. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1159-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Rubio L.M. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar for recent reviews). The current data supports the following model for FeMo-co biosynthesis: (i) The SAM-radical protein NifB generates NifBco, an [Fe-S] cluster of unidentified structure that serves as FeMo-co precursor (13Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Curatti L. Ludden P.W. Rubio L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether NifB-co is the only iron and sulfur source to FeMo-co is not yet known. (ii) NifB-co is then transferred to NifEN, a scaffold protein upon which further steps of FeMo-co synthesis occur. The original proposal of NifEN as scaffold for FeMo-co synthesis (15Brigle K.E. Weiss M.C. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Muchmore S.W. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 111-132Google Scholar) arose from the observations that there is significant sequence conservation between NifEN and NifDK, there is a mutual stability requirement by NifE and NifN, and the fact that the structural genes for dinitrogenase (NifDK) were not required for FeMo-co synthesis. NifX has the ability to bind NifB-co and it is possible that NifX is involved in NifB-co transfer. (iii) Molybdenum is then added to a FeMo-co precursor, probably in a NifH-dependent fashion (17Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, molybdenum has been previously processed by the activity of NifQ (18Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physical site of molybdenum incorporation into the FeMo-co precursor has been subject of some debate. Radiolabeling experiments showed 99Mo label accumulating on both NifH and NifEN when, NifB-co, MgATP, 99Mo, and DTH were combined with these two proteins in an in vitro reaction mix (19Rangaraj P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40106-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, from the inspection of the three-dimensional structure of NifH it is not obvious how this protein could coordinate any type of FeMo-co precursor. On the other hand, no molybdenum has been detected in purified preparations of NifEN, making it difficult to establish it as the site where molybdenum is incorporated into a FeMo-co precursor (20Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6082-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Hu Y. Fay A.W. Ribbe M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Robertson A.D. Cerny R.L. Hayes R.N. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. Nature. 1987; 329: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). (v) FeMo-co then binds to NafY, the product of a non-nif gene that also stabilizes the FeMo-co-deficient apoNifDK, and is finally inserted into apoNifDK to make it catalytically competent for N2 reduction (25Homer M.J.

The first purification of the Azotobacter vinelandii NifEN complex was reported by Roberts and co-workers (20Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6082-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NifEN was shown to be a 200-kDa α2β2 tetramer containing some type of [Fe-S] cluster. Purified NifEN did not function catalytically in an in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system, and the authors suggested that some moiety from NifEN (probably iron of sulfur) was being consumed during the FeMo-co synthesis reaction. A His-tagged NifEN complex was subsequentely overexpressed in a ΔnifHDK genetic background and purified by Dean and co-workers (21Goodwin P.J. Agar J.N. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10420-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A faster purification protocol for the His-tagged NifEN was developed allowing a more thorough characterization of the protein. NifEN was shown to contain two identical [4Fe-4S] clusters having an S = 1/2 EPR signal in the dithionite-reduced form that are referred to as the permanent clusters of NifEN. In addition, the authors observed the presence of a different S = 1/2 EPR signal when the enzyme was oxidized by thionine, and suggested it could arise from a FeMo-co precursor accumulated on NifEN (22Goodwin, P. J. (1999) Ph. D. dissertation, Department of Biochemistry, pp. 197, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VAGoogle Scholar). Their suggestion was supported by two additional observations: first, NifEN contains more iron than expected to account for the permanent [4Fe-4S] clusters. Second, it had been shown before that NifEN mobility in native gels was dependent on the presence of functional nifB and nifH genes (28Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The NifEN species accumulated in a ΔnifHDK genetic background was associated with a FeMo-co precursor activity and had different mobility than the NifEN species accumulated in a ΔnifB ΔnifDK genetic background. In vitro work with 55Fe-labeled NifB-co had showed the specific binding of NifB-co to NifEN (29Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and it seemed that further processing of FeMo-co precursors on NifEN required the activity of NifH. Goodwin's observations on the presence of a FeMo-co precursor on NifEN have been recently confirmed by work at another laboratory (23Hu Y. Fay A.W. Ribbe M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no evidence of molybdenum accumulation on NifEN along with a FeMo-co precursor in a ΔnifHDK genetic background. Rangaraj et al. (19Rangaraj P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40106-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the incorporation of 99Mo on NifEN in vitro is dependent on the presence of NifH, NifB-co, DTH, and ATP in a FeMo-co synthesis assay mixture. We show here that the NifEN protein, purified by Co2+ affinity chromatography from a ΔnifHDK A. vinelandii strain, contains a FeMo-co precursor and bound molybdenum. Moreover, in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays show that the molybdenum accumulated within the purified NifEN protein is suitable for FeMo-co synthesis, suggesting that NifEN serves as the entry point for molybdenum into the FeMo-co synthesis pathway. Buffers—Buffers for cell breakage, protein purification, and protein assays were made anaerobic by sparging with N2 for 30 min, followed by alternate cycles of vacuum and flushing with argon, and the addition of sodium dithionite (DTH) to a final concentration of 1 mm, unless otherwise specified.

Acta. 1972; 256: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris. For the removal of low molecular weight components from the A. vinelandii UW45 or DJ35 cell-free extracts, 55-ml aliquots of the extracts were anaerobically desalted by passage through four HiPrep 26/10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) serially connected to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The desalting chromatography was performed in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm DTH. Purification of NifEN by Co2+ Affinity Chromatography— The poly(His)-tagged NifEN was purified from the DJ1041 cell-free extract by affinity chromatography to a Co2+ resin (Talon resin, Clontech). All purification steps were performed under an anaerobic N2 atmosphere at 4 °C. Cell-free extracts from 250 g of cells of A. vinelandii strain DJ1041 were supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol, and loaded onto a 1.5 cm × 35 cm column of Co2+ charged resin. The column had been previously equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 mm DTH). The column was then washed with 150 ml of buffer A followed by 750 ml of buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The NifEN protein was eluted with 150 ml of buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed by passage through a series of HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The desalting chromatography was performed in buffer A. The fractions containing NifEN protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 100-kDa cutoff membrane, YM100, in an Amicon cell (Millipore Corp.) inside an anaerobic glove box. NifEN preparations in buffer A were stored under liquid nitrogen until used. The average NifEN purification yield was 700 mg of NifEN protein per 250 g of DJ1041 cell paste. NifEN was estimated to be >98% pure by SDS-PAGE. To purify NifEN in the presence of W, buffer A was supplemented with 10 mm Na2WO4 during the Co2+ affinity chromatography and a similar purification procedure was used. The eluted NifEN protein was desalted using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column equilibrated in buffer A, concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon cell, and stored under liquid nitrogen in buffer A. To purify NifEN loaded with molybdenum in vitro, buffer A was supplemented with 10 mm Na2MoO4 during the Co2+ affinity chromatography and a similar purification procedure was used. The eluted NifEN protein was desalted using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column equilibrated in buffer A, concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon cell, and stored under liquid nitrogen in buffer A. For comparison purposes, the NifEN protein was purified by Zn2+ affinity chromatography followed by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography according to Ref. 21Goodwin P.J. Agar J.N. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P.

A. 2005; 102: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purified NifEN protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above and stored under liquid nitrogen in buffer A. The average amount of NifEN purified using this procedure was 625 mg of NifEN protein per kg of DJ1041 cell paste. Purification of NifEN Not Charged with a FeMo-co Precursor—Uncharged NifEN was purified from cell-free extracts of A. vinelandii strain UW243 by affinity chromatography to a Co2+ resin. All purification steps were performed under an anaerobic N2 atmosphere at 4 °C. The UW243 cell-free extracts were supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, and were loaded onto a 20-ml Co2+-affinity column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, and the NifEN protein was eluted from the column by passing with 40 ml of buffer A supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. Eluted NifEN was pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM100 membrane in an Amicon cell under a N2 atmosphere, and then subjected to gel-filtration chromatography on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the residual imidazole and to exchange NifEN into buffer B (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm DTH). The average purification yielded was 10 mg of uncharged NifEN from 100 g of UW243 cell paste. The precursor-free NifEN was estimated to be >95% pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Purification of Other Components—NifH and NifDK were purified from UW cells as previously described (4Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A poly(His)-tagged apoNifDK form was purified from cells of strain DJ1143 as described (32Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously described. In Vitro FeMo-co Insertion and FeMo-co Synthesis and Insertion Assays—FeMo-co insertion assays were performed as described in (33Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NifB-co-dependent in vitro synthesis of FeMo-co assays were performed as described in Ref. 13Shah V.K. Allen J.R.

The complete reaction mixtures contained: 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 10 μlof1 mm Na2MoO4, 20 μl of 5 mm homocitrate, 200 μl of ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH), 10 μl of a solution containing NifB-co (equivalent to 4 nmol of Fe), 200 μl of A. vinelandii cell-free extract (∼3 mg of protein from UW45 or DJ35 W-grown cells), and 500 μg of purified NifEN in a total volume of 575 μl. The reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of NifB-co and any protein component, and for 30 min at 30 °C after addition of protein components to allow for the FeMo-co synthesis and insertion reactions. The resulting activation of apoNifDK present in A. vinelandii extract was analyzed by the acetylene reduction assay after adding 0.8 ml of ATP-regenerating mixture and an excess of purified NifH (120 μg of protein) (4Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activities for FeMo-co synthesis and insertion are presented in terms of NifDK activities defined as ethylene formed·min–1·assay–1. When FeMo-co synthesis assays were performed with only purified components, apoNifDK (100 μg of protein), and NifH (120 μg of protein) replaced the A. vinelandii crude extract in the reaction mixture. The total volume of the purified system reaction mixture was 395 μl. When purified NifEN was used as sole source of molybdenum for FeMo-co synthesis, Na2MoO4 was omitted from the complete reaction mixture and 0.5–2.5 nmol (100–500 μg) of heat-denatured NifEN protein (denatured by 1 h of incubation at 70 °C) were added to the mixture. It is important to note that 50 μg of active NifEN was still added to the reaction mixture to perform FeMo-co synthesis. When NifH, uncharged NifEN, or apoNifDK was tested as internal source of molybdenum for FeMo-co synthesis Na2MoO4 was omitted from the complete reaction mixture and 0.5–2.5 nmol of heat-denatured protein were added to the mixture. EPR Analysis—EPR spectra were recorded in the laboratory of Professor David Britt, on a Bruker ECS-106 spectrometer equipped with an ER 4116 dual-mode X-band cavity and Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. Perpendicular mode EPR spectra were recorded using a microwave frequency of 9.69 GHz, at 11 ± 0.2 K, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 1.0 mT (10 Gauss), a sweep rate of 12 mT/s, and a and a microwave power of 10 milliwatt. The program IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) was used for all subsequent handling of spectral data. Protein Assays—Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard (35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar). The procedures for SDS-PAGE has been described (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Metal Analysis—Iron and molybdenum contents in purified NifEN preparations were determined by ICP-OES. Concentrated samples of purified NifEN, NifH or NifDK protein (250 μl, containing ∼7.5 mg of protein) were diluted with 250 μlof buffer A (see above) supplemented with 1% NMF and 2% of nitric acid. The mixture was heated at 99 °C for 30 min and subjected to periodical vortexing to ensure full analyte recovery. The precipitated protein was pelleted out by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was placed into a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and introduced into the ICP-OES system (Optima 5X00™DV ICP-OES) via a peristaltic pump. The sample was aspirated with humidified argon, passed onto the plasma, and analyzed for iron and molybdunum. Commercial calibration standards and multi-element standards were used. Purification of NifEN—Poly(His)-tagged NifEN was purified to ∼98% homogeneity from A. vinelandii strain DJ1041 using Co2+ affinity chromatography immediately followed by desalting on a HiPrep gel filtration column (Fig. 1). Approximately 700 mg of NifEN protein can be purified from 250 g of cell paste in a typical purification. As described in more detail below, the NifEN protein purified by Co2+ affinity chromatography has important differences in FeMo-co synthesis activity, the content of bound molybdenum and iron, and its substrate requirements in comparison to previously reported preparations of NifEN purified by Zn2+ affinity chromatography (21Goodwin P.J.

A. 2005; 102: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These differences are significant in the context of the biochemical pathway for FeMo-co synthesis. Metal Contents of NifEN—The [Fe-S] clusters of NifEN are labile and the quality of NifEN preparations is very sensitive to the purification procedure employed. For example, the fast purification procedure described in Ref. 23Hu Y. Fay A.W. Ribbe M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar yielded NifEN with higher iron content than that described in Ref. 20Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The NifEN preparations purified by Co2+ affinity were analyzed by ICP-OES and were found to contain 24 ± 1 mol of iron per mol of tetrameric NifEN (Table 1). This amount of iron in NifEN is significantly higher than previously reported (20Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2157766455,"Vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D3] plays a crucial role in Ca2+ homeostasis by stimulating Ca2+ (re)absorption and bone turnover. The 1,25(OH)2D3 analog ZK191784 was recently developed to dissociate the therapeutic immunomodulatory activity from the hypercalcemic side effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and contains a structurally modified side chain characterized by a 22,23-double bond, 24R-hydroxy group, 25-cyclopropyl ring, and 5-butyloxazole unit. We investigated the effect of ZK191784 on Ca2+ homeostasis and the regulation of Ca2+ transport proteins in wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the renal epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV5 (TRPV5-/-). The latter display hypercalciuria, hypervitaminosis D, increased intestinal expression of the epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV6, the Ca2+-binding protein calbindin-D(9K), and intestinal Ca2+ hyperabsorption. ZK191784 normalized the Ca2+ hyperabsorption and the expression of intestinal Ca2+ transport proteins in TRPV5-/- mice. Furthermore, the compound decreased intestinal Ca2+ absorption in WT mice and reduced 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake by Caco-2 cells, substantiating a 1,25(OH)2D3-antagonistic action of ZK191784 in the intestine. ZK191784 increased renal TRPV5 and calbindin-D(28K) expression and decreased urine Ca2+ excretion in WT mice. Both 1,25(OH)2D3 and ZK191784 enhanced transcellular Ca2+ transport in primary cultures of rabbit connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts, indicating a 1,25(OH)2D3-agonistic effect in kidney. ZK191784 enhanced bone TRPV6 mRNA levels and 1,25(OH)2D3 as well as ZK191784 stimulated secretion of the bone formation marker osteocalcin in rat osteosarcoma cells, albeit to a different extent. In conclusion, ZK191784 is a synthetic 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand displaying a unique tissue-specific profile when administered in vivo. Because ZK191784 acts as an intestine-specific 1,25(OH)2D3 antagonist, this compound will be associated with less hypercalcemic side effects compared with the 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs currently used in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2027118223,"The roles of Asp75, Asp78, and Glu83 of the 75DPSDVARVE83 element of Mycobacterium smegmatis GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (GTP-PEPCK) were investigated. Asp78 and Glu83 are fully conserved in GTP-PEP-CKs. The human PEPCK crystal structure suggests that Asp78 influences Tyr220; Tyr220 helps to position bound PEP, and Glu83 interacts with Arg81. Experimental data on other PEPCKs indicate that Arg81 binds PEP, and the phosphate of PEP interacts with Mn2+ of metal site 1 for catalysis. We found that D78A and E83A replacements severely reduced activity. E83A substitution raised the apparent Km value for Mn2+ 170-fold. In contrast, Asp75 is highly but not fully conserved; natural substitutions are Ala, Asn, Gln, or Ser. Such substitutions, when engineered, in M. smegmatis enzyme caused the following. 1) For oxaloacetate synthesis, Vmax decreased 1.4-4-fold. Km values for PEP and Mn2+ increased 3-9- and 1.2-10-fold, respectively. Km values for GDP and bicarbonate changed little. 2) For PEP formation, Vmax increased 1.5-2.7-fold. Km values for oxaloacetate increased 2-2.8-fold. The substitutions did not change the secondary structure of protein significantly. The kinetic effects are rationalized as follows. In E83A the loss of Glu83-Arg81 interaction affected Arg81-PEP association. D78A change altered the Tyr220-PEP interaction. These events perturbed PEP-Mn2+ interaction and consequently affected catalysis severely. In contrast, substitutions at Asp75, a site far from bound PEP, brought subtle effects, lowering oxaloacetate formation rate but enhancing PEP formation rate. It is likely that Asp75 substitutions affected PEP-Mn2+ interaction by changing the positions of Asp78, Arg81, and Glu83, which translated to differential effects on two directions.

In this study, we have examined whether two Asp residues and a Glu residue, which belong to a well conserved sequence element of GTP-PEPCKs (Table 1), influence the enzymatic activity. The position numbers for these residues in the enzymes from three sources relevant to our work are as follows: human liver cytosolic (Asp81, Asp84, and Glu89) (20Stoffel M. Xiang K.S. Espinosa R. II I Cox N.J. Le Beau M.M. Bell G.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Dunten P. Belunis C. Crowther R. Hollfelder K. Kammlott U. Levin W. Michel H. Ramsey G.B. Swain A. Weber D. Wertheimer S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); chicken liver mitochondria (Asp66, Asp69, and Glu74; of the mature enzyme) (22Weldon S.L. Rando A. Matathias A.S. Hod Y. Kalonick P.A. Savon S. Cook J.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7308-7317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and Mycobacterium smegmatis, the model for our work (Asp75, Asp78, and Glu83) (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the chicken GTP-PEPCK, the aforementioned conserved element has been described as the second metal-binding site (23Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in the avian enzyme Asp66, Asp69, and Glu74 act as ligands for a Mn2+ ion (23Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and in turn the latter mediates phosphoryl group transfer from or to the nucleotide substrate (23Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure data for human cytosolic PEPCK indicate that these acidic amino acid residues are not involved in Mn2+ binding but are located near the PEP-binding pocket (Fig. 1). The same observation has been made in a report on the crystal structure of the chicken GTP-PEPCK (24Holyoak T. Sullivan S.M. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8254-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which was published while this manuscript was under review. Therefore, we have considered an alternative role for these residues. Asp69 and Glu74 of the avian enzyme are fully conserved in the PEPCKs (Table 1) (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol.

It is possible that in the avian PEPCK Asp69 and Glu74 play important roles in catalysis, whereas Asp66 serves a regulatory function and therefore is more prone to evolutionary changes (Table 1). We have tested these hypotheses by using the M. smegmatis enzyme as the model. We have shown previously that this mycobacterial enzyme kinetically prefers the gluconeogenic direction (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also, it has been expressed with activity in Escherichia coli from a plasmid-based construct (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This heterologous expression system is suitable for site-directed mutagenesis experiments and generation of variant enzymes. M. smegmatis PEPCK is highly similar to the human cytosolic and chicken mitochondrial enzymes (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is a suitable model for the GTP-PEPCKs. The results from our work support our hypotheses concerning the roles of the above-mentioned acidic residues in the PEPCK reaction.TABLE 1Primary structure alignment for the PEP-binding site of GTP-dependent PEPCKs The sources for the enzymes compared are as follows (accession number and reference, if available): M. smegmatis (AAK28534 (2Mukhopadhyay B.

Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) was used for the overexpression of PEPCK. These strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The E. coli transformants were selected on plates or grown in liquid medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. DNA Techniques—Standard techniques were used for the manipulation of the DNA (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Qiagen QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for the purification of plasmids. The sequence for the mutagenized DNA was verified by determining the sequence for both strands. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed by using the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and a pair of mutagenic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Site-directed Mutagenesis of M. smegmatis PEPCK—The desired alterations were introduced via two sets of experiments. In the first set, Asp75 was the target and the plasmid pBE129-19b, an expression vector for M. smegmatis PEPCK (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was used as the template. pBE129-19b was constructed by cloning the pck coding sequence as an NdeI-BamHI fragment into pET19b (2Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primer pairs used in this first set of experiments (Table 2) were designed to cause the following two changes in the pck coding sequence: 1) replacement of the codon representing Asp75 with that for Ala, Asn, Gln, or Ser; 2) introduction of a PmlI site at nucleotide position 239-244 without causing any change in the amino acid sequence. pBE129-19b does not contain a PmlI site. The newly introduced PmlI site provided a rapid screening method for plasmids containing the designed mutations. Upon digestion with BamHI and PmlI, a mutant plasmid produced two fragments of 1.5 and 6 kb, whereas this treatment generated only a 7.5-kb fragment from pBE129-19b. From these experiments the plasmids pBE129-19bD75A, pBE129-19bD75N, pBE129-19bD75Q, and pBE129-19bD75S were obtained. In the second set of mutagenesis experiments, either Asp78 or Glu83 of the PEPCK protein was targeted. For this work the template was pBE129-19bD75A, which carried a PmlI site and encoded an Ala residue at the 75th amino acid sequence position of the enzyme (Table 2). Each primer pair used in the second round restored the wild-type sequences that were altered in the first round and replaced the codon for either Asp78 or Glu83 with that for Ala (Table 2). A loss of the PmlI site was taken as a preliminary indication for the success of a mutagenesis experiment. The plasmids pBE129-19bD78A and pBE129-19bE83A were generated from this round. For each of six mutant clones, the DNA sequence for both strands of the entire pck gene was determined. The data showed that in every case the mutant gene carried only the desired alterations, and the rest of the DNA sequence remained unchanged.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesisa Only forward primers are listedb Wild-type sequence of the relevant region of M. smegmatis PEPCK with the areas targeted for mutagenesis are underlined is as follows: 5′-CTTTCCGATCCGTCCGACGTCGCGCGTGTCGAATCCCGCA"
