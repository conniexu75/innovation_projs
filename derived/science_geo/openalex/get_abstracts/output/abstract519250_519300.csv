https://openalex.org/W1979283544,"Cellular diversity in the brain revealed The mammalian brain has an extraordinarily large number of cells. Although there are quite a few different cell types, many cells in any one category tend to look alike. Zeisel et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of mouse brain cells to reveal more than meets the eye. Interneurons of similar type were found in dissimilar regions of the brain. Oligodendrocytes that seemed to be all of one class were differentiated by their molecular signatures into a half-dozen classes. Microglia associated with blood vessels were distinguished from look-alike perivascular macrophages. Thus, the complex microanatomy of the brain can be revealed by the RNAs expressed in its cells.

This planar optics approach, however, has generally been applicable to only a narrow band of wavelengths. Aieta et al. show that chromatic dispersion, or color dependence, can be compensated for by the judicious design of the surface. The results demonstrate a general approach for the fabrication of broadband and lightweight optical elements that can be engineered into planar thin films. Science , this issue p. 1342"

Cirulli et al. sequenced the expressed genes of nearly 3000 ALS patients and compared them with those of more than 6000 controls (see the Perspective by Singleton and Traynor). They identified several proteins that were linked to disease in patients. One such protein, TBK1, is implicated in innate immunity and autophagy and may represent a therapeutic target.

https://openalex.org/W2093971029,"Mutations in sunlight-induced melanoma arise from cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), DNA photoproducts that are typically created picoseconds after an ultraviolet (UV) photon is absorbed at thymine or cytosine. We found that in melanocytes, CPDs are generated for >3 hours after exposure to UVA, a major component of the radiation in sunlight and in tanning beds. These ""dark CPDs"" constitute the majority of CPDs and include the cytosine-containing CPDs that initiate UV-signature C→T mutations. Dark CPDs arise when UV-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species combine to excite an electron in fragments of the pigment melanin. This creates a quantum triplet state that has the energy of a UV photon but induces CPDs by energy transfer to DNA in a radiation-independent manner. Melanin may thus be carcinogenic as well as protective against cancer. These findings also validate the long-standing suggestion that chemically generated excited electronic states are relevant to mammalian biology."
https://openalex.org/W1969695012,"Physical systems usually exhibit quantum behavior, such as superpositions and entanglement, only when they are sufficiently decoupled from a lossy environment. Paradoxically, a specially engineered interaction with the environment can become a resource for the generation and protection of quantum states. This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a manifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of multiple stable steady states. We have experimentally confined the state of a harmonic oscillator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of opposite phases. In particular, we have observed a Schrodinger cat state spontaneously squeeze out of vacuum, before decaying into a classical mixture. This was accomplished by designing a superconducting microwave resonator whose coupling to a cold bath is dominated by photon pair exchange. This experiment opens new avenues in the fields of nonlinear quantum optics and quantum information, where systems with multi-dimensional steady state manifolds can be used as error corrected logical qubits."
https://openalex.org/W1963903389,"Although plasma corticosterone is considered the main glucocorticoid involved in regulation of stress responses in rodents, the presence of plasma cortisol and whether its level can be used as an indicator for rodent activation of stress remain to be determined. In this study, effects of estrous cycle stage, circadian rhythm, and acute and chronic (repeated or unpredictable) stressors of various severities on dynamics and correlation of serum cortisol and corticosterone were examined in mice. A strong (r = 0.6–0.85) correlation between serum cortisol and corticosterone was observed throughout the estrous cycle, all day long, and during acute or repeated restraints, chronic unpredictable stress and acute forced swimming or heat stress. Both hormones increased to the highest level on day 1 of repeated-restraint or unpredictable stresses, but after that, whereas the concentration of cortisol did not change, that of corticosterone showed different dynamics. Thus, whereas corticosterone declined dramatically during repeated restraints, it remained at the high level during unpredictable stress. During forced swimming or heat stress, whereas cortisol increased to the highest level within 3 min., corticosterone did not reach maximum until 40 min. of stress. Analysis with HPLC and HPLC-MS further confirmed the presence of cortisol in mouse serum. Taken together, results (i) confirmed the presence of cortisol in mouse serum and (ii) suggested that mouse serum cortisol and corticosterone are closely correlated in dynamics under different physiological or stressful conditions, but, whereas corticosterone was a more adaptation-related biomarker than cortisol during chronic stress, cortisol was a quicker responder than corticosterone during severe acute stress."
https://openalex.org/W2038824361,"Notch receptors guide mammalian cell fate decisions by engaging the proteins Jagged and Delta-like (DLL). The 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the interacting regions of the Notch1-DLL4 complex reveals a two-site, antiparallel binding orientation assisted by Notch1 O-linked glycosylation. Notch1 epidermal growth factor-like repeats 11 and 12 interact with the DLL4 Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain and module at the N-terminus of Notch ligands (MNNL) domains, respectively. Threonine and serine residues on Notch1 are functionalized with O-fucose and O-glucose, which act as surrogate amino acids by making specific, and essential, contacts to residues on DLL4. The elucidation of a direct chemical role for O-glycans in Notch1 ligand engagement demonstrates how, by relying on posttranslational modifications of their ligand binding sites, Notch proteins have linked their functional capacity to developmentally regulated biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2002047268,"The evolution of galaxies is connected to the growth of supermassive black holes in their centers. During the quasar phase, a huge luminosity is released as matter falls onto the black hole, and radiation-driven winds can transfer most of this energy back to the host galaxy. Over five different epochs, we detected the signatures of a nearly spherical stream of highly ionized gas in the broadband x-ray spectra of the luminous quasar PDS 456. This persistent wind is expelled at relativistic speeds from the inner accretion disk, and its wide aperture suggests an effective coupling with the ambient gas. The outflow’s kinetic power larger than 1046 ergs per second is enough to provide the feedback required by models of black hole and host galaxy coevolution."
https://openalex.org/W1986155887,"Large areas of the United States long considered geologically stable with little or no detected seismicity have recently become seismically active. The increase in earthquake activity began in the mid-continent starting in 2001 ( 1 ) and has continued to rise. In 2014, the rate of occurrence of earthquakes with magnitudes ( M ) of 3 and greater in Oklahoma exceeded that in California (see the figure). This elevated activity includes larger earthquakes, several with M > 5, that have caused significant damage ( 2 , 3 ). To a large extent, the increasing rate of earthquakes in the mid-continent is due to fluid-injection activities used in modern energy production ( 1 , 4 , 5 ). We explore potential avenues for mitigating effects of induced seismicity. Although the United States is our focus here, Canada, China, the UK, and others confront similar problems associated with oil and gas production, whereas quakes induced by geothermal activities affect Switzerland, Germany, and others."

Oxytocin, a natural brain peptide produced in the hypothalamus, has received considerable attention as a potential treatment for social deficits in ASD. Acute intranasal oxytocin temporarily enhances social cognition, empathy, and reciprocity in individuals with ASD (1). However, recent clinical trials have yielded mixed results, leaving the field questioning whether oxytocin can live up to the hype."
https://openalex.org/W2057545353,"Cope's rule proposes that animal lineages evolve toward larger body size over time. To test this hypothesis across all marine animals, we compiled a data set of body sizes for 17,208 genera of marine animals spanning the past 542 million years. Mean biovolume across genera has increased by a factor of 150 since the Cambrian, whereas minimum biovolume has decreased by less than a factor of 10, and maximum biovolume has increased by more than a factor of 100,000. Neutral drift from a small initial value cannot explain this pattern. Instead, most of the size increase reflects differential diversification across classes, indicating that the pattern does not reflect a simple scaling-up of widespread and persistent selection for larger size within populations."
https://openalex.org/W2118268313,"The ability of rumen microorganisms to use fibrous plant matter plays an important role in ruminant animals; however, little information about rumen colonization by microbial populations after weaning has been reported. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate the establishment of this microbial population in 80 to 110-day-old goats. Illumina sequencing of goat rumen samples yielded 101,356,610 nucleotides that were assembled into 256,868 reads with an average read length of 394 nucleotides. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated that the predominant phyla were distinct at different growth stages. The phyla Firmicutes and Synergistetes were predominant in samples taken from 80 to 100-day-old goats, but Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes became the most abundant phyla in samples from 110-day-old animals. There was a remarkable variation in the microbial populations with age; Firmicutes and Synergistetes decreased after weaning, but Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria increased from 80 to 110 day of age. These findings suggested that colonization of the rumen by microorganisms is related to their function in the rumen digestive system. These results give a better understanding of the role of rumen microbes and the establishment of the microbial population, which help to maintain the host’s health and improve animal performance."
https://openalex.org/W1982387423,"Airway basal cells (BC) function as stem/progenitor cells capable of differentiating into the luminal ciliated and secretory cells to replenish the airway epithelium during physiological turnover and repair. The objective of this study was to define the role of Notch signaling in regulating human airway BC differentiation into a pseudostratified mucociliated epithelium. Notch inhibition with γ-secretase inhibitors demonstrated Notch activation is essential for BC differentiation into secretory and ciliated cells, but more so for the secretory lineage. Sustained cell autonomous ligand independent Notch activation via lentivirus expression of the intracellular domain of each Notch receptor (NICD1-4) demonstrated that the NOTCH2 and 4 pathways have little effect on BC differentiation into secretory and ciliated cells, while activation of the NOTCH1 or 3 pathways has a major influence, with persistent expression of NICD1 or 3 resulting in a skewing toward secretory cell differentiation with a parallel decrease in ciliated cell differentiation. These observations provide insights into the control of the balance of BC differentiation into the secretory vs ciliated cell lineage, a balance that is critical for maintaining the normal function of the airway epithelium in barrier defense against the inhaled environment."
https://openalex.org/W2022915690,"Background The variability in the association of host innate immune response to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requires ruling out the possible role of host KIR and HLA genotypes in HCV-related disorders: therefore, we therefore explored the relationships between KIR/HLA genotypes and chronic HCV infection (CHC) as they relate to the risk of HCV-related hepatocarcinoma (HCC) or lymphoproliferative disease progression. Methods and Findings We analyzed data from 396 HCV-positive patients with CHC (n = 125), HCC (118), and lymphoproliferative diseases (153), and 501 HCV-negative patients. All were HIV and HBV negative. KIR-SSO was used to determine the KIR typing. KIR2DL5 and KIR2DS4 variants were performed using PCR and GeneScan analysis. HLA/class-I genotyping was performed using PCR-sequence-based typing. The interaction between the KIR gene and ligand HLA molecules was investigated. Differences in frequencies were estimated using Fisher’s exact test, and Cochran-Armitage trend test. The non-random association of KIR alleles was estimated using the linkage disequilibrium test. We found an association of KIR2DS2/KIR2DL2 genes, with the HCV-related lymphoproliferative disorders. Furthermore, individuals with a HLA-Bw6 KIR3DL1+ combination of genes showed higher risk of developing lymphoma than cryoglobulinemia. KIR2DS3 gene was found to be the principal gene associated with chronic HCV infection, while a reduction of HLA-Bw4 + KIR3DS1+ was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC. Conclusions Our data highlight a role of the innate-system in developing HCV-related disorders and specifically KIR2DS3 and KIR2D genes demonstrated an ability to direct HCV disease progression, and mainly towards lymphoproliferative disorders. Moreover the determination of KIR3D/HLA combination of genes direct the HCV progression towards a lymphoma rather than an hepatic disease. In this contest IFN-α therapy, a standard therapy for HCV-infection and lymphoproliferative diseases, known to be able to transiently enhance the cytotoxicity of NK-cells support the role of NK cells to counterstain HCV-related and lymphoproliferative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1967257060,"The majority of bacteriophages protect their genetic material by packaging the nucleic acid in concentric layers to an almost crystalline concentration inside protein shells (capsid). This highly condensed genome also has to be efficiently injected into the host bacterium in a process named ejection. Most phages use a specialized complex (often a tail) to deliver the genome without disrupting cell integrity. Bacteriophage T7 belongs to the Podoviridae family and has a short, non-contractile tail formed by a tubular structure surrounded by fibers. Here we characterize the kinetics and structure of bacteriophage T7 DNA delivery process. We show that T7 recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli rough strains through the fibers. Rough LPS acts as the main phage receptor and drives DNA ejection in vitro. The structural characterization of the phage tail after ejection using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle reconstruction methods revealed the major conformational changes needed for DNA delivery at low resolution. Interaction with the receptor causes fiber tilting and opening of the internal tail channel by untwisting the nozzle domain, allowing release of DNA and probably of the internal head proteins.

Bacteriophages depend on their bacterial host for production of new viral particles. Unlike eukaryotic viruses, most bacterial viruses translocate their genetic material into the host cytoplasm, whereas the empty capsid remains on the bacterial surface (1Cuervo A. Daudén M.I.

This complex has several functions that govern the sequence of events necessary for efficient transfer of the genetic material into the host (10Cuervo A. Carrascosa J.L. Viral connectors for DNA encapsulation.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2012; 23: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Bhardwaj A. Olia A.S. Cingolani G. Architecture of viral genome-delivery molecular machines.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 25: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The tail first closes the connector channel, preventing DNA leakage from the capsid after packaging. During infection, the tail specifically recognizes the bacterial receptor and transmits the gate-opening signal for DNA delivery. Finally, the tail conduit protects the genome during transfer to allow it to reach the bacterial cytoplasm safely. Bacteriophage T7 belongs to the Podoviridae family; its tail is an ∼2.7-MDa macromolecular complex. At least four proteins (gp8, gp11, gp12, and gp17) make up the T7 tail, which forms a central tubular structure with a closed, twisted nozzle at the bottom formed by a gp12 hexamer. This tubular assembly is surrounded by six protruding fibers specializing in receptor recognition, each of which is a gp17 trimer (12Garcia-Doval C. van Raaij M.J.

Biol. 2005; 12: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA transport is probably best studied for T4, where the contraction of the sheath drives the tail tube trough the outer membrane, forming a channel. In the case of T7, the tail is not long enough to puncture the bacterial envelope. Thus, it is postulated that some Podoviridae adopt a strategy similar to non-tailed viruses and enlarge their tail conduit by forming a new proteinaceous tubular structure when they infect Gram-negative hosts (11Bhardwaj A.

Using cryo-electron tomography, Hu et al. visualized a temporary extension of the T7 tail during infection (18Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage T7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); they suggest that this extension is formed by the T7 core proteins gp14, gp15, and gp16. As these proteins are found inside the mature virus capsid, they could only form a conduit for DNA protection after transport through the tail channel and reassembly in the bacterial envelope (11Bhardwaj A.

The molecular mechanisms that control channel opening and the precise conformational changes in the tail during this process are nonetheless unknown. The Gram-negative bacterial envelope is composed of a peptidoglycan layer surrounded by two membranes (9Vinga I. Sao-José C. Tavares P. Santos M. Bacteriophage entry in the host cell.in: Wegrzyn G.

Biol. 2010; 2: a000414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). During infection, the phage is thought to interact first with a surface molecule that allows correct tail orientation relative to the bacterial envelope, followed by an irreversible interaction with the same or a different receptor; this second interaction is needed to trigger opening of the tail channel (20Casjens S.R.

In the case of phage T7, the identity of the bacterial receptor that triggers the conformational changes in the tail is debated. In the late 1960s, LPS from Escherichia coli B was reported to neutralize T7 (24Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. Bacteriophage T3 and bacteriophage T7 virus-host cell interactions.Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 9-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A few years later, Lindberg (21Lindberg A.A. Bacteriophage receptors.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 205-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) claimed that T7 phages only infect rough strains of E. coli and Shigella, corroborating the importance of LPS in the infection mechanism. The tendency in the early 2000s was to consider LPS only a primary phage T7 receptor that mediates reversible binding to the bacterial surface, whereas another secondary receptor was suggested to be necessary for irreversible binding and infection (20Casjens S.R.

Here we used biochemical approaches to characterize the T7 particle interaction with purified LPS from E. coli rough strains. These studies allowed us to establish an in vitro ejection system for bacteriophage T7 and to carry out structural studies of the bacteriophage after ejection. Altogether these findings give new clues about the conformational changes needed in the tail to allow T7 genome transfer from the phage capsid into the bacterial cytoplasm. T7 (1011 pfu/ml) was incubated with 250 μg/ml LPS from the rough E. coli EH100 Ra mutant (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C; aliquots were collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180 min, diluted in TMS (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl), and stored on ice. Samples were then mixed with BL21 E. coli bacteria, plated on soft agar, and incubated (overnight, 37 °C) to determine viral titer. DNase protection assays were performed as described (26Oliveira L.

As LPS forms big aggregates in solution, to calculate Kbind constants, the molecular mass of the LPS was estimated to 10 kDa per chain (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R.

Curves were normalized and fitted to the double exponential equation (Equation 1) by Andres et al. (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R. Barbirz S.

The kopen constant was calculated after fitting the data to a monoexponential curve at LPS saturating concentrations (50 and 100 μg/ml). The T7-LPS ejection reaction samples were incubated (3 h, 37 °C), applied to Quantifoil 2-μm holey carbon grids coated with a thin carbon layer, frozen in liquid ethane, and transferred to a Tecnai G20 FEG200 electron microscope (FEI) operated as described (13Cuervo A.

Images were classified using XMIPP reference-free clustering approach classification methods (CL2D) (31Sorzano C.O. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Shkolnisky Y. Alcorlo M. Melero R. Caffarena-Fernández G. Li M.

A final model was obtained using the XMIPP Projection Matching package (29Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R.

Biol. 2013; 184: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine volume resolution, the particles were divided into two independent datasets (gold standard) and reprocessed. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to ∼20 Å. The three-dimensional model was deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) (accession number EMD-2717). The three-dimensional reconstruction images were generated using Chimera (35Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27950) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that E. coli rough LPS could act as the receptor for bacteriophage T7 (21Lindberg A.A. Bacteriophage receptors.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 205-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 36Koike M. Iida K. Effect of polymyxin on the bacteriophage receptors of the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we incubated T7 phages with rough LPS. This incubation led to inactivation of the virions (Fig. 1A). After 30 min, nearly half the particles were inactivated; this percentage increased to >90% after 90 min. We used DNase protection assays to test the effect of rough LPS on T7 particles and found a decrease in the amount of DNA protected within the capsids (Fig. 1B). This finding suggested that the decrease in the percentage of infective viral particles was the result of rough LPS-induced DNA ejection. Densitometry analysis of protected DNA as a function of incubation time (Fig. 1B, inset) showed a reduction that is consistent with the drop of phage titer (Fig. 1A). DNA ejection in vitro in the presence of rough LPS was confirmed by EM experiments, in which negatively stained T7 particles were incubated with LPS from rough or smooth (negative control) E. coli strains (Fig. 1C). As predicted, no phages bound to the smooth LPS and no staining agent penetrated the heads, indicating that the virus remained DNA-filled (Fig. 1C, left). In contrast, incubation with LPS from rough strain E. coli showed T7 particle attachment to rough LPS layers, and the staining agent penetrated the capsid, indicating that DNA had been ejected (Fig. 1C, right). These experiments demonstrated that incubation with rough LPS is sufficient to trigger DNA ejection in vitro and allowed us to establish an in vitro system to study T7 genome delivery. Similar findings have been reported previously for P22 (37Andres D. Hanke C. Baxa U. Seul A. Barbirz S. Seckler R. Tailspike interactions with lipopolysaccharide effect DNA ejection from phage P22 particles in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36768-36775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In our experiments with T7 bacteriophage, no proteins were observed inside the capsid after ejection (Fig. 1C, right), suggesting that the core proteins were also ejected (18Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage T7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, we did not observe the core complex attached to the tail structure (Fig. 1C, right) as it disassembles rapidly after DNA ejection (18Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage T7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of the ejection reaction components showed that neither the core proteins (gp14, gp15, and gp16), nor proteins gp6.7, gp7.3, and gp13 were present after DNA ejection, suggesting that they are proteolyzed after DNA translocation (Fig. 1D). Similar results have been reported in vivo (38Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which implies that this degradation is essential for the infection mechanism, possibly to avoid the long-term presence of a membrane channel, which would affect cell integrity after DNA transfer to the cytoplasm. Degradation of these proteins in the in vitro reactions also suggests that one of the viral proteins might proteolyze this structure. To follow real-time DNA ejection at 37 °C, we performed a fluorescence experiment using the Yo-Yo fluorescent DNA binding dye. The fluorescent signal increased immediately after the addition of rough strain LPS receptor to the sample. After 1000 s, ∼50% of viruses had ejected their genome and the curve stabilized in a plateau at ∼5000 s (Fig. 1E). The addition of DNase led to a decrease in the fluorescence signal (data not shown). The signal was dependent on rough LPS addition as DNA was not released when LPS was not present nor when smooth strain LPS was added (Fig. 1E, gray symbols). The fluorescence intensity increase was also dependent on rough strain LPS concentration until saturation was reached at ∼50 μg/ml, when 5 × 109 pfu of virus was used. We observed no further increase in fluorescence values when the virus was incubated with ∼100 μg/ml rough LPS (Fig. 1E, black triangles). As for T5 and P22 (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R. Barbirz S. Tail morphology controls DNA release in two Salmonella phages with one lipopolysaccharide receptor recognition system.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Chiaruttini N. de Frutos M. Augarde E. Boulanger P. Letellier L. Viasnoff V. Is the in vitro ejection of bacteriophage DNA quasistatic? A bulk to single virus study.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), T7 DNA ejection can be fitted to two first order reactions defined by two constants: 1) the first constant describes virus-receptor interaction (defined by kbind), and 2) the second constant describes the channel opening reaction (defined by kopen). Virus-receptor interaction is LPS concentration-dependent. The data fit well to the equation proposed by Andres et al. (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R. Barbirz S. Tail morphology controls DNA release in two Salmonella phages with one lipopolysaccharide receptor recognition system.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As in their case, estimation of LPS aggregates to a molecular mass of 10 kDa per chain allowed us to calculate kbind (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R. Barbirz S. Tail morphology controls DNA release in two Salmonella phages with one lipopolysaccharide receptor recognition system.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We obtained a kbind value of ∼104 m−1 s−1. Fitting of the data at saturating LPS concentrations to a monoexponential equation gave a kopen value of ∼4.2 × 10−4 s−1, in the same order of magnitude as reported for podovirus P22 (kopen ∼4.5 × 10−4 s−1) (28Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R. Barbirz S. Tail morphology controls DNA release in two Salmonella phages with one lipopolysaccharide receptor recognition system.Mol.

Is the in vitro ejection of bacteriophage DNA quasistatic? A bulk to single virus study.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) might be due to ejection of internal head proteins as well as DNA. The C-terminal portion of the fiber protein (gp17) is considered essential for virus-receptor interaction (12Garcia-Doval C. van Raaij M.J. Structure of the receptor-binding carboxy-terminal domain of bacteriophage T7 tail fibers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9390-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine the structural component that interacts with rough LPS, we incubated rough LPS with recombinant fiber-less tail complexes and with fiber-containing tail complexes (13Cuervo A. Pulido-Cid M. Chagoyen M. Arranz R. González-García V.A. Garcia-Doval C. Castón J.R. Valpuesta J.M. van Raaij M.J. Martín-Benito J. Carrascosa J.L. Structural characterization of the bacteriophage T7 tail machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26290-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). EM images of the negatively stained fiber-containing samples showed the tail complex attached to the rough LPS, presumably through the fibers (Fig. 2, A (left), and B, arrows), whereas no tail complexes were attached to rough LPS in the absence of fibers (Fig. 2A, right, circles). Aggregation of rough LPS in samples with fiber complexes could be due to interaction of each of the six fibers with a different LPS layer (Fig. 2, A (left) and B). The results imply that T7 bacteriophage interacts with its receptor through the fibers and that this interaction triggers the conformational changes that lead to DNA delivery. In vitro ejection samples consisting of T7 and rough strain LPS were incubated (3 h, 37 °C) and then vitrified in ethane. Cryo-EM images showed a double-layered LPS filament with viruses attached through the tail complex (Fig. 3A). Incubation of T7 phages with rough LPS led to delivery of the genome and the internal core proteins; as mentioned above, we did not observe core proteins in the capsid after genome ejection reactions. Two-dimensional averages belonging to different side view classes showed the characteristic conical shape of the tail structure, with a central channel that runs from the connector structure to the LPS (Fig. 3B). The two-dimensional classes correlated well with the individual particles (Fig. 3B). We obtained the three-dimensional structure of the tail complex in the post-ejected conformation by image processing of cryo-EM data at ∼20 Å (Fig. 3C). Based on the T7 tail complex structure (13Cuervo A. Pulido-Cid M. Chagoyen M. Arranz R. González-García V.A. Garcia-Doval C. Castón J.R. Valpuesta J.M. van Raaij M.J. Martín-Benito J. Carrascosa J.L. Structural characterization of the bacteriophage T7 tail machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26290-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we segmented the density corresponding to the tail proteins (connector, gp8; gatekeeper, gp11; nozzle, gp12; and fibers, gp17) out of the volume, as well as the capsid protein (gp10) (Fig. 3C). We observed the characteristic shape of the connector structure, embedded in the viral capsid, as well as the N-terminal domains of the six protruding fibers attached to the conical structure and running perpendicular to the central channel (Fig. 3C). Although denaturing gel electrophoresis of the ejection reaction samples demonstrated that the gp17 protein is not degraded during the process (Fig. 1D), we were not able to see the C-terminal domain of gp17 interacting with the LPS in our reconstruction, probably due to the flexibility of the fiber structure. The nozzle complex is found at the opposite side of the connector, ending in an open channel with a 40 Å overall diameter, large enough to permit passage of the dsDNA viral genome. Comparison of pre- and post-DNA ejection conformations (Fig. 4, A and B) permitted the definition of the conformational changes in the tail structure that correlate with DNA delivery. Some of these changes were defined using cryo-electron tomography by Hu et al. (18Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage T7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), who identified a change in fiber orientation. In the mature virus, the fibers are attached to the head and undergo considerable conformational change from an upward to a downward conformation, which allows interaction with the bacterial envelope (18Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage T7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although fiber flexibility did not allow us to visualize its C-terminal portion interacting with the rough LPS, single-particle reconstruction methods allowed us to increase resolution of the tail reconstruction, and thus to define more accurately the changes in the gp17 fiber N-terminal domain. After LPS interaction, the N-terminal fiber domain tilts by ∼30° (Fig. 4, B and C), allowing the C-terminal domain to contact the rough LPS layer. The gp17 N-terminal domain attaches to the tubular structure through a three-lobule region (13Cuervo A. Pulido-Cid M. Chagoyen M. Arranz R. González-García V.A. Garcia-Doval C. Castón J.R. Valpuesta J.M. van Raaij M.J. Martín-Benito J. Carrascosa J.L. Structural characterization of the bacteriophage T7 tail machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26290-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that could act as a hinge, allowing the long fiber structure to tilt. This change in surface contact between fiber and tubular structure might act as a sensor to trigger opening of the tail. Indeed, the DNA halted precisely at this point in the gatekeeper/adaptor channel (Fig. 4A, arrow), suggesting that there is a valve that retains the DNA. Long-tailed viruses have a gatekeeper valve (40Lhuillier S. Gallopin M. Gilquin B. Brasilès S. Lancelot N. Letellier G. Gilles M. Dethan G. Orlova E.V. Couprie J. Tavares P. Zinn-Justin S.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and other Podoviridae phages share the T7 DNA topology, which suggests that they use the same mechanism to secure the genome (41Liu X.

Structure of epsilon15 bacteriophage reveals genome organization and DNA packaging/injection apparatus.Nature. 2006; 439: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The second major conformational change that can be observed at this resolution consists of the opening of the ejection channel by untwisting of the tail nozzle domain (compare Fig. 4, A and B). The gp12 monomer is composed of three domains that form a shoulder and two lobes (13Cuervo A. Pulido-Cid M. Chagoyen M. Arranz R. González-García V.A. Garcia-Doval C. Castón J.R. Valpuesta J.M. van Raaij M.J. Martín-Benito J. Carrascosa J.L. Structural characterization of the bacteriophage T7 tail machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26290-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overlapping the segmented monomers from pre- and post-ejected conformations showed an ∼10° shift around the longitudinal axis of the gp12 apical lobe domain (Fig. 4D). Channel opening is thus the result of a concerted movement by the six gp12 monomers. The structural similarity of the T7 nozzle structure with those of other Podoviridae such as P-SSP7, K1E, and ϵ15 (44Cuervo A. Chagoyen M. Pulido-Cid M. Camacho A. Carrascosa J.L. Structural characterization of T7 tail machinery reveals a conserved tubular structure among other Podoviridae family members and suggests a common mechanism for DNA delivery.Bacteriophage. 2013Google Scholar) suggests that these viruses could share the same tail-opening mechanism. Increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics has revived interest in using bacteriophages as antibacterial agents. Correct implementation of such treatments demands detailed molecular knowledge of bacteriophage infection. Based on these results, we describe the initial steps of T7 infection (Fig. 5). In this model, a series of conformational changes is triggered sequentially. The first interaction of the virus with the outer membrane remains elusive, but studies on bacteriophages belonging to the Podoviridae family suggest that membrane proteins (probably porins) may be involved (22Parent K.N. Erb M.L. Cardone G. Nguyen K. Gilcrease E.B. Porcek N.B. Pogliano J. Baker T.S. Casjens S.R. OmpA and OmpC are critical host factors for bacteriophage Sf6 entry in Shigella.Mol.

This first interaction could be essential to facilitate subsequent recognition of the rough LPS viral receptor. Then, binding of the C-terminal gp17 fiber protein to a component of the rough strain LPS chain (probably a heptose (45Qimron U. Marintcheva B. Tabor S. Richardson C.C.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19039-19044Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) would force tilting of the N-terminal fiber docking point, altering the fiber-gatekeeper interface. Our hypothesis is that these modifications at the fiber-gatekeeper interface could trigger the conformational changes in the nozzle, leading to the opening of the ejection channel and thus leading to the DNA release. The force of the liberated DNA could then untwist the tail nozzle, forcing the irreversible structural modification needed to open the ejection channel. The channel is large enough to transport the DNA and the unfolded core proteins (46Chang C.Y. Kemp P. Molineux I.J. gp15 and gp16 cooperate in translocating bacteriophage T7 DNA into the infected cell.Virology. 2010; 398: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which degrade the peptidoglycan layer and form a conduit to reach the bacterial cytoplasm. To avoid disrupting bacterial integrity, this membrane-spanning tube would disassemble and be degraded shortly after DNA transport. We thank José J.

https://openalex.org/W2088369192,"We studied the dynamics of lexical decisions by asking participants to categorize lexical and nonlexical stimuli and recording their mouse movements toward response buttons during the choice. In a previous report we revealed greater trajectory curvature and attraction to competitors for Low Frequency words and Pseudowords. This analysis did not clarify whether the trajectory curvature in the two conditions was due to a continuous dynamic competition between the response alternatives or if a discrete revision process (a ""change of mind"") took place during the choice from an initially selected response to the opposite one. To disentangle these two possibilities, here we analyse the velocity and acceleration profiles of mouse movements during the choice. Pseudowords' peak movement velocity occurred with 100 ms delay with respect to words and Letters Strings. Acceleration profile for High and Low Frequency words and Letters Strings exhibited a butterfly plot with one acceleration peak at 400 ms and one deceleration peak at 650 ms. Differently, Pseudowords' acceleration profile had double positive peaks (at 400 and 600 ms) followed by movement deceleration, in correspondence with changes in the decision from lexical to nonlexical response buttons. These results speak to different online processes during the categorization of Low Frequency words and Pseudowords, with a continuous competition process for the former and a discrete revision process for the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1967281219,"Several recent studies have reported an inter-individual correlation between regional GABA concentration, as measured by MRS, and the amplitude of the functional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response in the same region. In this study, we set out to investigate whether this coupling generalizes across cortex. In 18 healthy participants, we performed edited MRS measurements of GABA and BOLD-fMRI experiments using regionally related activation paradigms. Regions and tasks were the: occipital cortex with a visual grating stimulus; auditory cortex with a white noise stimulus; sensorimotor cortex with a finger-tapping task; frontal eye field with a saccade task; and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with a working memory task. In contrast to the prior literature, no correlation between GABA concentration and BOLD activation was detected in any region. The origin of this discrepancy is not clear. Subtle differences in study design or insufficient power may cause differing results; these and other potential reasons for the discrepant results are discussed. This negative result, although it should be interpreted with caution, has a larger sample size than prior positive results, and suggests that the relationship between GABA and the BOLD response may be more complex than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1985926395,"Consumption and handling of chicken meat are well-known risk factors for acquiring campylobacteriosis. This study aimed to describe the Campylobacter jejuni population in Finnish chickens and to investigate the distribution of C. jejuni genotypes on Finnish chicken farms over a period of several years. We included 89.8% of the total C. jejuni population recovered in Finnish poultry during 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2012 and used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to characterize the 380 isolates. The typing data was combined with isolate information on collection-time and farm of origin. The C. jejuni prevalence in chicken slaughter batches was low (mean 3.0%, CI95% [1.8%, 4.2%]), and approximately a quarter of Finnish chicken farms delivered at least one positive chicken batch yearly. In general, the C. jejuni population was diverse as represented by a total of 63 sequence types (ST), but certain predominant MLST lineages were identified. ST-45 clonal complex (CC) accounted for 53% of the isolates while ST-21 CC and ST-677 CC covered 11% and 9% of the isolates, respectively. Less than half of the Campylobacter positive farms (40.3%) delivered C. jejuni-contaminated batches in multiple years, but the genotypes (ST and PFGE types) generally varied from year to year. Therefore, no evidence for a persistent C. jejuni source for the colonization of Finnish chickens emerged. Finnish chicken farms are infrequently contaminated with C. jejuni compared to other European Union (EU) countries, making Finland a valuable model for further epidemiological studies of the C. jejuni in poultry flocks."
https://openalex.org/W1999004638,"Background Current information on the epidemiology of physical inactivity among older adults is lacking, making it difficult to target the inactive and to plan for interventions to ameliorate adverse effects. Objectives To present statewide representative findings on the prevalence of physical inactivity among older community residents, its correlates and associated health service use. Methods A representative non-institutionalized random sample of 6963 individuals in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, aged ≥60 years, was interviewed face-to-face. Information was obtained on demographic characteristics, social resources, health conditions and behaviors, health service use, and physical inactivity. Controlled logistic regression was used to determine the association of physical inactivity with these characteristics. Results Overall, 62% reported no regular physical activity. Physical inactivity was significantly more prevalent among women, older persons, those with lower education and income, Afro-Brazilians (73%; White: 61%; “other”: 64%), those no longer married, and was associated with multiple individual health conditions and impaired activities of daily living (ADL). In adjusted analyses, associations remained for sociodemographic characteristics, social participation, impaired self-rated health, ADL, vision, and depression (odds ratios (OR) 1.2–1.7). Physically inactive respondents were less likely to report outpatient visits (OR 0.81), but more likely to be hospitalized (OR 1.41). Conclusions Physical inactivity is highly prevalent, particularly among Afro -Brazilians. It is associated with adverse sociodemographic characteristics; lack of social interaction; and poor self-rated health, ADL, vision, and depression; although not with other health conditions. Self-care may be neglected, resulting in hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W1964546522,"The fleeting lifetimes of the transition states (TSs) of chemical reactions make determination of their three-dimensional structures by diffraction methods a challenge. Here, we used packing interactions within the core of a protein to stabilize the planar TS conformation for rotation around the central carbon-carbon bond of biphenyl so that it could be directly observed by x-ray crystallography. The computational protein design software Rosetta was used to design a pocket within threonyl-transfer RNA synthetase from the thermophile Pyrococcus abyssi that forms complementary van der Waals interactions with a planar biphenyl. This latter moiety was introduced biosynthetically as the side chain of the noncanonical amino acid p-biphenylalanine. Through iterative rounds of computational design and structural analysis, we identified a protein in which the side chain of p-biphenylalanine is trapped in the energetically disfavored, coplanar conformation of the TS of the bond rotation reaction."

The ability of the parasite to rapidly develop resistance to therapeutics drives an urgent need for the delivery of new drugs. The Medicines for Malaria Venture have compounds known for their antimalarial activity, but not necessarily the molecular targets. In this study, we assess the ability of the “MMV 400” compounds to inhibit the activity of three metalloaminopeptidases from Plasmodium falciparum, PfA-M1, PfA-M17 and PfM18 AAP. We have developed a multiplex assay system to allow rapid primary screening of compounds against all three metalloaminopeptidases, followed by detailed analysis of promising compounds. Our results show that there were no PfM18AAP inhibitors, whereas two moderate inhibitors of the neutral aminopeptidases PfA-M1 and PfA-M17 were identified. Further investigation through structure-activity relationship studies and molecular docking suggest that these compounds are competitive inhibitors with novel binding mechanisms, acting through either non-classical zinc coordination or independently of zinc binding altogether. Although it is unlikely that inhibition of PfA-M1 and/or PfA-M17 is the primary mechanism responsible for the antiplasmodial activity reported for these compounds, their detailed characterization, as presented in this work, pave the way for their further optimization as a novel class of dual PfA-M1/PfA-M17 inhibitors utilising non-classical zinc binding groups."
https://openalex.org/W2128331920,"The job satisfaction of academics is related to a number of variables of complex function such as demographic characters, the work itself, pay, work responsibilities, variety of tasks, promotional opportunities, relationship with co-workers and others. Academics may be simultaneously satisfied with some facets of the job and dissatisfied with others. This paper aims at determining the influential factors that contribute to the enhancement or reduction of academics’ job satisfaction among private universities in Bangladesh with special reference to Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. A total of 346 respondents are considered from ten private universities using non-probability sampling. A pre-tested and closed-ended questionnaire using a seven-point Likert scale is used for data collection. In this study, descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation, multiple regression, and factor analysis are exercised as statistical tools. A conceptual model of job satisfaction is developed and applied for academics’ job satisfaction. The results reveal that compensation package, supervisory support, job security, training and development opportunities, team cohesion, career growth, working conditions, and organizational culture and policies are positively associated with the academics’ job satisfaction. Amongst them, three factors stood out as significant contributors for job satisfaction of academics i.e. compensation package, job security, and working conditions. Therefore, the management of private universities should focus their effort on these areas of human resource management for maintaining academics’ job satisfaction and employee retention. The study will be useful for university management in improving overall job satisfaction as it suggests some strategies for employee satisfaction practices."
https://openalex.org/W1982414800,"The Abrolhos Bank is part of the so-called Eastern Brazilian Shelf and is an area of high ecological and economic importance. The bank supports the largest and richest coral reefs in the South Atlantic and the largest rhodolith bed in the world. The spatial and seasonal variation of phytoplankton concentration, however, and the dynamic processes controlling that variability have remained poorly known. The present study investigates the seasonal and spatial distributions of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and water conditions by analyzing nine years (2003-2011) of level-3 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Chl-a, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/ETA model-derived winds, NCEP model-derived heat fluxes, thermohaline and velocity results from the Hybrid Circulation Ocean Model (HYCOM) 1/12o assimilated simulation. The results show that low/high concentrations occurred in austral spring-summer (wet season)/autumn-winter (dry season), with the highest values observed in the northern portion of the Abrolhos Bank. The typical meteorological and oceanographic conditions during austral summer favor the development of strong stratification. These conditions are 1) N-NE winds that favor an upwelling-type Ekman circulation; 2) coupling between the open ocean and the continental shelf through the western boundary current, which promotes cooler subsurface water to rise onto the shelf break; and 3) positive net heat flux. In contrast, the S-SE winds during autumn are in the opposite direction of the predominant current system over the Abrolhos Bank, thus reducing their speed and inducing an inverse shear. The warmer ocean and a somewhat cool and dry atmosphere promote the evaporative cooling of the surface layer. The above processes drive mixed layer cooling and deepening that reaches its maximum in winter. The blooming of phytoplankton in the Abrolhos Bank waters appears to be regulated by changes in the mixed layer depth, with Chl-a levels that start to increase during autumn and reach their peak in June-July."
https://openalex.org/W2021749038,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and has a high rate of metastasis. We hypothesize that NME2 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase 2), which has previously been considered as an anti-metastatic gene, plays a role in the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells. Using a tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that NME2 expression was associated with levels of differentiation of gastric cancer cells and their metastasis into the lymph nodes. When the NME2 gene product was over-expressed by ;in vitro stable transfection, cells from BGC823 and MKN45 gastric cancer cell lines had reduced rates of proliferation, migration, and invasion through the collagen matrix, suggesting an inhibitory activity of NME2 in the propagation and invasion of gastric cancer. NME2 could, therefore, severe as a risk marker for gastric cancer invasiveness and a potential new target for gene therapy to enhance or induce NME2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1993998094,"Penicillium digitatum is the most destructive postharvest pathogen of citrus fruits, causing fruit decay and economic loss. Additionally, control of the disease is further complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains due to the extensive use of triazole antifungal drugs. In this work, an orthologus gene encoding a putative sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) was identified in the genome of P. digitatum and named sreA. The putative SreA protein contains a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF2014) at its carboxyl terminus and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) leucine zipper DNA binding domain at its amino terminus, domains that are functionally associated with SREBP transcription factors. The deletion of sreA (ΔsreA) in a prochloraz-resistant strain (PdHS-F6) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation led to increased susceptibility to prochloraz and a significantly lower EC50 value compared with the HS-F6 wild-type or complementation strain (COsreA). A virulence assay showed that the ΔsreA strain was defective in virulence towards citrus fruits, while the complementation of sreA could restore the virulence to a large extent. Further analysis by quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that prochloraz-induced expression of cyp51A and cyp51B in PdHS-F6 was completely abolished in the ΔsreA strain. These results demonstrate that sreA is a critical transcription factor gene required for prochloraz resistance and full virulence in P. digitatum and is involved in the regulation of cyp51 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2028407198,"Classifications and phylogenetic inferences of organismal groups change in light of new insights. Over time these changes can result in an imperfect tracking of taxonomic perspectives through the re-/use of Code-compliant or informal names. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel approach for aligning taxonomies through the interaction of human experts and logic reasoners. We explore the performance of this approach with the Perelleschus use case of Franz & Cardona-Duque (2013). The use case includes six taxonomies published from 1936 to 2013, 54 taxonomic concepts (i.e., circumscriptions of names individuated according to their respective source publications), and 75 expert-asserted Region Connection Calculus articulations (e.g., congruence, proper inclusion, overlap, or exclusion). An Open Source reasoning toolkit is used to analyze 13 paired Perelleschus taxonomy alignments under heterogeneous constraints and interpretations. The reasoning workflow optimizes the logical consistency and expressiveness of the input and infers the set of maximally informative relations among the entailed taxonomic concepts. The latter are then used to produce merge visualizations that represent all congruent and non-congruent taxonomic elements among the aligned input trees. In this small use case with 6-53 input concepts per alignment, the information gained through the reasoning process is on average one order of magnitude greater than in the input. The approach offers scalable solutions for tracking provenance among succeeding taxonomic perspectives that may have differential biases in naming conventions, phylogenetic resolution, ingroup and outgroup sampling, or ostensive (member-referencing) versus intensional (property-referencing) concepts and articulations."
https://openalex.org/W2030315016,"Background Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become commonly used both as a concept and as a field of research. However, little is known about the HRQOL of men who have sex with men and women (MSMW). The aim of this study was to examine HIV-related behaviors, social support, and HRQOL status and explore its predictors among MSMW. Methods An anonymous cross-sectional study was conducted by snowball sampling method in 2013. A total of 563 Chinese MSM completed a structured questionnaire. The HRQOL and social support were measured with the Chinese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BRFE) and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), respectively. Results Of the 563 MSM analyzed, 77 (13.68%) were MSMW who had a higher proportion of in-marriage and preference for an insertive role as compared with the men who have sex with men only (MSMO) (P<0.05). As high as 70.13% of MSMW had no regular sex partners and 72.73% of MSMW reported engaging in unprotected anal sex in the last six months. 36.36% had tested for HIV, while only 12.99% had accepted HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services. The scores of objective support and subjective support in MSMW were significantly higher than that of MSMO (P<0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in scores of all the four domains of the HRQOL between MSMW and MSMO. When comparing the HRQOL scores of MSMW with the Chinese general population reference group, the scores of MSMW were significantly lower in physical health domain. In a multivariate regression model, age, monthly income, sexual role, VCT acceptability, subjective support were associated with variability in HRQOL. Conclusions To improve the HRQOL among MSMW, more attention needs to be paid to those with low social support, low-income, the old and those prefer a receptive role during anal sex populations."
https://openalex.org/W2008697807,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the downstream adaptor protein MyD88 are considered crucial for protective immunity during bacterial infections. Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is a human respiratory pathogen and a large majority of clinical pneumococcal isolates expresses an external polysaccharide capsule. We here sought to determine the role of pneumococcal capsule in MyD88-mediated antibacterial defense during S. pneumonia pneumonia. Wild type (WT) and Myd88-/- mice were inoculated intranasally with serotype 2 S. pneumoniae D39 or with an isogenic capsule locus deletion mutant (D39∆cps), and analysed for bacterial outgrowth and inflammatory responses in the lung. As compared to WT mice, Myd88-/- mice infected with D39 demonstrated a modestly impaired bacterial clearance accompanied by decreased inflammatory responses in the lung. Strikingly, while WT mice rapidly cleared D39∆cps, Myd88-/- mice showed 105-fold higher bacterial burdens in their lungs and dissemination to blood 24 hours after infection. These data suggest that the pneumococcal capsule impairs recognition of TLR ligands expressed by S. pneumoniae and thereby partially impedes MyD88-mediated antibacterial defense."
https://openalex.org/W2112865723,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis relies on glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimation, traditionally using the creatinine-based Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKDEPI) equation performs better in estimating eGFR and predicting mortality and CKD progression risk. Cystatin C is an alternative glomerular filtration marker less influenced by muscle mass. CKD risk stratification is improved by combining creatinine eGFR with cystatin C and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR). We aimed to identify the impact of introducing CKDEPI and cystatin C on the estimated prevalence and risk stratification of CKD in England and to describe prevalence and associations of cystatin C. Methods and Findings Cross sectional study of 5799 people in the nationally representative 2009 and 2010 Health Surveys for England. Primary outcome measures: prevalence of MDRD, CKDEPI and cystatin C-defined eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2; prevalence of CKD biomarker combinations (creatinine, cystatin C, uACR). Using CKDEPI instead of MDRD reduced the prevalence of eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 from 6.0% (95% CI 5.4–6.6%) to 5.2% (4.7–5.8%) equivalent to around 340,000 fewer individuals in England. Those reclassified as not having CKD evidenced a lower risk profile. Prevalence of cystatin C eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 was 7.7% and independently associated with age, lack of qualifications, being an ex-smoker, BMI, hypertension, and albuminuria. Measuring cystatin C in the 3.9% people with CKDEPI-defined eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 without albuminuria (CKD Category G3a A1) reclassified about a third into a lower risk group with one of three biomarkers and two thirds into a group with two of three. Measuring cystatin C in the 6.7% people with CKDEPI eGFR >60ml/min/1.73m2 with albuminuria (CKD Category G1-2) reclassified almost a tenth into a higher risk group. Limitations Cross sectional study, single eGFR measure, no measured (‘true’) GFR. Conclusions Introducing the CKDEPI equation and targeted cystatin C measurement reduces estimated CKD prevalence and improves risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2146484933,"Climate and land use changes are key drivers of current biodiversity trends, but interactions between these drivers are poorly modeled, even though they could amplify or mitigate negative impacts of climate change. Here, we attempt to predict the impacts of different agricultural change scenarios on common breeding birds within farmland included in the potential future climatic suitable areas for these species. We used the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) to integrate likely changes in species climatic suitability, based on species distribution models, and changes in area of farmland, based on the IMAGE model, inside future climatic suitable areas. We also developed six farmland cover scenarios, based on expert opinion, which cover a wide spectrum of potential changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns by 2050. We ran generalized linear mixed models to calibrate the effects of farmland cover and climate change on bird specific abundance within 386 small agricultural regions. We used model outputs to predict potential changes in bird populations on the basis of predicted changes in regional farmland cover, in area of farmland and in species climatic suitability. We then examined the species sensitivity according to their habitat requirements. A scenario based on extensification of agricultural systems (i.e., low-intensity agriculture) showed the greatest potential to reduce reverse current declines in breeding birds. To meet ecological requirements of a larger number of species, agricultural policies accounting for regional disparities and landscape structure appear more efficient than global policies uniformly implemented at national scale. Interestingly, we also found evidence that farmland cover changes can mitigate the negative effect of climate change. Here, we confirm that there is a potential for countering negative effects of climate change by adaptive management of landscape. We argue that such studies will help inform sustainable agricultural policies for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2149416651,"Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 was first described in 2004 and is associated with respiratory tract disease of varying severity. At the genetic and structural level, HCoV-NL63 is similar to other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily, especially human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Detailed analysis, however, reveals several unique features of the pathogen. The coronaviral nucleocapsid protein is abundantly present in infected cells. It is a multi-domain, multi-functional protein important for viral replication and a number of cellular processes. The aim of the present study was to characterize the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the protein shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded in other coronaviral genomes, with the N-terminal domain responsible for nucleic acid binding and the C-terminal domain involved in protein oligomerization. Surprisingly, analysis of the subcellular localization of the N protein of HCoV-NL63 revealed that, differently than homologous proteins from other coronaviral species except for SARS-CoV, it is not present in the nucleus of infected or transfected cells. Furthermore, no significant alteration in cell cycle progression in cells expressing the protein was observed. This is in stark contrast with results obtained for other coronaviruses, except for the SARS-CoV."
https://openalex.org/W2036853034,"Despite recent therapeutic advances the prognosis of heart failure remains poor. Recent research suggests that heart failure is a heterogeneous syndrome and that many patients have stimulating auto-antibodies directed against the second extracellular loop of the β1 adrenergic receptor (β1EC2). In a human-analogous rat model such antibodies cause myocyte damage and heart failure. Here we used this model to test a novel antibody-directed strategy aiming to prevent and/or treat antibody-induced cardiomyopathy. To generate heart failure, we immunised n = 76/114 rats with a fusion protein containing the human β1EC2 (amino-acids 195-225) every 4 weeks; n = 38/114 rats were control-injected with 0.9% NaCl. Intravenous application of a novel cyclic peptide mimicking β1EC2 (β1EC2-CP, 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or administration of the β1-blocker bisoprolol (15 mg/kg/day orally) was initiated either 6 weeks (cardiac function still normal, prevention-study, n = 24 (16 treated vs. 8 untreated)) or 8.5 months after the 1st immunisation (onset of cardiomyopathy, therapy-study, n = 52 (40 treated vs. 12 untreated)); n = 8/52 rats from the therapy-study received β1EC2-CP/bisoprolol co-treatment. We found that β1EC2-CP prevented and (alone or as add-on drug) treated antibody-induced cardiac damage in the rat, and that its efficacy was superior to mono-treatment with bisoprolol, a standard drug in heart failure. While bisoprolol mono-therapy was able to stop disease-progression, β1EC2-CP mono-therapy -or as an add-on to bisoprolol- almost fully reversed antibody-induced cardiac damage. The cyclo¬peptide acted both by scavenging free anti-β1EC2-antibodies and by targeting β1EC2-specific memory B-cells involved in antibody-production. Our model provides the basis for the clinical translation of a novel double-acting therapeutic strategy that scavenges harmful anti-β1EC2-antibodies and also selectively depletes memory B-cells involved in the production of such antibodies. Treatment with immuno-modulating cyclopeptides alone or as an add-on to β1-blockade represents a promising new therapeutic option in immune-mediated heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2059901544,"In Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the swimming organelle, the archaellum, is composed of three archaellins, FlaB1S2, FlaB2S2 and FlaB3S2. All three are modified with an N-linked tetrasaccharide at multiple sites. Disruption of the N-linked glycosylation pathway is known to cause defects in archaella assembly or function. Here, we explored the potential requirement of N-glycosylation of archaellins on archaellation by investigating the effects of eliminating the 4 N-glycosylation sites in the wildtype FlaB2S2 protein in all possible combinations either by Asn to Glu (N to Q) substitution or Asn to Asp (N to D) substitutions of the N-glycosylation sequon asparagine. The ability of these mutant derivatives to complement a non-archaellated ΔflaB2S2 strain was examined by electron microscopy (for archaella assembly) and swarm plates (for analysis of swimming). Western blot results showed that all mutated FlaB2S2 proteins were expressed and of smaller apparent molecular mass compared to wildtype FlaB2S2, consistent with the loss of glycosylation sites. In the 8 single-site mutant complements, archaella were observed on the surface of Q2, D2 and D4 (numbers after N or Q refer to the 1st to 4th glycosylation site). Of the 6 double-site mutation complementations all were archaellated except D1,3. Of the 4 triple-site mutation complements, only D2,3,4 was archaellated. Elimination of all 4 N-glycosylation sites resulted in non-archaellated cells, indicating some minimum amount of archaellin glycosylation was necessary for their incorporation into stable archaella. All complementations that led to a return of archaella also resulted in motile cells with the exception of the D4 version. In addition, a series of FlaB2S2 scanning deletions each missing 10 amino acids was also generated and tested for their ability to complement the ΔflaB2S2 strain. While most variants were expressed, none of them restored archaellation, although FlaB2S2 harbouring a smaller 3-amino acid deletion was able to partially restore archaellation."
https://openalex.org/W1975712644,"Heat shock gene promoters represent a highly conserved and universal system for the rapid induction of transcription after various stressful stimuli. We chose pairs of mammalian and insect species that significantly differ in their thermoresistance and constitutive levels of Hsp70 to compare hsp promoter strength under normal conditions and after heat shock (HS). The first pair includes the HSPA1 gene promoter of camel (Camelus dromedarius) and humans. It was demonstrated that the camel HSPA1A and HSPA1L promoters function normally in vitro in human cell cultures and exceed the strength of orthologous human promoters under basal conditions. We used the same in vitro assay for Drosophila melanogaster Schneider-2 (S2) cells to compare the activity of the hsp70 and hsp83 promoters of the second species pair represented by Diptera, i.e., Stratiomys singularior and D. melanogaster, which dramatically differ in thermoresistance and the pattern of Hsp70 accumulation. Promoter strength was also monitored in vivo in D. melanogaster strains transformed with constructs containing the S. singularior hsp70 ORF driven either by its own promoter or an orthologous promoter from the D. melanogaster hsp70Aa gene. Analysis revealed low S. singularior hsp70 promoter activity in vitro and in vivo under basal conditions and after HS in comparison with the endogenous promoter in D. melanogaster cells, which correlates with the absence of canonical GAGA elements in the promoters of the former species. Indeed, the insertion of GAGA elements into the S. singularior hsp70 regulatory region resulted in a dramatic increase in promoter activity in vitro but only modestly enhanced the promoter strength in the larvae of the transformed strains. In contrast with hsp70 promoters, hsp83 promoters from both of the studied Diptera species demonstrated high conservation and universality."
https://openalex.org/W1525296891,"Plant-pollinator associations are often seen as purely mutualistic, while in reality they can be more complex. Indeed they may also display a diverse array of antagonistic interactions, such as competition and victim–exploiter interactions. In some cases mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are carried-out by the same species but at different life-stages. As a consequence, population structure affects the balance of inter-specific associations, a topic that is receiving increased attention. In this paper, we developed a model that captures the basic features of the interaction between a flowering plant and an insect with a larval stage that feeds on the plant’s vegetative tissues (e.g. leaves) and an adult pollinator stage. Our model is able to display a rich set of dynamics, the most remarkable of which involves victim–exploiter oscillations that allow plants to attain abundances above their carrying capacities and the periodic alternation between states dominated by mutualism or antagonism. Our study indicates that changes in the insect’s life cycle can modify the balance between mutualism and antagonism, causing important qualitative changes in the interaction dynamics. These changes in the life cycle could be caused by a variety of external drivers, such as temperature, plant nutrients, pesticides and changes in the diet of adult pollinators."

After investigating the suitability and reliability of the cell-based screening method using atorvastatin as the positive control drug, this method was applied in screening Shixiao San and its extracts. The treatment of n-butanol fraction on endothelial cells exhibited stronger healing effects against oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced insult when compared with other fractions. Cell viability, the level of nitric oxide, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and endothelin-1 were measured, respectively. The assays revealed n-butanol fraction significantly elevated the survival ratio of impaired cells in culture. In parallel, n-butanol fraction exhibited the highest inhibition of inflammation. The generation of prostaglandin-2 and adhesion molecule (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) was obviously declined. Furthermore, n-butanol fraction suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and restored the activity of superoxide dismutase. Compounds identification of the n-butanol fraction was carried out by ultra high liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The active ingredients including quercetin-3-O-(2G-α-l-rhamnosyl)-rutinoside, quercetin-3-O-neohesperidoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside revealed the ability of anti-atherosclerosis after exposing on endothelial cells. The current work illustrated the pharmacology effect of Shixiao San and clearly indicated the major active components in Shixiao San. More importantly, the proposed cell-based screening method might be particularly suitable for fast evaluating the anti-atherosclerosis efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicines and screening out the interesting ingredients of Traditional Chinese Medicines."
https://openalex.org/W2089209384,"Background Over the past three decades, obesity-related diseases have increased tremendously in China, and are now the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Patterns of weight change can be used to predict risk of obesity-related diseases, increase understanding of etiology of disease risk, identify groups at particularly high risk, and shape prevention strategies. Methods Latent class trajectory modeling was used to compute weight change trajectories for adults aged 18 to 66 using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data (n = 12,611). Weight change trajectories were computed separately for males and females by age group at baseline due to differential age-related patterns of weight gain in China with urbanization. Generalized linear mixed effects models examined the association between weight change trajectories and baseline characteristics including urbanicity, BMI category, age, and year of study entry. Results Trajectory classes were identified for each of six age-sex subgroups corresponding to various degrees of weight loss, maintenance and weight gain. Baseline BMI status was a significant predictor of trajectory membership for all age-sex subgroups. Baseline overweight/obesity increased odds of following ‘initial loss with maintenance’ trajectories. We found no significant association between baseline urbanization and trajectory membership after controlling for other covariates. Conclusion Trajectory analysis identified patterns of weight change for age by gender groups. Lack of association between baseline urbanization status and trajectory membership suggests that living in a rural environment at baseline was not protective. Analyses identified age-specific nuances in weight change patterns, pointing to the importance of subgroup analyses in future research."

Despite these advantages, P(3HB) production is currently more expensive than the production of oil-derived plastics, and therefore, more efficient P(3HB) production processes would be desirable. In this study, we describe the model-guided design and experimental validation of several engineered P(3HB) producing operons. In particular, we describe the characterization of a hybrid phaCAB operon that consists of a dual promoter (native and J23104) and RBS (native and B0034) design. P(3HB) production at 24 h was around six-fold higher in hybrid phaCAB engineered Escherichia coli in comparison to E. coli engineered with the native phaCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha H16. Additionally, we describe the utilization of non-recyclable waste as a low-cost carbon source for the production of P(3HB)."
https://openalex.org/W2057162837,"The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of animal tissues is commonly used to trace wildlife diets and analyze food chains. Changes in an animal’s isotopic values over time are generally assumed to indicate diet shifts or, less frequently, physiological changes. Although plant isotopic values are known to correlate with climatic seasonality, only a few studies restricted to aquatic environments have investigated whether temporal isotopic varia-tion in consumers may also reflect environmental baselines through trophic propagation. We modeled the monthly variation in carbon and nitrogen isotope values in whole blood of four insectivorous bat species occupying different foraging niches in southern Spain. We found a common pattern of isotopic variation independent of feeding habits, with an overall change as large as or larger than one trophic step. Physiological changes related to reproduction or to fat deposition prior to hibernation had no effect on isotopic variation, but juvenile bats had higher δ13C and δ15N values than adults. Aridity was the factor that best explained isotopic variation: bat blood became enriched in both 13C and 15N after hotter and/or drier periods. Our study is the first to show that consumers in terrestrial ecosystems reflect seasonal environmental dynamics in their isotope values. We highlight the danger of misinterpreting stable isotope data when not accounting for seasonal isotopic baselines in food web studies. Understanding how environmental seasonality is inte-grated in animals’ isotope values will be crucial for developing reliable methods to use stable isotopes as dietary tracers."

Current knowledge of this phenomenon is derived from a limited number of known drugs and tool compounds. However, in a diverse, naïve chemical library, it remains unclear which and to what degree chemical motifs or scaffolds might be enriched for hERG inhibition. Here we report electrophysiology measurements of hERG inhibition and computational analyses of >300,000 diverse small molecules. We identify chemical ‘communities’ with high hERG liability, containing both canonical scaffolds and structurally distinctive molecules. These data enable the development of more effective classifiers to computationally assess hERG risk. The resultant predictive models now accurately classify naïve compound libraries for tendency of hERG inhibition. Together these results provide a more complete reference map of characteristic chemical motifs for hERG liability and advance a systematic approach to rank chemical collections for cardiotoxicity risk."
https://openalex.org/W2049719449,"Cells cope with the threat of xenobiotic stress by activating a complex molecular network that recognizes and eliminates chemically diverse toxic compounds. This “chemoimmune system” consists of cellular Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes, Phase 0 and Phase III ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) membrane transporters, and nuclear receptors regulating these components. In order to provide a systems biology characterization of the chemoimmune network, we designed a reaction kinetic model based on differential equations describing Phase 0–III participants and regulatory elements, and characterized cellular fitness to evaluate toxicity. In spite of the simplifications, the model recapitulates changes associated with acquired drug resistance and allows toxicity predictions under variable protein expression and xenobiotic exposure conditions. Our simulations suggest that multidrug ABC transporters at Phase 0 significantly facilitate the defense function of successive network members by lowering intracellular drug concentrations. The model was extended with a novel toxicity framework which opened the possibility of performing in silico cytotoxicity assays. The alterations of the in silico cytotoxicity curves show good agreement with in vitro cell killing experiments. The behavior of the simplified kinetic model suggests that it can serve as a basis for more complex models to efficiently predict xenobiotic and drug metabolism for human medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1974884368,"We report on novel chromosomal characteristics of Haliotis discus hannai from a breeding population at Fujian, China. The karyotypes of H. discus hannai we obtained from an abalone farm include a common type 2n = 36 = 10M + 8SM (82%) and two rare types 2n = 36 = 11M + 7SM (14%) and 2n = 36 = 10M + 7SM + 1ST (4%). The results of silver staining showed that the NORs of H. discus hannai were usually located terminally on the long arms of chromosome pairs 14 and 17, NORs were also sometimes located terminally on the short arms of other chromosomes, either metacentric or submetacentric pairs. The number of Ag-nucleoli ranged from 2 to 8, and the mean number was 3.61 ± 0.93. Among the scored interphase cells, 41% had 3 detectable nucleoli and 37% had 4 nucleoli. The 18S rDNA FISH result is the first report of the location of 18S rDNA genes in H. discus hannai. The 18S rDNA locations were highly polymorphic in this species. Copies of the gene were observed in the terminal of long or/and short arms of submetacentric or/and metacentric chromosomes. Using FISH with probe for vertebrate-like telomeric sequences (CCCTAA)3 displayed positive green FITC signals at telomere regions of all analyzed chromosome types. We found about 7% of chromosomes had breaks in prophase. A special form of nucleolus not previously described from H. discus hannai was observed in some interphase cells. It consists of many small silver-stained nucleoli gathered together to form a larger nucleolus and may correspond to prenucleolar bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1982951662,"Background Ribavirin (RBV) is a potential partner of interferon-based therapy and recently approved therapy using direct acting antivirals for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, the precise mechanisms underlying RBV action against hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication are not yet understood. To clarify this point, we attempted to develop RBV-resistant cells from RBV-sensitive HCV RNA-replicating cells. Methodology/Principal Findings By repetitive RBV (100 μM) treatment (10 weeks) of 3.5-year-cultured OL8 cells, in which genome-length HCV RNA (O strain of genotype 1b) efficiently replicates, dozens of colonies that survived RBV treatment were obtained. These colonies were mixed together and further treated with high doses of RBV (up to 200 μM). By such RBV treatment, we successfully established 12 RBV-survived genome-length HCV RNA-replicating cell lines. Among them, three representative cell lines were characterized. HCV RNA replication in these cells resisted RBV significantly more than that in the parental OL8 cells. Genetic analysis of HCV found several common and conserved amino acid substitutions in HCV proteins among the three RBV-resistant cell species. Furthermore, using cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we identified 5 host genes whose expression levels were commonly altered by more than four-fold among these RBV-resistant cells compared with the parental cells. Moreover, to determine whether viral or host factor contributes to RBV resistance, we developed newly HCV RNA-replicating cells by introducing total RNAs isolated from RBV-sensitive parental cells or RBV-resistant cells into the HCV RNA-cured-parental or -RBV-resistant cells using an electroporation method, and evaluated the degrees of RBV resistance of these developed cells. Consequently, we found that RBV-resistant phenotype was conferred mainly by host factor and partially by viral factor. Conclusions/Significance These newly established HCV RNA-replicating cell lines should become useful tools for further understanding the anti-HCV mechanisms of RBV."
https://openalex.org/W2088899762,"Concealing the possession of relevant information represents a complex cognitive process, shaped by contextual demands and individual differences in cognitive and socio-emotional functioning. The Reaction Time-based Concealed Information Test (RT-CIT) is used to detect concealed knowledge based on the difference in RTs between denying recognition of critical (probes) and newly encountered (irrelevant) information. Several research questions were addressed in this scenario implemented after a mock crime. First, we were interested whether the introduction of a social stimulus (facial identity) simulating a virtual investigator would facilitate the process of deception detection. Next, we explored whether his emotional displays (friendly, hostile or neutral) would have a differential impact on speed of responses to probe versus irrelevant items. We also compared the impact of introducing similar stimuli in a working memory (WM) updating context without requirements to conceal information. Finally, we explored the association between deceptive behavior and individual differences in WM updating proficiency or in internalizing problems (state / trait anxiety and depression). Results indicated that the mere presence of a neutral virtual investigator slowed down participants' responses, but not the appended lie-specific time (difference between probes and irrelevants). Emotional expression was shown to differentially affect speed of responses to critical items, with positive displays from the virtual examiner enhancing lie-specific time, compared to negative facial expressions, which had an opposite impact. This valence-specific effect was not visible in the WM updating context. Higher levels of trait / state anxiety were related to faster responses to probes in the negative condition (hostile facial expression) of the RT-CIT. These preliminary findings further emphasize the need to take into account motivational and emotional factors when considering the transfer of deception detection techniques from the laboratory to real-life settings."
https://openalex.org/W2139014642,"We study properties of the symbolic sequences extracted from the fractals generated by the arc-fractal system introduced earlier by Huynh and Chew. The sequences consist of only a few symbols yet possess several nontrivial properties. First using an operator approach, we show that the sequences are not periodic, even though they are constructed from very simple rules. Second by employing the ϵ-machine approach developed by Crutchfield and Young, we measure the complexity and randomness of the sequences and show that they are indeed complex, i.e. neither periodic nor random, with the value of complexity measure being significant as compared to the known example of logistic map at the edge of chaos. The complexity and randomness of the sequences are then discussed in relation with the properties of associated fractal objects, such as their fractal dimension, symmetry and orientations of the arcs."
https://openalex.org/W2051843200,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks and play important roles in many biological processes, such as growth and development of mammals. In this study, we used microarrays to detect 261 miRNAs that are expressed in sheep skeletal muscle. We found 22 miRNAs that showed high levels of expression and equated to 89% of the total miRNA. Genetic variations in these 22 pri-miRNAs were further investigated using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. A total of 49 genetic variations, which included 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 8 deletions/insertions, were identified in four sheep breeds. Three variations were further researched in a larger sample set, including five sheep breeds with different meat production performances. We found that the genotype and allele frequencies of the CCC deletion/insertion in pri-miR-133a were significantly related to the sheep meat production trait. Finally, cell assays and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were employed to investigate the effect of pri-miRNA genetic variation on the miRNA biogenesis process. The results confirmed that genetic variations can influence miRNA biogenesis and increase or decrease the levels of mature miRNAs, in accordance with the energy and stability change of hair-pin secondary structures. Our findings will help to further the understanding of the functions of genetic variations in sheep pri-miRNAs in skeletal muscle growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2027685441,"Relating a gene mutation to a phenotype is a common task in different disciplines such as protein biochemistry. In this endeavour, it is common to find false relationships arising from mutations introduced by cells that may be depurated using a phenotypic assay; yet, such phenotypic assays may introduce additional false relationships arising from experimental errors. Here we introduce the use of high-throughput DNA sequencers and statistical analysis aimed to identify incorrect DNA sequence-phenotype assignments and observed that 10–20% of these false assignments are expected in large screenings aimed to identify critical residues for protein function. We further show that this level of incorrect DNA sequence-phenotype assignments may significantly alter our understanding about the structure-function relationship of proteins. We have made available an implementation of our method at http://bis.ifc.unam.mx/en/software/chispas."
https://openalex.org/W2152694854,"Ionic-based dielectrophoretic microchips have attracted significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications in electro kinetic and biological experiments. In this work, a numerical method is used to simulate the dynamic behaviors of ionic droplets in a microchannel under the effect of dielectrophoresis. When a discrete liquid dielectric is encompassed within a continuous fluid dielectric placed in an electric field, an electric force is produced due to the dielectrophoresis effect. If either or both of the fluids are ionic liquids, the magnitude and even the direction of the force will be changed because the net ionic charge induced by an electric field can affect the polarization degree of the dielectrics. However, using a dielectrophoresis model, assuming ideal dielectrics, results in significant errors. To avoid the inaccuracy caused by the model, this work incorporates the electrode kinetic equation and defines a relationship between the polarization charge and the net ionic charge. According to the simulation conditions presented herein, the electric force obtained in this work has an error exceeding 70% of the actual value if the false effect of net ionic charge is not accounted for, which would result in significant issues in the design and optimization of experimental parameters. Therefore, there is a clear motivation for developing a model adapted to ionic liquids to provide precise control for the dielectrophoresis of multi-phase ionic liquids."
https://openalex.org/W2082585689,"Many hypotheses address the associations of plant community composition with natural enemies, including: (i) plant species diversity may reduce enemy attack, (ii) attack may increase as host abundance increases, (iii) enemy spillover may lead to increased attack on one host species due to transmission from another host species, or enemy dilution may lead to reduced attack on a host that would otherwise have more attack, (iv) physical characteristics of the plant community may influence attack, and (v) plant vigor may affect attack. Restoration experiments with replicated plant communities provide an exceptional opportunity to explore these hypotheses. To explore the relative predictive strengths of these related hypotheses and to investigate the potential effect of several restoration site preparation techniques, we surveyed arthropod herbivore and fungal pathogen attack on the six most common native plant species in a restoration experiment. Multi-model inference revealed a weak but consistent negative correlation with pathogen attack and host diversity across the plant community, and no correlation between herbivory and host diversity. Our analyses also revealed host species-specific relationships between attack and abundance of the target host species, other native plant species, introduced plant species, and physical community characteristics. We found no relationship between enemy attack and plant vigor. We found minimal differences in plant community composition among several diverse site preparation techniques, and limited effects of site preparation techniques on attack. The strongest associations of community characteristics with attack varied among plant species with no community-wide patterns, suggesting that no single hypothesis successfully predicts the dominant community-wide trends in enemy attack."
