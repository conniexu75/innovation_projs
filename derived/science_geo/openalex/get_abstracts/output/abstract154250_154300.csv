Chronic elevation of SAH, secondary to the homocysteine-mediated reversal of the SAH hydrolase reaction, reduces methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and phospholipids. High affinity binding of SAH to the active site of cellular methyltransferases results in product inhibition of the enzyme. Using a sensitive new high pressure liquid chromatography method with coulometric electrochemical detection, plasma SAH levels in healthy young women were found to increase linearly with mild elevation in homocysteine levels (r = 0.73; p"

Cysteine protease inhibitors block hemoglobin degradation, indicating that a cysteine protease plays a key role in this process. A principal trophozoite cysteine protease was purified by affinity chromatography. Sequence analysis indicated that the protease is encoded by a previously unidentified gene, falcipain-2. Falcipain-2 was predominantly expressed in trophozoites, was concentrated in food vacuoles, and was responsible for at least 93% of trophozoite soluble cysteine protease activity. A construct encoding mature falcipain-2 and a small portion of the prodomain was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded to active enzyme. Specificity for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates by native and recombinant falcipain-2 was very similar, and optimal at acid pH in a reducing environment. Under physiological conditions (pH 5.5, 1 mm glutathione), falcipain-2 hydrolyzed both native hemoglobin and denatured globin. Our results suggest that falcipain-2 can initiate cleavage of native hemoglobin in the P. falciparum food vacuole, that, following initial cleavages, the protease plays a key role in rapidly hydrolyzing globin fragments, and that a drug discovery effort targeted at this protease is appropriate.

Among potential new targets for chemotherapy are proteases that degrade hemoglobin, a principal source of amino acids (3Olliaro P.L. Yuthavong Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 91-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, erythrocytic parasites transport hemoglobin to an acidic food vacuole, where the protein is hydrolyzed (4Rosenthal P.J.

However, our understanding of the precise roles of plasmodial proteases in hemoglobin degradation is incomplete. In particular, studies of the roles of cysteine proteases in this process have been limited by the lack of straightforward purification schemes and difficulties with heterologous expression. Further characterization of plasmodial cysteine proteases and their roles in hemoglobin degradation should aid in the development of inhibitors of this process as antimalarial drugs.Cysteine protease activity was originally identified in extracts of trophozoites, the erythrocytic parasite stage during which most hemoglobin degradation occurs (8Rosenthal P.J.

Med. 1987; 166: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A critical role for a cysteine protease hemoglobinase was suggested when it was demonstrated that cultured malaria parasites failed to develop when incubated with cysteine protease inhibitors (8Rosenthal P.J.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Morphological examination of cysteine protease inhibitor-treated parasites revealed abnormally swollen, dark-staining food vacuoles, and biochemical evaluation indicated that the abnormality was caused by an accumulation of undigested hemoglobin in the food vacuole (8Rosenthal P.J.

These results suggested a central role for a cysteine protease in early steps in hemoglobin degradation by P. falciparum. However, other studies yielded conflicting results, suggesting that the trophozoite cysteine protease cannot hydrolyze native hemoglobin, but rather that this protease hydrolyzes only denatured hemoglobin fragments produced by the action of vacuolar aspartic proteases (16Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Banerjee D. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Until now, trophozoite cysteine protease activity has been attributed to the product of the single-copy falcipain gene (now renamed falcipain-1) (18Rosenthal P.J. Nelson R.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, although recombinant falcipain-1 was shown to degrade hemoglobin (19Salas F. Fichmann J. Lee G.K. Scott M.D. Rosenthal P.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2120-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of adequate expression and purification schemes has prevented the definitive characterization of the falcipain-1 gene product. We now report the purification of a major P. falciparumcysteine protease by affinity chromatography. This purification has yielded the unexpected result that the principal trophozoite cysteine protease, as determined with peptide substrates, is not the product of the falcipain-1 gene, but rather the product of a newly identified gene, falcipain-2. Our analysis of native and recombinant falcipain-2 strongly suggests that this protease plays a key role in the hydrolysis of both native and denatured hemoglobin by malaria parasites.DISCUSSIONA principal cysteine protease of P. falciparumtrophozoites was purified using an affinity chromatography protocol, which was adapted from a method for the purification of cathepsin B (24Rich D.H. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our purification provided, for the first time, a definitive amino-terminal sequence of this protease. Surprisingly, this sequence was not encoded by the falcipain-1 gene but rather by a previously unidentified cysteine protease gene that we have namedfalcipain-2. In retrospect, it appears that the conclusion that falcipain-1 encodes the principal trophozoite cysteine protease (18Rosenthal P.J. Nelson R.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was based on cross-reactive antisera. Indeed, a rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant falcipain-1 reacted with purified falcipain-2 (data not shown). Falcipain-2 was the only protease purified by our affinity technique. Importantly, both sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of purified protein did not detect the presence of falcipain-1 or falcipain-3. The biological roles of these other putative P. falciparum proteases are unknown. Falcipain-2 constituted at least 93% of soluble trophozoite cysteine protease activity, as measured with the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, but some activity was not accounted for by this enzyme, and activities may differ against different substrates. It is thus possible that the other plasmodial cysteine proteases are also active in trophozoites and play ancillary roles in hemoglobin degradation. Falcipain-2 activity was optimal at acidic pH and concentrated in the acidic food vacuole, as would be expected for a trophozoite hemoglobinase.The facile heterologous expression and refolding of falcipain-2 was somewhat surprising, because the expression of P. falciparumenzymes has often been problematic and our expression construct encoded only a small part of the prodomain. An extensive literature has documented the essential nature of protease prodomains in the expression and refolding of active enzymes (43Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12058-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The prodomains presumably mediate folding and act as protease inhibitors (46Baker D. Silen J.L. Agard D.A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20487-20495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failure to include the prodomain in expression constructs prevented the refolding of active protease. Our falcipain-2 construct included the most 35 carboxyl-terminal residues of the 243-amino acid prodomain. This small portion of the prodomain was adequate to support successful refolding of falcipain-2, apparently because it is the carboxyl-terminal portion of cysteine protease prodomains that mediates enzyme inhibition and/or refolding (54Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 55Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk D. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The refolding of falcipain-2 was accompanied by processing to the mature active protease. This processing was autocatalytic, as is the case with other papain family proteases, including papain (57Taylor M.A. Pratt K.A. Revell D.F. Baker K.C. Sumner I.G. Goodenough P.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the processing occurred in refolding buffer at an alkaline pH (8.0) at which mature falcipain-2 has minimal activity against peptide substrates or hemoglobin. For other papain family enzymes, acidic conditions appear to be required to unfold the prodomain and allow autoactivation (62Jerala R. Zerovnik E. Kidric J. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11498-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Processing of profalcipain-2 may have been expedited by the fact that our expression construct included a truncated prodomain. This domain was adequate to facilitate refolding but may not have interacted with the active site in the manner shown for full prodomains of related enzymes (54Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 55Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 56LaLonde J.M. Zhao B. Janson C.A. D'Alessio K.J. McQueney M.S. Orsini M.J. Debouck C.M. Smith W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, for expressed truncated profalcipain-2, the active site may have been free to cleave the truncated proregion under alkaline conditions. Of note, cleavages during refolding occurred at the native processing site and three sites 4–7 amino acids upstream of the native site, with the majority of molecules cleaved at sites containing P2leucine, a feature of the most favored peptide substrates identified for falcipain-2.Falcipain-2 has some unusual features when compared with other papain family cysteine proteases, including an unusually large prodomain. Interestingly, the prodomains of falcipain-1 (18Rosenthal P.J. Nelson R.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and its analogues from other plasmodial species (63Rosenthal P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 64Rosenthal P.J. Ring C.S. Chen X. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are even larger. The carboxyl-terminal portions of the prodomains of the plasmodial cysteine proteases share modest homology with other papain family enzymes and likely mediate refolding in a manner analogous to that of other papain family enzymes, as supported by the successful refolding of falcipain-2 containing only a truncated prodomain. The amino-terminal portions of the plasmodial cysteine proteases have unknown functions. Of interest, the prodomains of other plasmodial proteases, including the food vacuole aspartic proteases plasmepsin I and plasmepsin II (6Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 7Hill J. Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), also have unusually large prodomains for their respective protease classes. Amino-terminal prodomain sequences may mediate trafficking of the plasmodial proteases, as is the case in some plant (65Vitale A. Chrispeels M.J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), yeast (66Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and protozoan (67Huete-Perez J.A. Engel J.C. Brinen L.S. Mottram J.C. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16249-16256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) proteases. Hydrophobic domains that are present in the prodomains of falcipain-2, falcipain-1, and the plasmepsins do not appear to be typical signal sequences, but may play a role in trafficking to the parasite food vacuole. However, immunofluorescence studies suggest that falcipain-2 is present in both the parasite cytosol and food vacuole, suggesting that transit of profalcipain-2 to the food vacuole is relatively slow and that a reservoir of the proenzyme is present in the cytosol.Analysis of the specificity of falcipain-2 indicated that, at least with peptide substrates, the amino acid at the P2 position plays a key role in mediating substrate specificity. This is also the case with other cathepsin L-like papain family proteases but not with cathepsin B, which accepts chemically disparate P2 amino acids in its substrates. Falcipain-2 showed a preference for the bulky hydrophobic amino acids leucine and phenylalanine over smaller hydrophobic (valine) or charged (arginine, glutamic acid) P2 amino acids. The marked preference for leucine and poor acceptance of valine distinguished falcipain-2 from cathepsin L. The P2 specificity of falcipain-2 was more similar to that of cathepsin K and cathepsin S, two other mammalian papain family cysteine proteases (68Bromme D. Bonneau P.R. Lachance P. Storer A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30238-30242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 69Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Although results with peptide substrates may not predict specificity against physiological substrates, these data are consistent with a preference for P2 leucine in inhibitors with potent antimalarial activity (22Rosenthal P.J.

Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of lead falcipain-2 inhibitors may be expedited by efforts to develop cathepsin K inhibitors as treatments for osteoporosis (70Thompson S.K. Halbert S.M. Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A.

A. 1997; 94: 14249-14254Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Multiple P. falciparum food vacuole enzymes, including aspartic, cysteine, and metallo proteases, appear to participate in hemoglobin degradation, although the precise role of each protease is not well understood (5Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that hemoglobin degradation is an ordered process in which aspartic proteases initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis, and a cysteine protease subsequently hydrolyzes denatured hemoglobin peptides (5Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 16Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This model is appealing in its simplicity, but it cannot easily explain the observation with cultured parasites that the inhibition of falcipain-2 causes the food vacuole to fill with intact globin (8Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), at least a portion of which is native hemoglobin (15Gamboa de Domı́nguez N.D. Rosenthal P.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 4448-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model for the ordered degradation of hemoglobin was based on experiments performed in the absence of reducing agents; consideration of the effects of the physiological reductant GSH on falcipain-2 activity suggests that this protease also hydrolyzes native hemoglobin.Our data show that falcipain-2 is a potent hemoglobinase under strongly reducing conditions, but also that, under physiological conditions (1 mm GSH), falcipain-2 effectively hydrolyzes native hemoglobin. Sufficient reducing strength to activate falcipain-2 appears to be present in the food vacuole, because erythrocyte cytoplasm, which contains millimolar GSH (71Mills B.J. Lang C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), is transported into the food vacuole in large quantity and parasites maintain millimolar concentrations of GSH via synthetic pathways (72Atamna H.

Parasitol. 1996; 83: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that falcipain-2 more efficiently cleaves hemoglobin after its denaturation. These data support a model in which falcipain-2 participates in initial cleavages of hemoglobin and plays a key role in the hydrolysis of globin fragments after initial cleavages cause denaturation of the substrate.Falcipain-2 and other P. falciparum hemoglobinases are promising chemotherapeutic targets.

However, our understanding of the precise roles of plasmodial proteases in hemoglobin degradation is incomplete. In particular, studies of the roles of cysteine proteases in this process have been limited by the lack of straightforward purification schemes and difficulties with heterologous expression. Further characterization of plasmodial cysteine proteases and their roles in hemoglobin degradation should aid in the development of inhibitors of this process as antimalarial drugs. Cysteine protease activity was originally identified in extracts of trophozoites, the erythrocytic parasite stage during which most hemoglobin degradation occurs (8Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H.

https://openalex.org/W1988565419,"DNA transcription is initiated by a small regulatory region of transactivators known as the transactivation domain. In contrast to the rapid progress made on the functional aspect of this promiscuous domain, its structural feature is still poorly characterized. Here, our multidimensional NMR study reveals that an unbound full-length p53 transactivation domain, although similar to the recently discovered group of loosely folded proteins in that it does not have tertiary structure, is nevertheless populated by an amphipathic helix and two nascent turns. The helix is formed by residues Thr(18)-Leu(26) (Thr-Phe-Ser-Asp-Leu-Trp-Lys-Leu-Leu), whereas the two turns are formed by residues Met(40)-Met(44) and Asp(48)-Trp(53), respectively. It is remarkable that these local secondary structures are selectively formed by functionally critical and positionally conserved hydrophobic residues present in several acidic transactivation domains. This observation suggests that such local structures are general features of acidic transactivation domains and may represent specificity determinants (Ptashne, M., and Gann, A. A. F. (1997), Nature 386, 569-577) that are important for transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2039204471,"The autofluorescent lipofuscin that accumulates in retinal pigment epithelial cells with age may contribute to an age-related decline in cell function. The major lipofuscin fluorophore, A2E, is a pyridinium bisretinoid. We previously proposed that the biogenesis of A2E involves the following: (i) formation of the Schiff base, <i>N</i>-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine from all-<i>trans</i>-retinal and phosphatidylethanolamine in the photoreceptor outer segment membrane; (ii) further reaction of<i>N-</i>retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine with retinal to yield phosphatidylethanolamine-bisretinoid, A2-PE; (iii) hydrolysis of A2-PE to generate A2E. To provide evidence for this biogenic scheme, all-<i>trans</i>-retinal was reacted with dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine to yield DP-A2-PE (A2-PE), as confirmed by UV, with mass spectrometry revealing the molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 1222.9 (C<sub>77</sub>H<sub>124</sub>O<sub>8</sub>PN) accompanied by product ion at <i>m/z</i> 672.8, representing the phosphoryl-A2E fragment of A2-PE. In reaction mixtures of retinal and outer segments and in samples of Royal College of Surgeons rat retina containing outer segment membranous debris, A2-PE was detected as a series of high performance liquid chromatography peaks, each with UV similar to reference A2-PE. By mass spectrometry, A2-PE consisted of multiple peaks, representing fatty acids with different chain lengths, and the phosphoryl-A2E moiety, <i>m/z</i> 673. Incubation of the retinal/outer segment reaction mixture with phospholipase D generated A2E, as detected by high performance liquid chromatography, thus confirming A2-PE as the A2E precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2139986038,"p53 is the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer, whereas its homologue, p73, is rarely mutated. Similarly to p53, p73 can promote growth arrest or apoptosis when overexpressed in certain p53-null tumor cells. It has previously been shown that some human tumor-derived p53 mutants can exert gain of function activity. The molecular mechanism underlying this activity remains to be elucidated. We show here that human tumor-derived p53 mutants (p53His175 and p53Gly281) associate in vitro and in vivo with p73 alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. This association occurs under physiological conditions, as verified in T47D and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines. The core domain of mutant p53 is sufficient for the association with p73, whereas both the specific DNA binding and the oligomerization domains of p73 are required for the association with mutant p53. Furthermore, p53His175 and p53Gly281 mutants markedly reduce the transcriptional activity of the various isoforms of p73. Thus, human tumor-derived p53 mutants can associate with p73 not only physically but also functionally. These findings define a network involving mutant p53 and the various spliced isoforms of p73 that may confer upon tumor cells a selective survival advantage."

Amyloid β-peptide is released from the amyloid precursor protein by the sequential action of two proteases, β-secretase and γ-secretase, and these proteases are prime targets for therapeutic intervention. We have recently cloned a novel aspartic protease, BACE, with all the known properties of β-secretase. Here we demonstrate that BACE is anN-glycosylated integral membrane protein that undergoes constitutive N-terminal processing in the Golgi apparatus. We have used a secreted Fc fusion-form of BACE (BACE-IgG) that contains the entire ectodomain for a detailed analysis of posttranslational modifications. This molecule starts at Glu46 and contains fourN-glycosylation sites (Asn153, Asn172, Asn223, and Asn354). The six Cys residues in the ectodomain form three intramolecular disulfide linkages (Cys216–Cys420, Cys278–Cys443, and Cys330–Cys380). Despite the conservation of the active site residues and the 30–37% amino acid homology with known aspartic proteases, the disulfide motif is fundamentally different from that of other aspartic proteases. This difference may affect the substrate specificity of the enzyme.

Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Overproduction of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ, Aβ42, has been suggested to be the cause of all known cases of familial early onset AD (3.Younkin S.G. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and it is assumed that Aβ42 deposition plays an early and critical role in sporadic AD as well. Therefore, Aβ metabolism has attracted considerable interest. In 1987 it was shown (4.Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar) that formation of Aβ requires proteolytic cleavage of a large type I transmembrane protein, the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is constitutively expressed in most cell types. Over the next decade the proteolytic processing of APP has been studied in great detail in a variety of systems by many groups. Taken together, these studies have shown that Aβ is generated at a low rate by most cells analyzed and that two different proteolytic activities are required for Aβ generation. First, β-secretase cleaves APP to generate the N terminus of Aβ, and second, γ-secretase cleaves the C terminus, leading to the release of Aβ (for review see Ref. 5.Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Studies with intact cells expressing APP and the endogenous secretases have led to conclusions about the properties of the β- and γ-secretases,e.g. their tissue distribution, subcellular localization, substrate requirements (see e.g. Ref. 6.Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) etc., but until recently the identity of both β- and γ-secretase was unknown. This changed when we very recently identified the novel transmembrane aspartic protease BACE as the major β-secretase (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Here we characterize the BACE protein. We show that BACE is an N-glycosylated integral membrane protein that undergoes constitutive N-terminal processing in the Golgi apparatus. We determine the processing and N-glycosylation sites and the disulfide bonds. Our results demonstrate that BACE is an unusual member of the pepsin family. Trypsin, pepsin, and endoproteinase Asp-N were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Fluorescein 5-maleimide (FM) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 4-HCCA was from Sigma. Sialidase was obtained from Glyko (Novato, CA). N-and O-glycanases were from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA).N-Glycosidase F was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Other chemicals are of high quality grade. Untransfected 293 cells or 293 cells stably expressing BACE were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitors, and the cells were swollen on ice for 60 min. Cells were lysed by 3 freeze-thaw cycles at −80 °C and then centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 × g to precipitate nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × gto give a crude membrane pellet and a supernatant containing cytosolic proteins. Membranes were solubilized in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2% CHAPS and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant contained the membrane-bound proteins. To determine if BACE is an integral or peripheral membrane protein, crude membranes were washed with either 0.5 m NaCl or 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, to release peripherally bound proteins. A polyclonal antibody specific to the propeptide region of BACE was raised following standard procedures using as immunogen the peptide CGIRLPLRSGLGGAPLGLRLPR (comprising amino acids 25–45 of BACE and an N-terminal Cys residue for coupling). After metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine aliquots of the same cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the previously described BACE C-terminal antiserum (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar) and the propeptide antiserum following protocols described before (11.Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F treatment was performed after immunoprecipitation. For pulse-chase experiments cells were metabolically labeled for 20 min and then chased for the indicated times. Brefeldin A, dissolved as a 30 mm stock in methanol, was used at 30 μm final concentration in medium during a 3-h chase. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by quantitative imaging on a STORM 860 phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics). The BACE-IgG construct containing cDNA encoding the ectodomain of BACE (residues 1–460) and the Fc portion of human IgG1 (230 amino acids) was described previously (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). BACE-IgG protein was purified from conditioned media of stably transfected 293T cells with protein A columns. The protein A eluate consisted of BACE-IgG and a low level of clipped Fc fragment. In order to remove the Fc contaminant, this material was further purified by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (3.2 × 46 cm) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. In order to examine the existence of free sulfhydryl residues in BACE-IgG, the sample was treated with 10 mm FM in 50 mmTris-HCl, 4 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 20 h. Excess reagents were removed by passing through reversed phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm). The protein fraction was subjected to proteolytic digestion for peptide mapping. The above FM-modified sample and intact BACE-IgG (∼50 μg) were initially digested with trypsin (1 μg) at 37 °C for 20 h in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (200 μl). The sample was allowed to proceed to a second digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N (1 μg) under the same conditions. The digested materials were directly subjected to reversed phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm). Peptic digestion of the protein (∼50 μg) was performed in 0.02n HCl, pH 2 (200 μl), for 20 h at 37 °C with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w), and the digestion was terminated by direct injection onto reversed phase HPLC. Trypsin-endoproteinase-Asp-N (TD)- or pepsin (P)-generated peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm). Two solvent systems (solvents A and B) were utilized, solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 2% solvent B to 40% solvent B over 40 min and second gradient from 40% solvent B to 60% solvent B over 10 min. Flow rate was constant at 0.25 ml/min. The peptide was detected by absorbances at 215 and 280 nm. Glycoprotein or glycopeptides were treated with several enzymes. For removal of sialic acid, the dried protein sample was dissolved in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5 (50 μl), and incubated with sialidase (0.1 unit) for 20 h at 37 °C. Protein samples were deglycosylated with N- andO-glycanases in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Glycopeptides were incubated with the above enzymes under the same conditions. The sample was purified by reversed phase HPLC for mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry of the peptides was performed using either a Kratos IV (Kratos Analytical) or Voyager mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The sample was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and then spotted on the sample plate with sinapinic acid or 4-HCCA as matrix. Cys-containing peptides were also analyzed using an ion-spray interface using a MichromeBIOSOURCE Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer. The carrier solvent was 50% acetonitrile:water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid flowing at 5 μl/min. The scan range was 300–2400 atomic mass units with a step of 0.5 atomic unit. The mass units and standard deviation were calculated using Sciex hypermass software. N-Terminal sequence analysis of peptides and proteins was performed on a model 494 ABI Procise sequencer system from Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). For analysis of PTH amino acids, an ABI 140 system was used. Data analysis was performed with the Applied Biosystems model 610 data analysis program for protein sequencing, version 2.1. N-Glycosylation sites of the enzyme were identified by negative response on PTH analysis at the corresponding Asn cycle to the consensus sequence NX(S/T). The purified glycopeptides were further analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometry, indicating the mass of carbohydrate moiety after subtracting peptide mass. Another strategy of carbohydrate analysis was performed by deglycosylation using N-glycanase digestion or hydrazinolysis. The sugar components were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and sodium borohydride (12.Anumula K.R. Dhume S.T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The derivatives were purified by reversed phase HPLC for analysis by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the BACE protein sequence suggests that BACE is a single transmembrane domain protein (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that active enzyme can be released from membrane fractions after treatment with 0.2% Triton (9.Sinha S.

We prepared cell lysates of 293 cells stably overexpressing BACE and separated cytoplasm and membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation. Immunoprecipitation with the BACE C-terminal antiserum (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar) confirmed that BACE is present only in the membrane (M), but not in the cytoplasmic fraction (C) (Fig.1). Washing the membrane fraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride or 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, does not release the protein into the wash phase (P), demonstrating that BACE is indeed an integral membrane protein (I). As noted before, mature BACE migrates on gels at ∼70 kDa, a higher molecular mass than predicted from the amino acid sequence, suggesting that it may be glycosylated (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). When BACE is immunoprecipitated after 20 min labeling from the stable 293 line with the C-terminal antibody, an immature species running at ∼60 kDa is detected (Fig. 2 A, lane B). As expected, nontransfected control cells treated the same way do not show this band (lane C). If the immunoprecipitate is pretreated with N-glycosidase F (lane BF), the band runs at less than 50 kDa, indicating that the immature species isN-glycosylated. The same result is obtained with a second antibody raised to the propeptide region of BACE (Fig. 2 A). This antibody does not show a band with non-transfected control cells (lane C) but recognizes the same 60-kDaN-glycosylated species as the C-terminal antibody, and the same molecular weight shift is observed upon N-glycosidase F treatment.Figure 2BACE processing and glycosylation.

Cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times and immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal antibody (Fig. 2 B). At time 0 immediately after labeling a strong 60-kDa band representing the immature N-glycosylated species is detectable. At 3 h this band has disappeared, and less than half of the original material is recovered as mature glycosylated 70-kDa form that is degraded slowly (broken line,T 12 >9 h, Fig. 2 D). Thus, overexpressed BACE is glycosylated, and the immature N-glycosylated form is rapidly degraded. The immature N-glycosylated protein that escapes degradation is turned into the mature glycosylated form that is stable in 293 cells. We also performed pulse-chase experiments with the propeptide antibody (Fig. 2 C). At time 0 the same 60-kDa band is detected as with the C-terminal antibody; however, by 2 h chase time most of the signal has disappeared (Fig. 2C, quantitation see solid line in Fig.2 D). Only a minor portion of the material is at a molecular mass higher than 60 kDa. These results indicate that the BACE protein undergoes constitutive N-terminal processing and that the N-terminal processing occurs in temporal proximity with the trimming/adding of carbohydrate residues of the immature form, i.e. in the Golgi apparatus. This finding was confirmed by a Brefeldin A treatment experiment (Fig. 2 E). Cells chased for 3 h in the absence of Brefeldin A show only the mature 70-kDa protein that is detectable with the C-terminal antibody but not with the propeptide antibody. In contrast, cells chased with Brefeldin A for 3 h show the immature 60-kDa form that is detectable with both the C-terminal and the propeptide antibody. Thus, treatment of the cells with Brefeldin A blocks both N-terminal processing and further glycosylation of the immature 60-kDa form, indicating that propeptide cleavage happens in the Golgi apparatus. In order to characterize the posttranslational modifications of BACE in detail, it is necessary to purify a large quantity of the protein to homogeneity. We have previously described a soluble form of BACE that retains enzymatic activity but can be more easily purified than the transmembrane form. Because this fusion protein shows enzymatic activity, it is assumed that the structure of the BACE ectodomain is not compromised in a major way (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar) and only with the fusion protein were we able to get sufficient material for biochemical characterization. This fusion protein has been termed BACE-IgG and contains the extracellular domain of β-secretase (residues 1–460) and the Fc portion (230 amino acids) of human γ-immunoglobulin as shown in Fig.3 A. Because the IgG portion of the fusion protein forms the homodimeric Fc piece, we expected to find a molecule of the structure (BACE)2-(IgG)2 in which the two IgG molecules are connected by intermolecular disulfide bonds. The fusion protein was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified from the conditioned media by protein A affinity chromatography, followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300-HR. On non-reducing SDS-PAGE BACE-IgG showed a single band at approximately 116 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 2). An exact measure of protein mass was subsequently obtained by MALDI-mass spectrometry, revealing a single component with a molecular mass of 116 kDa (Fig. 5), consistent with the SDS-PAGE result. This molecular mass suggests the structure BACE-(IgG)2 but not (BACE)2-(IgG)2(see Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the proposed structure BACE-(IgG)2, SDS-PAGE after reducing treatment of purified BACE-IgG with β-mercaptoethanol shows the monomeric BACE-IgG fusion running at 90 kDa, as described previously (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T.

Nonreducing SDS-PAGE after treatment with N-glycanase (lane 6), O-glycanase (lane 8), sialidase (lane 9), and sialidase + O-glycanase (lane 10) shows that BACE contains multipleN-glycosylation sites but insignificantO-glycosylation.Figure 4SDS-PAGE of purified BACE-IgG.

Ten cycles of sequence analysis for the purified BACE-IgG showed multiple N-terminal sequences. Two sequences were derived from the N-terminal domain of BACE starting from residues 22 and 46, corresponding to sequences TQHGIRLPLR-(22–31) and ETDEEPEEPG-(46–55). We interpret the 22-form as the pro-form of the enzyme after cleavage of the signal peptide and the 46-form as the mature active species. The third sequence comes from the IgG portion, corresponding to AVTDKTHTXP-(461–470) for 10 residues. The ratio of the components was roughly 1:1 for BACE to IgG, as expected for BACE-(IgG)2 (see Fig. 3 B). Purified BACE-IgG was examined for the presence of free sulfhydryl residues using FM labeling. The FM-labeled protein was digested with trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N. The peptide mapping analysis (data not shown) indicated a few fluorescent-positive peaks. However, none of them gave N-terminal sequences. Thus, the FM-positive peaks might all be derived from the fluorescent reagent. This result suggests that all 6 cysteine residues in the BACE ectodomain form disulfide bonds. To analyze directly the disulfide bonds and the glycosylation sites, BACE-IgG was digested with trypsin and endoproteinase AspN. The double digestion was performed to obtain the Cys-containing peptides or glycopeptides. The peptide map (data not shown) demonstrated significant resistance against the serine protease or endoproteinase Asp-N, so peptide recovery was insufficient. Nevertheless, several peptides gave useful information for elucidating the structure. The results are summarized in Table I. Peptide TD22.8 gave two sequences, DXK-(277–279) and DXGYNIPQT-(442–450), where X is to be a cysteine residue according to the amino acid sequence (Fig.3 A). Mass spectrometry supported the conclusion that the peptides were linked between these cysteines. Peptide TD27.5a showed a similar, but C-terminally extended sequence DXKEYNY-(277–283). Mass spectrometry of both peptides confirmed the disulfide linkages as indicated with masses of 1376.5 and 1946.1, respectively. From these results we assign the first disulfide linkage as Cys278–Cys443. Finally, peptide TD27.5b consisting of the two peptides, XK-(564–565) and TPEVTXVVVD-(499–508), indicates the presence of Cys504–Cys564 in the Fc region. Since we could not obtain sufficient information to determine all disulfide bonds from the TD-digested peptides alone, the protein was digested with pepsin under acidic conditions. The pepsin-generated peptide map is shown in Fig. 6. Sequence analysis and mass spectrometry revealed the key peptides for determining disulfide linkages and N-glycosylation sites, and the analyzed disulfide bond containing peptides are shown in TableII. Peptide P33.7 contained two sequences LKMDXKEY-(274–281) and DMEDXGYNIPQT-(439–450). Mass spectrometry confirmed this assignment although the observed mass was slightly higher than the expected probably due to oxidation of a methionine residue (Fig. 7 A). This disulfide bond was already assigned by peptide TD22.8 (see above). Peptide P37.7 and P39 showed two sequences, FSLQLXGAGFPLNQSEVL-(211–228) and AVSAXHVHDEF-(416–426), where X indicates the cysteine residue. This peptide permitted us to determine Cys216–Cys420. Asn at residue 223 was not detected by sequence analysis because of theN-glycosylation. The difference between the peptides P37.7 and P39 may be due to carbohydrate heterogeneity. Mass spectrometry of the peptide was not successful due to glycosylation. The third disulfide linkage Cys330–Cys380 was determined by analysis of peptide P44.9, containing two sequences, LVXWQAGTTPWNIF-(328–341) and VATSQDDXYKF-(373–383). The observed mass of 2915 from peptide P44.9 was consistent with the predicted mass 2914.3 within the experimental errors (Fig. 7 B). Another disulfide of the Fc portion was determined to be Cys610–Cys668from peptide P34.6 (see Table II). Finally, the dimerized peptide P30.5 demonstrates the intermolecular linkages between Cys469 and Cys472 in the Fc portion.Table ISequences of Cys-containing peptides from trypsin-endoproteinase Asp-N double digestion of BACE-IgGPeptideSequence (residue no.) aCysteine residues were not detected by sequence analysis, but they are derived from the protein sequence (see Fig. 3 A).Observed massCalculated mass (MH+)Disulfide bondTD 22.8DCK-(277–279)13751376.5Cys278–Cys443DCGYNIPQT-(442–450)TD27.5aDCKEYNY-(277–283)19421946.1Cys278–Cys443DCGYNIPQT-(442–450)TD27.5bTPEVTCVVVD-(499–508)11941197.4Cys504–Cys564CK-(564–565)a Cysteine residues were not detected by sequence analysis, but they are derived from the protein sequence (see Fig. 3 A).

Four N-glycosylation sites (Asn153, Asn172, Asn223, and Asn354) from BACE and one site (Asn540) from IgG are predicted according to the consensus sequence, NX(S/T). After sequence analysis of all peptic peptides, we found that the four potential N-glycosylation sites of BACE are indeed occupied by carbohydrate moieties. The fact that glycopeptides with the same amino acid sequence were separately eluted on HPLC suggests that these N-glycosylation sites may have carbohydrate heterogeneities. For example, the peptide FINGSN-(170–175) containing Asn172 is separated into several peaks, P14.4, P14.9, and P15.3, respectively (Fig. 6). Moreover, mass spectrometry of a single HPLC peak, e.g. P27, gave several mass units, 3158.5, 3320.7, 3524.1, and 3686.2, respectively. According to the sequence analysis the glycopeptide P27 has the sequence VSIPHGPNVTVRA-(146–158) (mass = 1347.5) andN-glycans of this peptide should have 1811.0, 1973.2, 2176.6, and 2338.7 mass units, respectively. Thus, even considering experimental errors, our mass data predict multiple carbohydrate structures. Sequence and mass spectral analyses of the glycopeptides are listed in Table III. Due to the complexity of the problem, determination of the exact carbohydrate structure is still in progress, but the mass spectral fragmentation suggests that the predicted carbohydrates may have high hexose units, leading to the observed structural heterogeneity.Table IIIGlycopeptides from BACE-IgGPeptideSequence (residue no.)Sites aN-Glycosylation sites were determined by no detection of PTH-Asn at the corresponding cycle.

Open table in a new tab This study provides the first characterization of the recently identified β-secretase protein BACE at the biochemical level. We began our analysis by addressing properties of the intact form of BACE that contains the predicted transmembrane domain, and we confirmed that the BACE protein is an integral membrane protein (7.Vassar R.

Mc Conlogue L. Varghese J. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Analysis of the turnover of BACE in overexpressing 293 cells demonstrated that BACE is constitutively processed to a mature form lacking the propeptide region. Apparently, this processing is quite efficient, even under overexpression conditions, as has been reported before (9.Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suomensaari S.M. Wang S. Walker D. Zhao J. Mc Conlogue L. Varghese J. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). At least in the 293 cells tested here processing of BACE does not appear to limit β-secretase activity. The immature BACE protein is rapidly turned over, and less than half of the initial material is recovered as mature protein. We do not know at this point whether the massive loss of immature protein is an overexpression artifact or whether a major proportion of immature BACE is degraded under low level expression conditions as well. Once processed, BACE is quite stable even under overexpression conditions. Our results show that BACE is glycosylated. The findings that there is almost no fully glycosylated BACE which still contains the propeptide epitope and that Brefeldin A treatment blocks processing indicate that the cleavage of the propeptide happens in the Golgi apparatus. The nature of the propeptide processing enzyme is currently under investigation, but an autocatalytic mechanism, as reported for pepsin (13.Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), seems unlikely, if one considers the sequence specificity of BACE (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). To analyze the biochemistry of BACE in more detail, we made use of the previously described BACE-IgG construct (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar) containing the entire ectodomain of BACE, which can be purified much more conveniently than the transmembrane form. Because this form of the enzyme is active and maintains the sequence specificity of β-secretase (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar), it appears justified to study structural features of BACE using this soluble form. Sequencing of BACE-IgG confirms the Glu46 start previously described for the transmembrane form (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar) and also identifies a species starting at Thr23 that has the signal peptide cleaved off, but still contains the propeptide. We observed much lower amounts of this form when we analyzed membrane-bound BACE, suggesting that the propeptide cleavage of BACE-IgG is not quite as efficient as that of BACE. Whether this is due to different transport kinetics or other differences between the two forms is currently not known. The ectodomain of BACE contains six cysteines. According to the SH-labeling experiments it does not contain any free cysteines, but they all form disulfide bonds. Within BACE we did not detect dimeric forms caused by covalent intermolecular bonds, but instead we demonstrated that all three disulfide bonds are intramolecular linkages. Since BACE is clearly a member of the pepsin family (7.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar), one might expect that it could have a structure similar to other aspartic proteases including pepsin, cathepsin D or E, and human immunodeficiency virus proteases (for review see Ref. 13.Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). However, here we show that it has no significant homology with other pepsin family members in the disulfide structure. As shown in Fig.8, only phytepsin, a plant aspartic protease (14.Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), showed partial similarity with β-secretase in the big loops of the C-terminal domain. These structural differences may affect substrate specificity of the enzymes. Obviously, a detailed discussion of the structure function-relationship for β-secretase will require x-ray crystallographic studies. Understanding this prime target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease at the atomic level may turn out to be crucial for drug development."

NRL (neural retina leucine zipper) and CRX (cone rod homeobox) proteins bind to the adjacent NRE and Ret-4 sites, respectively, within this region. Although NRL and CRX are each individually able to induce rhodopsin promoter activity, when expressed together they exhibit transcriptional synergy in rhodopsin promoter activation. Using the yeast two-hybrid method and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, we demonstrate that the leucine zipper of NRL can physically interact with CRX. Deletion analysis revealed that the CRX homeodomain (CRX-HD) plays an important role in the interaction with the NRL leucine zipper. Although binding with the CRX-HD alone was weak, a strong interaction was detected when flanking regions including the glutamine-rich and the basic regions that follow the HD were included. A reciprocal deletion analysis showed that the leucine zipper of NRL is required for interaction with CRX-HD. Two disease-causing mutations in CRX-HD (R41W and R90W) that exhibit reduced DNA binding and transcriptional synergy also decrease its interaction with NRL. These studies suggest novel possibilities for protein-protein interaction between two conserved DNA-binding motifs and imply that cross-talk among distinct regulatory pathways contributes to the establishment and maintenance of photoreceptor function.

The elucidation of these protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions is critical to our understanding of the mechanisms of cell type- and tissue-specific gene expression. Generation of multiple neuronal cell types during retinal development is an evolutionarily conserved biological process, which offers a convenient model system to investigate tissue-specific gene regulation. More than 30 transcription factors representing several classes of DNA-binding proteins are expressed in developing and mature mammalian retina; nevertheless, the precise function of a majority of these proteins remains to be elucidated (12Freund C.

Rhodopsin, the G-protein-coupled light receptor, is expressed specifically in the rod photoreceptors of retina and is a pivotal protein for visual function. Its expression is correlated to rod differentiation and maintained at high levels afterward, throughout life (15Morrow E.M. Furukawa T. Cepko C.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Altered expression of rhodopsin and mutations that affect its function in mature rods result in retinal degeneration (15Morrow E.M. Furukawa T. Cepko C.L.

Gen. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Regulation of rhodopsin expression is primarily at the level of transcription and is mediated by two distinct regions: a proximal sequence from −176 to +70 bp, which determines photoreceptor specificity (called the rhodopsin proximal promoter region (RPPR)),1 and another more upstream region required for high level expression (called the rhodopsin enhancer region) (17Zack D.J.

A number of DNA sequence elements that bind to nuclear proteins have been identified within RPPR; these include Ret-1/PCE-1 (23Morabito M.A., Yu, X. Barnstable C.J. J. Biol.

Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), was the first transcription factor shown to bind to NRE in the RPPR region and transactivate the rhodopsin promoter in cultured cells (28Rehemtulla A.

Soon thereafter, CRX, a photoreceptor-specific paired-like homeodomain protein, was identified as the Ret-4 and BAT-1 binding protein by yeast one-hybrid screening and shown to activate the promoters of rhodopsin and other retinal genes (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). NRL and CRX demonstrated transcriptional synergy in rhodopsin promoter activation when transfected together in cultured cells (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J.

Recently, the Ret-1/PCE-1 element was shown to bind two other homeodomain proteins, Erx (32Martinez J.A. Barnstable C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Rx (33Kimura A. Singh D. Wawrousek E.F. Kikuchi M. Nakamura M. Shinohara T. J. Biol.

During embryonic development in mice, Nrl transcripts are detected in all postmitotic neurons and lens; however, its expression becomes restricted primarily to the retinal photoreceptors in the adult (34Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar). CRX is expressed specifically in photoreceptors and pinealocytes and plays a significant role during photoreceptor differentiation (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J.

Consistent with their role in rhodopsin regulation, detection of NRL and CRX transcripts precedes rhodopsin expression during rod development in mammals. In addition, mutations in the humanCRX and NRL genes have been identified in retinopathies, and these mutations result in altered transcriptional synergy in rhodopsin promoter activation assays (37Freund C.L.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the transcriptional synergy between NRL and CRX in rhodopsin regulation results from cooperativity in binding to adjacent NRE and Ret-4 (or BAT-1) sites and/or from direct physical interaction, leading to the formation of a stable enhanceosome and/or initiation complex. In this paper, we demonstrate direct interaction between the leucine zipper of NRL and the homeodomain of CRX using the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap andin vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. The two-hybrid screening in yeast was carried out according to the published procedure (42Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1996: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The bait construct was generated by cloning the SacII–PpuMI fragment of the human NRL cDNA (29Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) at the PvuII site of the pHybLex/Zeo vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting construct, called pLex-NRL-ZIP, encoded the NRL leucine zipper (NRL-ZIP; amino acids 171–231) fused in frame with the LexA protein and did not display autologous activation of the reporter gene lacZ orHIS3 upon transformation in the yeast L40 strain (MATa his3Δ200 trp1–901 leu2–3112 ade2 LYS2::(4lexAop-HIS3) URA3::(8lexAop-lacZ) GAL4). The following constructs were obtained as part of the “Hybrid Hunter System” (from Invitrogen) and used for positive and negative interaction control experiments: pHybLex/Zeo-Fos2, pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin, and pYESTrp-Jun, which expressed the c-Fos leucine-zipper domain fused to LexA, laminin fused to LexA, and the c-Jun leucine zipper fused to the B42-activation domain (B42-AD), respectively. A bovine retina cDNA library (43Tai A.W. Chuang J.-Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.-H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) in pACTII (prey vector with Gal4-activation domain) (a generous gift of Dr. C. H. Sung) was used to isolate interacting clones. Yeast strain L40 was sequentially transformed with pLex-NRL-ZIP and then with 10 μg of DNA from the retina library or purified clones in the prey vector, essentially as described (44Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Shiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Double transformants were selected for presence of the bait and the prey vectors, and possible interactors were selected by growth on the appropriate yeast minimal medium (250 μm zeocin, minus Leu His) and by filter lift assay of β-galactosidase activity. Mixed bait and prey construct DNAs were recovered from double-positive yeast transformants after Zymolase-20T/SDS treatment (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). The pACTII retina library clones were separated from the bait vector DNA by electroporation into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue bacteria and growth on LB-ampicillin plates. Plasmid DNA, prepared by the alkaline lysis method, was used for sequencing and to test for false positives by retransformation of L40 yeast strains containing pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin and pLex-NRL-ZIP bait vectors. NRL cDNA fragments corresponding to the full-length protein of 237 amino acids and a truncated protein with the bZIP domain (amino acids 110–237; ΔNRL) were cloned in frame with GST in the pGex2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bovine CRX (bCRX) cDNA was cloned in pcDNA3.1/HisC mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A series of N- and C-terminal deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification usingPfu DNA polymerase (Strategene, La Jolla, CA), with the wild-type bCRX and primers corresponding to the appropriate end sequences with added BamHI (5′) or EcoRI (3′) site (see Fig. 5 A). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and subcloned intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA 3.1/HisC vector. All deletions are fused in frame with the His6 tag at the N terminus and contain a stop codon at the C terminus. The sequence of each deletion construct was confirmed using a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism DNA sequencing kit and ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. The GST, GST-NRL, and GSTΔNRL proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21, essentially as described (45Artandi S. Calame K. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 267-278Google Scholar). Briefly, the transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C for 4 h (A600∼0.8) and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 27 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). E. coli-expressed proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads, as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were estimated using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma). The GST-CRX-HD fusion protein was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21, as described previously (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). bCRX constructs in pcDNA3.1/HisC vector (0.3 μg of double-stranded DNA) were translated in a 25-μl reaction in the presence of [35S]methionine (>1000 μCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the T7-TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation SystemTM (Promega). For in vitro interaction experiments, 7 μl of the 35S-labeled protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST, GST-NRL, or GSTΔNRL protein (≥100 μg) in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). After 18 h of incubation at 4 °C on a nutator, the beads were washed five times in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl and, 0.2% Triton X-100. After the final wash, glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins were resuspended in 60 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To estimate the amount of labeled protein used in binding, 20% of the in vitrotranslated products were also examined on a parallel gel. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography after treatment of the gel with AmplifyTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). For in vitro translation studies, the NRL cDNA (29Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was subcloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The plasmid construct was linearized by different restriction enzymes that digest at a unique site, and 35S-labeled full-length or truncated NRL proteins were produced using the T7-TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation SystemTM (Promega). As an initial approach to evaluate the possibility of direct interaction between NRL and CRX, the yeast two-hybrid method was employed. We generated a bait vector that produced a fusion protein with LexA and the leucine zipper domain of NRL (NRL-ZIP). This bait construct did not autoactivate the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes upon transformation in L40 yeast. The NRL-ZIP bait was used for screening a bovine retinal cDNA library in the pACTII vector (43Tai A.W. Chuang J.-Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.-H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Twenty-eight yeast double transformants that displayed fast growth on minus His medium were selected for further analysis. Filter lift tests of these His+ clones identified 26 clones that expressed β-galactosidase activity as well. Sequence analysis of the double positive clones revealed that 21 of them had bCRX sequence fused in frame to the Gal-4 activation domain. These clones could be divided into five subsets; four subsets included the 5′ noncoding sequence of bCRX, whereas one began at codon 14 of bCRX (Fig.2). All of the bCRX clones obtained from the screen contained the homeodomain. These clones, with or without the additional sequence from the 5′-untranslated region, were retransformed into L40 yeast. The presence of both the bait vector pLex-NRL-ZIP and bCRX-prey clones was found to be essential for growth on minus His medium (Fig. 3).Figure 3NRL-leucine zipper domain interacts with CRX in the yeast two-hybrid assay. A, the pACTII prey clones obtained from the screening of a bovine retina library were transformed into yeast L40 with and without the bait vector pLex-NRL-ZIP and replica-streaked onto minimal medium (minus Leu His, plus 10 mm aminotriazole) or minimal medium (minus Leu His, plus 250 μm zeocin, 10 mm aminotriazole). Three examples are shown here: Gal4-AD/CRX fusions without the 5′ noncoding sequence (clone CRX-N14), with the 5′ noncoding sequence (clone CRX-A), and a novel clone (KM1698–1). Only L40 double transformants with the bait vector grew on minus His plates.B, interaction of CRX is specific for the NRL-leucine zipper domain. Bait yeast strains L40/pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin and L40/pLex-NRL-ZIP were transformed with the CRX-N14 DNA, and double transformants were streaked onto minimal medium (minus Leu, minus His, plus 250 μm zeocin and 50 mm aminotriazole). The yeast transformants with the laminin bait and CRX prey did not grow, whereas NRL-ZIP and CRX double transformants activated the HIS3reporter gene and grew well. C, LexA-c-Fos (pHybLex/Zeo-Fos2) interacts with B42-AD-c-Jun (pYESTrp-Jun) in L40 yeast under identical assay conditions, whereas double transformants of LexA-laminin (pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin) with B42-AD-c-Jun did not show any interaction. Double transformants with c-Jun/c-Fos grew well on minimal medium (minus Trp, minus His, plus 250 μm zeocin and 50 mm aminotriazole), while those with laminin/c-Fos did not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specificity of interaction between NRL-ZIP and bCRX was confirmed by transformation of pACTII-bCRX(N14) with pLex-NRL-ZIP or pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin and streaking the double transformants onto minus His plates containing 50 mm aminotriazole. As shown in Fig. 3 B, only yeast double transformants with pLex-NRL-ZIP grew on minus His plates, while the presence of the laminin bait construct did not result in the activation of the HIS3reporter gene. Under identical assay conditions, double transformants of L40 yeast with the c-Fos (pHybLex/Zeo-Fos2) bait and c-Jun (pYESTrp-Jun) prey constructs showed excellent growth on minus His plates, whereas the double transformants with the laminin bait (pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin) and c-Jun prey did not (Fig. 3 C). To confirm the direct interaction of NRL and CRX, we employed a pull-down assay with GST fusion proteins. Both GST-NRL (expressing GST fused with the full-length NRL protein) and GSTΔNRL (GST fused with the C-terminal 117 amino acids of NRL; primarily the bZIP domain), but not GST alone, were able to interact with the in vitrotranslated full-length CRX protein (Fig.4). This was consistent with the yeast two-hybrid screening, where NRL-ZIP bait was used. The addition of micrococcal nuclease to the GST pull-down reactions (in order to remove the DNA template) did not significantly alter the interaction of CRX with NRL (data not shown). To further define the region of bCRX protein that interacts with NRL, various deletion constructs (shown in Fig.5 A) were used for in vitro translation. In the pull-down assay, full-length (construct bCRX) and truncated proteins containing the HD and the glutamine-rich plus basic region (constructs N34, C160, and C208) demonstrated strong binding to GSTΔNRL (Fig. 5 B). Deletion of the N-terminal 87 residues (construct N88), which include most of the homeodomain, considerably reduced the binding of bCRX to GSTΔNRL, whereas the removal of the N-terminal 111 residues (construct N112, which also removes the Gln region) completely eliminated the binding (Fig.5 B). Deletion of the first 33 amino acids in bCRX (construct N34) did not have any effect on the interaction. Truncated bCRX proteins, which included the homeodomain (constructs HD and C107), consistently showed binding to NRL, although at a reduced level (Fig.5 B). SDS-PAGE analysis of the in vitro translated bCRX proteins revealed a comparable intensity of the labeled protein in binding reactions (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, the data strongly suggest that amino acids 34–88 (i.e. the homeodomain) constitute a region of CRX that is important for interaction with NRL-bZIP. Nonetheless, the binding efficiency was enhanced dramatically when the glutamine-rich plus basic region that follows the HD was included. Together with the yeast two-hybrid experiments, these results suggest that CRX-HD provides the primary interface for physical interaction with the leucine zipper motif of NRL. To define the domain of NRL responsible for interaction with the CRX homeodomain, GST-CRX-HD fusion protein was used for GST pull-down assay of in vitro translated NRL proteins. Full-length NRL and the NRL proteins with C-terminal deletions after amino acids 210 and 190 (NRL210 and NRL190) were prepared by in vitro translation. Full-length NRL displayed strong interaction with GST-CRX-HD by pull-down assay (Fig.6). Removal of the leucine zipper domain (either in part or most of it, constructs NRL210 and NRL190) decreased NRL's binding to CRX-HD (Fig. 6) and its ability to form a homodimer (data not shown). To further ascertain the importance of HD in NRL-CRX interaction, two mutations (R41W and R90W, identified in autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (38Swain P.K. Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Affatigato L.M. Coats C.L. Brady K.D. Fishman G.A. Jacobson S.G. Swaroop A. Stone E. Sieving P.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Leber congenital amaurosis (40Swaroop A. Wang Q.L. Wu W. Cook J. Coats C. Xu S. Chen S. Zack D.J. Sieving P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), respectively) were incorporated in the CRX expression construct. The mutant CRX proteins, synthesized in vitro, were then used for the pull-down assay with GSTΔNRL. Both HD mutations, R41W and R90W, resulted in reduced binding to NRL-bZIP (Fig.7), consistent with the role of HD as the primary interface for interaction. Using two independent methods, we have provided evidence for direct physical interaction of NRL and CRX, two transcription factors implicated in rhodopsin regulation. The yeast two-hybrid studies show that the interaction is stable and functional within a cellular environment, whereas the GST pull-down experiments demonstrate direct association in vitro. These studies also indicate that the leucine zipper domain of NRL is sufficient for binding to CRX. Yeast two-hybrid experiments with LexA-bait fusions comprising the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of NRL-ZIP also showed interaction with the CRX prey (data not shown), suggesting a broad surface of contacts along the leucine zipper. Interestingly, the x-ray crystal structure of the interaction of the leucine zipper dimer AP1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) with NFAT, a β-scaffold type DNA-binding domain protein, illustrates an interaction surface that extends along the length of the leucine zipper region (47Chen L. Glover J.N.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The bZIP transcription factors have been shown to interact with several other protein domains, and such interaction can either activate or repress expression of downstream target genes (48Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C. Sun Y.-L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 49Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M.

Our studies demonstrate that the bZIP motif is capable of interacting with the homeodomain as well. Although deletions can cause allosteric effects, the GST pull-down studies using CRX-HD with NRL deletion constructs (see Fig. 6) are consistent with this conclusion. While the leucine zipper region is sufficient for interaction with CRX (and specifically CRX-HD), it is probably not the only NRL domain that can interact with CRX. Other regions in NRL might also provide additional contact surfaces for interaction (see Fig.6). 2K. P. Mitton and A. Swaroop, unpublished data. During the yeast two-hybrid screening, we did not identify any leucine zipper proteins. This was surprising, since leucine zippers are shown to heterodimerize with other leucine zipper proteins. It is possible that CRX is the predominant interacting protein, and we did not exhaustively screen the prey library. Nonetheless, we think that the lack of leucine zipper proteins is due to the design of the bait construct. LexA binds to DNA as a homodimer through its N-terminal domain, while dimerization is mediated by its C-terminal domain (52Schnarr M. Oertel-Buchheit P. Kazamaier M. Granger-Schnarr M. Biochemie. 1991; 73: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The use of NRL-ZIP as LexA fusion bait presents two possible outcomes. If the NRL-ZIP does not homodimerize, then the bait domain will be free to interact and form other potential leucine zipper associations with prey proteins from the retina library. This is illustrated by the fact that LexA-c-Fos bait fusion is free to interact with the B42-AD-c-Jun fusion protein, since the c-Fos leucine zipper does not homodimerize. On the other hand, if the NRL-ZIP forms a stable homodimer, complemented by LexA dimerization, it will not be available to interact with other leucine zipper domains. Nevertheless, prey proteins that interact with the exterior surface of the NRL-ZIP dimer would be picked up in this yeast two-hybrid screening. Analysis of the NRL-ZIP domain sequence reveals that the NRL-NRL homodimer has six potential ionic interactions, which would favor dimerization of similar strength as Fos-Jun association. The strong interaction of NRL with itself in GST pull-down assays strongly supports this possibility (data not shown). The yeast two-hybrid screening results are consistent with the hypothesis that NRL-ZIP bait exists as a homodimer and that the surface with leucine residues in the zipper is unavailable for interaction. We suggest that bCRX interacts with the NRL-ZIP homodimer and that the NRL interaction surface is the outside surface of the dimer (positionsa and d around the helical wheel) (53Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Additional experiments will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Homeodomains bind to DNA, and this is true for CRX as well (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

Zack D.J. Sieving P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on the published structure of the paired homeodomain (54Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that CRX-HD has three helix motifs: h1, from residues 50–59; h2, residues 69–76; and h3, residues 80–89. Helix-3 should be important for making contacts with DNA. It would then appear that the helices h1 and h2 are more accessible for interaction with NRL, consistent with the yeast two-hybrid screening results and CRX deletion analysis in GST pull-down assays. Both h1 and h2 are rich in ionic and polar amino acids that can make salt-bridge and hydrogen bonds with the NRL interaction surface. The conclusion that CRX-HD is involved in both DNA binding and protein-protein interaction is strengthened by the GST pull-down experiments with mutant CRX proteins (see Fig. 7). The glutamine-rich plus basic region that follows the homeodomain could provide a surface for additional interaction, since it enhanced the binding in pull-down assays. Homeodomain proteins appear to have a broad influence on gene expression, since they bind to a wide range of DNA sequences with similar affinity and this binding can be positively correlated to transcriptional activity (55Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 56Carr A. Biggin M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CRX may have a similar global influence on photoreceptor-specific gene expression, since it can bind to and transactivate from regulatory elements in several photoreceptor-specific genes, including rhodopsin, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, arrestin, and β-phosphodiesterase (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 57Livesey F.J. Furukawa T. Steffen M.A. Church G.M. Cepko C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 301-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In contrast, nonhomeodomain transcription factors bind to promoters in fewer genes with greater sequence specificity (58Bulger M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Such transcription factors, like NRL, may influence the specificity of gene transcription while homeodomain proteins, such as CRX, may facilitate structural control of larger chromatin regions and help facilitate the effects of other transcription factors upon the enhanceosome (56Carr A. Biggin M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interaction of NRL with CRX in the two test systems (yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down) did not require the presence of RPPR sequence elements. The addition of micrococcal nuclease to the GST pull-down reactions (in order to remove DNA template) did not significantly alter the interaction of CRX with NRL. This is different from the interaction of AP1 and NFAT, which occurs only when their cognate DNA binding region is present to form a quarternary complex (47Chen L. Glover J.N.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 59Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Our studies raise the possibility that the two activator proteins (NRL and CRX) form a stable complex by directly interacting with each other and probably with other proteins prior to their binding to their cognate cis-sequence elements in RPPR. CRX is shown to bind to Ret-4, BAT-1, and Ret1 elements in RPPR in vitro (31Chen S. Wang Q. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a stable NRL-CRX complex would influence the recognition of Ret-4 and BAT-1 flanking the NRE and provide binding sequence specificity during the organization of the rhodopsin enhanceosome. In addition, this interaction may result in cooperative and efficient DNA binding and explain their synergistic transactivation of the rhodopsin promoter. Mobility shift and DNase I experiments using the NRL and CRX proteins may help to confirm if the distribution of CRX on RPPR is influenced by NRL. The ability of NRL and CRX to physically interact with each other correlates well with their functional synergistic interaction at the rhodopsin promoter and illustrates one possible mechanism of context-dependent transcriptional regulation (60Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This interaction also points to cross-talk among different signal transduction pathways that activate or modulate rhodopsin expression in developing and mature photoreceptors. Further investigations are in progress to identify and characterize other activator proteins that are also involved in the formation of the rhodopsin enhanceosome. Elucidation of extracellular factors that influence the expression and activity of NRL, CRX, and these other factors should provide important new insights into the regulation of rhodopsin expression.

Possible functional interactions between these proteins have been described (reviewed in Ref. 1Yap A.S. Mullin J.M. Stevenson B.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Critical extracellular interactions in TJs have been attributed to two transmembrane proteins, claudin(s) and occludin (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that claudins recruit occludin to TJ sites (3Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), several recent studies have suggested instead that occludin dynamically regulates claudin-based TJ strands. Transfection of occludin mutants lacking either the intracellular (4Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. Gonzalez S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) or extracellular (5Bamforth S.D. Kniesel U. Wolberg H. Engelhardt B. Risau W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) domains induces disruption of epithelial barrier properties. In addition, TJ barrier function is also influenced by incubation with peptides containing the two extracellular loop amino acid sequences (6Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lacaz-Vieira F. Jaeger M.M. Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As yet, analogous studies have not been described for claudin(s). Finally, disruption of TJ function mediated by the constitutive activation of Raf-1 is associated with down-regulation of occludin and claudin-1 expression, an effect that can be reversed by the reintroduction of occludin expression that in turn restores claudin-1 protein levels (9Li D. Mrsny R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Human occludin is approximately 65 kDa with what appears to be a 65-amino acid cytosolic N terminus, two extracellular loops of 46 and 48 amino acids separated by a 10-amino acid cytosolic loop, and a C-terminal tail of approximately 255 amino acids (10Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Both the N- and C-terminal domains have a large number of serine and threonine residues, and the functionally active form of the protein localizing to the TJ appears to be hyperphosphorylated at serine and threonine residues (11Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the dynamic regulation of occludin (13Chen Y.-h. Lu Q. Schneeberger E.E. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The long intracellular C-terminal tail of occludin has been proposed to have interactions with TJ-associated proteins such as the zonula occluden proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (14Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These proteins, in turn, all contain conserved domains consisting of guanylate kinase, Src homology SH3 structures, PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1-like binding sites, and proline-rich sequences. The SH3, PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1-like, and proline-rich regions appear to be capable of interacting with other intracellular proteins, such as occludin, that also localize to epithelial TJs. Within the putative 150-amino acid ZO-1 binding domain of occludin is a 27-amino acid stretch with hydrophobic residues clustered in a pattern consistent with a coiled-coil structure (10Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).We have used a novel bait peptide method to determine the potential interaction of proteins known to localize to the TJ, associate with occludin, or regulate TJ function. Our results demonstrate for the first time that occludin can specifically interacts with itself through its coiled-coil domain and suggest that the established interaction between ZO-1 and occludin may occur through this same domain. Additionally, the coiled-coil domain of occludin appears to act as a site for specific interactions of several potential regulatory proteins, suggesting a pivotal role for occludin in the coordinated associations of TJ components in epithelial cells. Further, a potential link between a specific domain of occludin and a gap junction element (connexin 26) may have been identified.DISCUSSIONCoiled-coil domains have been identified as a potential site for protein-protein contacts, and the interactions between proteins at these contact sites can be emulated using peptides (30Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Our approach using biotinylation to track and isolate chemical conjugates of coiled-coil bait peptides following activation of a photoactive group is similar to previous studies that have employed synthetic peptides to mimic and characterize specific protein-protein or protein-peptide interactions. Synthetic peptides corresponding to C-terminal domains of Gsα have been used in a permeabilized cell system to study receptor-G protein-effector coupling (31Rasenick M.M. Lazarevic M. Watanabe M. Hamm H.E. Methods. 1993; 5: 252-257Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A photolabile, biotin-conjugated form of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone has been used to identify and partially purify ligand-receptor complexes (32Ahmed A.R. Olivier G.W. Adams G. Erskine M.E. Kinsman R.G. Branch S.K. Moss S.H. Notarianni L.J. Pouton C.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A biotinylated form of the neuropeptide somatostatin has been used for receptor purification and localization following photoaffinity cross-linking (33Schonbrunn A. Lee A.B. Brown P.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). T cell receptor interactions have been studied using a biotinylated, photoactive peptide (34Romero P. Casanova J.L. Cerottini J.C. Maryanski J.L. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Like these previous studies, our current results have demonstrated that this approach can be used to identify potential protein-peptide interactions. We have found that this bait peptide fishing approach can be used in place of technically challenging immunoprecipitation methods to identify potential binding partners of an integral membrane protein.We have investigated potential contacts of the coiled-coil domain of an integral membrane protein that has been identified as a component of the TJ complex. Several similar synthetic peptides have previously been used to model the coiled-coil structures present in a number of biological systems (35O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In our studies, a 27-amino acid-long synthetic peptide that emulates the coiled-coil region of human occludin was synthesized and chemically modified to contain an N-terminal biotin. An amino acid residue near the middle of either the hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface of the coiled-coil structure was replaced with a residue that could be photo-activated to form a covalent attachment site. Bait peptides were incubated with membranes isolated from polarized, high resistance T84 cell monolayers. After photoactivation samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed for biotinylated structures.These blots showed that only a small number of biotinylated bands were specifically labeled. Western blotting demonstrated that primary biotin-positive bands were recognized by antibodies to occludin, ZO-1, c-Yes, the regulatory (p85) subunit of PI 3-kinase, PKC-ζ, and connexin 26. However, a number of proteins present in our T84 lysates that have been demonstrated to localize at or modulate the function of TJs failed to be selectively labeled by the coiled-coil bait peptides. Proteins not positive for biotin labeling using these bait peptides included claudin-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, human junctional adhesion molecule, connexin 32, actin, Lyn, c-Src, Rho, phospholipase Cγ, protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1, protein-tyrosine phosphatase β1, and caveolin-1 (data not shown). Additionally, protein labeling was selective for CCD-In (hydrophobic surface photoactive bait) and CCD-Out (hydrophilic surface photoactive bait) peptides. For example, occludin, ZO-1 and PI 3-kinase p85 were lableled by both CCD-In and CCD-Out peptides. PKC-ζ and c-Yes were labeled only by the CCD-In peptide, and connexin 26 was labeled only by the CCD-Out peptide. Thus, the labeling approach that we have described appears to be selective by several criteria for proteins that might potentially interact with the coiled-coil domain of occludin.Our results have provided information that should increase our understanding of how occludin can function as a TJ component. Previous studies evaluating the impact of C-terminal truncation on occludin function, which also removed the coiled-coil domain, suggested that this portion of the protein may be involved in oligomeric assemblies (36Chen Y.-h. Merzdorf C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For the first time the coiled-coil domain of this protein has now been demonstrated to have selective association with itself and several proteins that may play a structural and/or functional role in the TJ. ZO-1 interactions with occludin have previously been shown to occur within a region of occludin from Asn373 to Thr522 (21Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Our data have now identified one potential site for this interaction to involve the coiled-coil domain (Leu440–Glu469) nested within this large region. Other members of the MAGUK family of proteins, ZO-2 (37Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and ZO-3 (38Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), did not appear to specifically interact with the coiled-coil domain bait peptides used in these studies. Together, these interactions between occludin with itself and with ZO-1 improve our understanding of how these proteins can establish the supramolecular structures that have been suggested for the TJ (discussed in Ref. 14Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest, for the first time, that the coiled-coil domain of occludin is a coordinating site for these oligomeric structures and that occludin and ZO-1, but not ZO-2 or ZO-3, participate in these contacts. ZO-1 has been suggested to interact with occludin, ZO-2, and F-actin (39Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), and both ZO-2 and ZO-3 interact with ZO-1/occludin complexes (38Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 40Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our data now stipulate that these interactions can occur through an organizing structure on the occludin protein, its 27-amino acid coiled-coil domain, where protein-protein contacts occur through both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of this domain.We also demonstrated that several proteins associated with kinase function can also selectively interact with the coiled-coil domain of occludin. This is important information because phosphorylation events control the development and dynamics of functional TJ complexes (41Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Occludin localized to TJs is hyperphosphorylated at serine/threonine residues (11Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar). ZO-1 also appears to be phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues (42Stevenson B.R. Siliciano M.S. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Disruption of epithelial barrier properties has been correlated with either a decrease in serine/threonine phosphorylation or an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of these TJ components (43Singer K.L. Stevenson B.R. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Staddon J.M. Herrenknecht K. Smales C. Rubin L.L. J.

We have now demonstrated for the first time the specific interaction of three proteins involved in protein phosphorylation, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Yes, PKC-ζ, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, with a singular domain of occludin. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase associates with and serves as a substrate for activated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (24Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase appears to be involved in the polymerization of actin in human intestinal epithelial cells (46Massoumi R. Sjolander A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), disrupts epithelial polarization (26Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), and acts as a negative regulator of cell differentiation through activation of PKC and ras pathways (47Ptasznik A. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Cirulli V. Lopez A. Hayek A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PKC-ζ has been previously localized to the region of the TJ (48Stuart R.O. Nigam S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 49Dodane V. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and may be involved in the phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase (50Gomez J. Martinez C. Garcia A. Rebollo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase and PKC-ζ have been suggested to regulate actin function (51Gomez J. Garcia A. Borlado L. Bonay P. Mertinez C. Silva A. Fresno M. Carrera A.C. Eicher-Streiber C. Rebollo A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1516-1522PubMed Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase itself affects actin polymerization in epithelial cells (46Massoumi R. Sjolander A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Our findings concerning the specific associations of several kinases to the bait peptides used in this study provide the first data to suggest a highly selective interaction between occludin and regulatory proteins capable of modulating the function of the TJ. Further, our studies identify a singular domain of occludin to be involved in these interactions and identifies a potential dynamic relationship between these specific kinase-related proteins and TJ function. A further point can be made about how these interactions can occur. Although the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase can interact with both interfacial surfaces of the coiled-coil domain of occludin, PKC-ζ and c-Yes interact only with the hydrophobic surface.Finally, connexin 26 was identified to interact in a specific manner at the hydrophilic interface of the intracellular coiled-coil domain of occludin. Connexin 26 is a component of gap junction structures. The possibility of an occludin-connexin 26 interaction provides an interesting explanation for several previously reported observations that suggest a proximity of TJ and gap junction structures (3Furuse M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has shown connexin 32 to directly interact with occludin (52Kojima T. Sawada N. Chiba H. Kokai Y. Yamamoto M. Urban M. Lee G.H. Hertzberg E.L. Mochizuki Y. Spray D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our data localized the specific interaction of connexin 26 to a 27-amino acid domain of occludin. At present, it is unclear how connexin 32 might interact with occludin because we could not demonstrate an interaction between this protein and the coiled-coil occludin bait peptides, despite its expression in T84 cell monolayers.Of the proteins identified in this study to specifically interact with our bait peptides, only occludin, the p85 regulatory component of PI 3-kinase, and connexin 26 appear to have potential coiled-coil domains (all protein sequences were analyzed using Lupas' algorithm of the PSORT program). Because the current paradigm of coiled-coil contact interaction describes the association of similar α-helical domains, it is unclear how these proteins that lack this structural attribute might interact with the coiled-coil domain of occludin. In vitro studies with the bait peptides have shown them to form oligomers under the solution conditions used in our studies. 2R. J. Mrsny, J. Chen, T. W. Liang, J. Tom, C. Quan, and A. Nusrat, manuscript in preparation. The association states of occludin and interactions with other proteins may also depend upon the phosphorylation state of occludin or these other proteins involved because several kinases have now been identified to directly interact with occludin at this site. It is also important to note that our studies identifying proteins with potential interactions with the coiled-coil domain of occludin do not imply that these same proteins cannot have other specific interaction sites on the occludin molecule.In summary, the data obtained to date using our bait peptide fishing approach support the concept that a component of the TJ, occludin, may act to coordinate elements of the actin cytoskeletal and signaling pathways to this structure in polarized epithelia through its coiled-coil domain. Such a function may be similar to that previously observed for integrins (53Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) and caveolin (54Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), which can act as membrane-anchored scaffolding proteins. Occludin may also be acting similarly or in concert with another TJ protein known as cingulin. This protein has recently been shown to contain putative coiled-coil domains, self-associate, and interact specifically with ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (55Cordenonsi M. D'Atri F. Hammar E. Parry D.A.D. Kendrick-Jones J. Shore D. Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Over the last decade a number of proteins have been identified that localize to the tight junction (TJ)1 structures of epithelial cells. Possible functional interactions between these proteins have been described (reviewed in Ref. 1Yap A.S. Mullin J.M. Stevenson B.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Critical extracellular interactions in TJs have been attributed to two transmembrane proteins, claudin(s) and occludin (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that claudins recruit occludin to TJ sites (3Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), several recent studies have suggested instead that occludin dynamically regulates claudin-based TJ strands. Transfection of occludin mutants lacking either the intracellular (4Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. Gonzalez S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) or extracellular (5Bamforth S.D. Kniesel U. Wolberg H. Engelhardt B. Risau W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) domains induces disruption of epithelial barrier properties. In addition, TJ barrier function is also influenced by incubation with peptides containing the two extracellular loop amino acid sequences (6Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lacaz-Vieira F. Jaeger M.M. Farshori P. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As yet, analogous studies have not been described for claudin(s). Finally, disruption of TJ function mediated by the constitutive activation of Raf-1 is associated with down-regulation of occludin and claudin-1 expression, an effect that can be reversed by the reintroduction of occludin expression that in turn restores claudin-1 protein levels (9Li D. Mrsny R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Human occludin is approximately 65 kDa with what appears to be a 65-amino acid cytosolic N terminus, two extracellular loops of 46 and 48 amino acids separated by a 10-amino acid cytosolic loop, and a C-terminal tail of approximately 255 amino acids (10Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Both the N- and C-terminal domains have a large number of serine and threonine residues, and the functionally active form of the protein localizing to the TJ appears to be hyperphosphorylated at serine and threonine residues (11Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Wong V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1859-C1867Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the dynamic regulation of occludin (13Chen Y.-h. Lu Q. Schneeberger E.E. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The long intracellular C-terminal tail of occludin has been proposed to have interactions with TJ-associated proteins such as the zonula occluden proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (14Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These proteins, in turn, all contain conserved domains consisting of guanylate kinase, Src homology SH3 structures, PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1-like binding sites, and proline-rich sequences. The SH3, PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1-like, and proline-rich regions appear to be capable of interacting with other intracellular proteins, such as occludin, that also localize to epithelial TJs. Within the putative 150-amino acid ZO-1 binding domain of occludin is a 27-amino acid stretch with hydrophobic residues clustered in a pattern consistent with a coiled-coil structure (10Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have used a novel bait peptide method to determine the potential interaction of proteins known to localize to the TJ, associate with occludin, or regulate TJ function. Our results demonstrate for the first time that occludin can specifically interacts with itself through its coiled-coil domain and suggest that the established interaction between ZO-1 and occludin may occur through this same domain. Additionally, the coiled-coil domain of occludin appears to act as a site for specific interactions of several potential regulatory proteins, suggesting a pivotal role for occludin in the coordinated associations of TJ components in epithelial cells. Further, a potential link between a specific domain of occludin and a gap junction element (connexin 26) may have been identified. DISCUSSIONCoiled-coil domains have been identified as a potential site for protein-protein contacts, and the interactions between proteins at these contact sites can be emulated using peptides (30Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Our approach using biotinylation to track and isolate chemical conjugates of coiled-coil bait peptides following activation of a photoactive group is similar to previous studies that have employed synthetic peptides to mimic and characterize specific protein-protein or protein-peptide interactions. Synthetic peptides corresponding to C-terminal domains of Gsα have been used in a permeabilized cell system to study receptor-G protein-effector coupling (31Rasenick M.M. Lazarevic M. Watanabe M. Hamm H.E. Methods. 1993; 5: 252-257Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A photolabile, biotin-conjugated form of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone has been used to identify and partially purify ligand-receptor complexes (32Ahmed A.R. Olivier G.W. Adams G."
https://openalex.org/W2087342144,"Genomic DNA is prone to oxidation by reactive oxygen species. A major product of DNA oxidation is the miscoding base 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). The mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG in mammalian cells are prevented by a DNA repair system consisting of 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (Ogg1), adenine-DNA glycosylase, and 8-oxo-dGTPase. We have cloned, overexpressed, and characterized mOgg1, the product of the murine <i>ogg1</i> gene. mOgg1 is a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase belonging to the endonuclease III family of DNA repair enzymes. The AP lyase activity of mOgg1 is significantly lower than its glycosylase activity. mOgg1 releases 8-oxoG from DNA when paired with C, T, or G, but efficient DNA strand nicking is observed only with 8-oxoG:C. Binding of mOgg1 to oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG:C is strong (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> = 51.5 nm), unlike other mispairs. The average residence time for mOgg1 bound to substrate containing 8-oxoG:C is 18.3 min; the time course for accumulation of the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-sensitive intermediate suggests a two-step reaction mechanism. Various analogs of 8-oxoG were tested as substrates for mOgg1. An electron-withdrawing or hydrogen bond acceptor moiety at C8 is required for efficient binding of mOgg1. A substituent at C6 and a keto group at C8 are required for cleavage. The proposed mechanism of 8-oxoG excision involves protonation of O<sup>8</sup> or the deoxyribose oxygen moiety."

This binding is a crucial step in the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of various key proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. We report that treatment of COS-7 cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A induces association of 14-3-3 with a 55-kDa protein, identified as the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Association of vimentin with 14-3-3 depends on vimentin phosphorylation and requires the phosphopeptide-binding domain of 14-3-3. The region necessary for binding to 14-3-3 is confined to the vimentin amino-terminal head domain (amino acids 1–96). Monomeric forms of 14-3-3 do not bind vimentin in vivo or in vitro, indicating that a stable complex requires the binding of a 14-3-3 dimer to two sites on a single vimentin polypeptide. The calyculin A-induced association of vimentin with 14-3-3 in vivo results in the displacement of most other 14-3-3 partners, including the protooncogene Raf, which nevertheless remain capable of binding 14-3-3 in vitro.Concomitant with 14-3-3 displacement, calyculin A treatment blocks Raf activation by EGF; however, this inhibition is completely overcome by 14-3-3 overexpression in vivo or by the addition of prokaryotic recombinant 14-3-3 in vitro. Thus, phosphovimentin, by sequestering 14-3-3 and limiting its availability to other target proteins can affect intracellular signaling processes that require 14-3-3. 14-3-3 proteins bind their targets through a specific serine/threonine-phosphorylated motif present on the target protein.

The ability of 14-3-3 to bind target proteins has been shown in many instances to depend on the phosphorylation of specific sites on the target protein (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and studies with synthetic phosphopeptides have defined two preferred 14-3-3 binding motifs as RSXpSXP or RXXXpSXP (where pS stands for phosphoserine) (12Muslin A.J.

The existence of additional variations in the sequence of 14-3-3 binding sites is probable inasmuch as 14-3-3 partners such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. Willebrand M.V. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) do not contain either of these motifs. Association with 14-3-3 may positively or negatively regulate the function of the partner; thus, the binding of 14-3-3 results in activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) but inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. Willebrand M.V. Sung A.

Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar); a continuous association with 14-3-3 is necessary for physiologic regulation of Raf kinase activity (12Muslin A.J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms by which 14-3-3 proteins modify the function of the target protein may vary for each partner; for example, in the case of yeast Cdc25 (18Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and FKHRL1 (7Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

The ability of the proapoptotic protein BAD to bind and sequester the antiapoptotic factors BCL2 and BCLxL is inhibited by the phosphorylation of BAD and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 (6Zha J. Harda H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins have multiple functions in the regulation of c-Raf-1; the binding of 14-3-3 to Raf stabilizes the inactive state in unstimulated cells but is also required to maintain the active conformation of Raf generated after growth factor stimulation (17Tzivion G. Luo Z.-J. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).The intermediate filament (IF)1 network provides a rigid framework that supports cell architecture during interphase (19Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar,20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). IF proteins undergo disassembly and major reorganization during cell cycle progression (21Klymkowsky M.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as IF proteins constitute at least 1% of total cell protein, IF disassembly creates a large pool of soluble IF proteins. The assembly/disassembly of IFs is regulated by dephosphorylation/phosphorylation of the filaments on their exposed N- and/or C-terminal domains (22Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A variety of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases likely to phosphorylate IFs in vivo have been proposed, including protein kinase Cs, protein kinase A, CaMKII, and Cdc2 kinase. In BHK-21 cells, the IF proteins vimentin and desmin undergo a major increase in phosphorylation (to a stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein) concomitant with filament disassembly that occurs as the cells move from G2 to M (23Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Chou Y.-H. Ngai K.-L. Goldman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7325-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of these cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A results in a rapid disassembly of IFs, in parallel with their hyperphosphorylation, both at sites already partially phosphorylated in interphase and at mitosis-specific sites (25Eriksson J.E. Brautigan D.L. Vallee R. Olmsted J. Fujiki H. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11093-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The epithelial IF protein keratin K18 associates with 14-3-3 proteins in a cell cycle- and phosphorylation-dependent manner, reaching a peak during late S-G2/M phase (8Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).We now report that calyculin A treatment of COS cells induces the binding of vimentin to 14-3-3-, accompanied by the displacement of virtually all other 14-3-3 partners, including Raf-1. 14-3-3-Raf complex disassembly results in a complete inhibition of Raf kinase activity, which is, however, completely overcome by 14-3-3 overexpression in vivo or by the addition of recombinant 14-3-3 to the cell extract in vitro. These results suggest that IF phosphorylation may serve to regulate 14-3-3 availability to key proteins involved in intracellular signaling and consequently regulate their function.DISCUSSION14-3-3 proteins have been found to specifically associate with and participate in the regulation of many proteins including several key proteins involved in cellular signaling and cell cycle control. The present work identifies vimentin as an additional, regulated, 14-3-3 interactor. Vimentin undergoes extensive phosphorylation during cell cycle progression, and the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A by calyculin A causes a rapid increase in vimentin phosphorylation comparable in magnitude with that occurring during mitosis, although with a somewhat different site specificity (25Eriksson J.E. Brautigan D.L. Vallee R. Olmsted J. Fujiki H. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11093-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The ability of calyculin A treatment to promote sufficient phosphorylation of endogenous vimentin to enable it to bind a very large fraction of cellular 14-3-3 raises two intriguing possibilities. First, it suggests that 14-3-3 may contribute to the regulation of vimentin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and/or to the ability of vimentin to participate in filament formation. Second, the high stoichiometry of cellular vimentin phosphorylation achieved during specific phases of the cell cycle may bind sufficient cellular 14-3-3 to limit its availability, thereby modulating the function of other 14-3-3-dependent proteins.Previous work has shown that the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphoproteins, such as Raf, can diminish their susceptibility to protein (Ser/Thr) phosphatase action (28Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of 14-3-3 with phosphovimentin may alter vimentin dephosphorylation. As regards the impact of 14-3-3 on intermediate filament assembly, Liao et al. (8Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of 14-3-3 to keratin K18 could interfere with its assembly into filaments in vitro. 14-3-3 binding to K18 depends on keratin Ser33phosphorylation; however, this phosphorylation is not sufficient by itself for conferring association (14Ku N.O.

Since the sequence around keratin Ser33 does not represent a strong 14-3-3 motif, it seems that another 14-3-3 binding site(s) on K18 may collaborate with the Ser33 site to support 14-3-3 binding. This possibility is strengthened by our finding that vimentin, which, like K18, does not contain an optimal high affinity 14-3-3 biding site, can form a stable association only with dimeric 14-3-3 and not with various 14-3-3 monomers. The importance of 14-3-3 dimerization in 14-3-3 function has not gained much attention; the functional role usually proposed for the 14-3-3 dimer is to allow the bridging of two different proteins (29Luo Z.-J. Tzivion G. Belshow P.J. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Marshal C.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For proteins that lack high affinity 14-3-3 binding sites, such as vimentin, keratin K18, and Wee1 (3Honda R. Ohba Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the coligation of two lower affinity sites by the 14-3-3 dimer may be necessary to enable stable target protein recognition and binding. The role of 14-3-3 dimerization extends, however, beyond the ability to bridge two different proteins and enable binding to single proteins with only low affinity sites. We recently showed that a 14-3-3 dimer is necessary to support Raf activity (17Tzivion G. Luo Z.-J. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) despite the fact that Raf contains two high affinity binding sites for 14-3-3, each of which is independently sufficient to stably bind 14-3-3 (17Tzivion G. Luo Z.-J. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 32Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). The present report extends those findings by demonstrating that not only is the dimerization-deficient 14-3-3 unable to support the reactivation of Raf inactivated by 14-3-3 displacement in vitro, it is also unable to support an active configuration of Raf achieved in vivo in calyculin A-treated cells. Along similar lines, we recently observed that the ability of 14-3-3 to modulate the DNA binding of the Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor DAF-16 requires a dimeric 14-3-3 and two independent 14-3-3 binding sites on the DAF-16 polypeptide. 2C. M. Cahill, G. Tzivion, N. Nasrin, S. Ogg, J. Dore, G. Ruvkun, and M. Alexander-Bridges, submitted for publication.The finding that vimentin phosphorylation and its concomitant binding to 14-3-3 proteins results in disassembly of Raf-14-3-3 complexes and other 14-3-3-protein complexes suggests that the association of phosphovimentin with 14-3-3 may have significance in the regulation of 14-3-3 availability besides a role in vimentin dephosphorylation/disaggregation. This intriguing possibility implies that phosphorylation of vimentin and perhaps other IF polypeptides (e.g. keratin K18) may affect various intracellular signaling and cell cycle control pathways by modifying 14-3-3 availability, as observed with Raf in this paper. Further evaluation of the cellular distribution of the different 14-3-3 isoforms under varying physiologic conditions and during different stages of the cell cycle and the effect of IF phosphorylation on this distribution is needed to ascertain whether variation in the availability of 14-3-3 by IFs serves as a regulatory factor in cellular signaling and cell cycle control. The 14-3-3 protein family consists of seven highly conserved proteins of 28–31 kDa that naturally assemble as homodimers or heterodimers and bind to a wide array of intracellular proteins (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Among the proteins known to associate with 14-3-3 in vivoare proteins that function in cell cycle control (e.g.Cdc25 (2Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)). Genetic alterations in 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to impair a variety of biologic functions, such as cell cycle timing (9Zeng Y. Forbes K.C. Wu Z. Moreno S. Piwnica-Worms H. Enoch T. Nature. 1998; 395: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in yeast (10Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.

The ability of 14-3-3 to bind target proteins has been shown in many instances to depend on the phosphorylation of specific sites on the target protein (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and studies with synthetic phosphopeptides have defined two preferred 14-3-3 binding motifs as RSXpSXP or RXXXpSXP (where pS stands for phosphoserine) (12Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 13Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The existence of additional variations in the sequence of 14-3-3 binding sites is probable inasmuch as 14-3-3 partners such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. Willebrand M.V. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), tyrosine hydroxylase (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and keratins (14Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) do not contain either of these motifs. Association with 14-3-3 may positively or negatively regulate the function of the partner; thus, the binding of 14-3-3 results in activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) but inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. Willebrand M.V. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Cdc25 (15Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar); a continuous association with 14-3-3 is necessary for physiologic regulation of Raf kinase activity (12Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 16Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W.

Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms by which 14-3-3 proteins modify the function of the target protein may vary for each partner; for example, in the case of yeast Cdc25 (18Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and FKHRL1 (7Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar) the association with 14-3-3 (Rad24 in yeast) results in their exclusion from the nucleus. The ability of the proapoptotic protein BAD to bind and sequester the antiapoptotic factors BCL2 and BCLxL is inhibited by the phosphorylation of BAD and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 (6Zha J. Harda H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins have multiple functions in the regulation of c-Raf-1; the binding of 14-3-3 to Raf stabilizes the inactive state in unstimulated cells but is also required to maintain the active conformation of Raf generated after growth factor stimulation (17Tzivion G. Luo Z.-J. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The intermediate filament (IF)1 network provides a rigid framework that supports cell architecture during interphase (19Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar,20Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). IF proteins undergo disassembly and major reorganization during cell cycle progression (21Klymkowsky M.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as IF proteins constitute at least 1% of total cell protein, IF disassembly creates a large pool of soluble IF proteins. The assembly/disassembly of IFs is regulated by dephosphorylation/phosphorylation of the filaments on their exposed N- and/or C-terminal domains (22Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A variety of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases likely to phosphorylate IFs in vivo have been proposed, including protein kinase Cs, protein kinase A, CaMKII, and Cdc2 kinase. In BHK-21 cells, the IF proteins vimentin and desmin undergo a major increase in phosphorylation (to a stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein) concomitant with filament disassembly that occurs as the cells move from G2 to M (23Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Chou Y.-H. Ngai K.-L. Goldman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7325-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of these cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A results in a rapid disassembly of IFs, in parallel with their hyperphosphorylation, both at sites already partially phosphorylated in interphase and at mitosis-specific sites (25Eriksson J.E. Brautigan D.L. Vallee R. Olmsted J. Fujiki H. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11093-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The epithelial IF protein keratin K18 associates with 14-3-3 proteins in a cell cycle- and phosphorylation-dependent manner, reaching a peak during late S-G2/M phase (8Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We now report that calyculin A treatment of COS cells induces the binding of vimentin to 14-3-3-, accompanied by the displacement of virtually all other 14-3-3 partners, including Raf-1. 14-3-3-Raf complex disassembly results in a complete inhibition of Raf kinase activity, which is, however, completely overcome by 14-3-3 overexpression in vivo or by the addition of recombinant 14-3-3 to the cell extract in vitro. These results suggest that IF phosphorylation may serve to regulate 14-3-3 availability to key proteins involved in intracellular signaling and consequently regulate their function. DISCUSSION14-3-3 proteins have been found to specifically associate with and participate in the regulation of many proteins including several key proteins involved in cellular signaling and cell cycle control. The present work identifies vimentin as an additional, regulated, 14-3-3 interactor. Vimentin undergoes extensive phosphorylation during cell cycle progression, and the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A by calyculin A causes a rapid increase in vimentin phosphorylation comparable in magnitude with that occurring during mitosis, although with a somewhat different site specificity (25Eriksson J.E. Brautigan D.L. Vallee R. Olmsted J. Fujiki H. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11093-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The ability of calyculin A treatment to promote sufficient phosphorylation of endogenous vimentin to enable it to bind a very large fraction of cellular 14-3-3 raises two intriguing possibilities. First, it suggests that 14-3-3 may contribute to the regulation of vimentin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and/or to the ability of vimentin to participate in filament formation. Second, the high stoichiometry of cellular vimentin phosphorylation achieved during specific phases of the cell cycle may bind sufficient cellular 14-3-3 to limit its availability, thereby modulating the function of other 14-3-3-dependent proteins.Previous work has shown that the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphoproteins, such as Raf, can diminish their susceptibility to protein (Ser/Thr) phosphatase action (28Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of 14-3-3 with phosphovimentin may alter vimentin dephosphorylation. As regards the impact of 14-3-3 on intermediate filament assembly, Liao et al. (8Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of 14-3-3 to keratin K18 could interfere with its assembly into filaments in vitro. 14-3-3 binding to K18 depends on keratin Ser33phosphorylation; however, this phosphorylation is not sufficient by itself for conferring association (14Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Since the sequence around keratin Ser33 does not represent a strong 14-3-3 motif, it seems that another 14-3-3 binding site(s) on K18 may collaborate with the Ser33 site to support 14-3-3 binding. This possibility is strengthened by our finding that vimentin, which, like K18, does not contain an optimal high affinity 14-3-3 biding site, can form a stable association only with dimeric 14-3-3 and not with various 14-3-3 monomers. The importance of 14-3-3 dimerization in 14-3-3 function has not gained much attention; the functional role usually proposed for the 14-3-3 dimer is to allow the bridging of two different proteins (29Luo Z.-J.

For the first time, we demonstrate the functional display of a peptide library fused to the carboxyl terminus of the M13 major coat protein. We used this library to analyze carboxyl-terminal peptide recognition by two PDZ domains. For each PDZ domain, the library provided specific ligands with sub-micromolar binding affinities. Synthetic peptides and homology modeling were used to dissect and rationalize the binding interactions.

In general, PDZ domain-containing proteins appear to assemble various functional entities, including ion channels and other transmembrane receptors, at specialized subcellular sites such as epithelial cell tight junctions, neuromuscular junctions, and post-synaptic densities of neurons. These clustering and localization effects have important biological implications. For example, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase, PSD-95, segregates the N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the Shaker potassium channel to the post-synaptic density of neurons (4.Tejedor F. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another illustration, the aggregation of various components of the fruit fly visual system by the multi-PDZ protein INAD greatly enhances the efficiency of this signaling cascade (5.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Another compelling case is the use of several PDZ domain-containing proteins in the appropriate basolateral localization of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase ofCaenorhabditis elegans (6.Kaech S. Whitfield C. Kim S. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This kinase is required for vulval development, and mutations in these PDZ domain-containing proteins result in the subcellular mislocalization of the LET-23 protein and a lack of vulval differentiation. Together with many other examples, these studies indicate that PDZ domains are important intracellular assembly and localization cofactors in diverse signaling pathways. PDZ domains recognize three different types of ligands, with two of these interactions showing specificity for peptides at the extreme carboxyl termini of proteins (7.Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8.Harrison S. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9.Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Type I and type II PDZ domains recognize carboxyl-terminal peptides with the consensus sequence Thr/Ser-X-Phe/Val/Ala-COOH or Phe/Tyr-X-Phe/Val/Ala-COOH, respectively. Interestingly, a third type of PDZ domain-ligand interaction involves the recognition of an internal peptide sequence. Structural analyses of these three types of PDZ interactions have illuminated the mechanisms of ligand recognition. For example, the crystal structure of a type I PDZ domain from PSD-95 showed that a 4-residue carboxyl-terminal peptide interacts with the protein via an antiparallel main chain association with a β strand, and the terminal carboxylate is inserted into a conserved “carboxylate binding loop” (10.Doyle D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 11.Morais-Cabral J. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S. Chisti A. Liddington R. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a PDZ domain from human CASK revealed the nature of interactions mediated by type II motifs (12.Daniels D. Cohen A. Anderson J. Brunger A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In both domain types, the peptide formed a new antiparallel β strand in the PDZ domain structure, and the overall conformations of the two interactions were similar. However, there were significant differences in side chain contacts that could account for the different ligand specificities of the two domain types. Finally, the interaction between a PDZ domain of syntrophin and a PDZ domain of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase has been examined by x-ray and NMR analyses (13.Hiller B. Christopherson K. Prehoda K. Bredt D. Lim W. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 14.Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandal P. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this case, an extended loop of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase PDZ domain forms a β finger that binds to a β strand of the syntrophin PDZ domain, in a manner that mimics the carboxyl-terminal ligands of types I and II domains. Together, these data suggest that these three types of PDZ domains use similar but highly specialized regions to recognize diverse carboxyl-terminal and internal peptide ligands. Identification of peptide ligands for novel PDZ domains would advance our understanding of PDZ domain structure and function, and it would also suggest potential functions for these motifs and the proteins that contain them. Initial forays into PDZ domain ligand specificities were performed using combinatorial libraries consisting of either free peptides (15.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chisti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) or peptides fused to the carboxyl terminus of theEscherichia coli Lac repressor (16.Strickler N. Christopherson K. Yi B. Schatz P. Raab R. Dawes G. Bassett D. Bredt D. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although phage display is the most commonly used method for displaying combinatorial peptide libraries, all phage-displayed peptide libraries reported to date have been displayed as fusions to the amino terminus of either the major coat protein (protein-8, P8) or the gene-3 minor coat protein, primarily because it is believed that neither coat protein can support carboxyl-terminal fusions (16.Strickler N. Christopherson K. Yi B. Schatz P. Raab R. Dawes G. Bassett D. Bredt D. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17.Palzkill T. Huang W. Weinstock G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus phage display has not been used for the display of peptides with free carboxyl termini, and the technology has not been amenable to the analysis of PDZ domain carboxyl-terminal binding specificities (16.Strickler N. Christopherson K. Yi B. Schatz P. Raab R. Dawes G. Bassett D. Bredt D. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18.Gee S. Sekely S. Lombardo C. Kurakin A.

Here we demonstrate that P8 can indeed support carboxyl-terminal fusions, and we describe a novel method for the analysis of PDZ domain binding specificities that utilizes this display format. We show that two different PDZ domains from a membrane-associated guanylate kinase select consensus sequences from highly diverse peptide libraries fused to the carboxyl terminus of P8. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the selected sequences bound their cognate PDZ domains with high affinity and specificity, and synthetic peptides were used to determine the binding contributions of individual ligand side chains. We also used molecular modeling to identify putative affinity and specificity determinants on one of these PDZ domains, and we propose possible mechanisms for binding of the selected peptide ligands. Together, these data establish carboxyl-terminal phage display as a powerful new method for mapping PDZ domain ligand specificity.

Maxisorp immunoplates were from NUNC (Roskilde, Denmark). E. coli XL1-Blue and M13-VCS were from Stratagene. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Tween 20 were from Sigma. Streptavidin was from Pierce.

Horseradish peroxidase/rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugate was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethyl-benzidine/H2O2 (TMB) peroxidase substrate was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc. Peptides were synthesized using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protocols, cleaved off the resin with 2.5% triisopropylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid, and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The mass of each peptide was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. With the full-length MAGI 3 gene as the template, the polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify DNA fragments encoding either PDZ2 (MAGI 3 residues 571–692; forward primer, GATCGATCGTCGACCACACTTTGACTGGTG, and reverse primer, GATCGATCGA GCGGCCGC CTATTTCATTTTGGCAG; SalI site is in bold and NotI site is in bold italics) or PDZ3 (MAGI 3 residues 741–840; forward primer, GGGATCCGTGAAGATAAACCACCAAACAC, and reverse primer, G CTCGAG TTTTTCTCCATAGAAGATCT; BamHI site is in bold and XhoI site is in bold italics). Each amplified fragment was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into a similarly digested pGEX-4T-3 plasmid, resulting in plasmids encoding either GST-PDZ2 or GST-PDZ3 fusion proteins. E. coli cultures harboring the appropriate expression plasmids were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 = 1.0) in 1.0 liter of LB broth at 37 °C, induced with 1.0 mm IPTG, and grown for an additional 2 h. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold PBS and sonicated for 2 min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 ×g, and GST-PDZ fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography on 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose. A polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify a 1.6-kilobase pair fragment of pMal-p2 containing the lacI q gene and a gene fragment encoding the signal peptide from maltose-binding protein under the control of the Ptac promoter (forward primer, AAAAGAATTCCCGACACCATCGAATGGTGC, and reverse primer, ACCAG ATGCAT AAGCCGAGGCGGAAAACATCATCG; EcoRI site is in bold and NsiI site is in bold italics). The DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and NsiI and ligated with the large fragment resulting from a similar digestion of a P8 display phagemid (19.Lowman H. Chen Y. Skelton N. Mortenson D. Tomlinson E. Sadick M. Robinson I. Clark R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The method of Kunkel et al. (20.Kunkel T. Roberts J. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was used to insert eight codons (TAATAACATCACCATCACCATGCG) immediately following the final codon of the P8 open reading frame. The resulting phagemid (designated pS1290a) contained the following DNA sequence downstream of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter: DNA encoding the maltose-binding protein signal peptide, mature P8, two stop codons (TAATAA), a penta-His FLAG (HHHHHA), and two more stop codons (TGATAA). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to delete the two stop codons between P8 and the penta-His FLAG or to replace them with varying numbers of Gly codons. The resulting phagemids secreted P8 moieties with carboxyl-terminal fusions consisting of various numbers of Gly residues followed by the penta-His FLAG. With phagemid pS1290a as the template, a previously described method (21.Sidhu, S., Lowman, H., Cunningham, B. & Wells, J. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar) was used to construct and sort linker libraries that replaced the two stop codons between P8 and the penta-His FLAG with 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 degenerate codons. The libraries were pooled together to give a total diversity of 1.1 × 1011. The pool was cycled through rounds of binding selection with an anti-tetra-His antibody as the capture target. After two rounds of binding selection, individual phage were isolated and analyzed in a phage ELISA by capturing the phage with the anti-tetra-His antibody and detecting bound phage (see below). Phage exhibiting strong signals in the phage ELISA were subjected to sequence analysis. The phagemid exhibiting the strongest ELISA signal was designated pS1403a. Phagemid pS1403a was used as a template to construct a library (21.Sidhu, S., Lowman, H., Cunningham, B. & Wells, J. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar) of P8 moieties with carboxyl-terminal fusions consisting of a 13-residue linker (AWEENIDSAPGGG) followed by seven degenerate codons (NNS, where N = A/C/G/T and S = C/G). The diversity of the library was 2.0 × 1010. The library was cycled through rounds of binding selection with a GST-PDZ fusion protein coated on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates as the capture target. Phage were propagated in E. coli SS320 (21.Sidhu, S., Lowman, H., Cunningham, B. & Wells, J. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar) either with or without 10 μm IPTG induction. After three or four rounds of binding selection, individual phage were isolated and analyzed in a phage ELISA (see below). Phage that bound to the target GST-PDZ, but not to an unrelated GST-PDZ, were subjected to sequence analysis. Binding of peptide-displaying phage particles to immobilized target proteins was detected using a phage ELISA. The assay was performed as described by Pearce et al.(22.Pearce Jr., K. Potts B. Presta L. Bald L. Fendly B. Wells J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20595-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), except that phage were produced in E. coli SS320, and assay plates were developed using a TMB peroxidase substrate system (read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm). The binding affinities of peptides for PDZ domains were determined as IC50 values using competition ELISAs. The IC50value was defined as the concentration of peptide that blocked 50% of PDZ domain binding to immobilized peptide. Assay plates were prepared by immobilizing amino-terminally biotinylated peptides (ASKVTWV or TRWWFDI for PDZ3 or PDZ4 binding assays, respectively) on maxisorp plates that had been first coated with streptavidin and subsequently blocked with BSA. A fixed concentration of GST-PDZ (60 nm) in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBT buffer) was preincubated for 3 h with serial dilutions of peptide and then transferred to the assay plates. After 15 min incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with a mixture of anti-GST antibody (0.5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase/rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugate (1:2000 dilution) in PBT buffer, washed again, and detected with TMB peroxidase substrate. The three-dimensional structure of PDZ2 in complex with a high affinity peptide ligand was modeled using homology modeling techniques with the Modeler program (23.Molecular Simulations, IncInsight II. Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego1999Google Scholar), based on the coordinates of other PDZ domains solved by x-ray crystallography (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry codes 1BE9 and 1PDR) (10.Doyle D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 11.Morais-Cabral J. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S. Chisti A. Liddington R. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanics calculations to energy-minimize the modeled complex were performed using the cff91 forcefield with the program Discover as implemented in INSIGHTII (23.Molecular Simulations, IncInsight II. Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego1999Google Scholar). We constructed a series of phagemids designed to ascertain whether peptides fused to the carboxyl terminus of P8 could be displayed on the surface of M13 phage. Each phagemid was designed to secrete a P8 moiety with a penta-His FLAG epitope (HHHHHA) fused to its carboxyl terminus. Phage particles containing phagemid DNA were produced by co-infecting E. coli with the phagemid and a helper phage. In such a system, the majority of the phage coat is composed of P8 molecules supplied by the helper phage (24.Wilson D. Findlay R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but the incorporation of some phagemid-encoded P8 molecules could result in the display of the carboxyl-terminally fused penta-His FLAG. We detected penta-His FLAG display with a phage ELISA using an anti-tetra-His antibody as the capture target. Fig. 1shows that direct fusion of the FLAG to the carboxyl terminus of P8 did not result in display, but display was achieved by inserting five or more Gly residues between the P8 carboxyl terminus and the FLAG. Display levels increased steadily with increasing linker length, reaching a maximum with a 16-residue linker. To optimize the linker sequence, we constructed libraries in which the linker connecting the penta-His FLAG to the P8 carboxyl terminus was designed to contain 4–6, 8, or 10 randomized residues. The libraries were pooled together and cycled through two rounds of binding selection on plates coated with the anti-tetra-His antibody. Many diverse sequences were selected, but all selectants contained either 8 or 10 residues, again demonstrating a minimum length requirement for the linker. The best linker sequence (AWEENIDSAP) increased display about 10-fold relative to polyglycine linkers of comparable length (data not shown). We constructed a library of random peptides fused to the carboxyl terminus of P8 with an optimized, intervening linker of 13 residues (AWEENIDSAPGGG). At each library position, we used a degenerate codon that encoded all 20 natural amino acids and an amber (TAG) stop codon. The library contained seven degenerate codons and thus predominantly encoded heptapeptides, but the possible occurrence of amber stop codons also provided for the display of shorter peptides. The library contained 2.0 × 1010unique members and thus exceeded the diversity of all possible natural heptapeptides (∼109). We used the library to investigate the binding specificities of PDZ domains 2 and 3 (PDZ2 and PDZ3, respectively) of MAGI 3, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase. PDZ2 interacts with the tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC, whereas the binding specificity of PDZ3 is not known (25.Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R. Lee J. Gu Q. Lasky L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). PDZ2 and PDZ3 were purified as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions from E. coli, and the phage-displayed peptide library was cycled through four rounds of binding selection against each domain. Transcription of the phagemid-encoded P8 gene is regulated by the Lac repressor, and display could thus be increased by the addition of IPTG. The PDZ2 sort was successful with or without IPTG, but the PDZ3 sort yielded binding clones only with IPTG induction. The PDZ2 sort yielded a variety of sequences varying in length from seven to four residues (Table I). The four carboxyl-terminal residues showed a strong consensus to the sequence Cys/Val-Ser/Thr-Trp-Val-COOH, a type 1 PDZ binding consensus related to, but distinctly different from, the carboxyl-terminal sequence of PTEN/MMAC (Tables I and II). Although many of the sequences were represented by unique clones, two carboxyl-terminal sequences appeared multiple times (CSWV and VTWV), both as tetrapeptides and also at the carboxyl termini of longer peptides. Thus, we reasoned that these two sequences represented minimal, high affinity ligands of PDZ2. The PDZ3 sort yielded only a single heptapeptide (TRWWFDI), a type II PDZ-binding motif that differs completely from the PDZ2 binding consensus.Table IPhage-displayed selectantsPeptide sequencePDZ2 bindersDGICSWVaIsolated without IPTG induction.,bRepresented by multiple clones.CSWVbRepresented by multiple clones.,cSelected after four rounds.ASKVTWVcSelected after four rounds.VTWVEAQCTWVLEVCSWVWGPCTWVPCSWVIERTTWVHEEWTWVGGDCHWVHKDCHWVPDZ3 bindersTRWWFDIbRepresented by multiple clones.The sequences were selected after three rounds of sorting with IPTG induction, unless otherwise indicated.a Isolated without IPTG induction.b Represented by multiple clones.c Selected after four rounds.

Open table in a new tab The sequences were selected after three rounds of sorting with IPTG induction, unless otherwise indicated. The IC50 values are the concentrations of peptide that blocked 50% of PDZ domain binding to immobilized peptide in an ELISA. Peptides corresponding to the selected sequences were synthesized and assayed for binding (Table II). The selected peptides bound their cognate PDZ domains with high affinity while exhibiting no detectable binding to non-cognate PDZ domains. Amidation of the carboxyl terminus of the PDZ3-specific peptide resulted in a 300-fold reduction in binding affinity, demonstrating the importance of interactions between PDZ3 and the terminal carboxylate of its ligand. The data also confirmed that the minimal tetrapeptide selectants from the PDZ2 sort bind PDZ2 with high affinity. Surprisingly, the selectants bound PDZ2 much more tightly than a heptapeptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of PTEN/MMAC. It appears that this large difference in binding affinity is entirely attributable to the residue at P(−1), 2Positions in the peptide ligand, from the carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus, are designated P(0), P(−1), P(−2), etc. The corresponding binding sites on PDZ domains are designated site(0), site(−1), site(−2), etc. which is a Trp in the selected peptide as opposed to a Lys in PTEN/MMAC (compare HTQITWV with HTQITKV, Table II). To assess the contributions of individual ligand side chains to the binding interaction, the tetrapeptide exhibiting the highest affinity for PDZ2 (CSWV) was subjected to an alanine scan. A peptide series was synthesized to convert individually each amino acid within the tetrapeptide to an Ala residue. The results indicate that all four side chains contribute favorably to the binding interaction (Table II), but the magnitudes of the contributions vary. Ala substitution at P(0) or P(−1) reduced binding by more than 100-fold, whereas substitution of the serine residue at P(−2) caused only a 5-fold reduction. Ala substitution of the cysteine residue at P(−3) caused an intermediate 25-fold reduction in binding. We used homology modeling techniques to build a three-dimensional model of PDZ2 in complex with the high affinity pentapeptide ligand GVTWV (Figs.2 and 3). The model was based on the crystal structures of the third PDZ domain from the human homolog of discs-large protein (11.Morais-Cabral J. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S. Chisti A. Liddington R. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95-3) in complex with a pentapeptide (KQTSV) (10.Doyle D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The model and the peptide alanine scan data help to define the binding interactions between PDZ2 and peptide ligands. In both the crystal structure and the model, the peptide ligand forms a β strand that intercalates between β2 and α2 of the PDZ domain, extending the antiparallel β sheet formed by β2 and β3 of the protein (Fig.2). The terminal carboxylate of the peptide interacts with the highly conserved carboxylate binding loop (main chain of residues Gly-22, Phe-23, and Gly-24), whereas the P(0) Val side chain resides in a well defined hydrophobic pocket. In the PSD-95-3/KQTSV crystal structure, the side chain of Ser at P(−1) is solvent-exposed, and it does not interact with the protein (Fig. 2). Thus, the P(−1) side chain in PDZ domain ligands has been considered unimportant for binding, and the type I consensus sequence X-Ser/Thr-X-Val-COOH has been proposed (10.Doyle D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In contrast, the bulky Trp side chain at P(−1) of our high affinity ligands can be modeled to pack against the protein (Fig. 2), establishing favorable Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Met-38 and Leu-40 in the β3 strand (Fig. 3). These interactions would bury a large hydrophobic area and greatly stabilize the complex. This prediction is supported by the dramatic reduction in binding upon substitution of Trp with Ala at P(−1) (Table II). Met-38 and Leu-40 are not conserved in the PDZ family (Fig. 2 A), indicating that interactions between side chains at these positions and peptide side chains at P(−1) may contribute not only to binding affinity but also to specificity. At P(−2), the Thr side chain makes a hydrogen bond to the conserved His-67 residue in both the crystal structure and the model (Fig. 2). However, the interaction is solvent-exposed, and Ala substitution at this position has only a modest effect on affinity (Table II). Thus, the side chain at P(−2) may determine specificity, but it makes only a minor contribution to affinity in the case of PDZ2 binding to the selected peptides. Finally, the binding contribution of the hydrophobic side chain at P(−3) can be rationalized in terms of favorable Van der Waals contacts with a hydrophobic patch on the protein formed by the side chains of residues Ala-26 and Ala-28 in the β2 strand and the side chain of Lys-37 in the β3 strand (Figs. 2 and 3). Our results confirm the importance of the previously described interactions between the carboxyl terminus of the peptide ligand and the carboxylate binding loop of the PDZ domain. In addition, our data highlight contributions to binding affinity and specificity attributable to interactions between hydrophobic side chains at P(−1) and P(−3) of the peptide ligand and side chains in the β2 and β3 strands of the PDZ domain.Figure 3Molecular surface of the modeled PDZ2-GVTWV complex.

This belief is based on structures of filamentous phage determined by x-ray fiber diffraction, because these structures indicate that the P8 amino terminus is solvent-exposed, whereas the carboxyl terminus is buried in the core of the particle (26.Marvin D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, the structure also reveals that the phage coat is essentially a repeating array of several thousand P8 molecules, and we reasoned that a few P8 molecules with carboxyl-terminal fusions may be tolerated in a coat predominantly composed of wild-type P8. Our results clearly demonstrate the viability of carboxyl-terminal P8 fusions in a phagemid system, where the majority of the coat is wild-type P8 supplied by a helper phage (24.Wilson D. Findlay R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The fact that display is dependent on linker length is consistent with a minimum peptide length necessary to extend the carboxyl terminus from the core of the phage particle to the solvent-exposed surface. Any phagemid-based system can be adapted for carboxyl-terminal P8 display, since all aspects of the format are analogous to conventional phage display. For example, display levels were increased by IPTG induction of a regulated promoter, and standard phage display selection methods worked well with the new format. Library members containing stop codons are not displayed as amino-terminal fusions, but in the carboxyl-terminal display format, random stop codons actually expanded library diversity by producing truncated peptides that were displayed (Table I). The perceived limitations of phage display prompted Cull et al. to develop an elegant alternative (27.Cull M. Miller J. Schatz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Their “peptides-on-plasmids” technique enabled the display of peptide libraries with free carboxyl termini, because the libraries were fused to the carboxyl terminus of the E. coli Lac repressor that in turn bound tightly to the peptide-encoding plasmid. The plasmid and phage display methods are analogous in principle, but they differ significantly in the requirements for library purification and propagation. M13 phage particles are secreted directly into the media, and a simple precipitation can be used to purify the phage away from the E. coli host and most host proteins (21.Sidhu, S., Lowman, H., Cunningham, B. & Wells, J. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, peptide-plasmid complexes are obtained in bacterial lysates and thus remain associated with soluble E. coli proteins (16.Strickler N. Christopherson K. Yi B. Schatz P. Raab R. Dawes G. Bassett D. Bredt D. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Following rounds of binding selection, phage particles can be efficiently propagated by infection of an appropriate host strain. The introduction of plasmids into host cells requires less efficient and more complicated transformation procedures (16.Strickler N. Christopherson K. Yi B. Schatz P. Raab R. Dawes G. Bassett D. Bredt D. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Whatever the particular method, carboxyl-terminal display formats open up new applications unsuitable for amino-terminal display. These include the display of cDNA libraries in which natural stop codons limit amino-terminal display (17.Palzkill T. Huang W. Weinstock G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and also the PDZ domain binding specificity analyses reported here. An interesting result from our studies is the fact that phage-selected peptides actually bind PDZ2 more tightly than a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of a natural PDZ2 ligand, the tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC (Table II). The selected consensus sequence is similar to the PTEN/MMAC sequence in three of the four carboxyl-terminal positions, but a major difference between the two sequences is found at P(−1), where the PTEN/MMAC sequence contains a Lys, whereas the selected sequence contains a Trp. This Trp side chain is critical for high affinity binding (Table II), and molecular modeling studies suggest that it makes highly specific Van der Waals contacts with the PDZ domain (Figs. 2 and 3). These results suggest that PDZ2 is capable of binding to both low and high affinity ligands, with the P(−1) side chain determining the affinity of the interaction. Protein data base searches (28.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) for the Ser/Thr-Trp-Val-COOH motif revealed that an epithelial cell junction protein, δ-catenin, ends in this sequence (data not shown). The possibility that δ-catenin may tightly interact with MAGI proteins is interesting, because catenins appear to be localized to the tight junctions of epithelial cells by an unknown mechanism. One interpretation of these data is that PDZ2 interacts with high affinity ligands, such as catenins, for subcellular localization and also with low affinity ligands, such as PTEN/MMAC, for the control of cell signaling. Structural studies have revealed that the peptide ligand forms an additional β strand in the PDZ domain structure through main chain interactions with β2 (10.Doyle D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In addition to previously noted interactions, our results highlight the binding contributions of peptide side chains at P(−1) and P(−3) (Table II). Our modeling studies suggest that side chains at these positions reach across β2 and make specific contacts with side chains in β3 (Figs. 2 and 3). These interactions help to explain PDZ domain binding specificity and affinity, and it is notable that similar “β1-β3” interactions between hydrophobic side chains have been found to stabilize three-stranded antiparallel β sheet proteins such as WW domains (29.Macias M. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz M. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschinkat M. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In fact, such β1-β3 interactions have been used to drive β sheet formation in de novo protein design experiments (30.Kortemme T. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Serrano L. Science. 1998; 281: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain side chains involved in these interactions are not conserved in the PDZ family, and thus, such interactions could be used to introduce both affinity and specificity in designed PDZ domain ligands."

Here, we show that in apoptotic cells, the Cdk inhibitory protein p21 WAF1/CIP1 , which is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex, undergoes selective proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, another Cdk inhibitory protein, p27 KIP1 , which is associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, remained unaltered during apoptosis. Ectopic overexpression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 suppressed apoptosis as well as cyclin A-Cdk2 activity induced by treatment of SK-HEP-1 cells with G-Rh2. The suppressive effects of p21 WAF1/CIP1 were much higher in the cells transfected with p21D112N, an expression vector that encodes a p21 WAF1/CIP1 mutant resistant to caspase 3 cleavage. Overexpression of cyclin A in SK-HEP-1 cells dramatically up-regulated cyclin A-Cdk2 activity and accordingly enhances apoptosis induced by treatment with G-Rh2. These up-regulating effects were blocked by coexpression of a dominant negative allele of cdk2. Furthermore, olomoucine, a specific inhibitor of Cdks, also blocked G-Rh2-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that the induction of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells treated with G-Rh2 occurs by a mechanism that involves the activation of cyclin A-Cdk2 by caspase 3-mediated cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 .

DAPI, 4′6-diamidino-2- phenylindole Apoptosis and cell proliferation are opposing cellular processes that maintain the homeostasis of multicellular systems. Growing evidence suggests that these opposing processes have several regulatory features in common. Various proteins involved in cell division cycle control, such as p53, retinoblastoma protein phosphatase Cdc25, oncoprotein c-Myc, transcription factor E2F-1, and the viral oncoprotein E1A also regulate the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis (1Field S.J.

Forced expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 can block apoptosis during myocyte differentiation (4Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Moreover, in response to prostaglandin A2 or ionizing irradiation, p21 WAF1/CIP1 (–/–) mutant cells and cells that down-regulate the expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 have been shown to be more susceptible to apoptosis than are wild cell types; this phenotype can be rescued by ectopic expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 (5Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Rapid up-regulation of Cdk activity has been shown to be associated with the onset of apoptosis in a number of experimental systems. These include growth factor-deprived human endothelial cells (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), lymphocytes induced by granzyme B (7Shi L. Chen G. He D. Bosc D.G. Litchfield D.W. Greenberg A.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2381-2385PubMed Google Scholar) or Fas (8Zhou B.B. Li H. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6785-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and noncycling thymocytes induced by nonspecific (γ-irradiation, heat shock, or dexamethasone) or specific (peptide-mediated) apoptotic stimuli (9Hakem A. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus it has been suggested that Cdks, the key regulators of the cell division cycle, also play a pro-apoptotic role. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observation that ectopic expression of a dominant negative version of Cdk2 (Cdk2-dn) partially suppresses apoptosis of human endothelial cells induced by growth factor deprivation (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, olomoucine, which is a specific inhibitor of Cdks, efficiently suppresses apoptosis in noncycling thymocyte induced by various apoptotic stimuli (9Hakem A. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although these studies provide evidence for a potentially essential role for Cdks in apoptosis, the mechanism of apoptotic activation of Cdks and their precise role in apoptosis have not been deciphered. Recently, we and others have shown that p21 WAF1/CIP1 undergoes caspase 3-mediated cleavage at a specific aspartate residue (Asp-112) during the early stage of apoptosis in various cell types induced by various stimuli (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 10Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I.

Because p21 WAF1/CIP1 loses its nuclear localization sequence after cleavage by caspase 3, it has been suggested that caspase-mediated cleavage of Cdk inhibitors may contribute to the observed rapid up-regulation of Cdk activity in the early stage of apoptosis (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2), a ginseng saponin with a dammarane skeleton that is isolated from the root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell types (10Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Lee K.Y. Park J.A. Chung E. Lee Y.H. Kim S.I. Lee S.K.

Lee K.Y. Oh Y.J. Kim K.W. Lee S.K. Cancer Lett. 1997; 121: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the human hepatoma cell line SK-HEP-1, G-Rh2 present in the culture media at low concentrations (1 μm) arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S transition by down-regulating cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity (12Lee K.Y. Park J.A. Chung E. Lee Y.H. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, at higher concentrations (12 μm), G-Rh2 induces apoptotic cell death through proteolytic activation of caspase 3. Apoptosis induced by treatment with G-Rh2 is not blocked by the ectopic expression of Bcl-2 in SK-HEP-1 cells, suggesting that G-Rh2 induces apoptosis by a mechanism that is not negatively regulated by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (14Park J.A. Lee K.Y. Oh Y.J. Kim K.W. Lee S.K. Cancer Lett. 1997; 121: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rather, in G-Rh2-induced apoptotic cells, p21 WAF1/CIP1 was shown to undergo proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3 at aspartate 112 (context: DHVDL113). The caspase 3 cleavage site is located between the N terminus and the nuclear translocation signal of p21 WAF1/CIP1 (10Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of caspase 3-mediated p21 WAF1/CIP1 cleavage in the induction of apoptosis in SK-HEP1 cells after treatment with G-Rh2. We demonstrate that the proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 , but not Cdk inhibitor p27 KIP1 , which also associates with cyclin-Cdk complexes, results in the selective and rapid activation of cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cyclin A-Cdk2) kinase activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the truncation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and consequent activation of cyclin A-Cdk2 are prerequisite events for the execution of apoptosis induced by treatment of cells with G-Rh2. G-Rh2 was kindly provided by the Korean Ginseng and Tobacco Research Institute. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. General chemicals were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SK-HEP-1 cells and HeLa cells were obtained from Seoul National University Cancer Center and maintained as a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (by volume) heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured for 12 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then treated with G-Rh2 for the indicated time periods. Both floating and adherent cells were harvested for the immunoblotting experiments and histone H1 kinase assays. At the same time, another set of G-Rh2-treated cells were fixed, permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with DAPI solution to visualize nuclei and DNA. Fluorescent cells were photographed under the fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc., and cultured in endothelial cell growth medium kit 2 containing 2% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Inc.). Apoptosis was induced in 40% confluent cell monolayers by treatment with RPMI 1640 medium containing 12 μm G-Rh2 or in confluent cell monolayers by incubating the cells in RPMI 1640 medium without growth factors. Full-length human cyclin A cDNA generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (using oligo 5′-AAGGATCCAGCCTATTCTTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCGGCAGCTGGCATCATTAATAC-3′) with BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends was cloned into the pCMV expression vector. Human Cdk2 and Cdk2-dn cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Ewen Mark (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Human full-length p21 WAF1/CIP1 cDNA (2.1 kilobase pairs) was inserted into pCMV vector. Substitution of Asn-112 for Asp-112 was accomplished by converting the Asp codon GAC to AAC by site-directed mutagenesis (CLONTECH). The full-length cyclin A cDNA sequence and the presence of the G-to-A mutation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. SK-HEP-1 cells (2 × 105) were co-transfected with either 2 μg each of pCMV-p21 WAF1/CIP1 and pCMV-β-galactosidase or pCMV-p21D112N and pCMV-β-galactosidase using 8 μl of Superfect (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, apoptosis was induced in the transfected cells with the addition of 12 μm G-Rh2. When about 50% of the total cells revealed apoptotic morphology, cells were stained with X-gal and examined with phase-contrast microscopy as described (15Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of apoptosis, we counted blue cells that were rounded and exhibited blebbing on 17 randomly selected fields (40–50 cells per field) under a phase contrast microscope (Olympus) at a magnification of × 150. HeLa cells were also used for transient transfection studies because of their high transfection efficiency (>80%). HeLa cells (2.5 × 105) grown on six-well plastic plates were transfected with 0.5–2 μg of each expression vector per sample using 8 μl of Superfect (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated at 1.5 × 103cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with G-Rh2 for 24 h, and then 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagents were added to each microculture well. After 2 h of incubation, the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO and measured with an ELISA reader (Tecan). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min. An aliquot (30 μg of protein) from each sample was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Gelman). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies to p21 WAF1/CIP1 or p27 KIP1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), with cyclin A or cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to Cdk2 (raised against the C-terminal peptide of Cdk2) and polyadenylribosyl polymerase (PARP). The blots were washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce), and then visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An aliquot (500 μg of protein) from each cell extracts was precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the supernatant was incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to cyclin A or cyclin E for 4 h. Immune complexes associated with cyclin A or cyclin E were collected after incubating for 2 h with protein A-agarose beads. The immune complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for their components by immunoblotting using corresponding mouse monoclonal antibodies. Immune complexes obtained from aliquots (200 μg of protein) of each cell extracts as described above were washed three times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The immune complexes were then incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of the kinase assay buffer supplemented with 5 μg of histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm), 5 μm PKI (protein kinase A inhibitor), and 20 mm EGTA, and the proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Cyclin-associated kinase activities were then determined by autoradiography. It is known that Cdk activity is up-regulated in the early stage of apoptosis of human hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells induced by G-Rh2. To decipher the mechanism by which Cdk activity is induced in the process of apoptosis, we examined the Cdk activities in SK-HEP-1 cells after treatment with G-Rh2. After treatment of SK-HEP-1 cells with G-Rh2 (12 μm) for 1 h, individual cells showed the typical morphological changes that occur during apoptosis, such as cell rounding and membrane blebbing (Fig.1 A). DAPI staining of the cells showed that G-Rh2 treatment also induced chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation within a similar range of time after treatment (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis showed that proteolytic activation of procaspase 3 to yield catalytically active 17-kDa caspase 3 and PARP cleavage to yield the 85-kDa version of the protein occurred in SK-HEP-1 cells 1 h after treatment with G-Rh2 (Fig. 1 C). We then immunoprecipitated the cyclin A- and cyclin E-dependent kinases from G-Rh2-treated SK-HEP-1 cell lysates and used histone H1 as a substrate to measure the amount of each specific Cdk activity. Cyclin A-Cdk2 activity was elevated 1–2-fold in cells that had been treated with G-Rh2 for 1 h compared to levels in control (vehicle-treated) cells (Fig. 1,D and E). Cyclin A-Cdk2 activity was elevated further by 2–3-fold after 2 h of treatment with G-Rh2 (Fig. 1,D and E). These results show that cyclin A-dependent kinase activity is up-regulated in the early stages of apoptosis and that this up-regulation is progressive over time and occurs in parallel with the process of apoptosis. By contrast, cyclin E-dependent kinase 2 (cyclin E-Cdk2) activity remained unaltered under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1,D and E). To test whether the up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 activity in apoptotic cells is associated with the proteolytic cleavage of Cdk inhibitors p21 WAF1/CIP1 or p27 KIP1 , we measured the amounts of these inhibitory proteins in SK-HEP-1 cells before and after treatment with G-Rh2. Immunoblotting analyses showed that cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 to yield p14 and p27 KIP1 to yield p23 was induced at 1 and 4 h, respectively, after treatment of cells with G-Rh2 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the proteolytic truncation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 precedes that of p27 KIP1 by 3 h in the process of apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells induced by G-Rh2 treatment. We then examined whether the truncated versions of these Cdk inhibitors were associated with cyclin-Cdk complexes. For these experiments, we carried out immunoblotting analyses of immune complexes that were immunoprecipitated from SK-HEP-1 cells with specific antibodies to cyclin A or cyclin E. These analyses showed that p21 WAF1/CIP1 that was associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 but not with cyclin E-Cdk2 underwent proteolytic cleavage after cells were treated for 1 h with G-Rh2. As expected, p21 WAF1/CIP1 that was associated with the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex remained unaltered under the same experimental conditions. In addition, the amount of p27 KIP1 that was associated with cyclin E-Cdk2 did not change with G-Rh2 treatment; however, the amount of p27 KIP1 that was associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 decreased slightly after cells were incubated with G-Rh2 for 4 h (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, the timing of proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 upon treatment of cells with G-Rh2 agrees very well with that of the rapid up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in the apoptotic cells. This series of experiments also showed that the amounts of cyclin A, cyclin E, and Cdk2 in the kinase complexes did not change upon G-Rh2 treatment relative to control cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the rapid activation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity observed in the early stages of apoptosis is caused by the proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. Our next goal was to provide evidence for the notion that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 is linked functionally to the up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity observed in apoptotic cells. To this end, we examined whether ectopic overexpression of p21D112N, a mutant version of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is resistant to caspase 3 cleavage, can suppress apoptosis more efficiently than does overexpression of wild type p21 WAF1/CIP1 in SK-HEP-1 cells treated with G-Rh2 (Fig.3). Because the transfection efficiency of SK-HEP-1 cells is relatively low (less than 30%), we differentiated between transfectants and untransfected cells using X-gal blue staining after co-transfection of the cells with a β-galactosidase expression vector and a vector that expressed either p21 WAF1/CIP1 or p21D112N. The blue-stained transfectants were then evaluated morphologically to determine the number of apoptotic cells (rounded shape and membrane blebbing) and viable cells (elongated in shape) (Fig. 3 A). G-Rh2 induced apoptosis in 53% of mock-transfected SK-HEP-1 cells, whereas the apoptosis-inducing effect of G-Rh2 was reduced significantly to 26 and 11%, respectively, in p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p21D112N transfectants under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 is important for the induction of apoptosis. Because of the low transfection efficiency, we were unable to measure cyclin A-Cdk2 activity using SK-HEP-1 cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of overexpression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p21D112N on cyclin A-Cdk2 activity and apoptosis using HeLa cells. HeLa cells were chosen for the following reasons. First, the transfection efficiency of HeLa cells is high enough (>80%) to perform biochemical assays. Second, our preliminary experiments showed that HeLa cells undergo apoptotic cell death in a manner similar to SK-HEP-1 cells after treatment with G-Rh2 (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4 A, the amounts of p21D112N and p21 WAF1/CIP1 increased in transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of transfected DNA. Using these transfectants, we examined cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in the cells after treatment with G-Rh2. Both classes of transfectants showed significant down-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity, which occurred in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of transfected DNA (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with the results obtained with transfected SK-HEP-1 cells, viability of the p21D112N transfectants was significantly higher than that of the p21 WAF1/CIP1 transfectants (∼71%versus ∼39%), and the changes in cell viability were dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 4, C and D). We next compared the cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in extracts of transfected cells after treatment of G-Rh2. As shown in Fig.4 E, p21D112N transfectants exhibited much lower cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity than did the p21 WAF1/CIP1 transfectants after treatment of HeLa cells with G-Rh2. As expected, kinase activity in the mock transfectants, which were transfected with the vector DNA, was much higher than that in p21D112N or p21 WAF1/CIP1 transfectants. Under the same experimental conditions used in Fig.4 E, we examined the levels of proteins that are associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase complex in transfected HeLa cells after treatment with G-Rh2. Immunoblotting analyses were carried out with immune complexes that were precipitated from extracts of G-Rh2-treated, transfected HeLa cells with specific antibodies to cyclin A. The levels of co-immunoprecipitated p21D112N from p21D112N-transfected cells were significantly higher than the levels of p21 WAF1/CIP1 co-immunoprecipitated from p21 WAF1/CIP1 -transfected cells (Fig.4 F). In apoptotic mock transfectants, the levels of p21 WAF1/CIP1 were undetectable. Thus, it appears that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 plays an important role in the up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity and induction of apoptosis in both SK-HEP-1 and HeLa cells treated with G-Rh2. In addition, the rapid up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity may be required in the process of apoptosis induced by G-Rh2 treatment. Because overexpression of either p21D112N or p21 WAF1/CIP1 suppressed apoptosis as well as the increase in cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in both SK-HEP-1 and HeLa treated with G-Rh2, we tested whether up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is required for the progression of apoptosis. We first examined whether olomoucine, a specific cyclin-Cdk2 inhibitor, can block apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 induced by treatment with G-Rh2. Incubation of G-Rh2-treated SK-HEP-1 cells with olomoucine suppressed the development of morphological changes and chromatin fragmentation (Fig.5 A). In addition, the viability levels of G-Rh2-treated cells were restored to the level of untreated cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 B). The results suggest that the apoptosis of cells induced by treatment with G-Rh2 requires the up-regulation of Cdk activity. To test whether up-regulation of cyclinA-Cdk2 kinase activity is required for the progression of apoptosis, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors that encoded either cyclin A, Cdk2-dn, or both. Immunoblotting analysis showed that expression of the corresponding transfected DNAs increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). Using these transient transfectants, we carried out immune complex cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase assays after treatment of the transfected cells with G-Rh2. In the cyclin A transfectants, cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity increased dramatically in a DNA dose-dependent manner compared with kinase activity in mock transfectants (Fig. 6 B). As expected, the increased cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity levels induced by overexpression of cyclin A were reduced to levels observed in mock transfectants by co-transfection of Cdk2-dn. In addition, cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity was shown to be decreased significantly in Cdk2-dn transfectants when compared with that of mock transfectants (Fig.6 B). The viability of cyclin A transfectants was decreased dramatically (Fig. 6 C). However, cell viability was restored to the levels of mock transfectants by co-transfection of Cdk2-dn. Overexpression of Cdk2-dn alone yielded cell viability levels higher than those obtained for mock transfectants. In this experiment, we used a lower concentration of G-Rh2 (6 μm) to adjust the cell viability of G-Rh2-induced mock transfectants to higher than about 70%, because this experiment was also aimed at testing whether forced expression of cyclin A accelerates apoptosis induced by treatment with G-Rh2. We next examined changes over time in the levels of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in the above transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2. Cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity was up-regulated dramatically in a time-dependent manner in the cyclin A transfectants compared with that of the mock transfectants (Fig. 6 D). When cells were co-transfected with cyclin A and Cdk2-dn, this up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity was again efficiently suppressed to levels that were even lower than those of the mock transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2. Cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in Cdk-dn transfectants was significantly lower than that of mock transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2. These results demonstrate that up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is required for the progression of apoptosis in G-Rh2-induced HeLa cells. In this article, we have described four major observations: (i) ectopic overexpression of a mutant version of p21 WAF1/CIP1 , p21D112N, which is not susceptible to proteolysis by caspase 3, efficiently blocks G-Rh2-induced apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells; (ii) cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity but not cyclin E-Cdk2 activity is up-regulated in the early stages of apoptosis; (iii) up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is a consequence of proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex; and (iv) proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex is a prerequisite process, not only for up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in apoptotic cells but also for the initiation and progression of apoptosis. When apoptosis is induced in SK-HEP-1 cells by treatment with G-Rh2, we observed that proteolytic activation of caspase 3, up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity, and the initiation of apoptosis all occur within the same time period after G-Rh2 induction. An earlier report showed that both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities are up-regulated under conditions where growth factor deprivation induces apoptosis in HUVEC (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity remained unaltered until SK-HEP-1 cells had been treated with G-Rh2 for 4 h, and at that time, the apoptotic process was nearly completed. Thus, we ruled out the possibility that cyclin E-Cdk2 plays a role in the early stages of apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells induced by G-Rh2. The selective up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity appears to be the result of proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. We observed that a marked reduction in the amount of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex coincided with the up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity. In contrast, the amounts of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p27 KIP1 that were associated with the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex remained unaltered. An earlier report showed that proteolysis of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p27 KIP1 is involved in the up-regulation of both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activities in apoptotic HUVEC induced by growth factor deprivation (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In this study, we also observed that p27 KIP1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage, but not until SK-HEP-1 cells have been treated with G-Rh2 for 4 h, when the apoptosis is nearly completed and cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity has been down-regulated. Furthermore, the amount of p27 KIP1 that is associated with both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes was unaltered during apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells. To determine whether these differences reflect differences in the cells studied or in the means by which apoptosis was induced, we extended this study to the induction of apoptosis in HUVEC by treatment with G-Rh2 or growth factor deprivation (Fig. 7). The results showed that G-Rh2 equally induces proteolytic cleavage of PARP in HUVEC as does it in SK-HEP-1 cells. Cyclin A-Cdk2 activity markedly increased, whereas cyclin E-Cdk2 activity remained unchanged in HUVEC after treatment with G-Rh2. In addition, increases in cyclin A-Cdk2 activity in apoptotic HUVEC kinetically coincided well with increases in proteolytic cleavages of PARP and p21 WAF1/CIP1 but not with an increase in that of p27 KIP1 . By contrast, in apoptotic HUVEC induced by growth factor deprivation, we observed that p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p27 KIP1 undergo proteolytic cleavages with subsequent increases in both cyclins A- and E-dependent kinase activities as described previously (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The appearance of the p21 WAF1/CIP1 fragment preceded the appearance of the p27 KIP1 fragment by 2–4 h after growth factor deprivation. A marked increase in cyclin A-Cdk2 activity preceded an increase in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity by 4 h in apoptotic HUVEC. These results clearly suggest that G-Rh2-induced apoptosis occurs by a different mechanism than growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in HUVEC. Our results also indicate that apoptosis in HUVEC and SK-HEP-1 cells induced by G-Rh2 may proceed by a similar mechanism. It is interesting to note that both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 form complexes with p27 KIP1 and p21 WAF1/CIP1 before SK-HEP-1 cells commit to apoptosis after treatment with G-Rh2. This phenomenon suggests that both cyclin kinase inhibitors, p27 KIP1 and p21 WAF1/CIP1 , may play a protective role in guarding cells against apoptosis (see below). However, results described in this report suggest that p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex is more susceptible to caspase 3-like enzymes than is kinase-associated p27 KIP1 . Therefore, p21 WAF1/CIP1 may play a distinct role in apoptosis, such as the selective up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in the initial stages of apoptosis. Our result indicate that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 at Asp-112 is a prerequisite event for the up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in SK-HEP-1 cells induced to enter apoptosis by treatment with G-Rh2. We (10Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and others (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19207-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have shown that caspase 3 specifically cleaves p21 WAF1/CIP1 at DHVDL113, which is located near the nuclear translocation signal. It has been suggested that cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 by caspase 3 or a caspase 3-like protease at Asp-112 can prevent nuclear translocation of this Cdk inhibitor and hence may result in the up-regulation of cyclin-Cdk2 kinase activity in the nucleus (6Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a noncleavable p21 WAF1/CIP1 mutant, p21D112N, to show that ectopic overexpression of a noncleavable form of p21 WAF1/CIP1 inhibits the up-regulation of G-Rh2-induced cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity (Fig. 4 E). Results herein and from other studies (4Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) imply that p21 WAF1/CIP1 is a protective factor, guarding cells against apoptosis. A number of observations suggest that part of this protective function may be achieved by preventing Cdk2 activation. First, overexpression of p53 induces apoptosis only when p21 WAF1/CIP1 fails to increase proportionally, and conversely, overexpression of p21 WAF1/CIP1 blocks p53-induced apoptosis (16Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Second, mutated p21 WAF1/CIP1 lacking Cdk-inhibitory activity fails to prevent apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma cells (17Lu Y. Yamagishi N. Yagi T. Takebe H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Third, all nonspecific (γ-irradiation, heat shock, or dexamethasone) and specific (peptide-mediated) apoptotic stimuli induce rapid activation of the Cdk2 in noncycling thymocytes. In addition, inhibition of Cdk2 activity by olomoucine efficiently protects thymocytes from cell death induced by various stimuli (9Hakem A. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results not only support a protective role for p21 WAF1/CIP1 in apoptosis but also indicate that cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 is a prerequisite event for apoptosis. This requirement for proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 in G-Rh2-induced apoptosis may be through the resulting up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity. The following observations support this hypothesis. First, the suppression of apoptosis by overexpression of either wild type p21 WAF1/CIP1 or p21D112N is well correlated with the down-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 activity in transfected HeLa cells treated with G-Rh2. This inhibitory effect on cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is more pronounced in the p21D112N transfectants (Fig.4 E). Second, the amounts of p21 WAF1/CIP1 associated with the kinase complex decreased more slowly in p21D112N transfectants than they did in wild type p21 WAF1/CIP1 transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2 (Fig. 4 F). By contrast, the amount of p21 WAF1/CIP1 associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 is much lower in the mock transfectants after treatment with G-Rh2 (Fig. 4 F). Thus, in wild type p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p21D112N transfectants, the amount of p21 WAF1/CIP1 associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 correlates with both a suppressive effect on apoptosis and down-regulation of kinase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.4, C–F). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 that is associated with cyclin A-Cdk2 is a major mechanism for up-regulation cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity in the early stages of apoptosis. Additional experimental observations suggest that this consequent up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is required for apoptosis in both SK-HEP-1 and HeLa cells induced by treatment with G-Rh2. First, in HeLa cells transfected with cyclin A, Cdk2-dn, or cyclin A and Cdk2-dn. (Fig. 6), we found that G-Rh2-induced apoptosis is increased dramatically by overexpression of cyclin A. However, this increase in apoptosis is blocked by co-transfection with Cdk2-dn (Fig. 6 C). Similarly, cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity is greatly up-regulated by overexpression of cyclin A, and this up-regulation is also blocked by co-transfection with Cdk2-dn (Fig. 6, B and D). Second, we showed that olomoucine, a specific Cdk inhibitor, is able to block G-Rh2-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, the changes in morphology and the nuclear fragmentation normally observed in apoptotic cells induced by treatment with G-Rh2 were blocked by addition of olomoucine to the culture media (Fig.5 A). Therefore, taken together, our results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of p21 WAF1/CIP1 and the consequent up-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity may be linked ultimately to irreversible cell death.

Noda (Meiji Cell Technology Center, Japan) and Ewen Mark (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) for providing human full-length p21 WAF1/CIP1 cDNA and human Cdk2-dn cDNA, respectively."

Recognition of the mRNA cap structure through its subunit eIF4E is a requirement for the recruitment of other translation initiation factors to the mRNA 5′-end and thereby for the attachment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In this study, we have investigated the mechanistic basis of the observation that eIF4E binding to the cap is enhanced in the presence of the large eIF4F subunit, eIF4G. We show that eIF4E requires access to both the mRNA 5′-cap and eIF4G to form stable complexes with short RNAs.

Full-length eIF4G is shown to induce increased eIF4E binding to cap analogues that do not contain an RNA body. Both results show that interaction of eIF4G with the mRNA is not necessary to enhance cap binding by eIF4E.

This is mediated by the cap-binding complex known as eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F. The minimal cap-binding complex that can be isolated from all organisms investigated so far comprises two proteins, eIF4E and eIF4G. Whereas eIF4E manifests direct affinity for the cap structure (1Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar), eIF4G serves as a multipurpose adaptor capable of recruiting a number of necessary activities to the mRNA 5′-end (2Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of eIF4G to the ribosome-associated initiation factor eIF3 is thought to establish physical contact between the mRNA and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (3Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T.

The interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G involves a conserved motif with the consensus sequence Tyr-X-X-X-X-Leu-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) in eIF4G (10Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between these two motifs is required for coupling the cap-binding activity to the activities of other initiation factors, its disruption or reinforcement may be utilized by cells to control specifically the translation of capped messages (see e.g. Ref. 17McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest that binding of the cap-binding complex to other initiation factors affects the stability of the eIF4E-cap interaction. So far, there is experimental evidence for a mutual reinforcement of the majority of interactions in the chain 5′-cap:eIF4E:eIF4G:Pab1:poly(A)-3′ for initiation factors purified from wheat germ (18Le H.

For yeast and mammalian eIF4E, the binding of different ligands (namely the eIF4E binding domain of eIF4G (4G-BD4E), p20, and 4E-BP2) has been shown to enhance (to differing degrees) the affinity of eIF4E for immobilized cap analogues and short RNAs (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T.

The interpretation of these, at first sight contradictory, findings is further complicated by the fact that mammalian eIF4E shows strong differences in its binding to several cap analogues and short RNAs, and that there is currently considerable uncertainty as to the affinity values for these interactions. Thus, one study found that the binding constant with cap analogues was two times smaller than with RNAs (Kd values are 2 × 10−6m for m7GTP and m7GpppG and 1 × 10−6m for capped RNAs, (22Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, a very recent study found equilibrium binding constants of 1 × 10−8m for m7GTP and 2 × 10−7m for the larger analogue, m7GpppG (21Niedzwiecka-Kormas, A., Chlebicka, L., Jankowska-Anyszka, M., Stepinski, J., Dadlez, M., Gingras, A.-C., Marcotrigiano, J., Sonenberg, N., Burley, S. K., and Stolarski, R. (1999)RNA abstractGoogle Scholar). Cooperativity effects in factors such as eIF4E could play a key role in the mechanism and control of translation (17McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, contrary to the cooperative model for eIF4E function (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), eIF4G enhances the eIF4E-cap interaction solely by virtue of the stabilizing influence of RNA binding to the eIF4G RRM regions (23Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). We have therefore designed a series of experiments to investigate further the proposed cooperative behavior of eIF4E, using a range of different techniques as well as different domains of eIF4G. The strategy was designed specifically to clarify the confusion arising from apparently contradictory results reported in previous work. Purification of recombinant yeast eIF4E from inclusion bodies was performed as described previously (24Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but 20 mm GDP was used to elute the protein from m7GTP-Sepharose instead of 0.1 mmm7GTP. The nucleotide was removed from protein-containing fractions by dialysis overnight against 2000 volumes of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl) followed by dialysis for 4 h against 2000 volumes of buffer A. His6-tagged fragments of yeast eIF4G were purified as described earlier (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Full-length, His6-eIF4G1 was expressed in SF9 insect cells and purified via heparin chromatography (application of the cleared extract in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and elution with a gradient of 30–500 mm KCl in the same buffer), followed by standard nickel-chelate chromatography. His6-tagged Pab1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (hsdS gal (λcIts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1)) using the expression plasmid pET2a at a growth temperature of 28 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the extract was subjected to nickel-chelate chromatography. PAB1-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to heparin chromatography as described for eIF4G. Synthetic DNA primers with the sequences 5′-GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and 5′-TGATGTTGTTGTTGGTGTCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAA TTC-3′ were used to generate capped or uncapped RNAs as described previously (20Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim Md. M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)1 experiments were performed on a BIA3000 (BIAcore) essentially as described earlier (20Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim Md. M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The eluent buffer for all experiments was 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml wheat germ tRNAs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.005% surfactant p20 (BIAcore). For estimation of the equilibrium binding constant, 10−7 to 10−5m eIF4E in eluent buffer was injected over the chip, and the equilibrium responses were plotted against protein concentration. BIAevaluation software (v3.1; BIAcore) was used to calculate a value corresponding to the curve. 2 μg of eIF4E were mixed with equimolar amounts of the respective binding partners, plus 1 μg/μl tRNAs and 20 units RNAsin in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2). The mixture was left for 5 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled probe was added in a volume of 2 μl, and the mixture again left for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were then separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), with 75 mm Tris/glycine, pH 8, as running buffer. These experiments were performed as described earlier (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, visualized using silver staining, and quantified with a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer and Bio-Rad molecular analyst software. eIF4E-binding proteins were added as indicated to an amount equimolar to the original 10 μg of eIF4E. All circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J810-CD in quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm. For each sample, four spectra were recorded at a sensitivity of 100 millidegrees and averaged. For sample preparation, proteins were dialyzed into buffer containing 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, and 2 mm MgSO4. All proteins were diluted to a concentration of 10 μm in the same buffer, and m7GpppG was added where appropriate to a concentration of 20 μm. Prior to measurements, samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and allowed to reach ambient temperature for five minutes immediately before the measurements. The commonly used method for the purification of recombinant eIF4E employs m7GTP immobilized on Sepharose as a highly specific affinity matrix for the binding of eIF4E. The elution of eIF4E from this resin is usually performed using buffer containing 0.1 mm soluble m7GTP. The cap analogue is then removed by means of either dialysis or further chromatographic methods (25Edery I. Lee K.A.W. Sonenberg N. Illan I. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 335-366Crossref Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of removal of the cap analogue during the purification of eIF4E has been questioned (21Niedzwiecka-Kormas, A., Chlebicka, L., Jankowska-Anyszka, M., Stepinski, J., Dadlez, M., Gingras, A.-C., Marcotrigiano, J., Sonenberg, N., Burley, S. K., and Stolarski, R. (1999)RNA abstractGoogle Scholar). It is important that eIF4E utilized in mRNA cap binding studies is essentially cap analogue-free, because any presence of a strongly binding cap analogue would reduce the effective concentration of active eIF4E. In earlier studies, mammalian eIF4E was shown to bind to nonmethylated nucleotides with 20–30-fold lower affinity than to their methylated counterparts (26Wieczorek Z. Niedzwiecka-Kormas A. Chlebicka L. Jankowska M. Kiraga K. Stepinski J. Dadlez M. Drabent R. Darzynkiewicz E. Stolarski R. Z. Naturforsch. 1999; 54: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore modified the standard method of elution of eIF4E from the cap resin, utilizing nonmethylated GTP instead of m7GTP, because the former should be more readily removed from the cap-binding protein. We found that 20 mm GTP elutes yeast eIF4E from m7GTP-Sepharose with similar efficiency to 0.1 mm m7GTP (data not shown). The eluted protein was then dialyzed overnight against 2000 volumes of buffer containing 1 m KCl, followed by dialysis for a further 4 h against the same volume of low salt buffer. To show that dialysis efficiently removes the nucleotide, a small aliquot of eIF4E was mixed with [γ-32P]GTP and subjected to the same procedure. Samples were taken after the initial mixing as well as after each dialysis step, and cross-linking was induced by irradiation with UV light. The resulting preparations were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the eIF4E bands were visualized through Coomassie Blue staining and excised from the gel, and the associated radioactivity was determined via scintillation counting. Both results show that GTP can be removed from the protein preparation with high efficiency, with the final protein containing less than 0.5% of GTP-associated eIF4E as calculated from the reduction of eIF4E-associated radioactivity. A capped, 19-mer RNA containing a single biotinylated UTP near its 3′-end was immobilized on streptavidin-coated sensor chips to a response level of 100 resonance units and used in SPR experiments (Fig. 2, A and B; and see “Materials and Methods”). The injection of the apo-form (noncap-bound) of yeast eIF4E over these chips revealed an interaction that is characterized by rapid binding and release, as was previously observed for the human protein (20Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim Md. M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Injections in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP or m7GTP, respectively, showed that the methylated cap analogue completely prevents the association of eIF4E with the chip, whereas the nonmethylated nucleotide has only a minor effect (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that the observed sensorgrams were generated solely by cap binding and not by nonspecific interactions of the protein with the negatively charged mRNA matrix. We do not at present know the origin of the slower binding and release phases following the initial rapid interaction. However, we found that the maximum response (Rmax) for these events is independent of the amount of immobilized mRNA. This suggests that this phase does not arise directly from the eIF4E-cap interaction. Part of it may stem from eIF4E molecules that are trapped in the dextran and/or mRNA matrix after release from the mRNA caps. In contrast, the rapid phases of the sensorgrams were dependent on both the amount of immobilized mRNA and the concentration of injected eIF4E. Inspection of the end points of the rapid phases at different protein concentrations yielded an estimated equilibrium binding constant of 3.6 × 10−6m (data not shown). This is in good accordance with the majority of published results derived from fluorescence studies for capped RNAs and eIF4Es from other species (e.g. 1 × 10−6m for human eIF4E (22Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and 0.8 × 10−6m for wheat eIF4E (27Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). The dissociation rates observed with this method could not be subjected to standard analysis procedures using the BIAevaluation curve-fitting software, because the short time from the end of injection to complete release of eIF4E did not yield sufficient data points for a detailed analysis. However, manual comparison of the actual curves with simulated release curves for off rates between 0.1 and 1 s−1 indicated that the release constant for the eIF4E-mRNA interaction lies between 0.5 and 1 s−1, corresponding to an association rate constant of 0.5–1 × 10−6 s−1m−1. In a further procedure designed to yield information about the interaction between eIF4E and the cap structure, gel mobility shift experiments were conducted with radiolabeled mRNA identical to that used in the SPR experiments, but containing no biotinylated residue. As has already been observed (5Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), yeast eIF4E alone is not sufficient to generate detectable signals of shifted RNA in this type of assay (Fig.3, lane 1). This is understandable in light of the results obtained in the SPR experiments, because a complex characterized by the observed low affinity and fast rate constants would not remain stably bound to the cap structures. However, the presence of a 17-kDa fragment of eIF4G comprising the eIF4E binding site flanked by ∼70 amino acids on each side (termed here 4G-BD4E) leads to a clearly detectable shift, whereas the eIF4G fragment alone does not interact detectably with the capped mRNA (lanes 2 and 3). The ability of the eIF4G fragment to induce the shift is likely to be linked solely to the increased cap-binding affinity of the complex with eIF4E, because this fragment lacks the RRM domains of eIF4G. Moreover, the presence of the cap analogue m7GTP completely prevents retardation of the RNAs (lane 4), and no shift can be induced under identical conditions when uncapped mRNA is used (lane 9). We next investigated the properties of a mutant form of eIF4E with the substitution W75R. The apo-form of this protein binds the cap structure with an affinity similar to the wild type, but can no longer interact with eIF4G (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This mutant protein was unable to cause the band-shift (lane 12). A slight smear of radioactivity above the free probe in this lane stems most likely from residual interactions between the eIF4G fragment and the mutated eIF4E. In conclusion, both the availability of a cap structure and the eIF4G interaction are necessary for eIF4E to be able to form a stable complex with mRNA. In previous work, a fragment of eIF4G comprising only the 17-amino acid region covering the eIF4E binding site has been shown to bind stably to eIF4E (12Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, this peptide did not have the ability to strengthen the interaction with the cap sufficiently to cause a mobility shift (lanes 5 and 6). The first indications of enhanced cap binding in the presence of fragments of eIF4G were obtained using equilibrium studies with purified proteins and m7GTP-Sepharose (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The use of immobilized cap analogues is particularly suited for the determination of cooperative effects during cap binding, because the absence of an RNA body excludes additive effects arising from the presence of RNA-binding activities in the eIF4E binding partners. Briefly, a small amount of eIF4E is incubated with a small amount of immobilized cap analogue, and an equilibrium between cap-bound and -free eIF4E is established through incubation in a large buffer volume. The amount of eIF4E that can subsequently be eluted from the resin is then taken as an indicator for the affinity of the protein for the cap. We used this method to obtain data on the influence of larger fragments of eIF4G on the cap affinity of eIF4E (data summarized in Fig.4). As was shown previously, the presence of 4G-BD4E significantly displaces the equilibrium between soluble and resin-associated eIF4E toward the cap-bound state. To our surprise, we found that the complete N-terminal half of eIF4G (4G-Nt, comprising both the eIF4E and Pab1 binding site, Fig. 1 A) had a much weaker effect on the recovery of eIF4E from the resin compared with the 17-kDa fragment. This is consistent with observations that larger fragments of eIF4G show a weaker interaction with eIF4E in yeast two-hybrid experiments. 2M. Ptushkina and J. E. G. McCarthy, unpublished results. Interestingly, the addition of Pab1 to this reaction restored the ability of eIF4G to increase the association of eIF4E with the cap analogue. The effect of 4G-Nt in a complex with Pab1 slightly surpassed that of 4G-BD4E alone. The same effect was observed when complete eIF4G1 purified from insect cells was used. Indeed, the combination of complete eIF4G1 and Pab1 produced the strongest effect in this assay, leading to a 3-fold increase in the amount of eIF4E recovered from the column. It was noted that the greatest increase in recovery observed in this assay was less dramatic than the increase in the signal observed in the gel shift experiments. We assume that this reflects differences in the interactions between eIF4E and cap analogues as compared with those between eIF4E and mRNAs. Recent fluorescence studies found that the binding of free eIF4E to m7GTP, which was used in the affinity resin experiments described here, is almost one order of magnitude stronger than the binding to the larger cap analogue, m7GpppG, which more closely resembles a capped mRNA. However, we assume that the more dramatic results from our gel shift experiments using capped mRNAs more closely reflect affinity changes in vivo. Finally, we observed that, in contrast to the larger eIF4G fragments, the 17-amino acid peptide comprising the minimal eIF4E binding motif had only a very small effect on the recovery of eIF4E, again confirming the results obtained in the gel shift experiments. The data presented here suggest that binding of eIF4E to eIF4G leads to an effective increase of the former protein's affinity for mRNA cap structures. Nothing is known, however, about the structural basis for this effect. Inspection of the sequences of eIF4Es from different organisms revealed an area of high conservation in the internal parts of eIF4E. It was suggested that this area forms an allosteric tract, which might be involved in structural changes that eIF4E undergoes upon interaction with its ligands (20Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim Md. M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate whether such changes do indeed take place, CD experiments were performed with free and cap-bound eIF4E. We compared the CD spectrum of buffer containing 10 μmeIF4E, recorded between 198 and 250 nm in the presence and absence of cap analogue (Fig.5 A). Upon the addition of 20 μm m7GpppG, the basic spectrum of eIF4E undergoes changes between 220 and 235 nm. Consistent with earlier studies (28Carberry S.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8078-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we did not find any absorbance of the free cap analogue at these wavelengths. We conclude, therefore, that the observed changes in the CD spectrum arise from conformational rearrangements within eIF4E. As expected, the eIF4E·eIF4G-BD4E complex shows a spectrum that is significantly different from that of free eIF4E. However, upon addition of the cap analogue this complex shows changes in the CD spectrum very similar to those observed with eIF4E alone (Fig. 5 B). This suggests, but does not prove, that the conformational changes are limited to a large extent to the eIF4E part of the cap complex and do not extend into the 17-kDa domain of eIF4G used here. Taken together with the data on the increased cap affinity of the eIF4F complex, these results suggest that the eIF4G binding domain stabilizes conformational rearrangements within eIF4E. Our data do not allow us to draw an unequivocal conclusion regarding the influence of eIF4G-BD4E binding on the conformation of apo-eIF4E. The solving of the three-dimensional structure of eIF4E (15Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) has recently provided a new basis for understanding how eIF4E interacts with the cap structure. However, the initially assumed “static” binding model, in which eIF4E interacts with the cap only in the conformation deduced from the crystallographic data (12Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 15Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), seems unlikely to provide an adequate explanation of the functional characteristics of this protein as part of eIF4F. Most studies concerning the nature of cap binding by eIF4E assume a relatively low affinity for capped mRNAs, with a Keq of ∼10−6m. Such a low affinity appears problematic with respect to the many functions that eIF4G is thought to fulfill at the mRNA 5′-end, which may include removal of secondary structure from the message by virtue of the recruitment of eIF4A/4B, attachment of the ribosome via interaction between eIF4G and eIF3, and according to a very recent study, involvement in decapping of the message through recruitment of Dcp1 (29Vilela C. Velasco C. Ptushkina M. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These functions require a sequence of events to occur that are firmly anchored at the 5′-end of the RNA, suggesting that a sufficiently tight interaction between eIF4F and the mRNA is important. The potential problem is further highlighted if one assumes the operation of a very rapid binding cycle, especially with the rapid release of eIF4E from capped RNA, as reported in this study. It seems unlikely that a sequence of events as complex as the recruitment of the 40 S subunit could be tied to the RNA through an interaction that is determined by the rate constants and affinity manifested by the eIF4E-cap interaction alone. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be provided by the fact that eIF4G itself shows affinity for mRNA through the action of two weakly conserved RRMs in the C terminus of the protein (8Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF4F might be tied to the message through the combined action of eIF4E and eIF4G. Indeed, increased cross-linking of human eIF4E to a capped RNA in the presence of full-length eIF4G has been shown (30Haghighat A. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21677-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this increase is merely attributable to the additional nonspecific eIF4G-mRNA interaction (23Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to note that the binding of eIF4G to RNAs is relatively weak, with an affinity measured for wheat eIF4G of ∼10−6m (27Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results reported here indicate that a different mechanism is involved in the increased association with mRNAs when eIF4E is part of eIF4F. The clearly observed increase in cap binding with fragments of eIF4G that bind to eIF4E, but not to RNAs, as well as the increase observed in binding to cap analogues that are not attached to an RNA body, are fully consistent with a model in which binding of ligands to the dorsal site on eIF4E modulates the affinity for the cap of this protein. Of the fragments tested here, the minimal portion of eIF4G capable of inducing this effect comprises the eIF4E binding site plus ∼70 amino acids on either side. This explains earlier, apparently contradictory results, which showed that no enhancement of cap binding can be observed when a peptide corresponding only to the known eIF4E binding motif is used (21Niedzwiecka-Kormas, A., Chlebicka, L., Jankowska-Anyszka, M., Stepinski, J., Dadlez, M., Gingras, A.-C., Marcotrigiano, J., Sonenberg, N., Burley, S. K., and Stolarski, R. (1999)RNA abstractGoogle Scholar). We have now seen that the corresponding peptide fails to produce any clear effect using the techniques described in this paper. With larger portions of eIF4G, or the full-length protein, the simultaneous presence of Pab1 was found to be necessary to achieve maximum reinforcement of the eIF4E-cap interaction. A comparable effect has been described for wheat eIF4F, where the presence of the poly(A)-binding protein PAB was found to enhance the affinity of both eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F for cap analogues (19Wei C.C. Balasta M.L. Ren J.H. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study, together with results derived from earlier studies (Table I), form a considerable body of evidence supporting the notion that cooperative effects play a role in the assembly and function of the cap-binding complex eIF4F. The finding of cooperative effects is significant for understanding how eIF4F can function during translation initiation despite the potentially transient nature of the basic eIF4E-cap interaction. Further work will have to address the role that cooperativity plays during translation initiation in vivo,and the way in which this might affect the overall process of translation and its regulation.Table IApparent cooperativity effects during cap complex assembly reported in the literatureOrganismEnhanced interactioneIF4E ligand(s)Ref.S. cerevisiaeeIF4E-m7GTP4G-BD4E14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T.

https://openalex.org/W2055141649,"Smad7 has recently been identified as a player that antagonizes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signals by acting downstream of TGF-β receptors. TGF-β rapidly induces expression of Smad7 mRNA in a variety of cell types, suggesting participation in a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β responses. We have previously described the genomic locus of rat Smad7 including the promoter region. Here we report polymerase chain reaction cloning of the corresponding promoter regions of human and murine Smad7 genes and functional characterization of the rat Smad7 promoter. Using transient transfection experiments of HepG2 cells, we identified the TGF-β response element within a strongly conserved region, containing a perfect Smad binding element (SBE; GTCTAGAC). Performing electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cotransfection experiments, we were able to delineate DNA-binding complexes and identified Smad3, Smad4, and Smad2. Mutation of the SBE completely abolished TGF-β inducibility of Smad7 in HepG2 cells, indicating that this sequence is necessary for TGF-β-induced transcription. Furthermore, a 3-base pair adjacent E-box is additionally essential for TGF-β-dependent promoter activation and an overlapping AP1 site is also involved. We conclude that regulation of Smad7 transcription by TGF-β is mediated via a specific constellation of recognition motifs localized around the SBE, which is conserved in human, rat, and murine genes. Smad7 has recently been identified as a player that antagonizes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signals by acting downstream of TGF-β receptors. TGF-β rapidly induces expression of Smad7 mRNA in a variety of cell types, suggesting participation in a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β responses. We have previously described the genomic locus of rat Smad7 including the promoter region. Here we report polymerase chain reaction cloning of the corresponding promoter regions of human and murine Smad7 genes and functional characterization of the rat Smad7 promoter.

Ligand binding to the receptor triggers Smad signaling. Nuclear translocation of activated complexes initiates expression and activity of specific target genes, including inhibitory Smads that interfere with receptor interaction and phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads, thus shutting of signal transduction. In contrast to receptor-activated Smads, which are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and upon activation translocate into the nucleus, Smad7 is mainly found within the nucleus in the absence of ligand and receptor activation induces its transport to the cell membrane (6Itoh S.

We have previously performed a detailed characterization of the rat Smad7 genomic organization including 1,300 bp of the promoter region (7Stopa M. Benes V. Ansorge W. Gressner A.M. Dooley S. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The gene is composed of 4 exons separated by 3 introns covering a DNA region of about 30 kilobases (kb) in total. Additionally, one potential transcription start site of the gene has been identified.In the present study, we describe the isolation of corresponding human and mouse Smad7 promoter regions and identified the TGF-β response element of the gene. A fragment of 141 bp, which is strongly conserved during evolution, contains the TGF-β responsive DNA sequence consisting of a Smad binding element (SBE), an E-box in a 3-bp 3′-distance of the SBE and an AP1 site, which is overlapping with the E-box. Disruption of the SBE and/or the adjacent E-box completely abolished TGF-β responsiveness of the Smad7 promoter region in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions at the TGF-β response element and identified Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 participating in TGF-β response element binding.DISCUSSIONTGF-β is the prototype of a family of signaling molecules that exhibit pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as on pattern formation during early vertebrate development (24Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of Smad proteins as downstream effectors of signaling from activated receptors activated by members of the TGF-β superfamily has opened new ways for investigating regulation of target gene expression. Inhibitory Smad6 and Smad7 are able to block TGF-β superfamily signaling in a negative feedback loop upon transcriptional activation. In the present study, we describe the isolation of Smad7 promoter regions from rat, human, and murine genes. A region of 141 bp (position −417 to −275) is completely conserved in all three organisms, with the exceptions that a poly(T) stretch varies between 12 and 15 bp and a G→A exchange occurs at position −270 within murine DNA. It has previously been shown by several investigators that the expression of Smad7 can be rapidly and transiently induced by TGF-β with kinetics similar to early response gene activation after treatment of quiescent cells with, e.g., FCS (5Nakao A.

Transient transfection experiments with promoter reporter constructs localized the TGF-β-responsive region downstream to −470 of the Smad7 promoter. A potential TGF-β-responsive element consisting of a perfect 8-bp SBE, GTCTAGAC, at position −346 to −338, previously identified by a PCR-based selection as optimal DNA sequence for Smad3 and Smad4 binding (16Zawel L.

Structurally, this sequence represents a palindromic motif containing two copies of GTCT and its reverse complement AGAC in the opposite strand. It has been shown that tandem repeats of this sequence element confer TGF-β-inducible transcriptional activation and that CAGA-like sequences in, e.g., the PAI-1 and JunB promoters are able to directly bind Smad3 and Smad4 (8Dennler S.

This basal activity is also based on regulatory elements located downstream from the −470 position. Using a site directed mutational assay, we have exchanged 6 of 8 bp from the SBE with an EcoRI restriction site within the Smad7 promoter/reporter construct, thereby completely abolishing TGF-β inducibility without interfering with basal promoter activity of the gene. In gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts of serum-starved and TGF-β-treated cells, two complexes were found. C1, displaying slower mobility, was present in serum-starved cells representing TGF-β-independent DNA binding activities. TGF-β treatment of the cells strongly induced a faster migrating complex C2, which could be supershifted or avoided, respectively, by antiserum raised against Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, indicating participation of all three Smad proteins in TGF-β inducibility of Smad7 in HepG2 cells. Participation of Smad2 in DNA binding of an SBE is in contrast to several previous investigations (8Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Tendijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

Based on structural differences, Smad2, in contrast to Smad3 and Smad4, is not able to interact with DNA directly (25Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that Smad2 is able to act as a transcription factor after binding to nuclear proteins like, for example, Fast2 (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 27Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein-protein interactions of SBE binding Smads and factors binding to adjacent DNA sequence elements may be necessary to recruit Smad2 stably in the complex. In a recent paper, Hua and colleagues (28Hua X.X. Liu X.D. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) described a synergistic cooperation of an E-box-binding protein and Smad3/Smad4 in TGF-β-induced transcription of the PAI-1 gene. Interestingly, mutation of the E-box sequence abolished TGF-β inducibility without preventing DNA binding of Smad3/Smad4 to the neighboring SBE. Furthermore, any insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the spacer region between the SBE and the E-box also completely abrogated TGF-β-induced transcription. Huaet al. suggested a model in which phosphorylated Smad3 and likely Smad4 bind to TFE3, a transcription factor, which is specific for E-boxes. This complex binds to the DNA and subsequently recruits coactivators such as p300 and CREB-binding protein, leading to enhanced transcription of the PAI-1 gene. Exactly the same constellation is found in the case of the investigated Smad7 promoters. In a downstream distance of 3 bp to the SBE, the promoters contain an E-box (CACGTG) and an overlapping AP1 site (TGACGA). AP1 sites have also been described as target elements involved in TGF-β signaling before (10Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougierchapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

We show the necessity of an intact E-box within the Smad7-specific TGF-β response element for TGF-β-dependent inducibility. Mutation of this motif completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of TGF-β. Within the Smad7 promoter, the situation is even more complex than in the PAI-1 gene promoter. In addition to the adjacent E-box, an E-box overlapping AP1 site was identified, which also participates in TGF-β-dependent complex formation and therefore may be involved in determining specificity of TGF-β signal transduction to the Smad7 target. Using EMSAs, a constitutive binding activity C1 was detected in serum-starved HepG2 cells, which is independent of TGF-β treatment and which contains (an) E-box-binding protein(s). Furthermore, this binding activity may be involved in, but seems not to be necessary for, basal promoter activity of Smad7 in HepG2 cells. If this motif was mutated in the wild type rat Smad7 promoter, basal activity could not be diminished. However, basal promoter activity was down-regulated after disruption of this E-box within a Smad7-TGF-β response element containing oligonucleotide, which lacks flanking promoter sequences. We conclude from these findings that several SP1 sites, which are located further downstream of the E-box within the Smad7 promoters (−274 to −190), additionally are able to confer basal transcriptional activity; therefore, disruption of the E-box in presence of functional SP1 sites has only a minor effect. Whether Smad proteins are involved in basal promoter activity is presently not clear. Based on our EMSA results with a CAGA-box lacking E-box sequences and nuclear extracts of HepG2, significant Smad binding activity is already present in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, transfections with Smad-expressing plasmids increase basal promoter activity, indicating basal pathway restricted Smad activation. Further confirmation of a “cross-talk” of the SBE, E-box, and AP1 motifs within the Smad7 promoter TGF-β response element was shown by supershift experiments with an antiserum against an E-box-binding protein (USF), which resulted in a strong supershifted band and reduced C1 and C2 complexes. We have not yet investigated the role of the overlapping AP1 site in more detail, and we do not know if TFE3, as described for the PAI 1 TGF-β response element, is part of the E-box-binding complex.In summary, our data functionally identify the immediate early TGF-β response element of the rat Smad7 gene promoter. This motif and flanking sequences are strongly conserved in human and murine genes. We show that Smad3, Smad4, and Smad2 are involved in TGF-β-induced Smad7 promoter binding activity. An SBE and an adjacent E-box, located 3 bp downstream of the SBE, are essential for TGF-β responsiveness of the promoter. Reciprocal interactions of DNA-binding proteins, which recognize neighboring motifs, determine Smad7 specificity of TGF-β signal transduction.AddendumSince submission of this article, two similar reports have been published (Nagarajan, R.

Huaet al. suggested a model in which phosphorylated Smad3 and likely Smad4 bind to TFE3, a transcription factor, which is specific for E-boxes. This complex binds to the DNA and subsequently recruits coactivators such as p300 and CREB-binding protein, leading to enhanced transcription of the PAI-1 gene. Exactly the same constellation is found in the case of the investigated Smad7 promoters. In a downstream distance of 3 bp to the SBE, the promoters contain an E-box (CACGTG) and an overlapping AP1 site (TGACGA). AP1 sites have also been described as target elements involved in TGF-β signaling before (10Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougierchapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

We show the necessity of an intact E-box within the Smad7-specific TGF-β response element for TGF-β-dependent inducibility. Mutation of this motif completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of TGF-β. Within the Smad7 promoter, the situation is even more complex than in the PAI-1 gene promoter. In addition to the adjacent E-box, an E-box overlapping AP1 site was identified, which also participates in TGF-β-dependent complex formation and therefore may be involved in determining specificity of TGF-β signal transduction to the Smad7 target. Using EMSAs, a constitutive binding activity C1 was detected in serum-starved HepG2 cells, which is independent of TGF-β treatment and which contains (an) E-box-binding protein(s). Furthermore, this binding activity may be involved in, but seems not to be necessary for, basal promoter activity of Smad7 in HepG2 cells. If this motif was mutated in the wild type rat Smad7 promoter, basal activity could not be diminished. However, basal promoter activity was down-regulated after disruption of this E-box within a Smad7-TGF-β response element containing oligonucleotide, which lacks flanking promoter sequences. We conclude from these findings that several SP1 sites, which are located further downstream of the E-box within the Smad7 promoters (−274 to −190), additionally are able to confer basal transcriptional activity; therefore, disruption of the E-box in presence of functional SP1 sites has only a minor effect. Whether Smad proteins are involved in basal promoter activity is presently not clear. Based on our EMSA results with a CAGA-box lacking E-box sequences and nuclear extracts of HepG2, significant Smad binding activity is already present in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, transfections with Smad-expressing plasmids increase basal promoter activity, indicating basal pathway restricted Smad activation. Further confirmation of a “cross-talk” of the SBE, E-box, and AP1 motifs within the Smad7 promoter TGF-β response element was shown by supershift experiments with an antiserum against an E-box-binding protein (USF), which resulted in a strong supershifted band and reduced C1 and C2 complexes. We have not yet investigated the role of the overlapping AP1 site in more detail, and we do not know if TFE3, as described for the PAI 1 TGF-β response element, is part of the E-box-binding complex.In summary, our data functionally identify the immediate early TGF-β response element of the rat Smad7 gene promoter. This motif and flanking sequences are strongly conserved in human and murine genes. We show that Smad3, Smad4, and Smad2 are involved in TGF-β-induced Smad7 promoter binding activity. An SBE and an adjacent E-box, located 3 bp downstream of the SBE, are essential for TGF-β responsiveness of the promoter. Reciprocal interactions of DNA-binding proteins, which recognize neighboring motifs, determine Smad7 specificity of TGF-β signal transduction. TGF-β is the prototype of a family of signaling molecules that exhibit pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as on pattern formation during early vertebrate development (24Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of Smad proteins as downstream effectors of signaling from activated receptors activated by members of the TGF-β superfamily has opened new ways for investigating regulation of target gene expression. Inhibitory Smad6 and Smad7 are able to block TGF-β superfamily signaling in a negative feedback loop upon transcriptional activation. In the present study, we describe the isolation of Smad7 promoter regions from rat, human, and murine genes. A region of 141 bp (position −417 to −275) is completely conserved in all three organisms, with the exceptions that a poly(T) stretch varies between 12 and 15 bp and a G→A exchange occurs at position −270 within murine DNA. It has previously been shown by several investigators that the expression of Smad7 can be rapidly and transiently induced by TGF-β with kinetics similar to early response gene activation after treatment of quiescent cells with, e.g., FCS (5Nakao A.

Transient transfection experiments with promoter reporter constructs localized the TGF-β-responsive region downstream to −470 of the Smad7 promoter. A potential TGF-β-responsive element consisting of a perfect 8-bp SBE, GTCTAGAC, at position −346 to −338, previously identified by a PCR-based selection as optimal DNA sequence for Smad3 and Smad4 binding (16Zawel L.

Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), was identified within the 141-bp region. Structurally, this sequence represents a palindromic motif containing two copies of GTCT and its reverse complement AGAC in the opposite strand. It has been shown that tandem repeats of this sequence element confer TGF-β-inducible transcriptional activation and that CAGA-like sequences in, e.g., the PAI-1 and JunB promoters are able to directly bind Smad3 and Smad4 (8Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Tendijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 20Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Luo K.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9431-9441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The promoter of Smad7 displayed already significant basal activity in HepG2 cells, which was even higher than the activity of TGF-β-induced (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, a very sensitive reporter of TGF-β signal transduction. This basal activity is also based on regulatory elements located downstream from the −470 position. Using a site directed mutational assay, we have exchanged 6 of 8 bp from the SBE with an EcoRI restriction site within the Smad7 promoter/reporter construct, thereby completely abolishing TGF-β inducibility without interfering with basal promoter activity of the gene. In gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts of serum-starved and TGF-β-treated cells, two complexes were found. C1, displaying slower mobility, was present in serum-starved cells representing TGF-β-independent DNA binding activities. TGF-β treatment of the cells strongly induced a faster migrating complex C2, which could be supershifted or avoided, respectively, by antiserum raised against Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, indicating participation of all three Smad proteins in TGF-β inducibility of Smad7 in HepG2 cells. Participation of Smad2 in DNA binding of an SBE is in contrast to several previous investigations (8Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Tendijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

Based on structural differences, Smad2, in contrast to Smad3 and Smad4, is not able to interact with DNA directly (25Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that Smad2 is able to act as a transcription factor after binding to nuclear proteins like, for example, Fast2 (26Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 27Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein-protein interactions of SBE binding Smads and factors binding to adjacent DNA sequence elements may be necessary to recruit Smad2 stably in the complex. In a recent paper, Hua and colleagues (28Hua X.X. Liu X.D. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) described a synergistic cooperation of an E-box-binding protein and Smad3/Smad4 in TGF-β-induced transcription of the PAI-1 gene. Interestingly, mutation of the E-box sequence abolished TGF-β inducibility without preventing DNA binding of Smad3/Smad4 to the neighboring SBE.

We now report the characterization of a rat counterpart of Sac1p. Rat Sac1 is a ubiquitously expressed 65-kDa integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that is found at particularly high levels in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Like Sac1p, rat Sac1 exhibits intrinsic phosphoinositide phosphatase activity directed toward phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate substrates, and we identify mutant rat sac1 alleles that evoke substrate-specific defects in this enzymatic activity.

They do so by regulating the intracellular localization and biological properties of a variety of proteins involved in these processes. Such effector proteins recognize specific phosphoinositides via lipid binding modules such as C2 domains, pleckstrin homology domains, FYVE domains, and SH21 domains (reviewed in Refs. 1De Camilli P.

The levels of specific phosphoinositide pools are regulated by intricate networks of enzymes and proteins that govern the rates of phosphoinositide synthesis, transport, and degradation (4Kearns B.G.

Given these findings, the characterization of proteins implicated in the metabolic turnover of phoshoinositides in mammalian cells has broad implications in biology and medicine. Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAC1 was originally isolated as a gene whose dysfunction suppresses specific mutations in the actin structural gene ACT1 (15Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAC1 was independently identified in a genetic screen for mutations that bypass the normally essential requirement for Sec14p, the major yeast phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, in protein transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface (16Cleves A.E.

In addition to these “bypass Sec14p” effects, other phenotypes also result from Sac1p insufficiencies in yeast.

Further interest in Sac1p has been fueled by the recent demonstration that regions of considerable homology to Sac1p (Sac1 domains) are present in a subfamily of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases, the synaptojanins. Synaptojanin 1, the first identified member of these enzymes, plays a critical role in regulation of a phosphoinositide pool involved in actin function and the recycling of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals (24McPherson P.S.

Furthermore, it has been found that yeast Sac1p and the Sac1 domains of yeast Inp52p (Sjl2p), Inp53p (Sjl3p), and human synaptojanin 1 have enzymatic activity. These proteins are phosphoinositide phosphatases that employ phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), PI(4)P, and PI(3,5)P2, but not PI(4,5)P2, as substrates (26Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M.

While yeast Sac1p has been analyzed in considerable detail, Sac1 proteins from other species have yet to be characterized. Herein we report the biochemical and functional properties of rat Sac1, the first Sac1 homologue to be defined in multicellular organisms. Sac1 domains from S. cerevisiae Sac1p, Inp51p, Inp52p, Inp53p, and Fig4p and rat synaptojanin 1 were aligned via the PILEUP algorithm and adjusted by visual inspection. The degenerate oligonucleotides 5′-G(G/C)(G/A/T/C)AA(T/C)TT(T/C)(G/A)(T/ A)(G/A/T/C)GA(G/A)AC(G/A/T/C)GA-3′ and 5′-G(G/C)(G/A/T/C)AA(T /C)TT(T/C)(G/A)(T/A)(G/A/T/C)GA(G/A)CA(G/A/T/C)GA-3′ were derived from the highly conserved motifs, (A/G)NF(V/N)ETE and NCLDCLD, respectively. These oligonucleotides were used as primers for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from rat brain total RNA essentially as described (28Nemoto Y. Arribas M. Haffner C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30817-30821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequence analysis identified a clone with the 480-base pair insert encoding a part of a protein highly homologous to budding yeast Sac1p. This DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe to screen a rat brain λ ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) following standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the chain termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar) by using double stranded plasmid DNA as template and the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Northern blot filter with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various adult rat tissues (rat multiple tissue Northern blot, CLONTECH) was probed for rat Sac1 by using the PCR-generated entire coding region. Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (31Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) was used as control for equal loading of poly(A)+ RNA (data not shown). To generate antibodies against rat Sac1, the coding sequence for the amino-terminal 54 amino acid residues was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocols and used to immunize rabbits. The antibodies were affinity purified using the fusion protein immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following standard procedures (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Homogenization and subcellular fractionation of rat liver was performed as described by Fleischer and Kervina (33Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 6-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Rat liver microsomes were isolated and fractionated following the discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation procedure described by Palade and co-workers (34Jin M. Saucan L. Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30105-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Materials from the interface between 0.25, 0.86 m and 0.86, 1.14 m sucrose were designated as Golgi light and Golgi heavy fractions, respectively. Fractions from 1.14, 1.18, and 1.24 m sucrose layers were defined as carrier vesicle fraction 1 and 2 (CV1 and CV2), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively. Alkali sodium carbonate extraction of microsomes was carried out as described previously (35Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding a 10-amino acid Myc epitope, EEQKLISEDL (36Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), was inserted next to the initiation codon of rat Sac1 cDNA by a PCR-mediated procedure as described previously (28Nemoto Y. Arribas M. Haffner C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30817-30821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal Myc-tagged cDNA was subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The plasmid for expression of NH2-terminal Myc-tagged Sac1 homology domain of rat Sac1 (amino acids 1–520) was constructed essentially in the same way. To express green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with the COOH terminus of rat Sac1 (amino acids 521–587), the region was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pEGFP C1 (CLONTECH). The region coding for the Sac1 homology domain of rat Sac1 (amino acids 1–520) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a modified pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) downstream of the coding sequence of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) (48Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). A recombinant virus was produced and amplified in Sf9 insect cells by the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. A high titer solution of the recombinant baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells at 106cells/ml. The cells were harvested after 72 h of incubation. The GST-Sac1 domain of rat Sac1 was purified from the lysed cells by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography. Minimal defined and complex media (YPD, supplemented with glucose to 2%, v/v) have been described (37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Two primers were generated for each mutation, each containing the desired mutation and designed to anneal to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid. Mutagenic primers used were as follows: for D391N, 5′-CGCAGCAACTGTATGAATTGTCTAGACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTAGACAATTCATACAGTTGCTGCG-3′; for A442V, 5′-CCTGGG CCGATAATGTTAATGCTTGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCACAAGCATTAACATTATCGGCCCAGG-3′; for R480H, 5′-GGCTTCAACTCATTATTACACTACTACAAGAACAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGTT CTTGTAGTAGTGTAATAATGAGTTGAAGCC-3′. Correctly mutagenized clones were confirmed by sequence analysis of the entire rat Sac1 cDNA and subcloned into a centromeric vector for constitutive PGKpromoter-driven expression in the appropriate yeast strains (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown overnight in selective minimal medium at 25 °C to anA 600 of 1.0. Spheroplasts were prepared as described (41Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42Cleves A.E. McGee T.P.

Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with periodic trituration every 5 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,000 × g. Alkaline extraction of the yeast cell lysates was described previously (19Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of protein for each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast strains were grown to mid-logarithmic growth phase in standard YPD medium at 25 °C, washed, and then shifted to low glucose (0.1%) YPD (to induce synthesis of secretory invertase) and 37 °C (to impose Sec14p deficiency in sec14-1 ts strains). After 2 h at 37 °C, 1-ml samples were removed from each culture, poisoned with sodium azide at a final concentration of 10 mm on ice. Cells were processed as described in detail elsewhere for invertase assays, and secretion indices calculated as described (43Salama S.R. Cleves A.E. Malehorn D.E. Whitters E.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4510-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments where bulk phospholipid species were identified and quantified in yeast, cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in inositol containing minimal medium and radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 20 min at 25 °C. Lipids were extracted and resolved by two-dimensional paper chromatography using previously described solvents (23Rivas M.P. Kearns B.G. Xie Z. Guo S. Sekar M.C. Hosaka K. Kagiwada S. York J.D.

Extracts derived from equal numbers of cells were loaded on each chromatogram, and specific32P-radiolabeled phospholipids were identified by autoradiography, excised, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting, or identified and quantified by phosphorimaging. Approximately 1 × 105 yeast cells were inoculated into 1-ml of SD medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids and containing 10–20 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabel Co., St. Louis, MO). Cells were grown to steady state at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with 3-ml of ice-cold water. Phosphoinositides were extracted by addition of 100 μl of 0.5n HCl, followed by 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and vortexing vigorously with glass beads for 2 min. For improvement of recovery, 200 μg of crude brain phosphoinositides (Sigma) were added as lipid carrier. Aqueous and organic phases were then generated by adding 300 μl each of chloroform and 1m KCl, and then separated by brief centrifugation. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with 400 μl of chloroform, and the organic phases were pooled and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were deacylated with methylamine as described (46Kirk C.J. Morris A.J. Shears S.B. Hutton J.C. Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, England1990: 151-158Google Scholar). Samples were re-dissolved in water, separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Partisphere SAX ion exchange column (4.6 × 125 mm; Whatman, Clifton, NJ), and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using the following gradient profile: buffer B: 0–10 min, 0% B; 10–55 min, 0–35% B, 55–70 min, 35–100% B; buffer B: 1.4m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.7. Radioactivity was measured using an on-line liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against protein-disulfide isomerase and calnexin were purchased fromStressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against type I InsP3 receptor was described by Takei et al. (47Takei K. Stukenbrok H. Metcalf A. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. Volpe P. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 489-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody against GM130 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), while mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10; American Type Culture Collection) was used for detection of Myc epitope. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce Biochemicals). Transfection of cells, immunostaining procedures, and other techniques and materials used are described elsewhere (23Rivas M.P. Kearns B.G. Xie Z. Guo S. Sekar M.C. Hosaka K. Kagiwada S. York J.D.

S. cerevisiae Sac1p represents a prototypical member of a growing family of Sac1-domain containing proteins. Sac1 homology domains have been identified in four other open reading frames in the budding yeast genome, and in mammalian inositol 5-phosphatases typified by synaptojanin (24McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 49Kearns B.G. McGee T.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Proteins of this family display the Sac1 homology domains at their amino termini, and these Sac1 homology domains typically share 24–32% amino acid identity with budding yeast Sac1p. In an attempt to identify a mammalian counterpart of Sac1p, we designed a set of oligonucleotide primers based on the conserved motifs in these Sac1 domains and isolated a partial cDNA fragment by reverse transcriptase-PCR from rat brain. Subsequent screening of a rat brain library identified a cDNA exhibiting an open reading frame of 1,764 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 587 amino acids (M r = 67,035). This protein, which we designate rat Sac1, shares 35% amino acid identity to S. cerevisiaeSac1p (Fig. 1 A). Data base searches reveal the presence, in diverse species, of proteins that are closely related to rat and budding yeast Sac1p. The widespread existence of such putative homologues suggests an evolutionary conservation of Sac1p function in cell physiology (Fig. 1 A). In support of this notion, all three amino acid residues presently known to be important for in vivo Sac1p function (49Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), are strongly conserved among all the putative Sac1 homologues from mammals, insects, nematodes, fungi, and plants. A distinguishing feature of yeast Sac1p with regard to other phosphoinositidases is that it represents an integral membrane protein with a single putative transmembrane domain that resides near the COOH terminus of the protein (16Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A similar situation applies to rat Sac1. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis identifies a stretch of 23 hydrophobic amino acid residues (Phe521 to Gly543) that likely constitutes a transmembrane segment near the rat Sac1 COOH terminus (Fig. 1 B). The presence of a putative COOH-terminal transmembrane segment is a structural feature shared by the other Sac1 homologues depicted in Fig. 1 A. Northern blot analyses of adult rat tissues demonstrate that rat Sac1 mRNA is expressed as a 4-kilobase transcr"

In yeast, the DNA damage checkpoint response is regulated by a series of genes that have mammalian homologs, including rad1, rad9, hus1, andrad17. On the basis of sequence homology, yeast and human Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 protein homologs are predicted to structurally resemble the sliding clamp PCNA. Likewise, Rad17 homologs have extensive homology with replication factor C (RFC) subunits (p36, p37, p38, p40, and p140), which form a clamp loader for PCNA. These observations predict that Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 might interact with Rad17 as a clamp-clamp loader pair during the DNA damage response. In this report, we demonstrate that endogenous human Rad17 (hRad17) interacts with the PCNA-related checkpoint proteins hRad1, hRad9, and hHus1. Mutational analysis of hRad1 and hRad17 demonstrates that this interaction has properties similar to the interaction between RFC and PCNA, a well characterized clamp-clamp loader pair. Moreover, we show that DNA damage affects the association of hRad17 with the clamp-like checkpoint proteins. Collectively, these data provide the first experimental evidence that hRad17 interacts with the PCNA-like proteins hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 in manner similar to the interaction between RFC and PCNA.

However, a highly conserved DXE motif from nucleases is poorly conserved among mammalian Rad1 homologs (22Dean F.B. Lian L. O'Donnell M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and purified hRad1 has been variably reported to have nuclease activity (19Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I.

Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, however, an alternative function for Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 has been postulated. All three proteins exhibit sequence and possible structural homology with the sliding clamp protein PCNA (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Thelen M.P. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Homotrimers of PCNA form a torodial structure that encircles DNA and tethers DNA polymerase δ to DNA during replication (reviewed in Refs.28Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J.

This homology raises the possibility that Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 may also form clamp-like structures that participate in the recognition or processing of damaged DNA. Consistent with this idea, Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 have all been shown to interact with one another in cell lysates (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Additionally, we have recently shown that hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 are converted to extraction-resistant nuclear foci following DNA damage (33Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Because clamp proteins encircle the DNA and are topologically linked with the DNA, they must be loaded onto the DNA by clamp loaders. The clamp loader for PCNA is replication factor C (RFC),1 a structure-specific heteropentameric complex (p36, p37, p38, p40, and p140) that recognizes primer-template junctions (28Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). RFC, which is only fully functional as a pentamer (34Cai J. Yao N. Gibbs E. Finkelstein J. Phillips B. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11607-11612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

If Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 also form clamps, a clamp loader would likewise be required to load them onto the DNA. One potential clamp loader is the checkpoint protein Rad17, which exhibits significant homology with all five RFC subunits (39Bluyssen H.A.R. Naus N.C. van Os R.I. Jaspers I. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. de Klein A. Genomics. 1999; 55: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Griffiths D.J.F. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M.

Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The homology appears related to function. TheS. cerevisiae homolog of Rad17 (scRad24) interacts with four of the five RFC subunits, forming a distinct multimeric structure in which Rad17 (scRad24) replaces the large RFC subunit in the complex (44Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Taken together, these observations suggest a tentative model in which a Rad17 clamp loader may interact with the Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 clamp-like proteins during recognition or processing of DNA damage. This model predicts that Rad17 should interact with Rad1, Hus1, or Rad9. To date, this model has been largely untested. Although an interaction between Rad1 and Rad17 homologs has been documented by yeast two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We now report that hRad17 does indeed interact with all three PCNA-like proteins, hRad1, hRad9, and hHus1, in cell lysates. Furthermore, by mutational analysis, we demonstrate that the interaction between hRad17 and hRad1 has biochemical features similar to the RFC-PCNA interaction. Finally, we show that DNA damage alters the interaction of hRad17 with hHus1, hRad1, and hRad9.DISCUSSIONThe checkpoint proteins Rad1, Hus1, Rad9, and Rad17 are required for early events in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint-signaling pathway (1Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Caspari T. Carr A.M.

Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Initially, there were few clues regarding their functions. Recently, however, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 have been predicted to be PCNA-like clamp proteins (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Thelen M.P. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and S. cerevisiae Rad17 (scRad24), which is homologous with RFC subunits, was found to interact with four of the five RFC subunits, suggesting that it may be a clamp loader (44Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation requires a clamp and a clamp loader. One prediction from this model is that the components of the clamp (Rad1) and clamp loader (Rad17) interact. Although several groups showed that Rad17 and Rad1 homologs interacted in yeast two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 43Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), initially, we and others could not demonstrate an interaction between endogenous Rad17 and Rad1 homologs (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that endogenous hRad17 and hRad1 interact, and we also show that hRad17 interacts with hRad9 and hHus1, two other PCNA-like checkpoint proteins. One possible organization for this complex is with hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 forming a clamp-like complex, with hRad1 linking an hRad1-hHus1-hRad9 complex to hRad17 (Fig.5). This idea is supported by the finding that yeast and human Rad17 interacts with Rad1 but not Rad9 or Hus1 in two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 43Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and by our present observation that the hRad1 M3 mutant disrupts the interaction with hRad17 but not hRad9 and hHus1.Additionally, our studies with mutant hRad17 and hRad1 suggest that the interactions between hRad17 and hRad1 may be similar to those between RFC and PCNA. First, mutations that disrupt the nucleotide-binding domain of hRad17 prevent interaction with hRad1 but not RFC p38, suggesting that nucleotide binding is important for stable association with hRad1. A similar requirement for nucleotide binding has been noted for RFC-PCNA interactions: in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, RFC interacted more tightly with PCNA (35Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, the hRad1 M3 mutation selectively disrupted interaction between hRad1 and hRad17. The analogous region in PCNA is also required for productive interactions between PCNA and RFC (48Zhang G. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that parallel regions of hRad1 and PCNA participate in interactions with clamp loaders.Several lines of investigation now suggest a provocative model regarding the roles of hRad1, hHus1, hRad9, and hRad17 in DNA damage-activated responses. In this model, an hRad17-containing clamp would recognize structural alterations induced by DNA damage (Fig. 5), much as classical RFC complexes recognize primer-template junctions. The hRad17-containing clamp loader would then load hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 clamps onto DNA, thus converting them from readily extractable nuclear proteins to extraction-resistant nuclear foci (33Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that even after DNA damage, hRad17 does not stably associate with nuclear elements, suggesting that hRad17 may interact only transiently with DNA. Once hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 are loaded onto DNA, they may then recruit proteins that participate in DNA processing or activation of the downstream checkpoint signaling machinery. In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells block cell cycle progression in a process commonly known as the DNA damage-induced checkpoint response. Studies in genetically tractable yeast model systems have identified a large number of genes, dubbed checkpoint genes, that are essential for DNA damage-inducible checkpoint activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Longhese M.P.

Epistasis and biochemical analyses in yeasts and humans have provisionally ordered the checkpoint proteins into a signaling pathway in which DNA damage relays activating signals through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases, which include spRad3, scMec1, ATR, and ATM. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases regulate activation of the serine-threonine protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (6Walworth N.C. Bernards R.

Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, however, an alternative function for Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 has been postulated. All three proteins exhibit sequence and possible structural homology with the sliding clamp protein PCNA (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Thelen M.P. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Homotrimers of PCNA form a torodial structure that encircles DNA and tethers DNA polymerase δ to DNA during replication (reviewed in Refs.28Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J.

This homology raises the possibility that Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 may also form clamp-like structures that participate in the recognition or processing of damaged DNA. Consistent with this idea, Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 have all been shown to interact with one another in cell lysates (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Additionally, we have recently shown that hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 are converted to extraction-resistant nuclear foci following DNA damage (33Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because clamp proteins encircle the DNA and are topologically linked with the DNA, they must be loaded onto the DNA by clamp loaders. The clamp loader for PCNA is replication factor C (RFC),1 a structure-specific heteropentameric complex (p36, p37, p38, p40, and p140) that recognizes primer-template junctions (28Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). RFC, which is only fully functional as a pentamer (34Cai J. Yao N. Gibbs E. Finkelstein J. Phillips B. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

If Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 also form clamps, a clamp loader would likewise be required to load them onto the DNA. One potential clamp loader is the checkpoint protein Rad17, which exhibits significant homology with all five RFC subunits (39Bluyssen H.A.R. Naus N.C. van Os R.I. Jaspers I.

TheS. cerevisiae homolog of Rad17 (scRad24) interacts with four of the five RFC subunits, forming a distinct multimeric structure in which Rad17 (scRad24) replaces the large RFC subunit in the complex (44Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest a tentative model in which a Rad17 clamp loader may interact with the Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 clamp-like proteins during recognition or processing of DNA damage. This model predicts that Rad17 should interact with Rad1, Hus1, or Rad9. To date, this model has been largely untested. Although an interaction between Rad1 and Rad17 homologs has been documented by yeast two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Furthermore, by mutational analysis, we demonstrate that the interaction between hRad17 and hRad1 has biochemical features similar to the RFC-PCNA interaction. Finally, we show that DNA damage alters the interaction of hRad17 with hHus1, hRad1, and hRad9. DISCUSSIONThe checkpoint proteins Rad1, Hus1, Rad9, and Rad17 are required for early events in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint-signaling pathway (1Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M.

Collectively, these observations suggest that DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation requires a clamp and a clamp loader. One prediction from this model is that the components of the clamp (Rad1) and clamp loader (Rad17) interact. Although several groups showed that Rad17 and Rad1 homologs interacted in yeast two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that endogenous hRad17 and hRad1 interact, and we also show that hRad17 interacts with hRad9 and hHus1, two other PCNA-like checkpoint proteins. One possible organization for this complex is with hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 forming a clamp-like complex, with hRad1 linking an hRad1-hHus1-hRad9 complex to hRad17 (Fig.5). This idea is supported by the finding that yeast and human Rad17 interacts with Rad1 but not Rad9 or Hus1 in two-hybrid analyses (26Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K.

First, mutations that disrupt the nucleotide-binding domain of hRad17 prevent interaction with hRad1 but not RFC p38, suggesting that nucleotide binding is important for stable association with hRad1. A similar requirement for nucleotide binding has been noted for RFC-PCNA interactions: in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, RFC interacted more tightly with PCNA (35Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, the hRad1 M3 mutation selectively disrupted interaction between hRad1 and hRad17. The analogous region in PCNA is also required for productive interactions between PCNA and RFC (48Zhang G. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that parallel regions of hRad1 and PCNA participate in interactions with clamp loaders.Several lines of investigation now suggest a provocative model regarding the roles of hRad1, hHus1, hRad9, and hRad17 in DNA damage-activated responses. In this model, an hRad17-containing clamp would recognize structural alterations induced by DNA damage (Fig. 5), much as classical RFC complexes recognize primer-template junctions. The hRad17-containing clamp loader would then load hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 clamps onto DNA, thus converting them from readily extractable nuclear proteins to extraction-resistant nuclear foci (33Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H.

However, the results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that even after DNA damage, hRad17 does not stably associate with nuclear elements, suggesting that hRad17 may interact only transiently with DNA. Once hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 are loaded onto DNA, they may then recruit proteins that participate in DNA processing or activation of the downstream checkpoint signaling machinery.

TWIK-2 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, and the immune system. Rat TWIK-2 currents are about 15 times larger than human TWIK-2 currents, but both exhibit outward rectification in a physiological K+gradient and mild inward rectification in symmetrical K+conditions. TWIK-2 currents are inactivating at depolarized potentials, and the kinetic of inactivation is highly temperature-sensitive. TWIK-2 shows an extremely low conductance, which prevents the visualization of discrete single channel events. The inactivation and rectification are intrinsic properties of TWIK-2 channels. In a physiological K+ gradient, TWIK-2 is half inhibited by 0.1 mmBa2+, quinine, and quinidine.

TREK-1 is highly expressed in temperature-sensitive neurons of the preoptic hypothalamus and dorsal root ganglions and moreover is activated by heat (21Maingret F. Lauritzen I. Patel A. Heurteaux C.

Finally, opening of TREK-1 has been proposed to be a key event in the neuroprotective effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids against the deleterious effects of brain ischemia and epilepsy (22Lauritzen I.

TASK subunits are background K+ channels that are inhibited by mild external acidosis (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

TASK-1 has been recently proposed to encode the background K+ channel present in motoneurons, cerebellum granular cells, and type I carotid body cells (24Buckler K. Williams B. Honoré E. J.

TWIK-1, the founding member of the 2P domain mammalian family, is widely expressed in human tissues and is particularly abundant in brain and heart (8Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). hTWIK-1 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes are K+-selective, are time-independent, and present a nearly linear I-V relationship that rectifies for depolarizations positive to 0 mV (8Lesage F.

TWIK-1 is blocked by Ba2+, quinine, and quinidine (8Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recently, hTWIK-2 (also called hTOSS), a TWIK-1-related gene, was cloned by two independent groups (1Chavez R.A. Gray A.T.

Although both hTWIK-2 and hTOSS sequences are identical, conflicting results were published concerning functional expression in heterologous systems (1Chavez R.A. Gray A.T. Zhao B.B. Kindler C.H.

On the contrary, no significant current was observed in hTOSS cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes or in hTOSS cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells (9Pountney D.J. Gulkarov I. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.

Co-injection of equimolar concentrations of hTWIK-1 and hTOSS cRNA also failed to generate currents in Xenopus oocytes (9Pountney D.J. Gulkarov I. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Holmes D. Saganich M. Rudy B.

These negative findings have led these authors and others to propose that hTOSS may be targeted to locations other than the plasma membrane or that it may possess a regulatory function, modulating the properties of other principal channel-forming subunits with tissue-specific implications (2Bang H.

We demonstrate that TWIK-2 encodes a low conductance inactivating K+ channel that is functionally distinct from that previously described for TWIK-1 (8Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Two partial expressed sequence tags were identified in the NCBI data base corresponding to hTWIK-2 (AA604914) and rTWIK-2 (AI454696). 5′ and 3′ RACE were used to identify the 5′- and 3′-ends of hTWIK-2 (human brain) and rTWIK-2 (rat heart) as described previously (28Waldmann R. Bassilana F. De Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Using the sequence obtained, oligonucleotides were designed to clone the genes in their entirety (hTWIK-2, accession number AF281302; rTWIK-2, accession number AF281304). The hTWIK-2 splice variant was isolated while screening a λ ZAP II human kidney library with a partial hTWIK-2 probe (accession number AF281303), whereas the rTWIK-2 splice variant was cloned by 5′-RACE (accession number AF281305). The coding sequences of hTWIK-2 and rTWIK-2 and their respective splice variants were cloned into pCI·IRES·CD8, a derivative of pCI (Promega), for expression in COS cells. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used as described previously to generate the following point mutations: cysteine 53 to serine in hTWIK-2 and rTWIK-2, leucine 217 to phenylalanine in hTWIK-2, tyrosine 109 to alanine in hTWIK-2 (19Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). All PCRs were performed using the Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were cloned into pCI·IRES·CD8. The clones obtained in this manner were sequenced in their entirety using an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against GST fusion proteins containing the M1P1 loop (amino acids 29–92) and the C-terminal region of TWIK-2 (amino acids 253–313) as described previously (12Reyes R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity-purified using the GST fusion proteins used for the immunization. Briefly, the crude antisera were preincubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 800 μg of GST protein previously transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a similar treatment with GST fusion protein strips. After four washes in PBS (0.1% Tween 20), the anti-TWIK-2 antibodies were recovered by a 1-min elution of each strip with 0.1 m glycine, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 2.8. After the elution, the purified antibodies were rapidly brought to pH 7.6 with 1 m Tris (pH 8.5). COS cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and harvested 48 h later. Cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped at 4 °C into PBS supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma catalog no. P8340) and 20 mm iodoacetamide. The cell suspension was homogenized with a cell disrupter (Vibra cell 72423, Bioblock Scientific) set at a potency of 5 watts. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. 5 μg of proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (with or without 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C-extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All incubations and washes were carried out in NETG (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.25% gelatin). The membranes were incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified antibodies (1:700) and washed with NETG. The binding of the primary antibodies was detected by adding goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:25,000) (Jackson) for 1 h at room temperature followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Pierce; Pierce) detection. N-Glycosidase treatment was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A multiple tissue expression array (MTE CLONTECH) was hybridized with a probe against the first 350 bp of hTWIK-2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was then exposed to a phosphor-imaging screen (Fuji) for 1 h. The signals obtained were quantified using TINA version 2.09 g for PC. Total RNA was isolated from various rat tissues using the SV total RNA kit (Promega). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 250 ng of random primers and SuperscriptII (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μl of each template was used for the PCR (final volume of 25 μl) using Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCRs for rTWIK-2 (oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): cggaattccaccatgcggcggggcgcgctc and acgcgtcgacctacctggggatggaggc) were carried out with an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 min and then 28 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. PCRs for actin (oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): ttgtaaccaactgggacgatatgg and gatcttgatcttcatggtgctagg) were carried out with an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 min and then 20 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. 5 μl of each reaction was then run out on a gel, transferred to nylon, and probed with an internal oligonucleotides (rTWIK-2 (5′-ccacaagcagcgcgccgagcg-3′) or rat actin (5′-tctacaatgagctgcgtgtg-3′)). The membrane was then exposed to a phosphor-imaging screen for 30 min and analyzed as described above. Signals were normalized to actin. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels (K1420-1, K1421-1, K1427-1) were purchased from CLONTECH and analyzed by PCR. PCRs for hTWIK-2 (oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): gctgcccccgccctggacgc and caccagaaagcagacggtca) and hspliceTWIK-2 (oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): caccatattggtcaggctag and caccagaaagcagacggtca) were carried out with 1 μl of cDNA template (K1420-1, K1421-1) and an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 min and then 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The cardiovascular panel (K1427–1) was screened as above except with 38 cycles. The control primers were CLONTECH's GAPDH amplimer set (5406-1). PCRs were carried out with an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 min and then 22 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. 5 μl of each reaction was then run out on a gel, transferred to nylon, and probed with an internal oligonucleotide (hTWIK-2 and splice, cagcagcatggtggtcggca; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, gccatcactgccacccagaagactg). All PCRs with the multiple tissue cDNA panels were carried out using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cell culture, transfection, and electrophysiology have been extensively described elsewhere (11Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat.

Briefly, COS cells were routinely transfected using the DEAE-dextran protocol with 1 μg of DNA/20,000 cells seeded in a 35-mm plate. Transfected cells were visualized with anti-CD8-coated beads. For whole cell experiments, the internal solution was 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.2 with KOH. In some experiments (regulation of TWIK-2 by second messengers), 5 mm ATP was included in the internal medium. The external medium contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 with NaOH. A K+-rich (155 mm) solution was made by substituting external NaCl with KCl. The same solutions were used for outside-out patch experiments. In certain experiments, internal Mg2+ was omitted. For cell-attached patch experiments, the bath contained the internal solution, and the pipette contained the external solution. Cells were continuously superfused with a microperfusion system during the time course of the experiments (0.3 ml/min). Temperature of the superfusing solution could be changed and monitored throughout the experiment using a homemade heating device (21Maingret F. Lauritzen I. Patel A. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2483-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed using Clampfit (Pclamp) and Biopatch (Biologic). Student's t test was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.01). A partial human expressed sequence tag (AA604914) was identified, and the full coding sequence was subsequently obtained from human brain using 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR. This gene encodes a 313-amino acid polypeptide 100% identical to the previously reported sequences of hTWIK-2 and hTOSS (1Chavez R.A. Gray A.T. Zhao B.B. Kindler C.H. Mazurek M.J. Mehta Y.

Saganich M. Rudy B. Artman M. Coetzee W.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified a partial rat expressed sequence tag (AI454696) coding for rTWIK-2. 5′- and 3′-RACE were used to clone rTWIK-2 in its entirety from rat heart. rTWIK-2 shares 84% identity with hTWIK-2. The greatest divergence between the homologues occurs in the COOH terminus (Fig.1). A TWIK-2 splice variant was cloned from both rat and human tissues. These splice variants encode proteins that initiate in transmembrane segment 2 (Fig. 1). Hybridization of a human multiple tissue expression array with a hTWIK-2 probe and PCR analysis of rat cDNA templates were used to examine the pattern of expression of TWIK-2 in various tissues (Fig.2). The highest expression of hTWIK-2 was found in placenta, esophagus, stomach, salivary gland, spleen, and aorta (Fig. 2 A). A substantial expression was also detected in lymph node, bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocytes, and thymus (Fig. 2 A). Rat TWIK-2 was abundant in aorta, kidney, spleen, stomach, lung, and pulmonary artery (Fig. 2 B). Rat blood vessels were denuded of endothelium, and colon and jejunum were free of epithelium, indicating an important expression of rTWIK-2 in smooth muscle. As observed in the human heart, rTWIK-2 is homogeneously expressed at lower levels in the septum, right ventricle, left ventricle, and atria, but almost absent in the brain (Fig. 2,A and B). We analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR the differential distribution of the full-length TWIK-2 and the splice variant in various human tissues. In most tissues tested, the full-length TWIK-2 and the splice variant had the same pattern of expression (not shown). However, in colon, fetal heart, atrium, and atrioventricular node, the splice variant was not significantly expressed, while the full-length form was abundant. hTWIK-2- and rTWIK-2-transfected COS cells were studied 48–72 h after transfection. Currents were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp, and I-V curves were constructed using voltage ramps (Fig. 3 C).I-V curves were outwardly rectifying in a physiological K+ gradient and reversed at −83.4 ± 2.1 mV (n = 76) and −89.0 ± 2.8 mV (n = 19) for hTWIK-2 and rTWIK-2, respectively (Fig. 3 C; see Fig.7 A). TWIK-2 currents were time-independent at negative potentials but showed a gradual slow inactivation at depolarized potentials (Fig. 3, A and B). In symmetrical K+ gradient, the reversal potential shifted toward 0 mV, and the I-V curve became mildly inwardly rectifying (Fig.3 C; see Fig. 7 A). hTWIK-2 reversal potential changed by 54 mV per decade, demonstrating K+ selectivity (Fig. 3 C, inset). The difference between mock- and hTWIK-2-transfected cells was only significant (p< 0.01) at hyperpolarized potentials in a symmetrical K+gradient (Fig. 3 D). The major difference between hTWIK-2 and rTWIK-2 was the significantly higher current density (about 15-fold) obtained with rTWIK-2 (p < 0.001) (Fig.3 D). hTWIK-2 and rTWIK-2 splice variant-expressing cells were not significantly different from mock-transfected cells (Fig.3 D). Co-expression of rTWIK-2 with hTWIK-1 (n = 14) or KCNK7 (n = 6) did not alter channel properties and current density (not shown).Figure 7Pharmacology of rTWIK-2. A, whole cell recording of rTWIK-2 recorded in physiological K+ conditions (NaCl) and in symmetrical K+conditions (KCl). The addition of 1 mm Ba2+ in physiological K+ conditions blocked rTWIK-2 currents at both negative and positive potentials. In symmetrical K+conditions, rTWIK-2 was resistant to 10 mmBa2+. The holding potential was −80 mV, and the cell was stimulated with voltage ramps of 800 ms in duration every 20 s.B, histogram showing the dose-dependent inhibition of rTWIK-2 by Ba2+ in a physiological (NaCl) and a symmetrical K+ gradient (KCl) at 100 mV.

Substituting leucine 217 with a phenylalanine in hTWIK-2 had no significant effect on current density (−13.2 ± 4.4 pA/pF in symmetrical K+ at −130 mV and 8.8 ± 1.9 pA/pF in physiological K+ at 100 mV, n = 14), on the reversal potential (−84.0 ± 2.9 mV, n = 14) or on current kinetics. On the contrary, substitution of tyrosine 109 with an alanine in the first pore domain killed channel activity (−1.5 ± 0.7 pA/pF in symmetrical K+ at −130 mV and 2.7 ± 0.4 pA/pF in physiological K+ at 100 mV, n= 13). The inactivation of rTWIK-2 was studied using a standard double voltage pulse protocol (Fig. 4 A). rTWIK-2 currents recorded during the conditioning prepotential showed a gradual inactivation upon depolarization. Inactivation became evident at potentials above −30 mV (Fig. 4 B). At room temperature, the time constant of inactivation was 1935 ± 159 ms (at 70 mV,n = 7) and remained constant at all potentials studied (Fig. 4 C, inset). The current amplitude elicited during the test pulse at 100 mV was gradually decreased with depolarizing preconditioning voltage pulses (Fig. 4, A andC). A steady-state inactivation curve was constructed and indicates that rTWIK-2 was inactivated over the whole voltage range with half-inactivation at +65 mV (Fig. 4 C). Finally, the inactivation rate of rTWIK-2 at depolarized potential was largely impaired when currents were recorded in symmetrical K+conditions (n = 6; Fig. 4 D). Similar inactivation properties were observed for hTWIK-2 (Fig.3 A). The inactivation of rTWIK-2 was highly temperature-sensitive (Fig.5). At physiological temperature, the outward current inactivated with a time constant of 218 ± 42 ms (at 0 mV, n = 15) (Fig. 5, A, B, and D). Moreover, the steady-state outward current became inwardly rectifying at 37 °C (Fig. 5, B andC). The effect of temperature on both current kinetics and rectification occurred within seconds and was fully reversible on returning to room temperature (Fig. 5 A). The inward current recorded during hyperpolarization remained time-independent at physiological temperature (Fig. 5 B). Inactivation was only partial, and a steady outward current was still present at 37 °C (Fig. 5, A and D). Recovery from inactivation at 37 °C occurred within 200 ms (n = 3) (Fig.5 D). Outside-out patches were excised from COS cells expressing rTWIK-2. The pipette solution was Mg2+- and Ca2+-free. Under these conditions, we observed currents that displayed the same kinetic and rectification characteristics as the macroscopic currents (Fig.6, A and C). The example illustrated in Fig. 6 A shows a patch with a high level of channel expression. The I-V curve recorded in a physiological K+ gradient was outwardly rectifying and became mildly inwardly rectifyin"

We recently identified neuromedin U as the cognate ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-3. In this study, we isolated cDNA coding for a novel G protein-coupled receptor, TGR-1, which was highly homologous with FM-3. We found that neuromedin U specifically and clearly elevated the extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite release, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR-1. Radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound with high affinity to membrane fractions prepared from these cells. These results show that TGR-1, like FM-3, is a specific and functional receptor for neuromedin U. We analyzed TGR-1 mRNA tissue distribution in rats using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found it to considerably differ from that of FM-3 mRNA. TGR-1 mRNA was primarily expressed in the uterus, suggesting that TGR-1 mediates the contractile activity of neuromedin U in this tissue.

When FM-3 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, neuromedin U induced specific and clear elevation of extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite (AA) release, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound with high affinity to membrane fractions prepared from these cells. Our analyses for FM-3 mRNA expression levels using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that FM-3 mRNA was expressed highly in the small intestine and lung of rats, but only very low levels were detected in the uterus. Nonetheless neuromedin U has reportedly shown very strong contractile activity (1Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H.

Peptides. 1999; 20: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We considered that this discrepancy might be due to the existence of an unknown receptor subtype for neuromedin U in the rat uterus. We therefore searched for another neuromedin U receptor subtype in addition to FM-3. In this paper, we report on the isolation of human and rat cDNA encoding a novel GPCR, TGR-1, which has significant homology with FM-3. We found that, like FM-3, TGR-1 functioned as a specific receptor for neuromedin U. Our analyses for TGR-1 mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR in rat tissues demonstrated that it was extensively expressed in the uterus. Two regions with high sequence similarity to FM-3 were identified in the GenBankTM genomic DNA data base between base pairs 204,900 and 205,550 and between base pairs 138,706 and 138,828 in a single human genomic DNA sequence (accession number AC008571). The deduced amino acid sequences of both regions were found to have 56% identity with corresponding FM-3 amino acid sequences. A cDNA fragment encompassing these sequences was isolated from a human testis cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) by PCR using the specific primers 5′-CGCCCACCAACTACTACCTCT-3′ and 5′-ACAAAGCTGAAGAAGAGTCGG-3′. The resultant PCR product of about 700 base pairs contained the two expected regions plus an unknown 126-base pair sequence between them, corresponding to the coding region spanning transmembrane domains 2–6. Both ends of this DNA fragment were further extended using human brain and testis Marathon ready cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedures with adapter primers provided with the cDNA libraries in addition to the following specific primers: 5′-ACAAAGCTGAAGAAGAGTCGG-3′ and 5′-CGCCCACCAACTACTACCTCT-3′ for the first PCR and 5′-ATGGGCTTGATGACCGTACAG-3′ and 5′-TGTGGCGCAACTACCCTTTCT-3′ for the nested PCR. The GPCR encoded by the human cDNA thus obtained was designated as TGR-1. Rat TGR-1 cDNA was isolated from rat uterine poly(A)+ RNA. For PCR, we designed primers (i.e.5′-GCTATGAAGACGCCCACCAACTACTA-3′ and 5′-CACCACATGGACGAGGTTGAACACAGC-3′) and prepared a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 μmof each primer, a template cDNA synthesized from rat uterine poly(A)+ RNA, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 1.25 unit of KlenTaq DNA polymerase (CLONTECH), and 2.5 μl of the buffer provided by the manufacturer. PCR was conducted at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 38 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, at 64 °C for 20 s, and at 72 °C for 20 s. Based on the partial rat cDNA sequence obtained, we synthesized different primers and then isolated cDNA fragments covering a fully coded region by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using these primers and a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit. We isolated rat TGR-1 cDNA with a fully coded region from rat uterine cDNA synthesized with a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) by PCR using the specific primers 5′-CTGATGCTATCCTTTCACTCTCTCAGACC-3′ and 5′-TCCTTGCAGTTTTGGCACATAGATGGA-3′. The entire region encoding human TGR-1 (corresponding to positions 1–1245 in the nucleotide sequence deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMdata base under accession number AB041228) was inserted downstream from an SRα promoter in the expression vector, pAKKO-111H (13Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resultant expression vector plasmid was transfected intodhfr − CHO cells, and transformeddhfr + CHO cells (CHO-hTGR-1) were selected as described elsewhere (13Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Porcine neuromedin U-8 and U-25 and rat U-23 were purchased from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Human U-25 was synthesized by Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Other peptides were purchased commercially. AA release assays were conducted as described elsewhere (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J.

Ca2+mobilization assays using CHO-hTGR-1 cells and mock-transfected CHO cells were conducted as described elsewhere (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H.

Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations induced by neuromedin U were measured with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR; Molecular Devices Corp.). Preparation of125I-labeled porcine U-8 and membrane fractions, and receptor-binding assays were conducted as described elsewhere (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S.

The labeled ligand (concentration 100 pm) and membrane fractions prepared from CHO-hTGR-1 cells were mixed and then incubated in 100 μl of the binding buffer at room temperature for 1.5 h. To determine the amount of nonspecific binding, a separate mixture was also prepared with the addition of unlabeled porcine U-8 (concentration 1 μm) and incubated under the same conditions. After incubation, bound and free radioactivities were separated, and the amount of bound ligand was counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from different tissues of 8–12-week-old Wistar rats, and cDNAs were synthesized as described elsewhere (14Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Sekiguchi M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Regul. Pept. 1999; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs of the placenta and mammary gland were prepared from female rats 17 days pregnant. We quantified rat TGR-1 mRNAs using a Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Biosystems) with a primer set (i.e.5′-ATCCATGTGGTATCAGGTGTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-CGCCGAGACAGGAGGTTATAGA-3′) and a fluorescence-labeled probe, 5′-FAM-TATCTGAGCTCCGCGGTCAACCCC-TAMRA-3′. For PCR, a 25-μl reaction mixture containing a cDNA solution synthesized from 4 ng of poly(A)+ RNA, a 0.2 μmconcentration of each primer, and 0.1 μm probe was prepared with a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems). PCR was conducted at 50 °C for 10 min in order for the reaction of uracil-N-glycosylase to prevent amplification of carried over PCR products and then at 95 °C for 15 min to activate AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase and finally for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 60 s for amplification. To obtain calibration curves, we amplified the known amounts of rat TGR-1 cDNA fragments in the same manner as the samples. Good linear relationships were obtained between the amount of rat TGR-1 cDNA introduced and the release of reporter dye within 1–106copies. As an internal control, rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was also measured using Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents (PE Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In most tissues, the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was 0.7 × 105 to 1.3 × 106 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, except in the skeletal muscle (4.6 × 106 copies/ng poly(A)+ RNA)) and costal cartilage (2.2 × 106 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). In our data base search, we found human DNA sequences that coded for a novel GPCR. Based on sequence information, we designed primers for PCR, and then from human brain and testis we isolated cDNA encoding a GPCR, which we designated as TGR-1. The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by TGR-1 had an amino acid length of 413 (Fig.1). In comparing amino acid sequence, human TGR-1 shared 52% identity overall with human FM-3. We subsequently isolated rat TGR-1 cDNA from rat uterus, which encoded an open reading frame with a 395-amino acid length and showed 78% amino acid sequence identity with human TGR-1 (Fig. 1). The positions of supposed initiator methionine in human and rat TGR-1 cDNAs were determined based on analyses for optimal nucleic acid sequences for translation (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar) and comparison of conserved amino acid sequences between humans and rats. Since TGR-1 has considerable homology with FM-3, we studied the effect of porcine neuromedin U-8 on CHO-hTGR-1 cells by microphysiometric assay and found that it induced a specific, dose-dependent promotion of the extracellular acidification rates in these cells (data not shown). We investigated what cellular changes were induced in CHO-hTGR-1 cells by neuromedin U. As with CHO cells expressing FM-3, CHO-hTGR-1 cells showed specific, dose-dependent AA release when neuromedin U was added (Fig.2). In the AA release assays, rat U-23 and porcine U-25 and U-8 were almost equally potent. Their median effective concentration (EC50) was 1.4–2.0 × 10−9m. However, that of human U-25 was seen to be slightly lower (4.0 × 10−9m). To confirm the specific interaction of TGR-1 and neuromedin U, we applied human ghrelin, motilin, NT, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) at 10−7m, but these did not cause obvious AA release in CHO-hTGR-1 cells. Since extracellular AA release is caused by the activation of phospholipase A2, which is closely linked to Ca2+ influx, we studied changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of CHO-hTGR-1 cells by FLIPR assay. We found that porcine U-8 induced rapid, evident mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ at doses of 10−7 and 10−8m. Porcine U-8 did not induce Ca2+ mobilization even at 10−7m in mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3). We examined the effect of neuromedin U on intracellular cAMP levels of CHO-hTGR-1 cells and found that neuromedin U partially inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production dose-dependently (data not shown).Figure 3Neuromedin U-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in CHO-hTGR-1 cells. CHO-hTGR-1 cells and mock-transfected CHO cells were cultured in black-walled 96-well plates overnight. The cells were loaded with Fluo 3-AM, following which fluorescent change was measured by FLIPR. Porcine U-8 was added to the cells after 10 s. Concentrations of porcine U-8 used were 10−7m (○) and 10−8m (▴) for CHO-hTGR-1 cells and 10−7m (■) for the mock-transfected CHO cells.

Scatchard analysis showed that CHO-hTGR-1 cells expressed a single class of high affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled porcine U-8 (Fig.4). The dissociation constant (Kd) was 2.2 × 10−11m, and the number of maximal binding sites (Bmax) was 6.8 pmol mg−1 protein. In the competitive binding assay, human, porcine, and rat neuromedin U were found to inhibit this binding dose-dependently (Fig.5). Porcine U-25 was the most potent, with a median inhibition concentration (IC50) of 2.2 × 10−10m. IC50values of rat U-23 and porcine U-8 were both 3.5 × 10−10m. Human U-25 was the least potent, with an IC50 of 6.2 × 10−10m. Human ghrelin showed slight inhibition at 10−7m, but motilin, NT, and PP displayed no obvious inhibitory activity.Figure 5Competitive inhibition assay for125I-labeled porcine U-8 binding to TGR-1.

Binding assays were also conducted in the presence of human ghrelin (●), motilin (▵), NT (▪), and PP (⋄) at 10−7m.

The highest level of TGR-1 mRNA was detected in the uterus (25 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA) (Fig.6). In the central nervous system, high expression levels were found in the hypothalamus and moderate levels in both the medulla oblongata and spinal cord (2.6, 0.7, and 1.5 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, respectively). Expression was low in the gastrointestinal tract. In other peripheral tissues, moderate expression was observed in the lung and ovary (0.6 and 1.1 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, respectively). We isolated TGR-1 as a novel GPCR showing considerable homology with FM-3, which has been recently shown to be the cognate receptor for neuromedin U (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y.

Neuromedin U showed a potent agonistic activity to CHO cells expressing human TGR-1 and specifically bound with high affinity to their membrane fractions at a Kd of 22 pm. Our data clearly show that TGR-1 is a subtype of neuromedin U receptors. Since neuromedin U caused Ca2+influx and AA release in CHO-hTGR-1 cells, TGR-1 is considered to couple to Gq in the signal transduction pathway similar to FM-3. Since slight inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was also detected in CHO-hTGR-1 cells treated with neuromedin U, TGR-1 may couple not only to Gq but also to Gi in CHO cells. Since it was first purified from the porcine spinal cord (1Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Peptides. 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), neuromedin U has been isolated from a number of species (11Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In comparing neuromedin U peptides derived from different species, the C-terminal five amino acid residues were found to be totally conserved, suggesting that this region is of major importance. It has also been reported that amidation of the C-terminal Asn is necessary for neuromedin U to exhibit biological activities (1Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the C-terminal region is vital for neuromedin U to interact with its receptor. TGR-1 shows significant homology with FM-3, which is reported to resemble NT and growth hormone secretagogue receptors (16Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NT and ghrelin show slight sequence homology with neuromedin U overall but do not show significant homology at their C termini (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S.

In our competitive binding experiment, ghrelin showed slight but significant inhibition on 125I-labeled neuromedin U-8 binding to TGR-1 at 10−7m, although it did not show agonistic activity on TGR-1. Our results suggest that these ligands and receptors are closely related both structurally and functionally.

Pharmacol. 1988; 155: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that neuromedin U exerts influence as a neuropeptide or neuromodulator rather than as a circulating hormone, because its levels in plasma are fairly low (17Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Peptides. 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that the reported action of neuromedin U on the gastrointestinal tract is primarily mediated by FM-3. In contrast, the expression of FM-3 mRNA was found to be low in the rat uterus (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21068-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this paper, we found an extremely high level of TGR-1 mRNA expressed in the rat uterus. This is consistent with reports that, in uterine tissue, neuromedin U shows strong contractile activity (1Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Peptides. 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and numerous binding sites for neuromedin U are detected (11Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Jamal H. Akinsanya K.O. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, we found TGR-1 mRNA expression levels to be lower in the gastrointestinal tract. Considering these results together, the reported action of neuromedin U on uterine tissue would appear to be primarily mediated by TGR-1. It has been reported that both neuromedin U mRNA and neuromedin U-like immunoreactivity are abundantly detected in the human and rat pituitary gland (17Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Peptides. 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Steel J.H. Van Noorden S. Ballesta J. Gibson S.J. Ghatei M.A. Burrin J. Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M.

It may be that neuromedin U is originally secreted from the pituitary and thereby put into circulation. However, further investigation is necessary to clarify the pathway of neuromedin U's action on the uterus. Significant expression of TGR-1 mRNA was detected in the central nervous tissues (i.e. hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord), the lung, and the ovary, suggesting that TGR-1 plays important roles here. In the rat brain, neuromedin U-positive nerve fibers have been observed in the hypothalamic paraventicular and supraoptic nuclei (19Ballesta J. Carlei F. Bishop A.E. Steel J.H. Gibson S.J. Fahey M.

Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The subcutaneous administration of neuromedin U into rats has been shown to increase plasma adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone concentrations (26Malendowicz L.K. Nussdorfer G.G. Markowska A. Tortorella C. Nowak M. Warchol J.B. Neuropeptides. 1994; 26: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These facts suggest the involvement of neuromedin U in the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. We have detected only low levels of FM-3 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal gland (10Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21068-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, in the present investigation, a relatively high level of TGR-1 mRNA expression was found in the rat hypothalamus, suggesting that neuromedin U functions in the hypothalamus via TGR-1. Our results suggest that TGR-1 and FM-3 possess different distributions and functions among tissues in vivo. The discovery of neuromedin U receptor subtypes provides valuable insight into the physiological roles of neuromedin U and the identification of neuromedin U receptor agonists and antagonists.

The delineation of the mammalian Ras/MAP1 kinase pathway had its roots in these systems. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-initiated signaling plays key roles in the developmental process of mammals,Drosophila, and C. elegans. InDrosophila, the mutation of the RTK sevenlesscauses R7 cells to fail to differentiate into photoreceptor cells, and instead they become lens-secreting cone cells in the eye ommatidia (1Tomlinson A. Bowtell D.D. Hafen E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 143-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In screening for an allele-specific suppressor of thesevenless phenotype, son of sevenless was isolated (2Rogge R.D. Karlovich C.A. Banerjee U. Cell. 1991; 64: 39-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Similarly, analysis of mutant phenotypes ofDrosophila eye ommatidia resulted in the identification of the adaptor protein Drk (Sem-5 in C. elegans/Grb2 in mammals) (3Simon M.A. Dodson G.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 169-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It became clear that son of sevenless is linked to RTKs by the adaptor Grb2 and acts downstream of various RTKs as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The discovery of Raf, a target protein for active Ras, also came about following similar genetic studies (4Dickson B. Sprenger F. Morrison D. Hafen E. Nature. 1992; 360: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The activation of the serine kinase Raf leads to the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP kinase kinase), which in turn activates MAP kinase (Erk) by phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine. Collectively, these studies allowed the first delineation of a signaling pathway from receptor activation to gene expression and highlighted the value of screening for signal transduction mutants in systems suitable for genetic analysis and extrapolating these findings into mammalian signaling systems. In Drosophila, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors are expressed as the products of two different gene products,breathless (Btl) (5Glazer L. Shilo B.Z. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and heartless (Htl) (6Beiman M. Shilo B.Z. Volk T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the former involved in the formation of the tracheal system and the latter involved in the formation of the vascular system. Thebranchless (bnl) gene, encoding an FGF-like protein, is expressed in discrete clusters of cells surrounding developing tracheal placodes, exactly where a new branch will form. The clusters of epithelial cells that form tracheal sacs failed to migrate and elongate to develop the respiratory network in mutants of FGF (branchless) (7Sutherland D. Samakovlis C. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1091-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), FGF receptor (breathless) (6Beiman M. Shilo B.Z. Volk T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and Downstream of FGF receptor (8Vincent S. Wilson R. Coelho C. Affolter M. Leptin M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Contrary to these observations,sprouty mutations cause excessive branching (9Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), suggesting that Sprouty is an inhibitor of FGF signaling. Casci et al. (10Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) later reported that Sprouty is also involved in the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-triggered cell recruitment in the eye of Drosophila. It was postulated that in both the EGF receptor and FGF receptor signaling pathways, Sprouty was a negative regulator of growth factor-induced Ras/MAP kinase pathways. Two different mechanisms were proposed to account for this inhibition. The first suggested that Sprouty was secreted and competes for the receptor with growth factors (9Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), whereas the other proposed that Sprouty inhibits a pathway upstream of Ras and is itself associated with the inner surface of plasma membrane (10Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Expression ofDrosophila Sprouty (dSpry) was detected in a wide range of developmental tissues such as eye imaginal discs, embryonic chordotonal organ precursors, and the midline glia (11Kramer S. Okabe M. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Hiromi Y. Development. 1999; 126: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus indicated it to be a general inhibitor of RTK signaling (12Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, genetic evidence was presented that in mammalian development Sprouty also inhibited the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, but the inhibition occurred downstream of Ras at the level of Raf or MAP kinase kinase (12Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, three mammalian homologs of dSpry were found. The murine Sprouty2 (mSpry2) negatively modulates respiratory organogenesis (13Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) suggesting some similarity to the Drosophila tracheal development system. Moreover, Sprouty overexpression caused a reduction in FGF induced limb bud outgrowth (14Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment of the mammalian Sprouty isotypes with the Drosophila protein reveals that the only conserved part is the C-terminal cysteine-rich region. It was the C-terminal half ofDrosophila Sprouty that apparently directed the protein to a membrane location, whereas the N-terminal part of the protein interacted with Gap1 and Drk (10Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We have been characterizing novel proteins that act proximal to the FGF receptor. Such proteins include FRS2, a necessary component of the MAP kinase signaling system. Because Sprouty was postulated to inhibit the Map kinase pathway in the vicinity of Ras, we were interested to know what the functions of the mammalian homologues of Sprouty are. The emphases in this initial phase of research were to investigate the intracellular location of human Sprouty2 (hSpry2) and to observe the effect of stimulation of cells with either FGF or EGF on the protein disposition. COS-1 monkey kidney cells or 293T human kidney epithelial cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/ml glucose) or RPMI medium, respectively. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in six-well plates containing glass coverslips for immunofluorescence studies or in 60-mm culture dishes for Western analyses. Cells at 80% confluency were transfected with various expression plasmids using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Four to six hours later, the transfection medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 10% serum-containing medium for 24 h. The cells were then washed and maintained in serum-free medium overnight. Before being fixed or lysed, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) for different time points. Various chemicals were added to media at the following concentrations: nocodazole, 10 μg/ml; cytochalasin A, 1 μg/ml; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 1 μm; and wortmannin, 50 or 100 nm. All of the above chemicals were from Sigma. In the EGF washout experiment, cells were washed with serum-free medium three times following 10 min of EGF stimulation. The cells were then reincubated in fresh, serum-free medium at 37 °C for an additional 30 or 60 min before being processed for immunofluorescence. Full-length cDNA of hSpry2 was cloned from an adult brain library (CLONTECH) using the Expand Long Template polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with primers designed against the published sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF039843). The hSpry2 cDNA was subcloned into the pXJ40FLAG mammalian expression vector (obtained from Dr. E. Manser, Glaxo Group Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore) utilizingBamHI/XhoI restriction sites. Arbitrary deletion mutants Δ53–122, Δ123–177, Δ178–194, Δ195–221, and Δ265–282, and DNA fragments of the N terminus () and C terminus (178–315, 178–282, 178–264, 178–250, 178–237, 178–229, and 178–225) of hSpry2 were generated by standard polymerase chain reaction procedures. Mouse Sprouty1, mouse Sprouty4, andDrosophila Sprouty (provided by Dr. M. Krasnow, Stanford University School of Medicine, and Dr. G. Martin, University of California, San Francisco) were subcloned into pXJ40FLAG. The cDNAs of Rac1 (provided by Dr. A. Hall, University College, London, United Kingdom) and Akt (a kind gift from Dr. P. Cohen, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom) were inserted into vector pXJ40HA (Dr. E. Manser, Glaxo-Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). Dominant negative mutant Rac1 (N17) was produced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quik-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PKCβII in pcDNA3 was obtained from Dr. X-M. Cao (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing or restriction digestion analyses. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were seeded onto sterilized glass coverslips contained in six-well plates. Quiescent COS-1 cells that were transfected with FLAG-tagged hSpry2 were either left untreated or treated with EGF (50 ng/ml). Subsequently, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10 mm calcium chloride and 10 mm magnesium chloride (PBSCM) and fixed with cold 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM for 30 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBSCM, twice with PBSCM containing 50 mmNH4Cl, and twice again with PBSCM. For cell permeabilization, cells on the coverslips were incubated with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) in PBSCM at room temperature for 15 min. The primary antibody for single labeling (anti-Flag M2® monoclonal antibody, Sigma) was diluted to 1 μg/100 μl in FDB (7% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBSCM), and each coverslip was incubated with 100 μl of diluted antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslip was then washed three times for 2 min in 0.1% saponin-containing PBSCM before incubation with secondary antibodies. For monoclonal primary antibody Texas Red® dye-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After the final wash (five times in 0.1% saponin containing PBSCM), each coverslip was prepared for microscopic examination by applying mounting medium (Crystal Mount, Biomeda). For double staining, FLAG-tagged hSpry2 was detected with polyclonal anti-Flag (OctA-Probe™, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Microtubules and intermediate-filaments were visualized with anti-β-tubulin and anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody, respectively, whereas filamentous actin was labeled by Texas Red® Isothiocyanate-Canjugated-labeled phalloidin (all reagents from Sigma). Hemagglutinin-tagged Rac1 (wild type and dominant negative) and Akt were detected using hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ezrin and PKCβII were detected by probing with the respective monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Confocal fluorescence microscopy of fixed and immunostained cells was performed at room temperature using a MRC-1024 laser scanner (Bio-Rad). All microscopic images were captured with a × 40 objective lens. Fluorescent images were processed with LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe System, Inc.). Digital manipulation of images was done using Microsoft PowerPoint software (Microsoft 1997 version). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the previously described antibodies, anti-phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs), or anti-Akt (New England BioLabs). The Western blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The C-terminal sequences of Sprouty isotypes, hSpry2 (AF039843), mSpry1 (AF176903.1), hSpry2, mSpry4 (AF176906.1), and Drosophila Spry (AF039842.1) were aligned using the Clustal method by DNASTAR. FLAG-tagged hSpry2 was overexpressed in COS-1 cells, and the distribution of the expressed protein was assessed by immunofluorescence with FLAG monoclonal antibody and confocal microscopy. Cells were serum-deprived for 18 h prior to various times of EGF stimulation. Prior to immunofluorescence studies, experiments were conducted to check that hSpry2 was present at similar levels in the different lysates and that the protein did not exhibit unexpected molecular weight changes (e.g. proteolysis) following EGF stimulation. To this end, whole cells lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with PY20 to locate tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptors to demonstrate EGF induced activation (Fig. 1 A, top panel) or with α-FLAG to locate and determine the integrity of FLAG-tagged hSpry2 (bottom panel). The hSpry2 protein did not change from its expected molecular weight upon EGF treatment. It was apparent in this and later experiments, though, that full-length or various protein fragments of hSpry2 often appear as double bands on Western blots, whether the cells were stimulated or not. The results from immunofluorescence experiments showed that in the unstimulated cells, hSpry2 was distributed along elements of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Upon EGF stimulation, a high proportion of the overexpressed hSpry2 rapidly (within 2 min) translocated to the cell periphery, more specifically to a wavy structure that resembled membrane ruffles (Fig. 1 B, right panel, which shows the 10-min time point). Control experiments, using overexpressed FLAG-tagged Annexin II, showed that EGF-induced translocation of hSpry2 was not a spurious effect of overexpression as Annexin II did not translocate upon stimulation of cells with EGF (data not shown). To confirm the subcellular distribution of hSpry2, co-staining of hSpry2 with each of the major cytoskeletal structural proteins tubulin, vimentin, and actin was performed. In unstimulated cells, the disposition of hSpry2 most closely resembled that of tubulin, as can be seen by a comparison of tubulin staining (Fig. 1 C, top panels) with hSpry2 staining (Fig. 1 C, middle panels) and a subsequently overlay of the two images (Fig. 1 C, bottom panels). In support of the evidence that hSpry2 co-localized with tubulin, we noted that pretreating the cells with nocodazole (10 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C), a well characterized chaotropic agent for microtubules, disrupted both the microtubule and the hSpry2 protein disposition (data not shown). In contrast, hSpry2 colocalized only partially with vimentin (one of the components of intermediate filaments) at the periphery of nuclei (data not shown), whereas it showed a staining pattern completely different from that of actin (microfilaments) in unstimulated cells (see Fig. 1 D). Actin and ezrin are two proteins shown to be present in membrane ruffles (reviewed in Ref. 15Ridley A.J. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To verify that hSpry2 translocated to membrane ruffles when cells were stimulated with EGF, co-staining of hSpry2 with actin or ezrin was performed on EGF-treated cells. It is apparent from the immunofluorescence images of actin staining shown in Fig. 1 D (top panels) that actin was in the same cell peripheral location as hSpry2 in EGF stimulated cells (Fig.1 D, middle panel), and this is further indicated by overlaying these images (Fig. 1 D, bottom panel). Likewise, ezrin (Fig. 1 E, top panel) is located in similar membrane peripheral structures as hSpry2 (Fig. 1 E, middle panel), as is also seen by overlaying the two images (Fig. 1 E, bottom panel). The formation of membrane ruffles is dependent on the activation of the small G-protein Rac1 (16Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). To further confirm that hSpry2 is localized to membrane ruffles in EGF-stimulated cells, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged hSpry2 and hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative Rac1 (N17). No formation of ruffles and no translocation of hSpry2 was observed in the cells when both constructs were co-expressed, indicating that hSpry2 translocated into newly formed Rac-dependent ruffles (data not shown). From the collective evidence, we concluded that hSpry2 is associated with microtubules in quiescent cells, and it rapidly translocated to membrane ruffles when cells were stimulated with EGF. We also observed a similar but less profound translocation of hSpry2 with FGF stimulation in COS-1 cells. hSpry2 translocation was not cell-specific, as we also showed that the protein translocated to membrane ruffles in 293T cells when these cells were similarly transfected and stimulated with EGF or FGF (data not shown). The rapid translocation of the hSpry2 protein upon stimulation of cells with EGF is reminiscent of the rapid membrane translocation of various signaling proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. PH domains target to membrane lipids containing products of PI-3 kinase, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (17Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar stimulation-directed translocation has also been observed with proteins containing the FYVE domain, which also targets products of PI-3 kinase-activated catalysis (18Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9129-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We asked whether full-length or C-terminal hSpry2 was targeted to similar lipid products in EGF stimulated cells. To investigate this possibility, COS-1 cells were transfected either with full-length hSpry2 or with Akt, which contains a PH domain, to compare their respective translocations as a function of time. Fig.2 A (top panels) shows the disposition of Akt for various times following EGF addition, compared with the location of hSpry2 as shown in Fig. 2 A(bottom panels). Akt was detectable in a peripheral membrane location at the optimal time of 10 min after EGF addition, compared with a higher proportion in the cytosol at both earlier and later times. This is in accordance with the observations from other studies on PH domain translocation (19Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, hSpry2 rapidly translocated to ruffles but essentially remained associated with those structures for at least 60 min. In a parallel experiment, to assess the reversibility of any translocation, the cells were stimulated for 10 min with EGF, following which they were extensively washed before serum-free medium was added again to the cells. Even when EGF was removed after 10 min of stimulation, hSpry2 remained associated with ruffles for at least another 60 min (Fig. 2 A, bottom right panel), whereas Akt relocated into the cytosol soon after EGF was removed and was predominantly present in the cytosol at 60 min (Fig. 2 A, top right panel). Although the kinetics of hSpry2 translocation does not appear to be similar to a prototypical PH domain-containing protein, we asked whether the translocation could be abrogated by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin. COS-1 overexpressing hSpry2 or Akt were treated with either 50 or 100 nm wortmannin for 10 min before cells were either left unstimulated or treated with EGF. Fig. 2 Bshows the disposition of Akt (left panel) compared with the location of hSpry2 (right panel). In both cases, the cells had been treated with 100 nm wortmannin prior to EGF stimulation. Although Akt appeared to be predominantly located in the cytosol, hSpry2 still showed a profound ruffles location (compare the respective 10 min time points in Fig. 2 Athat show the disposition of the proteins following EGF stimulation without the inhibitor). Parallel experiments were conducted on cells to show that the doses of wortmannin employed effectively inhibited PI-3 kinase activity in these experiments. It has been established that the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Akt kinase occurs downstream of PI-3 kinase (20Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). We assessed the activation status of Akt by probing for phosphorylation of the kinase in whole cell lysates using anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. In Fig. 2 C, phosphorylation of Akt is not apparent in lane 1 (unstimulated) but is apparent in lane 2 (EGF stimulated). The phosphorylation of Akt upon EGF stimulation was slightly decreased with 50 nmwortmannin (lane 3) but was almost completely abrogated with 100 nm wortmannin treatment (lane 4). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with Akt antibody to demonstrate equal loading of the protein in each lane (data not shown). It can therefore be concluded that the translocation of hSpry2 was independent of PI-3 kinase activation. Based on the kinetics of translocation, the disposition of hSpry2 was more reminiscent of the translocation seen with various proteins containing a C2 domain. This domain, found in the conventional PKCs (PKCβII, for example) and a variety of other proteins, targets the proteins to diacylglycerol, another lipid-derived product of RTK stimulation (21De Laat S.W. Moolenaar W.H. Defize L.H. Boonstra J. van der Saag P.T. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1985; 50: 205-220PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various phorbol esters mimic the presence of diacylglycerol in membranes and application of these tumor promoters to cells can result in the translocation of certain members of the PKC family. We therefore investigated whether the prototypical tumor promoting phorbol ester, PMA, could induce the translocation of hSpry2 to membrane structures. In a parallel study, COS-1 cells were transfected with either hSpry2 or with PKCβII. It can be seen in Fig.2 D (top panels) that PKCβII translocated to a peripheral membrane location following PMA treatment for 10 min. It is noteworthy that only about 10% of the transfected cells showed the degree of translocation illustrated and that the translocation destination was not characteristic of ruffles. Interestingly, hSpry2 also showed a weak peripheral membrane location following 10 min of PMA stimulation to an extent similar to that of PKCβII but significantly less than that for EGF stimulation (Fig. 2 D, bottom panels). Although hSpry2 assumed a weak membrane peripheral location following PMA stimulation, it did not have the typical wavy ruffles appearance that can be seen following EGF stimulation. In essence, it seemed that diacylglycerol, or its mimic PMA, was unlikely to be the target for the translocation of hSpry2 upon EGF stimulation. Likewise, there was no translocation of hSpry2 when the calcium ionophore ionomycin, 2.5 μm was used as stimulating agent, and when ionomycin, 2.5 μm was added in conjunction with PMA there was no enhancement of effect (data not shown). To investigate the domains responsible for directing hSpry2 to microtubules and ruffles, a series of deletion mutants was constructed, as shown in Fig.3. These mutants, which included two N-terminal deletions, Δ53–122 and Δ123–177, as well as three C-terminal deletions, Δ178–194, Δ195–221, and Δ265–282, were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cells were either left untreated or stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cell activation and the levels of expression of the various constructs were verified as described above. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with PY20 antibodies to locate tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptors (Fig. 3 A, top panel). The expression of the various mutants was shown to be approximately equivalent and intact following EGF stimulation as assessed by Western blotting with FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). It is noteworthy that the Δ53–122 hSpry2 protein ran anomalously when subjected to SDS-PAGE in that it consistently migrated at the same rate as the full-length hSpry2 protein. From the immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3 B), the disposition of Δ53–122 (top panels) was similar to that of full-length hSpry2 in both stimulated and unstimulated cells, indicating that this region of the protein was not involved in determining the subcellular localization. In contrast, both Δ123–177 and Δ195–221 (second and fourth rows of panels) showed no colocalization with the microtubules. This suggested that the association of hSpry2 with tubulin was via at least two distinct regions, one from each half of the protein. We were particularly interested in defining the region on hSpry2 that was responsible for the translocation of the protein to a mem"

Nature. 1985; 314: 596-602Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are components of the respiratory complexes located in the inner membrane. The assembly of these complexes requires proteins synthesized within the mitochondria and additional subunits synthesized in the cell cytoplasm and subsequently imported into this organelle. Much remains to be learned about the assembly of these multisubunit complexes. Although all of the polypeptides synthesized by the mitochondrial translational system are localized in the inner membrane, it is not yet clear whether they are actually synthesized on membrane bound ribosomes. Further, there is limited information on whether the insertion of these polypeptides is a co-translational or post-translational process. In yeast, a considerable body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial ribosomes are associated with the membrane and that translational initiation involves an interaction of the ribosome with the inner membrane. Early electron microscopic studies showed an association of ribosomes with the inner membrane in yeast (4Linnane A. Ward K. Forrester I. Haslam J. Plummer D. Villaneuva J. Garcia-Acha I. Gascon S. Urabura F. Yeast, Mold and Plant Protoplasts. Academic Press, New York1973: 344-360Google Scholar). Furthermore, a combination of high salt and detergents was required to purify yeast mitochondrial ribosomes free of membrane contamination (5Obbink D. Spithill T. Maxwell R. Linnane A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 151: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic evidence indicates that the expression of antibiotic resistance by mutant ribosomes in yeast is affected by changes in the mitochondrial membrane (6Trembath M. Bunn C. Lukins H. Linnane A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 121: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Spithill T. Trembath M. Linnane A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondrial mRNAs have long 5′-untranslated regions, and translational initiation in yeast mitochondria requires nuclearly encoded mRNA-specific translational activator proteins that appear to interact with the 5′-untranslated regions (8Fox T.D. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 733-758Google Scholar, 9Pel H. Grivell L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This translational activator complex binds to the inner membrane and recognizes both the 5′-untranslated regions of a specific mRNA and mitochondrial ribosomes. The translation of these mRNAs then occurs at the surface of the inner membrane, allowing their synthesis to occur near sites of their assembly into the multisubunit respiratory complexes. It should be noted, however, that the insertion of the mitochondrially encoded polypeptides does not absolutely require a co-translational process. Herrmann et al. (10Herrmann J. Koll H. Cook R. Neupert W. Stuart R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27079-27086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that the correct insertion of cytochrome oxidase subunit II into the inner membrane is not obligatorily coupled to its synthesis. The relationship between the translation of mitochondrial mRNAs and the assembly of the respiratory chain complexes remains to be clarified. Unlike the yeast mitochondrial mRNAs, animal mitochondrial mRNAs lack significant 5′- and 3′-untranslated nucleotides. The start codon is generally located within 3 nucleotides of the 5′ end of the mRNA (11Wolstenholme D. Wolstenholme D. Jeon K. Mitochondrial Genomes. Academic Press, New York1992: 173-216Google Scholar, 12Anderson S. de Brujin M. Coulson A. Eperon I. Sanger F. Young I. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The stop codon is generally followed immediately by a poly(A) tail added post-transcriptionally. The ribosomes present in mammalian mitochondria are 55–60 S particles and are composed of 28 and 39 S subunits. The rRNAs in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are significantly smaller than those of other ribosomes (12 S in the small subunit and 16 S in the large subunit). These ribosomes have 85–90 proteins (13Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cahill A.

This number is significantly higher than that observed in bacterial ribosomes and may exceed the number of proteins present in eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes (15Wittmann-Liebold B. Littlechild J.

In the current paper, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes are associated with the inner membrane and examine the nature of the forces governing this association. Mitochondria from 4 kg of bovine liver were prepared as described previously, and the outer membrane was removed by treatment with 0.12 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondrial protein (13Matthews D.E.

The large scale preparation of mitochondria required about 10 h. The indicated amounts of mitoplasts were resuspended in 0.6 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) using a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were sonicated at 4 °C for a total of 3 min using 18 bursts of 10 s each. The mixture was transferred to centrifuge tubes using buffer A and was centrifuged in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 2,500 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing fragments of the inner membrane, and the matrix of the mitochondria (23Daum G. Bohni P. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was centrifuged at 40,800 rpm in a Beckman Type 50 rotor for 12 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this step was used as the inner membrane fraction, and the supernatant was used as the matrix fraction. Free mitochondrial ribosomes were prepared as described previously (13Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Eberly S.L. Locklear V. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8721-8725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that free mitochondrial ribosomes would not sediment under the conditions used to prepare the inner membrane, 2.5A260 of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes were diluted in 2 ml of buffer A and treated as described above. To assess the effects of various conditions on the association of the 28 S subunit with the inner membrane, mitoplasts (about 20 g) were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A and sonicated as described above. The volume of the sample was adjusted to 34 ml by the addition of buffer A and subjected to low speed centrifugation. Following this step, the supernatant (30 ml) was divided into aliquots of 3.5 ml each. The aliquots were treated as follows: 1) nothing was added, 2) KCl was added to a final concentration of 90 mm, 3) KCl was added to a concentration of 280 mm, 4) the concentration of KCl was adjusted to 520 mm, 5) puromycin was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, 6) Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and 7) Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1.6%. In separate experiments, both 1 mm puromycin and KCl (final concentration, 280 mm) were added sequentially to the same sample. Finally, samples were prepared in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and 280 mm KCl. All samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then separated into matrix and inner membrane fractions by high speed centrifugation as described above. The inner membrane fraction in each case was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A. The concentration of protein was determined as described (24Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1942; 310: 384-421Google Scholar). Nucleic acids in aliquots (0.5 ml containing 17 A260 from the inner membrane or 1 ml containing 1.8 A260 from the matrix) were extracted using the SDS-phenol/chloroform method (25Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Seidman Moore D. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). For this analysis, samples were adjusted to 1.5 volumes with buffer B (0.3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) and extracted with an equal volume of a 1:1 mixture of phenol and chloroform. Nucleic acid was precipitated by the addition of 0.6 volumes of isopropyl alcohol at −20 °C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). DNA was removed by digestion with 0.01 mg/ml DNase as described (25Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Seidman Moore D. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were dissolved in water and stored at −70 °C. RNA was extracted from mitochondrial ribosomes (48 A260) and wheat germ cytoplasmic ribosomes (150 A260) as described above. Biotinylated (Bt)1 probes for the 12 S rRNA (residues 370–391, 5′-GGCTATTGTAGGGTCACTTTCG-Bt), for the 16 S rRNA (residues 236–255, GGAATGCTGGAGGTGATGTT-Bt or residues 849–868 GTCTGGTTTCGGGCTGCTTA-Bt) of the mitochondrial rRNAs, and for the 18 S cytoplasmic rRNA (residues 1371–1390, GTCTCGTTCGTTATCGGAAT-Bt) were prepared in the Lineberger Cancer Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. RNA samples (0.001–0.01 A260 in 10 μl) were denatured, immobilized on Zeta-probe nylon membranes by UV cross-linking, and probed with the biotinylated rRNA probes (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.49-7.55Google Scholar). For detection, blots were blocked with TBST (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was added for 1 h, and blots were washed three times with TBST. Colorimetric detection with the BCIP/NBT color substrate was performed according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signal intensities were determined by transferring blots of colorimetric reactions into a PC using a HP ScanJet 4P and analyzing images for relative intensities via the CorelDraw graphics software (27Poluektova L. Huggler G. Patterson E. Khan M. Immunopharmocology. 1999; 41: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or the Scion Image Beta 3b software. The procedure used was basically as described previously (28Browning K.S. Humphreys J. Hobbs W. Smith G. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17967-17973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were diluted as needed in 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl, with or without 0.02% SDS and immobilized in microtiter plates at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies used were anti-bovine COXIV, mouse monoclonal 20E8-C12 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and anti-Hsp60, mouse monoclonal IgG1, LK-1 (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.). Color development was carried out using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) following the manufacturer's directions and monitored on a SpectraMax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Background absorbency (well blocked and treated as described except for the addition of sample) was subtracted from each value. To assess the possibility that mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes were associated with the inner membrane, it was essential to obtain reasonably clean preparations of the inner membrane and of the soluble interior portion of the mitochondrion (the matrix). One of the standard protocols for this fractionation uses the detergent lubrol to create fragments and vesicles of the inner membrane that can be separated from the matrix by a high speed centrifugation step (22Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This method allows the preparation of inner membrane and matrix with little cross-contamination. However, when ribosomes alone were taken through this procedure, they pelleted during the high speed centrifugation step used to sediment the membranes. Hence, it was not feasible to use this procedure for the analysis of an association between mitochondrial ribosomes and the membrane. As an alternative, a sonication method was developed to allow the preparation of inner membrane and matrix fractions reasonably free of cross-contamination. In this procedure, membrane fragments were created by a brief sonication step. The resulting membrane fragments and the matrix were separated by very brief high speed centrifugation under conditions in which free ribosomes would not sediment with the inner membrane. The inner membrane and matrix fractions thus obtained were examined for cross-contamination using antibodies for marker proteins (COXIV for the inner membrane and Hsp60 for the matrix fraction). Quantitative ELISAs were used to determine the amount of COXIV and Hsp60 in the fractions obtained. As indicated in Fig.1, over 85% of the COXIV was found associated with the inner membrane fraction as expected (Fig. 1,A and C). About 15% was located in the matrix fraction. This percentage reflects the short centrifugation time used to prevent sedimentation of the ribosomes during the fractionation process. The inner membrane is largely free of contamination from the matrix as indicated by the very small amounts of Hsp60 detectable in the preparations (Fig. 1, B and C). To ensure that free ribosomes would not sediment during the brief high speed centrifugation step used to separate the matrix and inner membrane fractions, free ribosomes were carried through this procedure. No free ribosomes could be detected sedimenting under the conditions used. To assess the presence of mitochondrial ribosomes on the inner membrane, it was essential to have a quantitative method to carry out this analysis. For this work, a biotinylated oligonucleotide probe for the small subunit rRNA (12 S rRNA) was prepared. As indicated in Fig.2 A, this probe gave an increasing signal on dot blots when used to detect increasing amounts of rRNA extracted from isolated mitochondrial ribosomes. The signal obtained was reasonably linear with the amount of rRNA used in the dot blot allowing the quantitation of the amount of the small ribosomal subunit present in the initial preparations (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of the probe for mitochondrial rRNA was examined by hybridization to wheat germ cytoplasmic rRNA containing the 18 S rRNA from the 40 S subunit. As indicated in Fig. 2 C, no signal was detected from this rRNA. Wheat germ rRNA was used as a control because 18 S rRNA is reasonably well conserved and preparations of cytoplasmic ribosomes from bovine liver are generally contaminated with small amounts of mitochondrial ribosomes because of organelle breakage during the preparation of the cytoplasmic fraction. To examine matrix and inner membrane preparations for the presence of 28 S ribosomal subunits, the nucleic acid in these fractions was extracted. Treatment with DNase was used to remove mitochondrial DNA. The amount of the 12 S rRNA was determined using the dot blot assay. The signal from the biotinylated probe for the 12 S rRNA and the amount of material recovered in the inner membrane and matrix fractions were used to calculate the relative amount of small subunit rRNA associated with each faction. This analysis indicates that about 40% of the small subunits are located in the inner membrane fraction, suggesting that there is a significant association between the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome and the inner membrane (Fig. 2 D). Mitochondrial ribosomes could be associated with the inner membrane through a number of different types of interactions including 1) an electrostatic interaction between the polar surface of the membrane and charged/polar groups on the ribosome; 2) the nascent chain as it is being targeted to assemble into the large oligomeric complexes in which mitochondrial translational products are localized; 3) interaction with one or more specific proteins in the membrane (a putative ribosome receptor); 4) partial insertion of a portion of the ribosome into the membrane allowing strong hydrophobic interactions to occur; and 5) a combination of several of these interactions. It should also be kept in mind that there may be different populations of ribosomes associated with membranes in different ways reflecting the different stages of protein synthesis. The importance of electrostatic interactions on the binding of mitochondrial 28 S subunits to the inner membrane was assessed by examining the effects of increasing concentrations of salt. The preparations described above were carried out in 40 mm KCl. When the salt concentration is raised to 90 mm, the percentage of the subunits that fractionate with the inner membrane decreases from about 40% to about 30% (Fig.3). As the concentration of salt is increased still further (to 280 and 520 mm), the fraction of ribosomal subunits associated with the membrane decreases further until about 15% of the subunits remain membrane-associated. These observations indicate that a little over half of the inner membrane-associated ribosomes are released by salt treatment, suggesting that electrostatic interactions play an important role in their ability to bind to membranes. The remainder of the subunits appear to remain associated with the membrane even at elevated salt concentrations, suggesting that factors other than simple electrostatic interactions are important for their association with the membrane. At the higher concentrations of salt, there is a decrease in the total recovery of 28 S subunits in the inner membrane and matrix fractions, suggesting that high levels of KCl cause some damage to these particles (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with previous data (29Spremulli L. Kraus B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) indicating that mitochondrial ribosomes lose activity when treated at elevated concentrations of salt. The role that the nascent chain plays in the interaction of the small subunit with the membrane was assessed by examining the treatment of the ribosome-membrane complexes with puromycin. Transfer of the nascent chain to puromycin triggers the release of the nascent chain from the ribosome. The nascent chain normally emerges from the ribosome through the exit tunnel in the large subunit. The release of the nascent chain could reduce interaction of the large (39 S) subunit with the membrane, indirectly triggering the release of its associated 28 S subunit. For these experiments, mitochondrial extracts were incubated with puromycin and then fractionated into the matrix and inner membrane, which were probed for the 12 S rRNA. Treatment with puromycin did not cause a significant reduction in the fraction of the small subunits associated with the inner membrane (Fig. 4). This observation indicates that the interaction of the 28 S subunit with the membrane is not indirectly mediated through the nascent chain emerging from the large ribosomal subunit. A combination of high salt and puromycin on the 28 S subunit-membrane association was examined and indicated that puromycin did not increase the release of small subunit mediated by high salt concentrations (Fig. 4). The data provided above suggest that electrostatic forces play a significant role in the interactions of at least half of the 28 S subunits associated with the membrane. Additional interactions must be important for at least a portion of the small subunits. One of the standard methods to determine whether a peripheral or intrinsic membrane protein plays an important role in mediating an interaction with the membrane is to examine the effect of alkaline Na2CO3, which strips peripheral membrane proteins leaving intrinsic membrane proteins associated with the lipid bilayer. Unfortunately, alkaline Na2CO3 (pH 11) damages ribosomes significantly and cannot be used to examine the role of a peripheral membrane protein in the observed association. As suggested above, it is conceivable that the ribosome could be associated with the inner membrane through an integral membrane protein or through a direct interaction with the lipid bilayer. To gain some insight into this possibility, preparations were made in the presence of 1% and 1.6% Triton X-100. This detergent solubilizes membranes with the exception of regions that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (regions forming lipid rafts) (30Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.5, treatment of extracts with 1% Triton releases more than half of the small subunits associated with the inner membrane. However, 15–20% of the mitochondrial 28 S subunits remain associated with the Triton-insoluble portion of the inner membrane. Treatment at a higher concentration of Triton (1.6%) resulted in about the same percentage of mitochondrial ribosomes associated with the membrane. When mitoplast extracts were treated with a combination of high salt (280 mm) and 1% Triton X-100, close to 15% of the ribosomes still remain associated with the inner membrane. This observation suggests that some fraction of the small subunits have a rather strong association with the inner membrane, possibly with regions containing large oligomeric complexes or regions forming lipid rafts. The experiments described above focused on the association of the small ribosomal subunit with the inner membrane. A similar approach was used to determine whether the large (39 S) subunit was also located on the membrane. Initial experiments indicated that the total recovery of the large subunit in the inner membrane and matrix was lower than that of the 28 S subunit for unknown reasons. Two different probes for the large subunit rRNA (16 S rRNA) gave similar responses, suggesting that the lower apparent yield was not related to difficulties with the hybridization protocol used. It is possible that the 39 S subunit becomes damaged under some of the conditions used as has been observed with the large subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes (31Russell D.W. Spremulli L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 201: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite some difficulties with the overall recovery, examination of the percentage of the large subunit present in the membrane and matrix fraction indicated that about 40% of the large subunit was associated with the membrane (Fig. 6). This value is essentially the same as that observed with the small subunit. Treatment of extracts with puromycin had only a small effect on the association of the 39 S subunit with the membrane, suggesting that the interaction is not mediated by the nascent chain. Treatment with elevated concentrations of salt in addition to puromycin removed about half of the large subunits from the inner membrane. These observations suggest that a significant fraction of the 39 S subunit associates with membrane via forces in addition to an electrostatic interaction. The data reported here demonstrate that about half of the ribosomes in bovine liver mitochondria are associated with the inner membrane. This number probably represents an underestimate of the actual degree of association because the time required for the large scale preparation of bovine mitoplasts might result in the release of some of the ribosomes from the inner membrane. Ribosomes are associated with cellular membranes in a number of cases. Ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum are involved in the synthesis of proteins for several membrane systems in the cell, in the synthesis of exported proteins, and in the synthesis of proteins localized in certain subcellular organelles such as lysosomes (32Johnson A. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic ribosomes are also found associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria (33Crowley K. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The synthesis of organellar membrane proteins and their assembly into large oligomeric complexes is poorly understood. A considerable body of evidence in the yeast mitochondrial system suggests that the ribosomes are associated with the inner membrane. Further, the synthesis of thylakoid membrane proteins encoded in the chloroplast genome is thought to occur on membrane-associated ribosomes. No signal sequences are observed at the N termini of the mitochondrially synthesized proteins in mammalian cells, and the mechanism by which they are inserted into the inner membrane and assembled into the respiratory chain complexes is not well understood. The association of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes with the inner membrane has both similarities and differences with the association of ribosomes with other cellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Only about half of the mitochondrial ribosomes are released by treatment with high salt, and puromycin has no significant effect on their association with the membranes. In contrast, cytoplasmic ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum can generally be released from the membranes by a combination of high salt and puromycin (34Adelman M. Sabatini D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 56: 206-229Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that they interact with the translocon (Sec61p system) through electrostatic interactions and through the nascent chain. Chloroplast ribosomes associated with thylakoid membranes are also largely released by the combination of high salt and puromycin (35Wollman F.-A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1411: 21-85Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is possible that mitochondrial ribosomes associate with membranes through different interactions at discrete stages of the translation cycle. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytoplasmic ribosomes are essentially all in the stage of polypeptide chain elongation. Their interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is governed primarily by the association of the large subunit with the translocon complex. During synthesis the nascent chain passes through the exit tunnel in the large subunit directly into the translocon pore (32Johnson A. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In the current models, the small ribosomal subunit does not contact the endoplasmic reticulum membrane directly. Work in the yeast mitochondrial system suggests that polypeptide chain initiation as well as chain elongation will occur in association with the inner membrane (8Fox T.D. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 733-758Google Scholar, 36He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell.

Korte J. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). During initiation, the small subunit of the ribosome should be in contact with the membrane. This association would allow the small subunit to contact mRNA-specific binding proteins that have been shown to be associated with the inner membrane (8Fox T.D. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 733-758Google Scholar, 37Manthey G. Przybyla-Zawislak B. McEwen J. Eur. J.

Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11737-11741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, during chain elongation, any co-translational insertion of the nascent chain into the membrane would require contact between the large subunit of the ribosome and the membrane because the nascent chain emerges from the back of this subunit. Somewhat surprisingly, about 15% of the mitochondrial ribosomes remain associated with the membrane after Triton X-100 extraction. Extraction of membranes can yield detergent-insoluble lipids (lipid rafts) that appear to be enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (30Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). The inner membrane of liver mitochondria does not contain high levels of these lipids. Rather it is enriched in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin (40Gurtubay J.I. Goni F. Gomez-Fernandez J. Otamendi J. Macarulla J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which tend to be solubilized by Triton (30Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the lipids tend to be more effectively solubilized than the proteins when the inner membrane is treated with Triton X-100 (40Gurtubay J.I. Goni F. Gomez-Fernandez J. Otamendi J. Macarulla J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inner membrane is very protein-rich (about 75% protein) compared with most membranes (about 50% protein) (41Scheffler I. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the mitochondrial ribosomes not solubilized with Triton X-100 are associated with one or more large protein complexes in the membrane rather than primarily associated with lipids. Current efforts are underway to identify membrane components involved in this interaction."

We find that at early time points (up to 3 h) in nocodazole induction, Raf/MEK/MAPK is activated, and inhibition of MAPK activation by a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or U0126, reduces the number of cells entering mitosis by creating a block at G2. At later time points and in mitosis, activation of MEK/MAPK is severely inhibited, even though Raf-1 activity remains high and can be further increased by growth factor. This inhibition is reversed when cells are released from metaphase and enter G0/G1 phase. In addition, we find that binding of Raf-1 to 14-3-3 is progressively induced by nocodazole, reaching a maximum in mitosis, and that this binding is necessary to maintain mitotic Raf-1 activity.

Microtubules play a central role in chromosome movement by forming the mitotic spindle (21Andersen S.S.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The dynamic balance between polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules is critical for cells to enter and exit mitosis, and drugs that disrupt this dynamic, such as colchicine, nocodazole, and taxol, interfere with chromosome movement and arrest the cell cycle in mitosis. The mechanism by which these drugs block mitosis appears to be more complex than a simple disruption of microtubule structure, as treatment with these drugs leads to activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway (22Torres K.

The biological significance and mechanisms of Raf-1 activation and uncoupling from its downstream kinase MAPK in mitosis of mammalian cells has not been addressed. In the present study, we characterize the activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway in mitosis induced by nocodazole. We show that activation of Raf-1 and MAPK are coupled at early time points of nocodazole treatment and became uncoupled at later time points. Inhibition of MAPK activation by MEK inhibitor PD98059 or U0126 blocks the G2/M transition. During mitosis itself, Raf-1 is highly phosphorylated and exhibits increased binding to 14-3-3. Removal of 14-3-3 from mitotic or EGF-stimulated Raf-1 results in the inhibition of its kinase activity, suggesting that 14-3-3 plays an essential role in keeping Raf kinase active in mitosis. cDNAs encoding wild-type Raf-1, K375M, or S259A/S621A were tagged with a Myc epitope at the amino terminus and cloned into pMT2 (28Luo Z.

COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, from Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, from Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed according to the protocol provided by Life Technologies, Inc., with some modifications. Cells from confluent 10-cm plates were split 1:4 and allowed to grow to 50% coverage and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with 2 ml of serum-free DMEM. 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) were combined in 500 μl of serum-free DMEM at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with the cells for 3 h. The transfection mixture was then aspirated and the cells washed and allowed to recover overnight in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were then split 1:3 and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 to 2 days before collection. Induction of mitotic block and FACS analysis were performed according to Ziogaset al. (26Ziogas A.

Mitotic samples were collected by incubating cells with nocodazole for 12 h, washing with 5 ml of PBS, adding 2 ml of PBS, and gently tapping the plates to dislodge the loosely adherent mitotic cells. Attached fractions were then either trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, Life Technologies, Inc.) or scraped off the plate. For manual cell counting, cell samples collected as described above were brought to a uniform volume, and 10 μl were loaded onto a hemacytometer. The average cell count over five areas was used to compute the overall cell count. For FACS analysis, 5 × 105-1 × 106cells were trypsinized, spun gently, washed with PBS, and incubated in ice-cold 70% ethanol, 30% PBS at 4 °C for 1 to 5 h. The samples were then washed once with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of staining solution (10 μg/ml RNase A, 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS). The samples were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. FACS analysis was performed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Recombinant mouse 14-3-3ζ was expressed as a GST fusion protein in JM 109 bacterial cells and purified through a glutathione affinity column (28Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For binding assays, 5 μg of GST-14-3-3 protein were immobilized on glutathione bead and incubated with cell extracts treated with nocodazole for the indicated times. The isolated complex was then subjected to immunoblotting. Raf-1 kinase assays were performed as described by Luo et al. (28Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mmβ-glycerol-phosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and spun in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C at maximum speed for 10 min. Protein concentration was assayed using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, 10–20 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed thoroughly with lysis buffer, cell extract was added, and incubation at 4 °C was continued for at least 2 h. For GST immobilizations, 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated at 4 °C with cell extract for at least 1 h. The precipitated beads were then washed once with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer plus 1 m NaCl, and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Raf kinase activity was assayed in a total of 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 μg/ml MEK1 at 30 °C for 20 min and then supplemented with 40 μg/ml kinase dead ERK2 after which incubation continued for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer and boiled. MEK kinase activity was assayed by sequential incubation with 2 μg/ml Erk1 and 50 μg/ml myelin basic protein; otherwise, this assay was the same as for Raf kinase. All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The radioactively labeled membranes were exposed to an autoradiograph film at −80 °C. For MEK activity assays, the labeled Erk2 bands were excised and subjected to scintillation counting after autoradiography. Samples were resolved on either 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) for 3 to 4 h at 500 mA constant current. The transferred proteins were detected by specific antibodies according to manufacturer's protocols using enhanced chemiluminescence. Several recent studies have demonstrated that Raf-1 is activated and hyperphosphorylated on its serine/threonine residues in cells arrested in metaphase by nocodazole (24Laird A.D. Taylor S.J.

To evaluate the role of Raf/MAPK activation in nocodazole-induced mitosis, we transiently transfected GST-Raf-1 in COS7 cells, treated the cells with nocodazole, and collected samples at various time points to examine activation of recombinant GST-Raf-1 using a MEK1- and Erk2-coupled assay (28Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Raf-1 was found to be activated in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 a). Raf kinase activity peaked between 1 and 3 h at a level comparable with EGF-stimulated kinase activity and declined as the nocodazole incubation continued. Raf-1 from mitotic cells collected by shake-off after a 12-h exposure to nocodazole showed higher than basal levels of kinase activity, although this activity was not as high as during the 1–3-h peak. Since Raf-1 lies upstream of MEK and MAPK in higher eukaryotes, we examined the activation profile of these downstream kinases. We found that MAPK had a similar activation time course as Raf-1, as measured by anti-phospho-antibodies against its active forms. Upon further incubation with nocodazole, the activity of MAPK declined and became lower than basal by 12 h, when more than 60% of the cells were arrested in metaphase, and in mitotic cells isolated by shake-off (Fig. 1 b). The diminished activity of MAPK was not the result of decreased expression of the protein. In these studies, maximal activation of MAPK appeared to occur 30 min earlier than Raf activation. This could be explained if nocodazole penetration into the cells was not maximal until 1 h, but the level of Raf-1 kinase activity at 30 min was sufficient to give apparent maximal activation of MEK and MAPK. A second possibility is that nocodazole simultaneously activates MEK/MAPK and triggers events that later inactivate this pathway, so that maximal activation of MEK/MAPK may mirror that of Raf-1 but be masked by the action of the induced inactivation machinery. To study the relationship between Raf/MAPK activation and mitosis, we examined expression of mitosis-specific cyclin B1 and showed that cyclin B1 was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner. This up-regulation occurred after the activation of MAPK and was correlated with increases in the number of mitotic cells during mitotic induction (Fig. 1 b). To further explore the role of Raf/MAPK in mitosis, we treated COS7 cells with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or U0126, or with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, 15 min before the addition of nocodazole. After a 12-h incubation with nocodazole alone or with PD98059, U0126, or wortmannin, we counted the number of mitotic cells versus the number of attached cells. Interestingly, we found that the number of mitotic cells in the samples incubated with MEK inhibitors was significantly lower (decreased by 2–3-fold) than the samples without the MEK inhibitors (either nocodazole alone or nocodazole with wortmannin) (Fig.2 a). This inhibition of mitosis corresponded to an increase in the number of attached cells. Wortmannin did not have obvious effect although the total cell number was decreased by about 20%.Figure 2MAPK-dependent entry into mitosis. a, COS7 cells were stimulated for 12 h with nocodazole alone, with nocodazole and 50 μm PD98059 or 20 μm UO126, or with nocodazole and 1 μmwortmannin (Wort.). Cells in the attached and mitotic fractions were counted using a hemacytometer. b, FACS analysis representing the ratio of 2 n/4 n DNA from the mitotic and attached fractions of cells treated for 12 h with nocodazole plus or minus PD98059 (+ or −PD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed FACS analysis to determine the cell cycle stage of the attached (non-mitotic) cells after treatment with nocodazole and a MEK inhibitor, PD98059. More than 90% of the attached cells were at the G2 phase with 4 n DNA. This was a similar 2 n/4 n DNA ratio to cells incubated with nocodazole but no MEK inhibitor (Fig. 2 b). More than 95% of the mitotic shake-off cells contained 4 n DNA in every treatment. Based on these findings, we concluded that activation of MAPK is essential for the G2 to M transition induced by nocodazole. To investigate whether 14-3-3 is involved in the regulation of Raf-1 activity in mitosis, we examined the ability of Raf-1 to bind to 14-3-3. Raf-1 kinase was immunoprecipitated from both unsynchronized and mitotic cells and the relative content of associated 14-3-3 assessed by immunoblotting against 14-3-3. As shown in Fig.3 a, 14-3-3 binding to Raf-1 is enhanced in mitosis, whereas the levels of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 are almost constant between unsynchronized and mitotic cells. The increased ability of Raf-1 to bind to 14-3-3 was verified by an in vitro assay in which recombinant GST-14-3-3 was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with extracts of unsynchronized or mitotic cells in the presence of a phospho- or non-phospho-peptide containing a 14-3-3 binding site (29Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 30Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the binding of Raf-1 from mitotic cells to 14-3-3 was stronger than that of Raf from unsynchronized cells and that it was inhibited by the phospho-peptide but not by the non-phospho-peptide containing the 14-3-3 binding site (Fig. 3 b). We then tested whether the binding of Raf-1 to 14-3-3 could be induced by nocodazole and was associated with the G2/M progression. As shown in Fig.3 c, the binding of Raf-1 to 14-3-3 was progressively enhanced as the retarded mobility shift of Raf-1 was induced with prolonged incubation of cells with nocodazole. When mitotic cells were replated in nocodazole-free medium, cells progressed into G0/G1 phase, and Raf/14-3-3 binding gradually decreased. By 4 h, Raf-1/14-3-3 binding decreased to a level equal to that of unsynchronized cells, and Raf-1 molecular weight decreased to the same level as in unsynchronized cells (Fig. 3 d). We previously showed that, in contrast to the present results, the binding of 14-3-3 to Raf-1 was not influenced by growth factors (28Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that EGF and nocodazole activate Raf-1 through distinct mechanisms. To study the functional role of 14-3-3 binding of mitotic Raf-1, COS7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Raf-1 variants including Raf wild-type, Raf 259A/621A (mutated at two 14-3-3 binding sites), and Raf K375M (a kinase dead mutant). The kinase activity of recombinant Raf-1 was assayed after immunoprecipitation from extracts of mitotic, EGF-stimulated, or unsynchronized cells. As shown in Fig.4 a, wild-type Raf-1 was moderately activated in mitosis, as compared with EGF treatment, whereas neither Raf S259A/S621A nor the kinase dead mutant Raf-1 could be activated by EGF stimulation or nocodazole-induced mitosis. Another approach was necessary to ascertain that loss of kinase activity of Raf S621A is not due to misfolding of the Raf kinase catalytic domain. A logical experiment would be to immunoprecipitate 14-3-3 and compare the kinase activity of Raf associated with immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 and Raf remaining in the 14-3-3 immunodepleted extract. Two practical considerations prevented this approach. First, there is no antibody available that can deplete all isoforms of 14-3-3. Second, 14-3-3 associates with other MEK kinases besides Raf-1 (data not shown), which makes interpretation impossible. We devised an alternative experiment to demonstrate that 14-3-3 is necessary for the activity of mitotic Raf. Wild-type Myc-Raf was cotransfected with full-length 14-3-3 or with amino-terminally truncated 14-3-3, both expressed as GST fusion proteins and known to bind to Raf-1 equally well (28Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After induction of mitosis, wild-type and truncated 14-3-3 were purified by glutathione affinity beads, eluted with free glutathione, and subjected to anti-Myc (Raf-1) immunoprecipitation and Raf kinase assay. As shown in Fig.4 b, mitotic Raf associating with full-length 14-3-3 displays much higher activity and can be further stimulated by EGF, whereas Raf kinase associated with truncated 14-3-3 is totally inactive and unresponsive to EGF stimulation To further determine whether 14-3-3 binding is necessary to maintain the active conformation of mitotic Raf-1 as it is for EGF-stimulated Raf-1 (29Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 31Thorson T.A., Yu, L.W.K. Hsu A.L. Shih N.-Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the kinase activity of recombinant GST-Raf-1 isolated by glutathione immobilization from unsynchronized and mitotic cells was assayed in the absence or presence of the phospho-peptide containing the 14-3-3 binding site (Fig. 4 b). We observed that Raf-1 from mitotic and attached cells had higher than basal activity and that EGF could further stimulate this activity. Under all of these conditions, removal of 14-3-3 by the phospho-peptide diminished Raf-1 kinase activity. Thus, binding of 14-3-3 to Raf-1 is augmented during nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest, and such binding is necessary to maintain Raf-1 kinase activity. Several recent papers have reported that, during mitosis, MAPK activity is diminished and uncoupled from the increased activity of Raf-1 (24Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26742-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Lovric J. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4430-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our present data extend these previous findings by showing that the activations of MAPK and Raf-1 are coupled early in nocodazole treatment and uncoupled at late time points and during mitosis (Fig. 1). To elucidate the mechanism by which the Raf/MAPK pathway is regulated during G2/M progression induced by nocodazole, we next addressed two questions: 1) is the signaling pathway initiated by extracellular mitogenic signals impacted?; and 2) if it is inhibited, at which level does the uncoupling occur? As shown in Fig. 4 b, the activity of Raf-1 from mitotic and attached cells increased further when the cells were stimulated with EGF. However, when MAPK under the same conditions was blotted with an antibody that recognizes the active state of MAPK, we found severely impaired MAPK activation in EGF-stimulated mitotic and attached cells as compared with EGF-stimulated unsynchronized cells (Fig.5 a). This inhibition was reversed with time when mitotic cells were released from nocodazole induction (Fig. 5 b) and entered G0/G1 phase as indicated by FACS analysis (data not shown). To determine whether the uncoupling between Raf-1 and MAPK occurs at MEK, we examined MEK activation under the same conditions as described above for MAPK. MEK exhibited a similar activation profile to MAPK as shown by an anti-phospho-MEK1/2 immunoblot (Fig.6 a). At later time points in nocodazole treatment and in mitosis, the anti-phospho MEK1/2 antibody gave barely detectable signals for active MEK, whereas nonspecific signals increased. The low signals were not due to decreased expression of MEK1 and MEK2, as no change was observed by anti-MEK1 or MEK2 immunoblots. In the next experiment, we transiently expressed GST-MEK1 in COS7 cells and assayed its kinase activity. We show here that both EGF and nocodazole activate MEK1 at early time points, but activation of MEK by EGF is severely inhibited in mitotic and attached cells (Fig.6 b). The inhibition of MEK is not due to sequestering of the kinase in different cellular compartments in mitotic versusunsynchronized cells because the majority of MEK is found to be in the cytosol in both mitotic and non-mitotic cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the uncoupling of Raf-1/MAPK activation in nocodazole-induced mitosis is due to inhibition of MEK. Previous studies have demonstrated that Raf-1 is hyperphosphorylated on serine/threonine residues and activated in mitosis after a long (12–16 h) induction with nocodazole (24Laird A.D. Taylor S.J.

The regulatory control governing the fidelity and specificity of these processes can be encoded by the amplitude, frequency, or localization of cytosolic calcium signals (Δ[Ca2+]c) (4Li W. Llopis J.

Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).1 It is well established that Δ[Ca2+]c in nonexcitable cells is generally induced by InsP3 production, following activation of Gq proteins coupled to phospholipase Cβ (7Berridge M.J.

Many cell types express multiple distinct receptors coupled to this general transduction pathway. It is, however, not understood how the selective activation of distinct receptors that utilize the same general intracellular signaling system, such as the Gαq-coupled formation of InsP3, can generate agonist-specific Δ[Ca2+]c (9Woods N.

Pancreatic acinar cells represent an ideal cell model for investigating this phenomenon because despite the activation of a common Ca2+release pathway by agonists, very different patterns of Δ[Ca2+]c emerge. Stimulation of cells with acetylcholine (ACh) or cholecystokinin (CCK) results in Δ[Ca2+]c that differ in spike frequency, level of base-line spiking, and local sites of initiation (11Osipchuk Y.V.

In a previous study, we showed that the acinar cell type III InsP3R is rapidly and selectively phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase A (PKA) following stimulation with physiological levels of CCK but not by ACh (15LeBeau A.P. Yule D.I. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 851-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with data in the literature suggesting that CCK but not muscarinic stimulation results in coupling to Gαs in addition to Gαq (16Schnefel S. Profrock A. Hinsch K.D. Schulz I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study we have investigated the possibility that selective phosphoregulation of the InsP3R by PKA contributes to the shaping of cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Single acinar cells or small two- to three-cell clusters were prepared by a standard collagenase digestion of pancreata from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, 25-g mice were sacrificed in accordance with National Institutes of Health policy and established protocol with the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine, University of Rochester following CO2 gas asphyxiation and then cervical dislocation. The pancreas was removed, and the capsule was injected with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 30 μg/ml collagenase P (Sigma), 1000 units Purified collagenase (Worthington), and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Following 20–30 min of digestion at 37 °C, the pancreas was triturated through a 10-ml Falcon pipette tip, passed through a 100-μm nylon mesh, and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumen (Sigma), and isolated cells and small acini were collected by centrfugation at 100 × g for 3 min. Cell were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 5 min prior to application of recording solution perifusate. Ionic currents were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 KHz using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier, Instrutech digital interface, and IGOR PRO/Pulse Control XOP software. The standard intracellular recording solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1.13 mmMgCl2, 2 mm sodium ATP, 1 mm n-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, and 0.001–0.1 mm d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, P4(5)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester (NPE-caged InsP3), pH 7.3. The intracellular recording solution for the photolytic release of caged Ca2+contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm o-nitrophenyl EGTA, 5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm magnesium ATP, 1.2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2. Under whole cell conditions, resting [Ca2+]c and free [Mg2+] were estimated at 175 nm and 1 mm, respectively. Intervals of 4 min were maintained following patch rupture prior to and between stimuli to allow for sufficient equilibration with the patch pipette solution. The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 10 mm d-glucose, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.13 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3. Photolytic release was performed using a pulsed Xenon arc lamp (T.I.L.L. Photonics) and fiber optic guide fed to a dual port epifluorescence condenser attached to a Nikon TE-200 fluorescence microscope. A high intensity 0.5-ms flash of UV light (360 ± 7.5 nm) was reflected onto the plane of focus with a DM400 dichroic mirror and Nikon 40× oil immersion objective, 1.3 NA. At the high intensity setting about 80 J were discharged. In other experiments, a low intensity (0.1 J) continuous strobe discharge was used to uncage threshold levels of InsP3. For simultaneous current recording and direct measurement of Δ[Ca2+]c, 75 μm Oregon Green 488 Bapta-2 was added to the patch pipette solution. [Ca2+]c imaging was performed using a monochrometer-based illumination system and high speed CCD camera (T.I.L.L. Photonics). Cells were illuminated at 488 ± 15 nm, and fluorescence was collected through a 525 ± 25-nm band pass filter (Chroma). Images were acquired at 79-ms intervals and displayed as ΔF/F o = 100[(F −F o)/F o], whereF is the recorded fluorescence and F owas obtained from the mean of 15 sequential frames following equilibration with the patch dialysis solution and prior to stimulation. In some experiments, the acetoxymethylester of fura-2 was loaded into acinar cells and used to measure agonist-induced Δ[Ca2+]c. In this case, loaded cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 ± 15 nm, and emitted light was collected through a 525 ± 25-nm bandpass filter. The ratio of emitted light resultant from excitation at these two wavelengths was utilized as a measure of Δ[Ca2+]c. Immunoprecipitations were performed as follows. Samples were sonicated in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml pepstatin, at pH 7.4) and then sonicated. After 30 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was assayed for protein concentration. Samples of equal protein concentration were then incubated with antiserum overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of individual InsP3R subtypes was performed with excess antiserum (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). (No InsP3R was detectable in the lysate after addition of protein A.) Immobilized protein A beads (Pierce) were added to each sample. As a control, samples were processed with no cellular lysate or with no immunoprecipitating antiserum to ascertain specific bands on the immunoblot. After rotating the samples for 2 h, the samples were microcentrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, suspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled. The proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose prior to immunoblotting (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoreactivity was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection using the ECL detection system exposed on ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcellular localization was performed using standard immunohistochemical methods in isolated acini fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde as described previously (18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H.

A Noran/Oz laser scanning confocal microscope was used to visualize the distribution of immunofluorescence. To date, no consensus exists in the literature as to the physiological consequence of phosphorylation of individual InsP3R types (19Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, we investigated the PKA-dependent regulation of Ca2+ release in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells using the controlled release of photoactivatable (caged) InsP3 and selective pharmacological activators and inhibitors of PKA function. Whole cell patch clamp methods were used to measure Ca2+-activated ionic current evoked by the photolysis of caged compounds. This current has been previously established to faithfully report Δ[Ca2+]c, especially below the apical plasma membrane (6Kasai H. Augustine G.J.

As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), high intensity UV light flash photolysis of a reproducible portion of 1–100 μm NPE-caged InsP3, introduced via diffusional equilibration with the patch pipette solution, could repetitively evoke a Ca2+-activated current in a concentration-dependent manner. This indicated that prior exposure to Ca2+ had little effect on amplitude or kinetics of the whole cell current. A constant interval was maintained between flash discharge (3–5 min) to allow for equilibration of the cytosol with the cage-containing patch pipette. Application of the cell-permeable, hydrolysis-resistant cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) (60 μm), prior to flash photolysis of caged InsP3, rapidly and reversibly reduced or abolished the amplitude of the Ca2+-activated current. Currents represent the maximum inhibition observed after a 3–5-min exposure to dbcAMP. Only cells that showed recovery to near control current levels within 15 min were included in the analysis. Surprisingly, it was only at the lowest concentrations of NPE-caged InsP3 tested that this inhibitory effect was revealed as significant (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition compared with control was 82.6 ± 9.0% (1 μm, n = 7), 36.8 ± 11.1% (3 μm, n = 9), 23.4 ± 11.2% (10 μm, n = 7), 20.2 ± 6.3% (30 μm, n = 8), and 5.8 ± 2.9% (100 μm, n = 5). The percentage of inhibition was determined by measuring the peak current in response to a high energy flash discharge prior to and after 3–5-min exposure and following removal of drug. The observation that only the smallest, threshold responses to InsP3 were inhibited by PKA activation is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that PKA had little effect on Ca2+ release evoked by application of high doses of agonist (26Camello P.J. Petersen O.H. Toescu E.C. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 432: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Kase H. Wakui M. Petersen O.H.

It is unlikely that this reduction was mediated by direct inhibitory phosphoregulation of the Ca2+-activated Cl−channel because, as shown in Fig. 2, no inhibition of peak current amplitude was observed over a range of currents (32–527 pA, 5 mm NP-EGTA; or 320–686 pA, 10 mm NP-EGTA) activated by the release of caged Ca2+. Average peak currents prior to and following treatment with 100 μm dbcAMP for 4 min were 217 ± 51 versus 243 ± 50 pA (n = 11, 5 mm NP-EGTA) and 519 ± 73 pA versus571 ± 84 pA; (n = 5; 10 mm NP-EGTA). On average, flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ (10 mm NP-EGTA) transiently raised [Ca2+]c to about 7 μm, as measured with the ratiometric, low affinity Ca2+ indicator, benzothiazola coumarin. These levels of Ca2+ are generally within a physiological range evoked apically by InsP3 (1–10 μm) (29Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and at which the Cl− current is not likely to be saturated (29Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Wakui M. Potter B.V. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Thorn P. Petersen O.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that, unlike CFTR or voltage-activated Cl− channels, cAMP does not directly modulate the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (32Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Chen Y. Pollock J.D. Wang Y. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Yu L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 34Hirono C. Sugita M. Furuya K. Yamagishi S. Shiba Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that PKA activation was found to directly inhibit InsP3-evoked Δ[Ca2+]c in a permeablized mouse pancreatic acinar cell preparation, supporting our contention that the reduction in the Ca2+ signal largely resulted from a decreased Ca2+ release rather than an effect on the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel or on Ca2+ clearance (data not shown). A reduction of the current activated by low levels of stimulation indicated that a subset of InsP3R that exhibit the highest sensitivity for InsP3 is preferentially modulated by dbcAMP. Because the pancreatic acinar cell expresses all isoforms of receptor together with heterotetrameric forms (35Wojcikiewicz R.J. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1194-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is difficult to categorically identify this high sensitivity receptor. The relative contribution of an InsP3R type to the initial signal is presumably determined by several factors including the relative abundance of the particular receptor, the affinity of the receptor for InsP3 and susceptibility to phosphoregulation by PKA. Because the type II receptor is a poor substrate for PKA phosphorylation (23Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it would seem unlikely that this receptor contributes markedly to threshold level Ca2+ release and its modulation by PKA. In contrast, the type I receptor is a good substrate for phosphorylation by PKA and has been reported to have the highest affinity for InsP3 but is expressed at very low levels in pancreatic acinar cells (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The type III receptor has been shown to be an efficient substrate for PKA-mediated phosphorylation (15LeBeau A.P. Yule D.I. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 851-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the only quantitative study of receptor number in the exocrine pancreas has shown that the type III receptor is the most abundant receptor form (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and, thus, by mass action would presumably contribute significantly to the initial Ca2+ release. In support of this contention, the type III receptor has also been proposed to serve as an initial trigger for Ca2+ release (36Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the open probability of the receptor is modulated very steeply by near resting [Ca2+]c (37Mak D.O. McBride S. Raghuram V. Yue Y. Joseph S.K. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It should, however, be noted that the type III receptor has been reported, when studied in isolation, to have the lowest affinity for InsP3 (23Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These data together with the body of work in the literature indicate that the type III is a good candidate for the initial, PKA-modulated Ca2+ signal. A contributing role for the type I receptor alone or in heterologous association with the type III receptor, however, cannot be excluded. Because Ca2+ spikes induced by low levels of ACh have been shown to initiate at specialized, InsP3R-rich sites (trigger zones) tightly associated with the luminal borders and are often confined to the luminal pole (18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 39Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we postulated that the effect of dbcAMP on Ca2+ release would also be manifested in this region. To test this hypothesis, we sought to selectively activate Ca2+ release at the acinar cell trigger zone. Thus, rather than using a high intensity flash discharge, we applied a continuous, low level photolytic strobe stimulus (indicated as I in the Fig. 3) to cells loaded with caged InsP3 to achieve threshold activation levels of InsP3. In most cases it was necessary to first determine empirically the concentration of caged InsP3 that was needed to evoke threshold activation. As shown in Fig. 3, fluorescence digital imaging methods confirmed that this stimulation paradigm preferentially induced Ca2+ rises that were initiated and largely maintained in the luminal pole, characteristic of threshold Ca2+ release. Simultaneous patch clamp measurements revealed the activation of irregular current spikes that mirrored the evoked apical Δ[Ca2+]c. As expected, a subsequent, high intensity UV flash discharge (indicate as II in the Fig. 3) evoked a global Ca2+ rise that initiated in the luminal pole and activated a robust current. To investigate the inhibitory effect of cAMP on the high sensitivity InsP3R subset, cAMP levels were increased by treatment with 10 μm forskolin, and the Ca2+-activated current spike activity was evoked by 15–30 s of a continuous UV strobe. To accurately quantify the complex nature of the Ca2+ release events evoked by continuous strobe prior to and following forskolin application for 3–5 min, the time integral of the current produced was determined. As shown in Fig.4 A, forskolin treatment reversibly inhibited Ca2+ release at the trigger zone. Following wash-off of forskolin, current responses returned to control values within 5–20 min. Forskolin treatment induced nearly 83% inhibition of threshold Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 B). Current integrals were, on average, reduced to 16.4 ± 9% of control values by forskolin treatment (p ≤ 0.0003,n = 10). Removal of forskolin restored the current integrals over 5–20 min to a level not significantly different from control values (150.7 ± 23%). Next, we tested whether PKA activation was required for the inhibitory effect of cAMP. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), inclusion of a specific, competitive PKA inhibitor, Rp-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophoshorothioate (Rp-cAMPS) (334 μm), in the patch pipette solution largely abrogated the forskolin-induced inhibition of spike activity, and the current integrals following forskolin treatment were not significantly different from control values (107 ± 7 and 124 ± 27%, respectively; n = 5). Taken together, these data strongly indicate that intracellular rises in cAMP negatively modulate InsP3 induced Ca2+ release via PKA-dependent phosphoregulation of a specialized subset of InsP3R localized at the acinar cell apical pole. Because forskolin treatment likely induces a spatially uniform rise in cAMP, we suggest that signaling specificity is achieved not in the production of cAMP but in the compartmentalization of its effector, PKA. This co-localization has been shown by others to lead to rapid and efficient phosphorylation of a specific substrate, even on a uniform background of cAMP levels (40Tibbs V.C. Gray P.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high degree of functional and structural organization exhibited by these polarized cells, we hypothesized that PKA might be targeted to the trigger zone to provide spatiotemporal control over the phosphoregulation of Ca2+ release. PKA targeting is often achieved by the association of the regulatory R subunit dimer with an protein kinase A-anchoring protein bearing a specific subcellular localization signal (46Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 48Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical methods were performed to visualize the subcellular distribution of PKA in acinar cells using RIIα and RIIβ subunit-specific monoclonal anitbodies. The RIIα subunit exhibited diffuse cytosolic distribution (not shown). In contrast, the RIIβ subunit displayed a pattern of labeling that was confined to the apical and granular region of the cells (Fig. 5). This pattern of staining overlaps and is consistent with localization of PKA to the sites of InsP3-induced Ca2+release. It is within this region that the majority of InsP3R co-localize with a highly structured sublumenal actin web (18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether RII subunits form molecular associations with type III InsP3R, we immunoprecipitated proteins from acinar cell extracts using a monoclonal antibody to the type III InsP3R. The enriched proteins were separated, and the Western blots were probed with actin, RIIα, and RIIβ subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6 A, actin and both RII subunits immunoprecipitated with the type III InsP3R, suggesting that PKA is targeted to its potential kinase substrate, either directly or by a common tethering mechanism, possibly through actin or actin-binding proteins. To demonstrate specificity for the immunoprecipitation of PKA, lysates immunoprecipitated with type III InsP3R and containing RIIβ (Fig. 6 B, lane 1) were probed with a polyclonal antiserum recognizing all heterotrimeric G protein β subunits. Although Gβ subunits were identified in whole pancreatic acinar cell lysates (Fig. 6 B, lane 4), no Gβ could be demonstrated to co-immunoprecipitate with type III InsP3R antiserum (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2and 3). To investigate whether PKA was associated selectively with any particular InsP3R type, individual receptors were immunoprecipitated from pancreatic lysates using subtype-specific antiserum (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Probing of separated proteins with the antiserum used to immunoprecipitate confirmed that individual InsP3R types had been immunoprecipitated (Fig.6 C, upper panel). In lane A, specific polyclonal antiserum raised against the C terminus of type I receptor were used (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In lane B, a polyclonal antiserum versus the type II receptor (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and inlane C, a monoclonal antibodies specific for type III receptor were utilized. Each antiserum was utilized in excess and is known to effectively and selectively immunoprecipitate its respective receptor (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the lower panel, the same immune complexes were probed with antiserum raised against PKA-RIIβ. Only samples immunoprecipitated with type III InsP3R contained PKA-RIIβ. These data strongly suggest that PKA is targeted specifically to type III receptors and, thus, is ideally placed to mediate rapid, specific phosphorylation of this receptor. To test the functional significance of type III InsP3R-PKA co-localization, we disrupted PKA targeting in patch clamped acinar cells using a synthetic peptide containing the functional RII binding motif of the thyroid protein kinase A-anchoring protein, Ht31. The Ht31 peptide has been shown to be an efficient and specific inhibitor of RII protein kinase A-anchoring protein interactions (46Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 48Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.7 A shows that inclusion of 30 μm Ht31 in the pipette solution could block the forskolin-induced inhibition of the apical Ca2+ release. As shown in Fig. 7 B, no statistically significant inhibition was observed following continuous treatment with forskolin for 5 or 10 min or following removal of forskolin, compared with control responses (76.8 ± 15, 49.5 ± 27, and 139 ± 30% of control, respectively; n = 9). Although our experiments provide evidence that the targeted phosphorylation of a subset of InsP3R exerts negative regulatory control over local Ca2+ release events, we wondered whether this modulation could account for the distinctive patterns of Ca2+oscillations induced by CCK or carbachol (CCh). Application of physiological doses of ACh or CCh to pancreatic acinar cells generates sinusoidal [Ca2+]c oscillations with frequencies of 4–6/min that are superimposed on an elevated base line (11Osipchuk Y.V. Wakui M. Yule D.I. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, CCK application induces oscillations consisting of base-line spikes of much longer period (1–2/min) (12Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 50Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. Wakui M. Yule D.I. Petersen C.C. Toescu E.C. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To address this relationship, we tested whether PKA-dependent phosphorylation could convert CCh-induced oscillations into a pattern that resembled CCK-induced oscillations. Intact acinar cells were treated with low doses of either CCh or CCK to induce [Ca2+]c oscillations and the Δ[Ca2+]c monitored with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, prior to and following application of 60 μm dbcAMP. As shown in the representative trace in Fig.8 A, introduction of dbcAMP reduced both spike amplitude and the plateau component (defined as the average intra-spike level) and slowed the frequency of [Ca2+]c oscillations, suggesting that activation of PKA was sufficient to shift the CCh-induced pattern of oscillations to one that was more “CCK-like”. As expected, dbcAMP had little effect on CCK-induced [Ca2+]c oscillations (Fig.8 B), where presumably the InsP3R is already in a phosphorylated state. Analysis of the oscillation frequencies and plateau levels of Δ[Ca2+]c induced by these agonists are shown in Fig. 8 (C and D). Numerous factors have been proposed to provide a mechanism underlying agonist-specific [Ca2+]c oscillations observed in pancreatic acinar cells (51Petersen O.H. Cancela J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 488-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 52Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These include the utilization by CCK receptor signaling of alternative second messengers such as cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Although no data are available regarding the ability of agonists to stimulate levels of these putative messengers, significant modulation of Ca2+ signaling has been reported (25Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 53Cancela J.M. Petersen O.H. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 746-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is clear that if the levels of these molecules are modulated by agonist stimulation, it must be through Gαq activation, because both CCK and muscarinic signaling are abolished by maneuvers antagonizing Gαq function.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also suggested that pancreatic secretagogue receptors interact with differing RGS proteins to play a role in modulating signaling events (56Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M.

Modulating the kinetics of InsP3 production at the level of the cell surface receptors would be expected to have significant effects on the generation of [Ca2+]csignals. Although the data presented in this study do not preclude any of the aforementioned proposals, selective modulation of the initial Δ[Ca2+]c by PKA appears to contribute significantly to shaping the Ca2+ signal. We conclude that targeted, PKA-mediated phosphorylation specifically controls the functioning of a discrete subset of intracellular Ca2+ release channels that act as the initial trigger for InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. Our data suggest that the type III InsP3R, abundant in the apical trigger zone, fulfills this role. We contend that the negative allosteric modulation of the type III InsP3R contributes significantly to the characteristic Ca2+ oscillations induced by CCK. Given that most cells have surface receptors that can couple to multiple G protein families (58Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 59Bugrim A.E. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), cross-talk between divergent signaling pathways to modulate Ca2+ signaling at the level of the Ca2+ release channel is likely to be a widespread and important mechanism by which information can be encoded for the selective activation of distinct physiological end points.

These processes are regulated by growth factors and cytokines. One of the markers of activated keratinocytes is keratin K6. We used a novel organ culture system to show that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induces the expression of K6 protein and mRNA in human skin. Multiple isoforms of K6 are encoded by distinct genes and have distinct patterns of expression. By having shown previously that proliferative signals, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), induce expression of the cytoskeletal protein keratin K6b, we here demonstrate that the same isoform, K6b, is also induced by TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine. Specifically, TNFα induces the transcription of the K6b gene promoter. By using co-transfection, specific inhibitors, and antisense oligonucleotides, we have identified NFκB and C/EBPβ as the transcription factors that convey the TNFα signal. Both transcription factors are necessary for the induction of K6b by TNFα and act as a complex, although only C/EBPβ binds the K6b promoter DNA. By using transfection, site-directed mutagenesis, and footprinting, we have mapped the site that responds to TNFα, NFκB, and C/EBPβ. This site is separate from the one responsive to EGF and AP1. Our results show that the proinflammatory (TNFα) and the proliferative (EGF) signals in epidermis separately and independently regulate the expression of the same K6b keratin isoform. Thus, the cytoskeletal responses in epidermal cells can be precisely tuned by separate proliferative and inflammatory signals to fit the nature of the injuries that caused them.

These responses are coordinated and orchestrated by growth factors and cytokines that carry signals from cells to cells (3Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1998; 17: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes produce paracrine signals to alert fibroblasts, endothelial cells, melanocytes, and lymphocytes, as well as autocrine signals targeted at neighboring keratinocytes. In response to such signals keratinocytes produce and release additional signaling molecules, increase the levels of their cell surface receptors, and change their cytoskeleton. The most prominent cytoskeletal proteins in keratinocytes are keratins. The basal layer of the epidermis produces keratins K5 and K14; the differentiating, suprabasal layers produce K1 and K10, and the activated keratinocytes express keratins K6, K16, and K17 (4Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 5Navarro J.M. Casatorres J. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21362-21367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These three keratins are markers of inflammatory and hyperproliferative processes. Healthy interfollicular epidermis does not contain K6, K16, or K17; however, these keratins are constitutively expressed in the outer root sheet of the hair follicle, the nail bed, oral epithelia, and some other tissues (reviewed in Ref. 6Schweizer J. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 33-72Google Scholar). The expression of keratins K6 and K16 can be disconnected from proliferation per se, and cultured keratinocytes express K6 even when their proliferation is inhibited (7Wetzels R.H.W. Kuijpers H.J. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Troyanovsky S.M. Holland R. van Haelst U.J. Ramaekers F.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 751-763PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of K6 and K16 keratins could be a marker of inflammation. In vitro, when grown in cell culture as monolayers, keratinocytes are already activated and hyperproliferative, expressing copious amounts of K6 keratin (8Schermer A. Jester J.V. Hardy C. Milano D. Sun T.T. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, convenient in vivo systems for analysis of the effects of TNFα and other growth factors and cytokines in human skin have not been described. Therefore, we developed an elegant and convenient “propior vivo” experimental system, using organ culture explants of human skin specimens otherwise discarded during surgery (9Kataranovski M. Karadaglic D. Acta Dermato-Venerologica A. P. A. 1999; 8: 131-140Google Scholar). We incubated such biopsies of human skin for relatively short times in minimal keratinocyte culture medium to which we added TNFα.1 In this system we demonstrated the specific induction of K6 keratin protein and mRNA expression by TNFα, without the frequently concomitant proliferative signals. The specific function of the K6 keratin is not fully understood, but curiously, there are multiple K6 genes in mammals, encoding virtually identical proteins (10Takahashi K. Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18581-18592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Takahashi K. Yan B. Yamanishi K. Imamura S. Coulombe P.A. Genomics. 1998; 53: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations in K6akeratin lead to pachyonychia congenita Type I,whereas those in K6b lead to pachyonychia congenita Type II, reflecting the slightly different expression patterns of the two genes (12Bowden P.E. Haley J.L. Kansky A. Rothnagel J.A. Jones D.O. Turner R.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Smith F.J. Jonkman M.F. van Goor H. Coleman C.M. Covello S.P. Uitto J. McLean W.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The paralogous genes are differentially expressed in human and in murine tissues, although their expression is generally restricted to the suprabasal layers of stratified epithelia (11Takahashi K. Yan B. Yamanishi K. Imamura S. Coulombe P.A. Genomics. 1998; 53: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi K. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol.

Differentiation. 1999; 65: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This poses an interesting conundrum: if both proliferative and proinflammatory signals induce K6 expression, is the same K6 protein induced by both, or does one of the K6 genes respond to the proliferative and the other to the proinflammatory stimuli? Our previous results have demonstrated that EGF or TGFα, the proliferative signals, induce the expression of keratins K6b and K16 (17Jiang C.K. Flanagan S. Ohtsuki M. Shuai K. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4759-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Jiang C.K. Magnaldo T. Ohtsuki M. Freedberg I.M. Bernerd F. Blumenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6786-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, focusing on the K6b keratin, we decided to determine whether TNFα, which is a strong proinflammatory but not a proliferative signal in keratinocytes (19Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), affects its expression. TNFα is produced by a wide variety of cells in response to infection or injury, primarily macrophages and monocytes but also by epithelial cells including epidermal keratinocytes. A low level of TNFα is present in the upper layers of the healthy epidermis, but its synthesis and release from keratinocytes is greatly augmented in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, infection, UV irradiation, etc. (20Oxholm A.

Lancet. 1991; 337: 211-214Abstract PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In these pathological conditions, TNFα activates immune responses through inducing production of proteins such as amphiregulin, TGFα, IL-1α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, EGF receptor, and ICAM1 (22Woodworth C.D.

The NFκB family includes the proteins p65, p50, and c-Rel, which both homo- and heterodimerize among themselves (34Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are stored latent in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory protein, IκB. TNFα causes activation of IKKs, kinases that phosphorylate IκB and induce its degradation, which results in activation and nuclear translocation of the NFκB protein (28Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

In epidermis in vivo NFκB is present in all layers but is nuclear only in the suprabasal ones; this suggests a role for NFκB in epidermal differentiation (44Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). On the other hand, constitutive activation of NFκB in IκB knockout mice results in normal epidermal development and differentiation but a widespread, lethal dermatitis in the first few days of life (45Klement J.F.

To determine the roles of TNFα-activated transcription factors in regulating K6b keratin gene expression, we have used the clone containing the promoter of the human K6b keratin gene (59Bernerd F. Magnaldo T. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 187-199PubMed Google Scholar, 60Ma S. Rao L. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Gene Expr. 1997; 6: 361-370PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter contains several sites that bind transcription factors responsive to extracellular stimuli (5Navarro J.M. Casatorres J. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol.

By using transfection experiments, gel shifts, and footprinting, we have mapped the TNFα-responsive element. We determined that both NFκB and C/EBPβ act through the same DNA sequence. Only C/EBPβ binds this DNA directly and NFκB does not. By using specific inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides, we have shown that both NFκB and C/EBPβ are essential for the regulation by TNFα, and we propose that a complex containing NFκB and C/EBPβ binds the K6bpromoter through the C/EBPβ DNA binding domain to convey the TNFα signal. Finally, we physically separated the DNA element responsive to TNFα, NFκB, and C/EBPβ from the element responsive to EGF and AP1, thus showing that the inflammation and hyperproliferation in keratinocytes are distinct and independent processes. Pieces of normal human skin were obtained immediately after surgery. They were cut into pieces approximately 5 mm3 and incubated in keratinocyte basal medium, KBM, (keratinocyte-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.) with or without TNFα (50 ng/ml, Intergen), in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. Generally, we use 24-well culture dishes with up to 5 pieces in the same well and enough medium to just cover the explants. The explants were mounted in tissue Tec OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and frozen. Sections, 4–6 μm thick, were obtained with a cryostat (Miles Laboratories), fixed with methanol/acetone for 10 min, incubated with anti-keratin K6 antibody (Progen Biotechnik GMBH) at 4 °C overnight, treated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vecstatin ABC-mouse IgG kit from Vector Laboratories), at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with ABC complex (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h, and treated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (Dojindo Corp.) and 0.01% H2O2 in Tris, pH 7.6, for 2 min. The samples were observed and photographed under the light microscope (Microphot-FXA, Nikon). Additional antibodies used were from Monosan, Uden Holland; antibodies specific for keratins K5, K8, K10, and K18 were from Progen, Heidelberg, Germany; antibodies specific for keratins K19 and K17 were from Neomarkers, Freemont, CA; and antibodies specific for K14 and for NFκB and C/EBPβ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Explanted skin samples were incubated with or without TNFα for 16 h and harvested, and total RNAs were isolated utilizing RNeasy RNA extraction kit from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). Between 1 and 15 μg of RNA were subjected to RT-PCR, with Access RT-PCR system from Promega (Madison, WI). By optimizing the number of cycles (30 cycles) and application amount of total RNA (1–9 μg), we achieved linear correlation between the amount of RNA added and the density of bands. We used commercial primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and the K6 keratin primers are given in Table I. The PCR products were subjected to agarose-gel electrophoresis, visualized with ethidium bromide (Sigma) with a transilluminator from Ultraviolet Products (Upland, CA), and photographed with a photographing unit from Polaroid (Germany). The densities of bands were quantified by utilizing an image scanner (GT-9000 from Epson, Tokyo, Japan).Table IOligonucleotides used in PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, footprinting, RT-PCR, and antisense experimentsK6ForwardTTTGGATCCCACTCAGGGCATTGTCGATAK6ReverseTTTGTCGACCATGGTTCCAGAGATGAGAGD268TTTGGATCCAACTTCATGAATTD193TTTGGATCCACTAAAGGAAGCGAAAD172TTTGGATCCAATCTCGGTATTTCATD138TTTGGATCCAGGTGTGAATCTCACD111TTTGGATCCAGCCCTTCCCAACCI216TTTAAGCTTGGAGGCAGGAACATTI193TTTAAGCTTACTAAAGGAAGCGAAAI131TTTGGATCCACACCTGCATTATTACI96TTTGGATCCAGGTTGGGAAGGGCTGAP1-forwardCGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAAAP1-reverseTTCCGGCTGACTCATCAAGCGC/EBPTGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCANFκB-forwardGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACTNFκB-reverseAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGCK6 footprint shortATTTTGCCCTGACTAAAGGAAGCGAAAAATGCAATCTCGGTATTTCATAACTTTGTAATAATGCK6 footprint longATTTTGCCCTGACTAAAGGAAGCGAAAAATGCAATCTCGGTATTTCATAACTTTGTAATAATGC AGGTGTGAATCTCACTAK6 footprint-reverseATTACAAAAGTTATGAAATAAS-NFκBTGGATCATCTTCTGCCATTCT *PhosphorothioateAS-IκBGCGCTCGGCCGCCTGGAACATGGC *PhosphorothioateAS-C/EBPβCATGAACGCGGGTGCCCGGGGAGGG *PhosphorothioateAS-NCoRCATTATCAGTAAAGAAGTCC *PhosphorothioateK6RT-PCR-forwardGAGATCGACCACGTCAAGAAGCK6RT-PCR-reverseTGACTTGTCCAACGCCTTCG Open table in a new tab Human epidermal keratinocytes in the fourth passage were plated on glass coverslips and grown for 24 h in KBM.

As the secondary antibodies we used anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate absorbed with human serum proteins or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-fluorescence isothiocyanate conjugate absorbed with human serum proteins (both from Sigma).

Additional K6b promoter constructs were prepared by PCR withThermus aquaticus DNA polymerase under conditions suggested by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). All DNA primers, including the phosphorothioate-modified ones used in antisense experiments, were either synthesized on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Gene-Plus Synthesizer or provided by the Kaplan Comprehensive Cancer Center Core Facility. They are listed in Table I. To create the deletions of the K6b promoter we used PCR with K6CAT as a template, a common proximal primer starting just upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon and a series of nested distal oligonucleotides (Table I). To create point mutations in the responsive element, we performed a two-round PCR mutagenesis procedure (65Tomic M. Sunjevaric I. Savtchenko E.S. Blumenberg M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To clone the responsive element into a heterologous vector, we amplified the DNA using PCR and cloned it into the enhancer trap TK-CAT vector (Promega). The CAT activity of the resulting plasmid was compared with that of control plasmid TK-CAT (Promega). The sequences of the DNAs inserts were confirmed by the Kaplan Comprehensive Cancer Center Core Facility, using the dideoxy plasmid sequencing method. All DNAs used in transfections were purified using the Magic Megapreps DNA purification system (Promega). Normal epidermal keratinocytes from human foreskin were a generous gift from Dr. M. Simon. The cultures were initiated using 3T3 feeder layers as described (66Simon M. Green H. Cell. 1984; 36: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 67Randolph R.K. Simon M. J.

Once thawed, the keratinocytes were grown without feeder cells in defined serum-free keratinocyte growth medium, KGM, supplemented with bovine pituitary extract epidermal growth factor, insulin, thyroid hormone, and hydrocortisone (keratinocyte-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were expanded through two 1:4 passages before transfection and transfected at ∼80% confluence. Transfections using Polybrene with Me2SO shock were performed as described previously (68Jiang C.K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Invest.

Each transfection contained either 10 μg/dish of K6CAT or 15 μg/dish of deletion and mutant constructs as well as 3 μg/dish of pRSVZ. The cells were incubated in KGM 18 h after the transfection, and then TNFα was added in combination with various other agents, as indicated. The cells were usually harvested 24 h later. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (68Jiang C.K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed 14–18 h after transfection, and cells were either left untreated for another 24 h or stimulated with TNFα.

All CAT values were normalized for transfection efficiency by calculating the ratio of CAT activity to β-galactosidase in each transfected plate. Each transfection experiment was separately performed three or more times, with each data point resulting from duplicate or triplicate transfections.

However, several studies have now shown that significant pools of hyaluronan are also present intracellularly, but its function therein is unknown. One avenue of investigation that may assist in defining the function of intracellular hyaluronan is to identify intracellular hyaluronan-binding proteins. In previous studies we identified CDC37, a cell cycle regulatory protein, using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a novel group of hyaluronan-binding proteins. In this study, we have identified a second hyaluronan-binding protein with this antibody and characterized its properties. This protein, which we have termed IHABP4, was also found to be an intracellular and a specific hyaluronan-binding protein, containing several hyaluronan-binding motifs: (R/K)X7(R/K) (where R/K denotes arginine or lysine and X denotes non-acidic amino acids). Furthermore, we have determined the gene organization ofIHABP4 and cloned cDNAs for the chick, mouse, and human homologs. Comparison of the deduced chick, mouse, and human protein sequences showed that the hyaluronan-binding motifs, (R/K)X7(R/K), in these sequences are conserved; both chick and mouse IHABP4 were shown directly to bind hyaluronan. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescent localization of epitope-tagged IHABP4 indicated that it is mainly present in the cytoplasm. These data support the possibility that intracellular hyaluronan and its binding proteins may play important roles in cell behavior.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), have raised an interesting question. Does intracellular hyaluronan, like extracellular hyaluronan, play an important role in regulating cellular behavior through interactions with IHABPs? Recently, it was reported that rapid uptake of Texas red-labeled hyaluronan and its subsequent accumulation in the cell processes, perinuclear area, and nucleus of transformed cells were associated with enhanced cell motility (13Collis L. Hall C. Lange L. Ziebell M. Prestwich R. Turley E.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, careful examination confirmed the intracellular localization of endogenous hyaluronan as well as hyaluronan-binding sites and demonstrated dynamic changes in their pattern of distribution during proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These data suggest strongly that intracellular hyaluronan has important roles in cellular processes.Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb), IVd4, which recognizes a novel group of chick HABPs (14Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have previously identified and characterized CDC37, a cell cycle regulatory protein (9Grammatikakis N.

Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3598-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized a cDNA, LH21, that encodes a second novel chick HABP recognized by mAb IVd4, using similar strategies as described previously (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A. Yoneda M., Yu, Q. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Huang L. Grammatikakis N. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3598-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This HABP, like CDC37, is also an intracellular protein containing multiple hyaluronan binding motifs, (R/K)X7(R/K), in which B denotes arginine or lysine and X denotes any amino acid except glutamic or aspartic acid (16Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have cloned the mouse and human homologs of this gene; shown that the hyaluronan binding motifs are conserved among the deduced chick, mouse, and human protein sequences; and demonstrated that the chick and mouse proteins bind hyaluronan specifically. These results imply that the hyaluronan-binding properties of this protein have functional importance. We have termed this protein IHABP4, because three other IHABPs have so far been characterized: CDC37 (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A. Yoneda M., Yu, Q. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), RHAMM/IHABP (10Entwistle J. Hall C.L. Turley E.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 11Assmann V. Marshall J.F. Fieber C. Hofmann M. Hart I.R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized a novel and specific IHABP. Until the function of this protein is better understood, we propose to call it IHABP4, because three other IHABPs have been convincingly characterized, namely CDC37 (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A. Yoneda M., Yu, Q. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), RHAMM/IHABP (10Entwistle J. Hall C.L. Turley E.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 11Assmann V. Marshall J.F. Fieber C. Hofmann M. Hart I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and P32 (12Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IHABP4 contains multiple hyaluronan-binding motifs throughout its sequence, notably one stretch with three overlapping motifs in the middle region of the protein sequence. These motifs are conserved in the chick, human, and mouse sequences, suggesting that IHABP4 may have a hyaluronan-related function. This conclusion is supported by our data showing that both chick and mouse IHABP4 bind hyaluronan in a specific fashion. However, regions within IHABP4 may be related to putative nucleic acid-binding proteins, e.g. theDrosophila vig gene product. Although IHABP4 does not contain an established RNA recognition domain, we tested IHABP4 for RNA-binding activity and found it to exhibit weak binding compared with hyaluronan. Nevertheless, until further functional work is carried out, the question of whether hyaluronan is the natural ligand for IHABP4 must remain open. The homologies found between IHABP4, the human protein CGI-55, and the above-mentioned Drosophila proteins suggest that IHABP4 belongs to a family of related genes.Unlike the other known IHABPs referred to above, IHABP4 mRNA is not ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. IHABP4 mRNA is found at significant levels in adult heart, brain, liver, kidney, and testis, as well as in embryonic tissues, but not in adult spleen, lung, or skeletal muscle. A very prominent transcript that is smaller than that found elsewhere was seen only in testis. It is not yet known whether a different protein product from that found in this study results from this smaller transcript. The human homolog, also known as Ki-1/57, is expressed in activated, but not resting, human lymphocytes and is enriched in some tumor cells (21Kobarg J. Schnittger S. Fonatsch C. Lemke H. Bowen M.A. Buck F. Hansen H.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). Obviously, to understand the function of this novel HABP, further investigation will be needed, including examination of the expression levels of its mRNA and protein in various normal cells versus corresponding tumor cells, as well as its interaction with other regulatory or structural protein(s). In reference to the latter, previous evidence suggests that Ki-1/57 is associated with intracellular kinase activity (21Kobarg J. Schnittger S. Fonatsch C. Lemke H. Bowen M.A. Buck F. Hansen H.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar).A considerable amount of evidence has shown that sulfated GAG chains and proteoglycans are present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of a variety of cell types and that in some cases these intracellular GAG populations are likely to be involved in regulation of cell behavior. For example, it has been shown that heparan sulfate can act as atrans-repressor that interferes with the action of c-Fos and c-Jun on transcription events in vitro, and preliminary evidence has suggested that endogenous nuclear heparan sulfate has such a regulatory function in vivo (25Busch S.J. Martin G.A. Barnhart R.L. Mano M. Cardin A. Jackson R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In support of this possibility, specific inhibitory subpopulations of heparan sulfate are targeted to the nucleus during cell proliferation (26Fedarko N.S Conrad H.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Fedarko N.S. Ishihara M. Conrad H.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, dynamic changes occur in the levels of biglycan and glypican proteoglycans in the nucleus during the cell cycle, and the core proteins of these proteoglycans have been shown to contain nuclear localization motifs (28Liang Y. Haring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There is also definitive evidence that heparin is essential for retention of several proteases present within secretory granules of mast cells (29Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).It has become increasingly evident that hyaluronan is also present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other organelles in various types of tissues and cells (5Furukawa K. Terayama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Ripellino J.A. Bailo M. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Eggli P.S. Graber W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide evidence that exogenous hyaluronan added to transformed 10T1/2 cells accumulates in multiple subcellular compartments and directly affects cell motility (13Collis L. Hall C. Lange L. Ziebell M. Prestwich R. Turley E.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that there is a dramatic increase in endogenous intracellular hyaluronan and redistribution from nucleolus to cytoplasm (mainly the perinuclear area) and interchromosomal regions during mitosis of mitogen-stimulated smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There is also an increase in pericellular hyaluronan during cell division (30Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 31Brecht M. Mayer U. Schlosser E. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar); however, extracellular hyaluronan that becomes internalized after addition to dividing cells is distributed in a different pattern to that of endogenous intracellular hyaluronan (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similar changes in the amounts and distribution of intracellular hyaluronan-binding sites also occur in dividing cells (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest that Ki-1/57 is localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus of Hodgkin's and myeloma cell lines (32Rohde D. Hansen H. Hafner M. Lange H. Mielke V. Hansmann M.L. Lemke H. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 473-482PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that hyaluronan and Ki-1/57, i.e. IHABP4, may have overlapping distributions. Future studies will establish whether hyaluronan and IHABP4 interact during cell division.The data discussed above suggest a possible role for intracellular hyaluronan and IHABPs in cell division. However, it is not clear the extent to which hyaluronan is directly targeted to various intracellular sites after synthesis rather than being first secreted and then re-internalized. Synthesis and interactions of pericellular hyaluronan have been shown to promote cell detachment and rounding during mitosis (30Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 31Brecht M. Mayer U. Schlosser E. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), anchorage-independent growth in culture (33Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar,34Peterson R.M., Yu, Q. Stamenkovic I. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and tumor growth and progression in vivo (33Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 34Peterson R.M., Yu, Q. Stamenkovic I. Toole B.P. Am. J.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Yet hyaluronan internalization has also been implicated in some of these processes (36Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 38Culty M. Shizari M. Thompson E.W. Underhill C.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Liu D. Pearlman E. Diaconu E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Willson J. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7832-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Possibly, a dynamic balance between pericellular hyaluronan and intracellular hyaluronan exists, and hyaluronan re-internalization might contribute to this balance. This dynamic balance could in turn be involved in regulating various cellular behaviors. In this regard it is noteworthy that internalization into endothelial cells of a complex of heparan sulfate-proteoglycan and a heparin-binding protein targets the latter to mitochondria, consequently preventing apoptosis (40Olofsson A.M. Vestberg M. Herwald H. Rygaard J. David G. Arfors K.E. Linde V. Flodgaard H. Dedio J. Muller-Esterl W. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, as mentioned above, exogenously added hyaluronan can be targeted to various intracellular compartments and results in increased cell motility (13Collis L. Hall C. Lange L. Ziebell M. Prestwich R. Turley E.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, targeting of hyaluronan to the nucleus was blocked by (R/K)X7(R/K)-containing peptide in the latter study, suggesting the possible involvement of an IHABP. Although re-internalization of hyaluronan, and other GAGs, is likely to contribute to intracellular pools, the question of how these polymers reach sites such as the cytosol, mitochondria, or nucleus remains unclear. One possibility is that they are transported in a retrograde manner through the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol in a similar manner to some protein toxins or by other less understood, “non-classical” routes (41Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 42Cleves A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although re-internalization subsequent to secretion is one likely pathway whereby GAGs become localized to intracellular sites, recent evidence (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) indicates that it is unlikely to be the sole pathway for distribution of intracellular hyaluronan. Another possible mechanism for intracellular targeting of hyaluronan arises from its unique mechanism of synthesis. Hyaluronan is synthesized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, and secretion takes place by extrusion during polymer elongation (43Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that a subpopulation of hyaluronan polymer is directly deposited in the cytosol rather than crossing the plasma membrane; this in turn may be regulated by interaction with IHABPs.The most important, and puzzling, question arising from the various studies discussed above is the exact mechanism whereby intracellular hyaluronan might influence cellular events. It is possible that the high level of hydration associated with hyaluronan (2Toole B.P. Iozzo R. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, NY2000: 61-92Google Scholar) also plays a role in structural changes in the cytoskeleton or nuclear matrix during cell division or motility, e.g. in regulating cell shape or volume changes. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that hyaluronan-associated changes in hydration play an important role in growth plate expansion during bone development (44Pavasant P. Shizari T. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar) but that most of the hyaluronan at this site is intracellular (45Takada Y. Sakiyama H. Kuriiwa K. Masuda R. Inoue N. Nakagawa K. Itano N. Saito T. Yamada T. Kimata K. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the role of intracellular hyaluronan, it is to be expected that its functions will be regulated and/or mediated by IHABPs. However, direct evidence for intracellular interaction in situ and for the functional consequence of these interactions is needed to elucidate this possibility. Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1 that is present in extracellular and pericellular matrices. On the basis of its unique physical and chemical properties, it has been well documented that hyaluronan plays a critical role in dynamic structural changes within extracellular matrices during development and tissue remodeling, as well as in maintenance of mechanical properties and homeostasis of many tissues (1Toole B.P. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 430-433Google Scholar, 2Toole B.P. Iozzo R. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, NY2000: 61-92Google Scholar). Interactions of hyaluronan with hyaluronan-binding proteins (HABPs) are involved in establishing and modifying the structural properties of extracellular matrices. Furthermore, it is increasingly appreciated that hyaluronan is a crucial pericellular and cell surface component that actively participates in regulating cell behavior through its interactions with cell surface HABPs such as CD44 (1Toole B.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), have raised an interesting question. Does intracellular hyaluronan, like extracellular hyaluronan, play an important role in regulating cellular behavior through interactions with IHABPs? Recently, it was reported that rapid uptake of Texas red-labeled hyaluronan and its subsequent accumulation in the cell processes, perinuclear area, and nucleus of transformed cells were associated with enhanced cell motility (13Collis L. Hall C. Lange L. Ziebell M. Prestwich R. Turley E.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, careful examination confirmed the intracellular localization of endogenous hyaluronan as well as hyaluronan-binding sites and demonstrated dynamic changes in their pattern of distribution during proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (8Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These data suggest strongly that intracellular hyaluronan has important roles in cellular processes. Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb), IVd4, which recognizes a novel group of chick HABPs (14Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have previously identified and characterized CDC37, a cell cycle regulatory protein (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A.

In the present study, we have characterized a cDNA, LH21, that encodes a second novel chick HABP recognized by mAb IVd4, using similar strategies as described previously (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A. Yoneda M., Yu, Q. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16198-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Huang L. Grammatikakis N. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3598-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This HABP, like CDC37, is also an intracellular protein containing multiple hyaluronan binding motifs, (R/K)X7(R/K), in which B denotes arginine or lysine and X denotes any amino acid except glutamic or aspartic acid (16Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have cloned the mouse and human homologs of this gene; shown that the hyaluronan binding motifs are conserved among the deduced chick, mouse, and human protein sequences; and demonstrated that the chick and mouse proteins bind hyaluronan specifically. These results imply that the hyaluronan-binding properties of this protein have functional importance. We have termed this protein IHABP4, because three other IHABPs have so far been characterized: CDC37 (9Grammatikakis N. Grammatikakis A. Yoneda M., Yu, Q. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of non-human primates has served as a useful model for understanding AIDS pathogenesis in humans. Research on several genetically divergent SIV isolates has revealed that SIV uses CCR5, and not CXCR4, for entry. CEM x174, a human lymphoid cell line, has been routinely used to cultivate and maintain various SIV strains. However, questions have arisen about how CEM x174, which reportedly was unable to express detectable amounts of CCR5 transcripts, efficiently supports the growth of SIV. In searching for an answer, we resorted to a sensitive competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure in an attempt to detect as well as quantify the amount of CCR5 expression. Here we present our findings, which indicate that CEM x174 indeed expresses CCR5 and that the amount of CCR5 is increased in cells pretreated with morphine. These results correlate well with our previous observations that morphine treatment causes CEM x174 cells to be more susceptible to SIV infection. Similar morphine effect was not observed on CEM x174 cells infected with simian retroviruses, which do not depend on CCR5 for entry. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism whereby opiate drug users render themselves more susceptible to HIV infection, thereby explaining the vast prevalence of HIV infection among endemic drug use populations.

The feasibility and success of human studies have always been hampered by the complexity of an individual's history of intravenous drug use. Thus, rhesus monkey treated with opioids and infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)1 provides an excellent animal model for studying drug abuse and AIDS under a controlled manner (1Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Addiction Biol. 1997; 2: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using this animal system we have previously found that monkeys dependent upon opioid administration and subsequently infected with SIV will have a faster rate of viral replication in comparison with drug-naive, virus-infected monkeys (1Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Addiction Biol. 1997; 2: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CEM x174 is a human lymphoid cell line (2Salter R.D. Howell D.N. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) commonly used to co-cultivate SIV isolated from infected monkeys. The syncytium formation of SIV-infected CEM x174 cells was found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of morphine sulfate, with a concomitant increase in the activity of cellular reverse transcriptase and the expression of SIV p27 core antigen (3Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Chemokines are small 6–10-kDa polypeptides that are synthesized in response to infection and that function mainly as chemoattractants for phagocytic cells, recruiting monocytes and neutrophils from the vascular system to sites of infection (4Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Further studies on the effects of opioids on immune cells revealed that the addition of opioids to the chemokines interleukin-8, RANTES, or MIP-1β reduces the ability of monkey neutrophils and monocytes to migrate toward these chemokines (5Choi Y. Chuang L.F. Lam K.M. Kung H.-F. Wang J.M. Osburn B.I. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1999; 13: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction occurs instantaneously, without the inclusion of a cell opioid preincubation step (6Miyagi T. Chuang L.F. Lam K.M. Kung H.-F. Wang J.M. Osburn B.I. Chuang R.Y. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that the presence of opioids during SIV/HIV infection immediately disrupts the body's first line of defense against harmful external pathogens by disrupting the chemotaxis ability of immune cells toward harmful pathogens. Such observations may provide an indirect mechanism to explain why primates or humans dependent upon intravenous drug administration have a higher probability of developing into a full-blown disease than non-drug users when exposed to a viral challenge (1Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Addiction Biol. 1997; 2: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Mazzone A. Mazzucchelli I. Fossati G. Gritti D. Fea M. Ricevuti G. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Chemokines act on receptors that belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family whose members contain seven transmembrane domains (4Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Activation, desensitization, and resensitization of receptor proteins are thought to involve the activity of receptor-specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins (8Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Chemokines such as RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV disease; they may be selectively secreted from infected individuals and induce inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (9Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). It was later found that chemokine receptors (especially CCR5 and CXCR4) are coreceptors for HIV or SIV entry (10Lee B. Montaner L.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6509-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, regions in CCR5 or CXCR4 required for ligand (chemokine) binding and coreceptor activity are not identical and only partially overlap (10Lee B. Montaner L.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was further established that in addition to blocking viral entry through steric hindrance, cognate ligand interaction with chemokine receptors has been shown to result in receptor down-regulation for CCR5 and CXCR4 (14Trkola A. Paxton W.A. Monard S.P. Hoxie J.A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Wu L. Mackay C.R. Horuk R. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 396-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SIVmac239 replicates most efficiently in the human transformed lymphoid cell line CEM x174 (15Park I.W. Steen R. Li Y. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, this cell line is routinely used for preparing high titered stocks of this virus (11Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that SIVmac239 may use CCR5, BOB (GPR15), or BONZO (STRL33) as a coreceptor for entry into various cell types, including 293T.CD4 (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), 3T3.CD4 (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and Cf2Th.CD4 (17Choe H. Farzan M. Konkel M. Martin K. Sun Y. Marcon L. Cayabyab M. Berman M. Dorf M.E. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these studies, CCR5 was a preferred coreceptor over BOB or BONZO; cells with CCR5 produced a greater amount of virus than cells with BOB or BONZO. However, CCR5 has not been identified in CEM x174 (11Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vodicka M.A. Goh W.C. Wu L.I.

Uberla K. Di Marzio P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6509-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of a study to quantify virus production in CEM x174 cells, we serendipitously found that addition of morphine sulfate to CEM x174 cell cultures significantly increases the replication of SIVmac239 (3Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The present study determines which coreceptor is responsible for the observed morphine effect on CEM x174 cells. The CEM x174 cell line, a hybrid of the human B cell line 721.174 and human T cell line CEM (2Salter R.D. Howell D.N. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mmHEPES, and penicillin and streptomycin. GHOST Parental Cell Line and GHOST Hi-5 (a GHOST cell transfectant with high CCR5 expression) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and penicillin and streptomycin. For GHOST Hi-5, the medium also contained 1 μg/ml puromycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. CEM x174 cells in culture were diluted 1:3 with fresh medium every 3–4 days. At the time of dilution, morphine sulfate, naloxone HCl, or H2O (as controls) was added, and incubation was continued for the indicated time. When naloxone was used together with morphine in an experiment, cells were first treated with naloxone HCl for 30 min at 37 °C followed by morphine treatment. A PCR fragment of CCR5 (1114 bp), BONZO (797 bp), or BOB (563 bp) was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), yielding plasmid CCR5/pCRII, BOB/pCRII, or BONZO/pCRII, which was then sequenced to prove identity (Fig.1 a). To construct competitor molecules, small internal deletions were introduced into the inserts. CCR5/pCRII was deleted 96 bp from bases 298 to 393 (inclusive), and BONZO/pCRII was deleted 125 bp from bases 145 to 269 (inclusive) using the Exo mung bean deletion kit (STRATAGENE). BOB/pCRII was deleted 63 bp from bases 404 to 466 (inclusive) after double digestion withHincII and NdeI (Fig. 1 a). Total RNA was isolated from opioid-treated or control CEM x174 cells using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). In both the reverse transcription and the PCR steps, all the reaction reagents were prepared as master mixes and then aliquoted to each tube to provide uniform reaction conditions and minimize inter-tube variations. To confirm the detection range of competitive RT-PCR, the relationship between the amount of cDNA generated and the initial concentrations of total RNA used were determined: reverse transcription was performed on 0.5, 1, and 2 μg of total RNA, and the reaction was for 30 min at 42 °C using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction mixture also contained 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 mm of each dNTP, and 7.5 nm random hexamers in a final volume of 20 μl. For PCR amplication, 20 μl of PCR Master Mix containing 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 were dispensed into tubes. To the PCR Master Mix 2 μl of the reverse transcription reaction product and various concentrations of competitor molecules were added. The PCR was performed in a M. J. Research Thermocycler PTC-200, using the following conditions: after an initial 3-min incubation at 95 °C, PCR amplification was carried out for 20 cycles (BOB), 27 cycles (BONZO), or 31 cycles (CCR5) at 95 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The last primer extension step was conducted for 10 min. The primers for BOB were 5′-CATCTGCTCTTTGGTGATG-3′ and 5′-GTATGGCTTATCATCAATCAGC-3′, corresponding to bases 66–85 and 607–628 of the published BOB sequence (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The primers for BONZO were 5′-CAGGCATCCATGAATGGGTGT-3′ and 5′-CAAGGCCTATAACTGGAACATGCTG-3′, corresponding to bases 269–289 and 1041–1065 of the published STRL33 (or BONZO) sequence (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The primers for CCR5 were 5′-GGTGGAACAAGATGGATTAT-3′ and 5′-ATGTGCACAACTCTGACTG-3′, corresponding to bases 44–63 and 1139–1157 of the published CCR5 sequence (13Kirchhoff F. Pohlmann S. Hamacher M. Means R.E. Kraus T. Uberla K. Di Marzio P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6509-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products separated on 2% agarose gel were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed under UV illumination (Fig. 1 b). The intensity of the bands on the image from Eagle Eye II Still Video System (STRATAGENE) was measured with the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health). For analyzing the results, the log of the ratio of amplified target to competitor products was graphed as a function of the known amount of competitor added to the PCR reaction (Fig. 1 c). CA-Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates) was used for the regression analysis and calculation of x intercepts. When the log ratio equals zero, the concentrations of the target (originally from the RT reaction) and the competitor are equal (Fig. 1 c). The amount of cDNA synthesized from 1 μg of the initial RNA sample was calculated from the graph (Fig. 1 c). The expression of CCR5 on CEM x174 cells treated with or without morphine was evaluated by FACS. Fluorescein-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human CCR5 (clone 45549.111) and fluorescein-labeled mouse IgG2B antibody (clone 20116.11, as a negative control) were obtained from R & D Systems. Procedures for sample staining followed the manufacturer's specifications. After the final wash, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before FACS analysis using FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The method of Western blotting has been described elsewhere (18Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26815-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-CCR5-CT for the Western analysis was obtained from ANASPEC Incorp. (San Jose, CA). Methods for the experimental infection of CEM x174 cells with SIVmac239 or SRV and the subsequent assay of the reverse transcriptase activity of the infected cultures were detailed elsewhere (3Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Torres J.V. Werner L.L. Malley A. Benjamini E. J. Med. Primatol. 1991; 20: 218-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SIVmac239 was propagated and titered in CEM x174 cells (3Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and titers for SRV serotypes 1–3 were determined by the Raji cell infectivity assay as described previously (19Torres J.V. Werner L.L. Malley A. Benjamini E. J. Med. Primatol. 1991; 20: 218-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Raji cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Fig. 2 a is a representative figure of the results from an RT-PCR analysis of CEM x174 CCR5. Using primer sequences corresponding to bases 44–63 and 1139–1157 of the published human CCR5 sequence (13Kirchhoff F. Pohlmann S. Hamacher M. Means R.E. Kraus T. Uberla K. Di Marzio P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6509-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CEM x174 cells synthesized a 1114-bp segment (lane 2) that was identical in size to the segment synthesized by GHOST Hi-5 (a GHOST cell transfectant encoding CCR5, lane 4) and that was not found in GHOST Parental cells (lane 6). Using primer pairs corresponding to bases 66–85 and 607–628 of the published BOB sequence (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and bases 269–289 and 1041–1065 of the published BONZO sequence (16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), we also found that CEM x174 cells synthesized cDNA segments of 563 and 797 bp, respectively, in length (data not shown). The cDNA synthesized in each case was sequenced to prove identity. It was found that CEM x174 cells express receptors with gene sequences identical to the published human CCR5, BOB, and BONZO sequences (13Kirchhoff F. Pohlmann S. Hamacher M. Means R.E. Kraus T. Uberla K. Di Marzio P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6509-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Deng H.K. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To further establish that the CCR5 transcripts detected in CEM x174 cells are translated into receptor proteins, we performed both flow cytometry (Fig. 2 b) and Western blot analysis (see Fig.4 b, inset) using fluorescein-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human CCR5 (for flow cytometry) and rabbit polyclonal anti-human CCR5 (for Western blot). Both procedures confirmed the presence of CCR5 molecules on CEM x174 cells (Figs. 2 b and4 b). Therefore, we demonstrated that in addition to BOB and BONZO, CEM x174 cells indeed express significant amounts of CCR5, the major coreceptor for SIVmac entry. To determine coreceptor densities on CEM x174 cells, plasmids containing segments of CCR5, BOB, and BONZO, and plasmids containing CCR5, BOB, and BONZO segments with 96-bp (CCR5), 63-bp (BOB), and 125-bp (BONZO) deletions were constructed (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1 a). Plasmids with deleted segments were used in quantitative RT-PCR as external controls for quantifying the expression of chemokine receptor genes in CEM x174. To select a cycle number to achieve an exponential amplification phase, the densities of amplified fragments from different cyclical amplifications were measured after gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Cycle numbers 31, 20, and 27 were selected for experiments on CCR5, BOB, and BONZO, respectively (data not shown). To confirm the detection range of competitive RT-PCR, the relationship between the amount of cDNA generated and the initial concentrations of total RNA used were determined. For each RT reaction of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 μg of total RNA, five different concentrations of competitors were used for PCR amplification (Fig. 1 b). The results showed that the amount of cDNA generated was in proportion to the amount of initial RNA used (Fig. 1 c). To investigate the effect of morphine treatment on the gene expression of CCR5, BOB, and BONZO, the amount of cDNA amplified by competitive RT-PCR from cells treated with morphine sulfate was compared with that of untreated cells. Morphine treatment, if used, was either 10 μm or 10 nm; these are physiological morphine concentrations in morphine-dependent animals (20Liu Y. Blackbourn D.J. Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F.

It was found that after the dilution of the cultures at time 0 (see “Experimental Procedures”), the cells synthesized an increasing amount of CCR5 (Fig. 3 a) or BOB (Fig.3 b), with the amount reaching a plateau 12–24 h post-dilution. However, it was also found that in comparison with the control cells at each time point, 10 μm morphine treatment increased CCR5 expression 207% by 12 h post-treatment, whereas 10 nm morphine treatment induced a 240% increase of CCR5 by 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 3 a). On the contrary, morphine treatment did not affect the expression of BOB (Fig.3 b) or BONZO (Fig. 3 c) in CEM x174 cells. Further experiments showed that the morphine-induced increase in CCR5 expression correlated with the amount of CCR5 proteins on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig.4 a) as well as Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 b) and that the effect was opioid receptor-mediated, because it could be completely abolished when cells were pretreated with naloxone, a μ opioid receptor antagonist (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of naloxone on morphine-induced CCR5 expression. The amount of CCR5 expressed in CEM x174 cells was determined by the competitive RT-PCR after treatment of the cells for 12 h with 10 nm morphine, 10 nm naloxone or a combination of naloxone and morphine (10 nm each). The data were reproducible in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To correlate the observed morphine effect on CCR5 up-regulation with viral infectivity, CEM x174 cells with or without morphine treatment were assayed for viral susceptibility after infection with SIVmac239 or with SRV in parallel experiments. SRV infect B cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), macrophages, and epithelial cells. Like SIVmac239, SRV cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in monkeys (19Torres J.V. Werner L.L. Malley A. Benjamini E. J. Med. Primatol. 1991; 20: 218-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor for SRV is not CCR5 but a neutral amino acid transporter that has been identified and cloned (21Anderson D. Torres J.V. Viral Immunology. 1999; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study CEM x174 cells were treated with morphine sulfate at 0, 0.4, 4, or 10 μm and infected with SIVmac239 or three serotypes of SRV (SRV-1, SRV-2, and SRV-3). The cells were observed for syncytia formation and assayed for viral reverse transcriptase activities. Fig.6 shows that on day 6 post-infection, syncytia appeared in SIVmac239-infected cultures and the number of syncytia formation increased with increasing concentrations of morphine in the culture (Fig. 6 A and TableI). On the contrary, none of the SRV-infected cultures showed signs of syncytia even in the presence of morphine treatment (Fig. 6 B). Results of RT assay of the infected cultures indicated a gradual increase of the enzyme activity with time of infection in all cultures (TableII); however, morphine significantly enhanced RT activities of SIVmac239-infected cells but not SRV-infected cells (Table II). For SRV-infected CEM x174 cells, we instead observed a slight decrease in RT activities upon morphine exposure (Table II). Further incubation of SRV-infected cells up to 12 days in the presence of morphine had little effect on, or slightly decreased, viral infectivity, as again shown by RT assays (TableIII).Table ITotal number of syncytia formation for SIVmac239DayMorphine concentration0 μm0.4 μm4.0 μm10.0 μm6 1 1-aTotal number of syncytia.34278246401239905675Data were reproducible in three independent experiments.1-a Total number of syncytia.

Similar to chemokine receptors, opioid receptors are also G protein coupled, seven-transmembrane domain receptors (25Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar). Human CEM x174 lymphocytes possess all three subtypes of opioid receptors, μ, κ, and δ (22Chuang L.F. Chuang T.K. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang A.J.

Sheng W.S. Chao C.C., Yu, L. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The current study shows that activation of opioid receptors of human lymphocytes, probably of the μ subtype, by morphine up-regulates the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5. The downstream molecular mechanisms induced by receptor activation through which morphine affects CCR5 expression awaits further investigation. Morphine, which inhibits chemokine-induced chemotaxis, nevertheless does not perturb chemokine binding to CCR5 (26Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M.Z. Resau J.H. Wang J.M. Ali H. Richardson R. Snyderman R. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is therefore attractive to propose that morphine, by binding to its own cell surface receptor, initiates a series of G protein-coupled signal transduction pathways (18Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26815-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that thereby hetero-sensitize (or up-regulate) CCR5. Many facts support this proposal. For instance, morphine has been shown to modulate the expression of other cellular proteins that may induce CCR5 expression. Specifically, morphine reportedly modulates the cellular activation of NFκB and TNF-α in macrophages (27Roy S. Cain K.J. Chapin R.B. Charboneau R.G. Barke R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and interleukin-2 in lymphocytes (28Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar); activation of NFκB, TNF-α, and interleukin-2 has been found to up-regulate CCR5 expression (10Lee B. Montaner L.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Fraziano M. Cappelli G. Santucci M. Mariani F. Amicosante M. Casarini M. Giosue S. Bisetti A. Colizzi V. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, morphine may up-regulate CCR5 by inhibiting chemokine synthesis and thus chemotaxis. Under certain conditions, opiates such as morphine as well as opioid peptides may down-regulate cytokine synthesis and release (30Chao C.C. Molitor T.W. Close K. Hu S. Peterson P.K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1993; 15: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Morgan E.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 65: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) such as RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β may induce receptor internalization and decrease cell surface expression of CCR5 (14Trkola A. Paxton W.A. Monard S.P. Hoxie J.A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Wu L. Mackay C.R. Horuk R. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 396-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Franchin G. Zybarth G. Dai W.W. Dubrovsky L. Reiling N. Schmidtmayerova H. Bukrinsky M. Sherry B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which ultimately contributes to anti-HIV-1 activity (9Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar, 14Trkola A. Paxton W.A. Monard S.P. Hoxie J.A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Wu L. Mackay C.R. Horuk R. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 396-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one yet-to-be-proved mechanism of morphine-mediated up-regulation of CCR5 is through the down-regulation of chemokine synthesis. SRV are endemic in wild macaques of India and Indonesia and in captive macaques important for medical research (33Rosenblum L.L. Weiss R.A. McClure M.O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Five distinct neutralization serotypes (SRV1–SRV5) have been described, of which three have been molecularly cloned (SRV1–SRV3). The present study shows that unlike SIVmac239 infection, morphine treatment will not increase the infectivity of SRV 1–3 (Fig. 6). Instead, morphine may induce a “protective” effect against SRV infection (Tables II andIII). Similar phenomenon has been reported for murine Friend retrovirus infection (34Veyries M-L. Sinet M. Desforges B. Rouveix B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 498-504PubMed Google Scholar). Like SRV, the Friend retrovirus infection model has been described as relevant to several aspects of AIDS; in particular, there are significant changes in immune function similar to those observed in HIV infection. The receptor for such virus is again not CCR5 but murine cationic amino acid transporter 1 (35Davey R.A. Hamson C.A. Healey J.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8096-8102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and morphine was found to attenuate the pathological manifestations of the virus in infected animals (34Veyries M-L. Sinet M. Desforges B. Rouveix B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 498-504PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that morphine-induced CCR5 in human lymphocytes facilitates only SIVmac239 infection, for which CCR5 is a co-receptor for viral entry. This study shows for the first time that lymphocytes express CCR5 at higher levels when treated with morphine sulfate. Previous studies that were unable to detect CCR5 in CEM x174 may have been due to the low levels of CCR5 expression inherent in cells; this level is below the threshold of many conventional detection methods. These low levels of CCR5 expression are significant nevertheless, especially when these low levels of CCR5 expression are augmented by morphine treatment. In addition, recent studies have shown that in cells with large amounts of CD4, a low trace of CCR5 was sufficient for susceptibility to virus infection (36Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in cells with low levels of CCR5 expression, morphine treatment may bring CCR5 concentrations above threshold levels for maximal infection. Morphine does not affect the gene expression of BOB or BONZO (Fig. 3). In this regard, the induction of the chemokine receptor CCR5 gene expression by morphine may provide a mechanism by which morphine sulfate enhances HIV/SIV infection and hence exacerbates the Simian AIDS or AIDS pathogenesis.

In recent years, the allosteric regulation of the different classes was studied in detail in various microorganisms (4Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J.

All three classes are present in bacteria; in some cases one finds all three in the same organism (6Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman Y. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only class Ia is found in higher eukaryotes (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev.

Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 147-183PubMed Google Scholar). This reductase consists of two tightly bound homodimeric proteins: the larger R1 protein (coded by thenrdA gene) and the smaller R2 protein (coded by thenrdB gene). R1 is the business end of the enzyme, containing both catalytic and allosteric sites. R2 harbors a tyrosyl radical, located at a specific position of the polypeptide chain, and an oxygen-linked di-iron center. The radical is generated through the interaction of the iron center with oxygen. During catalysis the radical function moves from R2 to a cysteine residue in the catalytic site of R1 (2Sjöberg B-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 13Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol.

Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 793-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Mao S.S., Yu, G.X. Chalfoun D. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9752-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each polypeptide of E. coli R1 contains two allosteric sites: one specificity site capable of binding ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP and one activity site accepting only ATP or dATP (16Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Effector binding to the specificity site modulates the catalytic activity so that binding of ATP or dATP prepares the protein for the reduction of UDP or CDP, binding of dTTP prepares the protein for the reduction of GDP, and binding of dGTP prepares the protein for the reduction of ADP. In the E. coli enzyme, this regulation of substrate specificity is only found when ATP binds to the activity site. In the x-ray structure, the specificity site is located at the interface between the two polypeptides of the R1 homodimer (9Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activity site regulates the overall activity of the enzyme so that binding of ATP stimulates enzyme activity, whereas binding of dATP inhibits it. These effects are independent of the occupation at the specificity site. In the x-ray structure, the activity site is located at the N terminus of the polypeptide chain (9Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This part of the R1 protein is in direct contact with the R2 protein in the model-built structure of the E. coli R1-R2 enzyme complex (8Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 9Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the allosteric sites of the E. coli R1 protein, their occupancy by various effectors, and how they influence the catalytic activity of the ribonucleotide reductase. The regulation of mammalian ribonucleotide reductases was found to follow the pattern set by the E. coli enzyme. As long ago as 1979, experiments with a highly purified R1 preparation from calf thymus demonstrated the same effector specificity for substrate reduction, as well as stimulation by ATP and inhibition by dATP (17Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the bacterial enzyme, the mammalian enzyme showed almost no activity in the absence of effectors. Furthermore, binding of dTTP or dGTP to the specificity site did not require that ATP be bound to the activity site to give full specificity. Binding experiments suggested the presence of two distinct binding sites. However, the binding stoichiometry was different: the calf thymus R1 contained only one specificity site and one activity site per homodimer, whereas E. coli R1 contains two of each. Strong evidence for the independent functions of two separate allosteric sites was obtained with purified reductases from mouse T-lymphoma cell lines resistant to growth inhibition by deoxyguanosine (18Ullman B.

One cell line, dGuo-L, provided an R1 protein insensitive to allosteric regulation by dGTP, suggesting a mutation in the specificity site (18Ullman B. Gudas L.J. Caras I.W. Eriksson S. Weinberg G.L. Wormsted M.A. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10189-10192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R1 from the other cell line, dGuo-200–1, was insensitive to inhibition by dATP, suggesting a mutation in the activity site (19Eriksson S. Gudas L.J. Clift S.M. Caras I.W. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10193-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This R1 contained a single point mutation in the N-terminal region, transforming aspartic acid to asparagine (D57N) (20Caras I.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2698-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In E. coli R1, dATP is bound in this region (9Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Biosensor studies (21Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicated that allosteric effector binding strongly influenced mouse R1/R2 protein interaction. Binding to the specificity sites promoted formation of R1 dimers, which is believed to be a prerequisite for binding to the R2 dimer. The low affinity between the R1 monomers in the absence of effectors may explain why the mammalian enzyme requires effectors for activity. Additional binding of ATP/dATP to the activity sites further increased mouse R1/R2 interaction. Using current technology and the availability of large amounts of recombinant proteins, we wished to resolve the paradoxical findings in the literature about the numbers of allosteric sites on the mammalian enzyme. To this purpose both the wild type form and the D57N mutant of mouse R1 were overproduced in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and investigated with respect to their allosteric properties. For the wild type R1 protein, it was of particular interest to investigate the reported difference from the E. coliclass Ia prototype in the effector binding stoichiometry. For the D57N mutant, one important task was to determine whether the protein no longer was able to bind dATP, or whether the lack of inhibition was caused by a different mechanism. We hoped that the results would help us to understand why the mere addition of a 2′-OH to dATP transforms an inhibitor to an activator for the wild type enzyme. Recombinant mouse R1 and R2 proteins were overexpressed in Bl21(DE3)pLysS bacteria using the pET 3a expression vector (22Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P.

The final preparation of the wild type R1 protein was homogeneous as determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, lane 3).Figure 1Scheme for the allosteric properties ofE. coli R1 showing the two classes of sites (substrate specificity and overall activity), the binding of various effectors to these sites, and the effects of binding on the catalytic activity of the R1-R2 complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2SDS gel electrophoresis of the ATP eluate of the D57N mouse R1 protein (lane 1, 3.2 μg), the D57N R1 protein after chromatography on Superdex 200 (lane 2, 5 μg), and wild type mouse R1 protein (lane 3, 2.8 μg).

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) with mutagenized oligonucleotides was used to introduce the D57N mutation into the wild type R1 protein pETR1 vector. The resulting pETD57NR1 construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The purification of wild type R1 protein uses affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose as a major purification step (22Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This purification procedure could not be applied directly to the mutant D57N R1 protein because of its lower affinity for dATP (see “Binding of Effectors to Mouse D57N R1”). Instead we developed the following procedure. Before loading on the dATP-Sepharose column, the dissolved ammonium sulfate pellet was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl. Elution of the D57N R1 protein from the column was made with 10 mm ATP instead of 50 mm. Most of the experiments were made with this ATP eluate, and the degree of homogeneity is shown in Fig. 2,lane 1. To obtain a higher purity of the D57N R1 protein for use in some of the binding studies, the ATP eluate was further purified by chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 preparative grade column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm dTTP (Fig. 2,lane 2). After purification, D57N was unstable. Frozen solutions had a tendency to precipitate after thawing and were centrifuged at high speed before use for binding experiments. The interaction of wild type or mutated R1 proteins with the R2 protein was studied at 22 °C by a biosensor technique, as described earlier (21Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reductions of 0.5 mm CDP, GDP, or ADP were determined with dithiothreitol as hydrogen donor, as described previously (25Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were at 37 °C for 30 min with 1–5 μg of wild type or mutated R1 and 4 μg of R2. Binding of the allosteric effectors was measured at 4 °C by a rapid filtration method (27Ormö M. Sjöberg B-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 182: 674-682Google Scholar). Protein was determined colorimetrically (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). The method was standardized by amino acid analysis of wild type R1 protein. In accordance with earlier results (17Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) concerning the calf thymus reductase, we found that the mouse enzyme reduced CDP, ADP, and GDP very poorly in the absence of allosteric effectors. Reduction of CDP required millimolar concentrations of ATP. Replacement of ATP by increasing concentrations of dATP resulted first in minor stimulation but reverted to inhibition at concentrations above 20 μmdATP (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the ATP-stimulated enzyme was strongly inhibited by dATP (Fig.3 A). These data are in full agreement with the model developed from earlier results with E. coli and calf thymus enzymes. ATP binding induces CDP reduction when bound to both the specificity and activity sites. Addition of dATP then displaces ATP from the activity site and inhibits the enzyme. The reductions of GDP and ADP also followed predictions from the model. GDP reduction was dependent on binding of dTTP to the specificity site (data not shown). It was stimulated more than 6-fold by ATP binding to the activity site but was inhibited completely when dATP was bound instead (Fig.3 B). The small inhibition by dGTP (Fig. 3 B) results from competition with dTTP at the specificity site. ADP reduction presents a similar story (Fig. 3 C). This reaction primarily requires binding of dGTP to the specificity site. When bound to the activity site, ATP stimulated catalytic activity, whereas when dATP bound to the activity site, catalytic activity was inhibited. The small inhibition by dTTP arose from competition with dGTP at the specificity site (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 4 shows results from experiments with the mutant enzyme similar to those depicted in Fig. 3for the wild type enzyme. The major difference from the wild type R1 concerns the function of dATP, which stimulated CDP reduction over the whole concentration range and did not inhibit the ATP-stimulated reaction (Fig. 4 A). In addition, in the case of GDP (Fig.4 B) and ADP reduction (Fig. 4 C), dATP stimulated the reaction in the presence of the prime effectors dTTP (for GDP reduction; Fig. 4 B) and dGTP (for ADP reduction; Fig.4 C). Note also that GDP reduction was inhibited by dGTP and that ADP reduction was inhibited by dTTP, as was the case for the wild type R1. All results suggest that the single amino acid mutation resulted in an R1 protein that binds both ATP and dATP to the activity site but no longer distinguishes between them when it comes to their effect on catalysis. The availability of relatively large amounts of homogeneous mouse R1 prepared inE. coli made possible a more detailed study of effector binding than was possible 20 years ago with the scarce calf thymus R1 protein. In particular, we could now address the puzzling earlier discrepancy in binding stoichiometry between the mammalian and E. coli enzymes. Fig. 5 Ashows Scatchard plots for dATP and dGTP binding to the R1 dimer. A linear curve (as for dGTP) suggests homogeneous binding to identical sites; non-linearity (as for dATP) suggests separate sites, each binding the ligand with a different affinity. Extrapolation to the abscissa gives the number of sites per dimer, and the slope of the curve gives the dissociation constant K D. According to these criteria, dGTP was bound by two identical sites with aK D of 0.2 μm. dATP was bound to four sites, even though the non-linearity of the curve made extrapolation difficult. Assuming the curve to be the resultant of two separate classes of sites, as indicated in Fig. 5 A, we can calculate approximate binding constants of 0.07 μm and 1.5 μm for the two dATP-binding sites. To obtain an understanding of the structural basis for the modulation of catalytic activity by the interplay between different effectors, we determined dATP binding curves in the presence of an excess of other effectors. Fig. 5 B shows competition with dGTP and dTTP. In both cases we tested two concentrations of competing effector to ascertain saturating conditions. dATP binding was now linear and extrapolated to close to two sites with binding constants of 0.3 μm (competing nucleotide, dGTP) and 0.2 μm(competing nucleotide, dTTP). A 20-fold increase in concentration of the competitor did not change this. With ATP, the results depended on the concentration of the competitor (Fig. 5 C). At 0.33 mm ATP, dATP binding was linear and extrapolated to two sites with a K D of 1 μm. When the ATP concentration was increased 4-fold, ATP blocked dATP binding almost completely, and no meaningful curve could be drawn from the data (Fig.5 C). These experiments show that all four dATP-binding sites also bind ATP but that only two sites bind dGTP and dTTP. As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” we tested two different preparations of the protein. First, we show the results with the ATP eluate (Fig. 2,lane 1), because this preparation was available in relatively large amounts. In contrast to the wild type R1, the mutated R1 bound dATP with a single K D of 0.5 μm (Fig. 6 A). The linear curve extrapolates to a value of 1.2 sites per dimer. In the presence of an excess of competing dGTP or dTTP (Fig. 6 B), the affinity for dATP was essentially unchanged (K D= 0.2–0.3 μm) but now extrapolated to 0.6 sites. Thus both competing nucleotides blocked half of the dATP-binding sites, suggesting that the blocked sites also can bind dTTP and dGTP. In agreement with this, the binding curve for dGTP in Fig. 6 Aextrapolates to 0.4 sites, with a K D of 0.2 μm. We return to the significance of these data under “Discussion.” In a different set of experiments, we tested the inhibition of dATP binding by an excess of competing effectors where dATP was present at close to saturating concentrations (TableI). dATP was bound at 1.5 sites in the absence of competitor in this experiment. This value was halved in the presence of either dGTP or dTTP, and a combination of the two resulted in no further decrease. ATP by itself instead decreased dATP binding to less than one-fifth, and, in combination with either dGTP or dTTP, abolished it completely. Together, the data in Table I suggest that, similar to wild type R1, half of the dATP-binding sites also can bind dGTP and dTTP, that dGTP and dTTP bind to the same site, and that ATP binds to both dATP-binding sites. However, ATP binding is weak and at the concentration used in the experiment did not by itself completely prevent all dATP binding.Table ICompetition by non-labeled effectors for binding of labeled dATP to D57N R1Competing nucleotideV dATPNone1.48dTTP0.81dGTP0.74dTTP + dGTP0.78ATP0.26ATP + dGTP0ATP + dTTP0The initial concentrations of [3H]dATP was 10 μm; non-labeled dTTP or dGTP, was 1.5 mm; non-labeled ATP was 3 mm.

Open table in a new tab The initial concentrations of [3H]dATP was 10 μm; non-labeled dTTP or dGTP, was 1.5 mm; non-labeled ATP was 3 mm. Binding of [3H]dATP was measured at 4 °C under standard conditions. In an attempt to increase the stoichiometry in the binding experiments, we performed a limited series of experiments with the D57N R1 protein further purified on a Superdex 200 column (Fig. 2, lane 2). As found with the ATP eluate, this preparation also bound dATP with a single K D of 0.5 μm, but now the linear curve extrapolated to a value of 2.4 sites per dimer (Fig.6 A). In the presence of an excess of competing dTTP, the curve for dATP binding extrapolated to around 1.5 sites per dimer (data not shown). Protein R2 was immobilized to a sensor chip, and solutions containing different concentrations of R1 protein in the absence or presence of allosteric effectors were injected while R1 binding was recorded. The equilibrium response data from increasing concentrations of wild type or mutated R1 protein were analyzed in Scatchard plots (Fig. 7). With wild type R1 protein, we found much steeper slopes with ATP and dATP than with dTTP or dGTP, indicating a lower dissociation constant for R1/R2 binding (Fig. 7, upper panel). This steep plot was also present for the D57N R1 protein in the presence of ATP, whereas the dATP plot was indistinguishable from the plots obtained with dTTP or dGTP (Fig. 7, lower panel). We interpret the result to mean that in the mutant R1 protein, dATP binding to the activity site is much less efficient in inducing the high affinity conformation of R1 than in the wild type protein, whereas the effects of ATP binding are the same. The experiments with the wild type enzyme provided clear-cut results. The effector binding stoichiometries (four dATP or ATP and two dTTP or dGTP per R1 dimer) are now the same as those found earlier forE. coli R1, and the lower values reported earlier for calf thymus R1 in all probability were caused by impurities in the preparation. Mouse R1 has two classes of sites, one site binding all the tested effectors and the second binding only dATP and ATP. All these data are identical to earlier results with E. coli R1, where the first site is considered to regulate substrate specificity and the second site is considered to regulate enzyme activity. The present data depicted in Figs. 3 and 5 fully support a similar pattern of regulation for the mouse reductase and confirm the earlier work with the calf thymus reductase that led to the conclusion that the allosteric regulation of the mammalian ribonucleotide reductase follows the same rules as the regulation of the E. coli enzyme. In addition, the results concerning the catalytic activity of the D57N mutant are quite straightforward. There are several lines of evidence demonstrating that the aspartate 57 residue is located in the allosteric activity site. First, the allosteric activity site is absent from all microbial ribonucleotide reductases lacking a sequence homologous to the 100 N-terminal amino acids of E. coli R1. Second, in a complex between AMPPNP1 and E. coli R1, histidine 59 (which corresponds to aspartate 57 of mammalian R1) binds to the ribose moiety of the analog. Third, dGuo-200–1 mutant cells containing the D57N mutation are not inhibited in their growth by deoxyadenosine, and CDP reduction by the reductase isolated from these cells is not inhibited by dATP. The present data (Fig. 4) provide conclusive evidence on this point. They show that not only CDP reduction but also GDP and ADP reductions catalyzed by the mutated enzyme were strongly stimulated by dATP. During reduction of GDP and ADP, the specificity site is blocked by dTTP and dGTP, respectively, and the stimulation by dATP has to involve the activity site. With CDP, the distinction between the two sites was more difficult, as dATP in these experiments binds to both sites. In conclusion, the D57N mutation affects the activity site, resulting in stimulation of the enzyme by both ATP and dATP, i.e. the enzyme no longer distinguishes between hydrogen and hydroxyl at C-2′ of ATP. This agrees with the presumed interaction between aspartate 57 and the ribose moiety of the ligand, as suggested from the AMPPNP-E. coli structure. The interpretation of the effector binding data with the D57N mutant is less clear. The low binding stoichiometries might be caused by a functional loss of sites, with only two dATP-binding sites in the mutated R1 dimer, instead of four. If this were the case, the protein would have lost one specificity site and one activity site, because the catalytic experiments demonstrate the function of both classes. More likely, impurities in the preparations decreased the stoichiometry. Because of the lability of D57N, some molecules may also have lost the ability to bind effectors. We favor this explanation, because the binding stoichiometry increased for the D57N R1 protein with increasing purity of the preparation. The dATP binding curve for D57N R1 (Fig. 6 A) differs from that of wild type R1 (Fig. 5 A) in two aspects; it shows no curvature, and the K D value calculated from the straight line is almost an order of magnitude larger than the firstK D value for wild type R1. We have presented above conclusive evidence for the presence of both a specificity site and an activity site on the mutated R1. Our finding of a single slope has two alternative explanations. Both sites have the same or closely similarK D values of 0.5 μm; or the curve measures the K D for the specificity site, and the affinity at the activity site is too low to be measured. Both alternatives lead to the unexpected conclusion that theK D for the specificity site is 0.5 μmand not 0.07 μm as in wild type R1, demonstrating that a mutation in the activity site decreased the affinity for dATP at the specificity site almost 10-fold. Note that this effect is not seen with dGTP. The competition experiments with other effectors suggest strongly that the first alternative is correct (Fig. 6 B). An excess of either dGTP or dTTP halved the number of sites available for dATP binding but only minimally affected the K D in the Scatchard plot. As both dGTP and dTTP bind to the specificity site, the site remaining for dATP binding is the activity site with aK D of 0.2–0.3 μm. In addition, the data in Table I show that dTTP and dGTP, either alone or in combination, blocked half of the dATP-binding sites. In contrast, competition experiments with ATP (Table I) show that ATP bound to all four sites. Combining the results from the allosteric effects on enzyme activity and the binding data, we conclude that in the D57N mutant the activity site has the ability to bind both ATP and dATP but that the protein no longer can distinguish between them. A similar situation has been described for the R1 protein of Trypanosoma brucei (7Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and some class II ribonucleotide reductases (6Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman Y. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation also decreases the affinity of the specificity site for dATP almost 10-fold, so that it can no longer be distinguished from the activity site in the Scatchard plot. This explains why the protein no longer could be easily purified by dATP-Sepharose chromatography. At first sight it may seem surprising that a mutation in one allosteric site primarily affects binding at the second site. The interdependence of the two sites, however, became evident already from the finding that theK D for dATP at the activity site of E. coli R1 depended on the type of effector bound to the specificity site (16Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our concepts concerning the allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reductases illustrated by Fig. 1 depend on a high degree of flexibility of the enzyme structure, which permits the conformational transitions required for the postulated interactions between the two allosteric sites and the catalytic site. The present result further adds to this picture by suggesting similar interactions also between the two allosteric sites. Our new data combining enzyme assays, nucleotide binding experiments, and studies by a biosensor technique of R1/R2 interaction clearly define the function of the various allosteric effectors. Still they do not tell us why the removal of the 2′-OH from ATP transforms an activator to an inhibitor of the wild type enzyme. The mouse enzyme does not absolutely require ATP to be bound to the activity site for activity, because GDP or ADP reduction stimulated by dTTP or dGTP, respectively, is active also in an enzyme with an empty activity site. Therefore, the conformation of the mouse R1 protein with effectors bound to the specificity sites allows the formation of an active enzyme complex together with the R2 protein, even in the absence of ATP bound to the activity sites. However, binding of ATP greatly stimulates activity, and this may be a result of the tighter R1/R2 complex induced by ATP (21Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because both ATP and dATP, on binding to the activity sites, induce the same high affinity complex between the R1 and R2 proteins in the wild type mouse ribonucleotide reductase, the mechanism for dATP inhibition seems not to involve different enzyme complexes. Instead, dATP binding may interfere with the catalytically essential radical transfer pathway between the active site of R1 and the tyrosyl radical of R2 (9Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 21Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hopefully, the crystal structure of an R1/R2 complex will reveal the mechanism of dATP inhibition."

Siegel B.D. Leung W.C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Evidence for roles in these processes has come primarily from identification of interacting proteins with BRCA1. For example, binding to such proteins as Rad51 (2Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) and Rad50, p95, and MRE11 (3Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) has suggested that BRCA1 may be involved in DNA repair mechanisms, such as double strand break repair, that involve the Rad, p95, and MRE11 proteins. BRCA1 is also bound and phosphorylated by the ATM and human CDS1 DNA damage-activated kinases (3Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H.

On the other hand, BRCA1 also complexes with RNA polymerase II (6Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Manley J.L. Science. 1999; 285: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These interactions suggest that BRCA1 plays some role in cellular gene transcription. It has been hypothesized that BRCA1 involvement in transcription is a means by which the protein acts in one aspect of DNA repair (12Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The findings thatBRCA1 −/− cells are defective in transcription-coupled repair and that BRCA1 associates with such global transcription components as RNA polymerase II suggest that BRCA1 is not a specific transcriptional activator per se. However, BRCA1 has also been shown to bind individual transcription factors such as p53 and c-Myc (13Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 14Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BRCA1 is able to repress c-Myc transcriptional activity, whereas it is able to enhance p53 activity similar to other transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. BRCA1-specific involvement in the p53 response has been enhanced with the finding thatBRCA1 −/− embryos survive longer if one or both copies of the p53 gene are also missing (16Ludwig T. Chapman D.L.

Transcriptional coactivation of p53 is dependent on the C terminus of BRCA1, as this region is required for all transcription-related events that BRCA1 performs (14Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The N-terminal p53-binding region of BRCA1 has been shown to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of p53-mediated transcription when expressed without the remainder of the BRCA1 protein, indicating that although this region is able to bind p53, the machinery needed to coactivate p53 either binds to or is present in other areas of the protein (21Somasundaram K. MacLachlan T.K. Burns T.F. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6605-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that one mechanism by which BRCA1 induces p53 activity is to bind directly and subsequently to coactivate transcription, another mechanism may involve increasing the stability of p53. Overexpression of BRCA1 has been shown to induce accumulation of p53 in wild-type p53-expressing cell lines (21Somasundaram K. MacLachlan T.K. Burns T.F. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6605-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This accumulation appears to depend on the presence of p14ARF, a protein that allows p53 to escape degradation induced by MDM2. BRCA1-induced p53 is then transcriptionally active and activates such downstream genes as p21 WAF1 . The effect of DNA damage on BRCA1 protein has been the subject of recent studies. Treatment of cultured cells with a variety of DNA-damaging agents, including γ-radiation, UV light, mitomycin C, and adriamycin, results in a retardation of BRCA1 protein on denaturing gels that is reversed by the addition of phosphatase, indicating phosphorylation (22Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of these studies report a reduction in BRCA1 protein and RNA levels following extended treatment with DNA-damaging agents (22Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 23Andres, J. L., Fan, S., Turkel, G. J., Wang, J. A., Twu, N. F., Yuan, R.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we show that this effect seems to be dependent on the presence of wild-type p53 protein and that ectopic expression of p53 alone is able to down-regulate BRCA1 protein. The reduction appears to occur at the RNA level. Although BRCA1 has been proposed to act in a complementary manner to p53, we propose that this feedback loop is not unlike the one that has been described for p14ARF expression: whereas p14ARF, like BRCA1, is able to induce p53 (25Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), p53 is also responsible for negatively regulating p14ARF expression (26Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell.

A total of 1 × 106Saos2 cells were transfected using Superfect reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) with 0.5 μg of reporter and 1.5 μg of pCEP4-p53 or vector alone. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity as described (31Zeng Y.X.

Adenovirus infections of MCF7 cells were carried out at m.o.i.1 = 20 in 1% fetal bovine serum and phosphate-buffered saline. Adriamycin treatment was performed as described above. Preparation of cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed essentially as described (32van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed on a Coulter Epics Elite counter. DNA content analysis was performed using MacCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Floating and attached cells were trypsinized from six-well dishes and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 900 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, to which 100 μl of 0.4% trypan blue dye (Sigma) was added, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 10 μl of this mixture was applied to a hemocytometer. Dead cells (those staining blue) were counted and compared with the total number of cells viewed in the hemocytometer. We have previously found that BRCA1 induces p53 protein accumulation (21Somasundaram K. MacLachlan T.K. Burns T.F. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6605-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent evidence on the factors that contribute to such a process has suggested that the effect of p53 on these factors runs contrary to what one might expect. For example, whereas MDM2 degrades p53, p53 in fact activates MDM2 transcription. On the other hand, p14ARF is able to potently stabilize p53 protein; however, p53 represses p14ARF expression. Given this evidence, we sought to determine the effect of p53 on BRCA1 expression in light of recent results suggesting that BRCA1 expression may be reduced in some cell lines exposed to DNA-damaging agents. Adriamycin is a potent DNA-damaging agent that rapidly induces a p53 response in wild-type p53-expressing cell types. We treated one wild-type (PA1), one mutant (SW480) and one null (Saos2) p53 cell line with adriamycin for 24 h and examined BRCA1 protein expression by immunoblotting. Whereas SW480 (colon carcinoma) and Saos2 (osteosarcoma) cells displayed a clear shift in mobility of BRCA1 protein as well as an apparent increase in the protein level, PA1 cells (ovarian carcinoma) appeared to have lost BRCA1 expression entirely (Fig. 1 A). We also utilized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients. These cells lack functional activity of ATM, a kinase required for the rapid accumulation of p53 protein and phosphorylation of BRCA1 (4Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) and NBS1 (33Lim D.S. Kim S.-T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lim J. Petrini J.H.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We tested the 03189C line that is null for ATM activity as well as a control line (2184D) that possesses both functional copies of ATM for their effects on BRCA1 protein expression following 24 h of adriamycin treatment. The ATM−/− cell line displayed a full shift of the BRCA1 protein, which was present in similar amounts as the BRCA1 protein in untreated cells (Fig.1 B). In the wild-type ATM-containing lymphoblastoid cell line, BRCA1 also became phosphorylated upon treatment with adriamycin; however, the protein expression level decreased significantly by 24 h post-treatment. As p53 is wild-type in these lines, it is possible that the accumulation of p53 via ATM in the normal cell line led to a reduction of BRCA1 expression. Another DNA-damaging agent (mitomycin C) was also seen to cause a repression of BRCA1 protein expression only in the PA1 and HCT116 (colon carcinoma) wild-type p53-expressing cell lines, whereas no reduction or an induction was observed in the mutant p53-expressing lines SW480 and SkOV-3 (ovarian carcinoma) (Fig. 1 C). In addition to the differences in p53 status among the seven cancer cell lines described above, they are likely different genetically in many other ways as well. To more closely draw a link between BRCA1 repression and wild-type p53 presence, we utilized the H460 lung cancer cell line that expresses wild-type p53. Two variants of this line either express the human papilloma virus E6 protein that degrades p53 (H460-E6) or carry only the backbone vector from which human papilloma virus E6 is expressed (H460-Neo). Upon treatment of these lines with either 0.2 or 0.4 μg/ml adriamycin for 24 h, only the H460-Neo line stabilized p53 protein, whereas there was no detectable p53 protein in the H460-E6 line (Fig. 2), consistent with the previously reported E6-mediated p53 degradation in this line (27Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Can. Res. 1996; 2: 623-633PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas BRCA1 protein shifted in the H460-E6 line treated with adriamycin, the H460-Neo cell line displayed a marked decrease in the BRCA1 protein expression level with a similar mobility shift in the protein seen in the H460-E6 line. This reduction correlated with accumulation of p53 protein. To determine if BRCA1 repression correlated temporally with the onset of p53 protein accumulation post-treatment with adriamycin, we investigated the kinetics of BRCA1 disappearance in the H460 cell line after treatment with 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin. Total cellular RNA and protein were harvested at various time points over the course of 24 h. As early as 8 h after treatment with adriamycin, a reduction inBRCA1 RNA to below basal levels was observed (Fig.3 A). By 12 h post-treatment, BRCA1 protein had completely disappeared, whereas another tumor suppressor, pRb, remained expressed (Fig. 3 B). The reduction in BRCA1 RNA correlated with the appearance of p53 protein, and the disappearance of BRCA1 protein correlated with the appearance of the p53 transcriptional target p21WAF1. Activation of p53 expression did not affect expression of another tumor suppressor, pRb. Repression of BRCA1 did not appear to be downstream of the apoptotic effects of p53, as no signs of apoptosis in the H460 cell line were noted at 12 h, the time point after adriamycin treatment when repression of BRCA1 protein is most noticeable. We have previously determined the ID50 in response to adriamycin for this cell line to be 0.53 μg/ml (27Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Can. Res. 1996; 2: 623-633PubMed Google Scholar), which is above the concentration used here and was derived from a 7–10-day treatment period. It is interesting to note that immediately upon treatment of the cells with adriamycin, BRCA1 RNA increased ∼2–3-fold, and an increase in BRCA1 protein was noted, indicating a rapid induction response of BRCA1 to DNA damage. This increase may explain why in mutant and null p53 cell lines there is apparently more BRCA1 protein present after DNA damage (Fig. 1). To potentially eliminate other pathways activated by adriamycin treatment, we ectopically expressed p53 protein using an adenovirus vector in the mutant p53-expressing cell line SW480. Infection with Ad-p53, but not with Ad-LacZ or Ad-E2F, resulted in a complete disappearance of BRCA1 protein (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of p53 also resulted in a significant reduction inBRCA1 mRNA as well, indicating that the decrease in protein noted by accumulation of p53 by adriamycin or overexpression by p53 adenovirus may be due to lack of BRCA1 transcription (Fig. 4 B). As has been suggested in the literature, BRCA1 expression may be cell cycle-regulated, with high levels of protein in cells in S and G2/M phases and lower expression levels in cells in early G1 phase (35Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The p21WAF1protein has been found to mediate the p53-directed G1 phase arrest (28El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7900) Google Scholar). To determine if p53 was causing the repression of BRCA1 through the action of its downstream target p21, HCT116 and DLD1 cells deleted of their respective p21-coding region were infected with p53 adenoviruses and harvested for protein and RNA. As shown in Fig. 4(C and D), p53 repressed BRCA1 protein and mRNA equally well in both p21+/+ and p21−/− cells, indicating no requirement of p21 for this repression. Interestingly, in several experiments, we found BRCA1 protein and RNA to be expressed at much lower levels in both null p21 cells used here. p21 may in fact exert positive effects on the expression level or stability of the BRCA1 transcript or protein unrelated to the cell cycle in asynchronously growing cells. To determine if p21 overexpression may be able to repress BRCA1 protein to levels seen in cases of p53 overexpression, we infected HCT116 cells with p53- and p21-expressing adenoviruses, harvested for total protein, and immunoblotted for BRCA1. Whereas some decrease in BRCA1 protein levels was noted in Ad-p21-infected cells (as expected due to a presumed G1 phase arrest), the decrease in Ad-p53-infected cells was much greater, indicating that the effect that p53 has on BRCA1 expression levels goes beyond that of halting the cell cycle and may be a direct effect on transcriptional levels. Luciferase reporter constructs with 1500, 800, or 200 bases upstream of theBRCA1 transcriptional start site (34Thakur S. Croce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8837-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were cotransfected into Saos2 cells with a p53 mammalian expression vector, and luciferase activity was determined. Compared with vector-alone transfections, p53 repressed all BRCA1 promoter-luciferase constructs ∼10-fold, whereas p53 expressed from the same vector was able to activate a construct containing 13 copies of the consensus p53-binding site (pG13) (Fig. 5)."

The formation of FAD depends on the sequential utilization of two molecules of ATP in reactions that first involve the riboflavin (flavokinase, EC 2.7.1.26) kinase-phosphorylation of riboflavin to form FMN and then FAD (EC 2.7.7.2) synthetase-catalyzed adenylylation of the latter to form FAD. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing the two steps have been purified from several sources (1Nakano H. McCormick D.B. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G.

In Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis, flavokinase and FAD synthetase co-purify and are present in a single, bifunctional flavokinase/FAD synthetase enzyme (7Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J.

To date, a large number of homologs to the bifunctional flavokinase/FAD synthetase ribC gene of B. subtilis have been identified in archaea and eubacteria, indicating that this type of gene organization is common in prokaryotes. In contrast, both enzymatic activities have been purified separately in eukaryotic organisms (1Nakano H. McCormick D.B. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G.

In mammalian tissues, the smaller flavokinase (1Nakano H. McCormick D.B. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium 1990. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 89-92Google Scholar) is readily separable from the larger FAD synthetase (3Oka M. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7418-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the gene encoding a monofunctional FAD synthetase (FAD1) has recently been cloned as an extragenic suppressor of a respiratory deficient pet mutant (11Wu M. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the gene encoding flavokinase in yeast as well as in the rest of eukaryotic organisms remains to be identified. The formation of holo-flavoproteins, by binding of the coenzyme to the apo-protein, depends on the availability of the cognate flavocoenzyme. It is known that most cell flavoproteins are located in the mitochondria but little is known about the subcellular distribution of the enzymes involved in flavin metabolism. It has been described that flavokinase is a cytosolic enzyme in plant and mammalian tissues (4Merrill Jr., A.H. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sobhanaditya J. Rao N.A. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the synthesis of FMN and FAD occurs in hepatocyte cytosol (12McCormick D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1170-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the synthesis of both flavocoenzymes from externally added riboflavin by isolated mitochondria from rat liver has been also reported (13Barile M. Passarella S. Bertoldi A. Quagliarello E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas it has been determined that the synthesis of riboflavin occurs in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells (14Santos M.A. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23801-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the exact location of the synthesis of FMN and FAD and their compartmentation is controversial in this organism. It has been reported that yeast mitochondria do not contain FAD synthetase and that a specific mitochondrial carrier protein, Flx1p, is involved in flavin transport across the mitochondrial membrane (16Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum D.M. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it has also been described that FMN and FAD synthesis occurs in isolated yeast mitochondria (17Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that yeast cells overexpressing theFAD1 gene show mitochondrial FAD synthetase activity (11Wu M. Repetto B. Glerum D.M.

Homeostasis of flavin coenzymes is achieved by an intricate interplay of the different enzymes in the pathway responding to regulators (18Reddy A.R.V. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Rao N.A. J.

Since yeast and other eukaryotes share the same flavin coenzyme biosynthetic pathway, study of flavin coenzyme synthesis in yeast should provide a system amenable for study by basic and biochemical techniques of classic and molecular genetics. The present work addresses the identification and characterization of the structural gene encoding flavokinase in S. cerevisiae as well as the subcellular localization of the enzyme. The yeast strains used in this study are congenic to the BY4743 background (21Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

The following primers were used to replace YDR236c codons 2-218 (23Jacq C. Alt-Morbe J. Andre B. Arnold W. Bahr A. Ballesta J.P. Bargues M. Baron L. Becker A. Biteau N. Blocker H. Blugeon C.

PCR-derived cassettes containing either three copies of the HA epitope or the GFP coding sequence followed by the ADH1terminator and the kanMX6 gene were inserted at the translational stop of YDR236c as described (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar), using the following primers CCTTGCCACTCCACCGTATCAAGTATTCAAACAACAATTACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA (YDR236c-F2) and GTCATTTATTAAAAGGTATAAATATGTAAATGTATACTTAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC (YDR236c-R1). All gene replacements were confirmed by PCR analysis. Yeast strains were usually grown in rich medium (YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose) or in selective medium (SD, synthetic dextrose, complemented by auxotrophic requirements) (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 163-167Google Scholar). Semisynthetic low sulfate lactate medium was prepared as described (26Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13068-13074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For overexpression of Fmn1p in Escherichia coli, the entireYDR236c coding sequence was amplified by high fidelity PCR from yeast genomic DNA with the primers GGAATTCC ATATGTTTACGTGGACTATTTATG (YDR236c-E1) and GGGTCGACCTATAATTGTTGTTTGAATAC (YDR236c-E2) introducing NdeI and SalI restriction sites (underlined) on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The PCR product was digested with NdeI andSalI and cloned into the same sites of the expression vector pET28b (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) to obtain pET28b-FMN1. E. coli BL21(DE3) strain recombinant cells obtained by transformation with pET28b-FMN1 were grown on Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the cell density in the culture reached anA 600 of 1.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation after 1 h of induction, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated three times for a 2-min interval at a setting of 70 watts. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, the inclusion bodies were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, for 15 min, washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in the same buffer containing 8 m urea, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Solubilized inclusion bodies were diluted 10-fold with 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 10.7, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution was adjusted to pH 8.0 with HCl and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant, containing most of the recombinant Fmn1 protein, was dialyzed first against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 125 mm urea and then against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 15 mm SO4Mg, 10 mm NaSO3, 25 μm riboflavin to allow refolding of the protein. Refolded Fmn1p was affinity-purified on a TalonTM (CLONTECH) column as recommended by the manufacturer. For overexpression of Fmn1p in yeast, the coding region was recovered from pET28b-FMN1 as a 681-base pairHindIII-PstI fragment and inserted between the respective sites of the yeast expression vector pVT101L (28Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), to obtain pVT101L-FMN1. The YDR236c flanking and coding region was isolated as a 2.5-kilobase SphI-PstI fragment from a cosmid (ATCC, clone 70664) and inserted into the respective sites of YCplac111 (29Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) to obtain YCplac111-YDR236c. Yeast cells were cultured on SD-leu medium until the A 600 reached approximately 1.0, collected by centrifugation, and washed with 0.85% NaCl solution. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution and disrupted with glass beads. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and the resulting supernatants were used as cell extracts. FMN and FAD, obtained from Sigma, were further purified on a preparative LiChrosorb RP18 (Scharlau Science) column developed isocratically with 25% methanol in 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6. Riboflavin was used without any additional purification. The concentrations of the nucleotides were estimated spectrophotometrically using millimolar extinction coefficients of 12.5, 12.5, and 11.3 at 450 nm for oxidized riboflavin, FMN, and FAD, respectively (30Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1969Google Scholar). Flavokinase and FAD synthetase activities were determined at 37 °C as described previously (11Wu M. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,16Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum D.M. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm C18 reverse phase column (Spherisorb S5-ODS2, Waters) with 25% methanol in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, as the mobile phase and the elution of flavin nucleotides was monitored at 450 nm. The concentration of each nucleotide was determined from the area under each peak. Standard curves obtained with the purified compounds were linear over a range of 0–5 nmol. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of product/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cells were grown for 16 h at 30 °C to anA 600 of 5–6 in low sulfate lactate medium, harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, containing 10 mmdithiothreitol. Isolation of crude mitochondria was accomplished according to Zinser and Daum (32Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), using 2 mg of Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Co.) per g of cells, dissolved in 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1.2 m sorbitol to convert the cells to spheroplasts. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice with 1.2 m sorbitol, and resuspended in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 0.6m sorbitol, 1 mm KCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (breakage buffer). Spheroplasts were homogenized in a 10-ml glass Dounce homogenizer, and after unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g the crude mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant thus obtained was named the postmitochondrial fraction. Crude mitochondria were diluted in a small volume of breakage buffer and overlaid on a continuous 20–50% sucrose gradient in 0.6m sorbitol, 5 mm MES, pH 6.0. After 1 h of centrifugation at 100,000 × g, purified mitochondria were recovered as a light-brown band from the lower third of the tube. The solution of purified mitochondria was diluted 5-fold with breakage buffer, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g and the resulting pellet washed once with 0.6 m mannitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in a small volume of the same buffer. The microsomal fraction was isolated from the postmitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant was named the cytosolic fraction. The microsomal pellet was gently homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and cleared of residual mitochondria by centrifugation through a step 25–50% sucrose gradient (5% increment by step) in the same buffer. The submitochondrial localization of proteins was performed essentially as described (33Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For mitoplast generation, mitochondria were diluted 5-fold in 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated on ice for 25 min. For protease treatment of mitoplasts, 100 μg/ml proteinase K was added. Protease treatment was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1.5 mm, followed by 5-min incubation on ice. Mitoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. For carbonate extraction, the mitoplasts were resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor. For the detergent treatment, mitoplasts were incubated on ice for 25 min in lysis buffer (0.6m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100) in the presence of 100 μg/ml proteinase K. For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry fat-free milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 and further incubated with the antibodies. The anti-porin, anti-Sec63, anti-Hsp60, anti-AAC, and anti-CC1HL polyclonal antibodies were a gift from Dr. N. Cousiño. Anti-PGK (Molecular Probes) and anti-HA antibodies (BabCo) were obtained from commercial sources. Immunodetection was performed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For microscopy, samples were viewed and photographed as wet mounts with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with Nomarski optics and epifluorescence. For staining of mitochondria, cells were stained with rhodamine B, hexyl ester (Molecular Probes) as recommended by supplier. Fluorescence of the Fmn1p-GFP fusion protein was followed in living yeast cells as described previously (34Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). While the processes that mediate FMN biosynthesis in yeast are not defined, it seemed reasonable to surmise that a flavokinase could be required. Sequence similarity searches such as FASTA and BLAST (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) failed to unambiguously detect any yeast protein showing homology to the riboflavin-kinase carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) domain of bifunctional prokaryotic flavokinase/FAD synthetases. Comparison of proteins encoded in seven complete genomes, including the S. cerevisiae genome, and the elucidation of consistent patterns of sequence similarities allowed the delineation of clusters of orthologous groups, each containing individual orthologous proteins from at least three different lineages (36Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 37Koonnin E.V. Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of these clusters (clusters of orthologous 0196) contains the predicted YDR236c gene product from S. cerevisiae in addition to flavokinase/FAD synthetases from several bacterial species. Since members of the same cluster are predicted to have the same or related function and the gene encoding FAD synthetase in yeast (FAD1) has been previously identified, we hypothesized that YDR236c would encode riboflavin kinase in yeast. To test this hypothesis a null allele of YDR236c was constructed by the replacement of the complete open reading frame by the geneticin resistance kanMX4 marker (22Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar) and used to make a chromosomal deletion of YDR236c in BY4743 diploid cells, which was confirmed by PCR (38Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst .). 1987; 57 (, 272): 267Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Whenydr236cΔ/YDR236c diploids were sporulated and the resulting tetrads dissected, viability segregated 2+:2− and all viable spores were geneticin-sensitive, suggesting that YDR236c is a single copy gene that is essential for growth on YPD medium. Examination of the non-growing spores under the light microscope revealed that they gave rise to microcolonies comprising several hundred small and morphologically heterogeneous cells, suggesting that the spores had gone through germination and grown for an additional 7–10 generations before arresting. When ydr236cΔ/YDR236cdiploids were subsequently transformed to leucine prototrophy with theLEU2-marked plasmid YCplac111-YDR0236c and then sporulated, upon tetrad dissection all four spores were viable on YPD medium, all geneticin-resistant spores were Leu+, and the geneticin-resistance marker segregated 2+:2−as expected. Cells disrupted in the gene encoding flavokinase are predicted to be unable to grow because of their metabolic block in the biosynthesis of the essential cofactors FMN and FAD. To investigate whetherYDR0236c is indeed a gene involved in the biosynthesis of FMN and the external supply of FMN or FAD cofactors is able to rescue the growth impairment of the ydr236cΔ mutant, cells from the microcolonies on the dissection plates were transferred to YPD plates supplemented with riboflavin, FMN, or FAD. Of the compounds examined, only FMN (minimum 1 mm) supported the growth ofydr236cΔ disruptants, thus demonstrating thatYDR0236c is specifically involved in the formation of FMN (Fig. 1). Accordingly, this gene was designated FMN1. To facilitate the biochemical characterization of the Fmn1p product an expression system in which the protein could be rapidly isolated from a bacterial lysate was developed. The primers YDR236c-E1, containing a NdeI restriction site 5′ upstream from the translation initiation codon, and YDR236c-E2, containing a SalI restriction site downstream from the translation termination codon, were designed to amplify theFMN1 open reading frame on the basis of the published sequence (23Jacq C. Alt-Morbe J. Andre B. Arnold W. Bahr A. Ballesta J.P. Bargues M. Baron L. Becker A. Biteau N. Blocker H. Blugeon C. Boskovic J. Brandt P. Bruckner M. Buitrago M.J. Coster F. Delaveau T. del Rey F. et al.Nature. 1997; 29: 75-78Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment obtained usingS. cerevisiae genomic DNA as template was cloned into pET28b vector for expression under the control of T7 RNA polymerase inE. coli strain BL21(DE3) (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Induction of FMN1expression from the T7 promoter led to the production of a single 29-kDa protein, consistent with the expected molecular mass of the Fmn1p fusion protein (which contains the His-tag and the T7-tag of the polylinker of the vector at the NH2-terminal end of Fmn1p) (Fig. 2, lane 4). The 29-kDa recombinant protein was absent in uninduced extracts (Fig. 2,lane 3) and also in cells carrying the empty vector (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). The 29-kDa protein was partially purified from insoluble bacterial inclusion bodies and solubilized and refolded in the presence of riboflavin as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and7). The biochemical properties of the partially purified Fmn1p were analyzed in vitro. Efficient phosphorylation of riboflavin to form FMN was observed in the presence of the purified Fmn1p and ATP (Fig. 3). In contrast to known prokaryotic riboflavin-kinase/FAD synthetases (9Gomes B. McCormick D.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1983; 172: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Mack M. van Loon A.P. Hohmann H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 950-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no FAD synthetase-associated enzymatic activity could be detected. A similar extract that did not contain Fmn1p, obtained from control cells transformed with the empty pET28b vector and prepared according to the Fmn1p purification protocol, showed no flavokinase activity.Figure 3Enzymatic conversion of riboflavin into FMN by recombinant yeast flavokinase. Representative high performance liquid chromatographic profiles for extracts of incubation mixtures consisting of 50 μm riboflavin, 3 mm ATP, and 5 μg of purified recombinant Fmn1 protein.

The elution positions of riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are indicated with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate independently that FMN1 encodes flavokinase in S. cerevisiae, the gene was overexpressed in yeast cells. In order to maximize the level of expression, a leu2d-based multicopy vector carrying the FMN1 open reading frame under the control of the strong ADH1 promoter was constructed (28Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). When this plasmid (pVT101L-FMN1) was introduced into thefmn1Δ null mutant strain, the resulting expression level of Fmn1p was elevated by approximately 50-fold as compared with that observed in the control wild-type strain, as estimated by determination of the flavokinase specific activity (TableI).

https://openalex.org/W1494122614,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is capable of inducing a variety of biologic responses through multiple signaling pathways. Because of the potential role of protein kinase C (PKC) in apoptosis, we examined the effects and mechanisms of TNF-α on PKC regulation, specifically on PKCα. In L929 murine fibroblasts, TNF-α (0.5– 5 nm) caused potent inhibition of PKCα activity and induced translocation of PKCα from the cytosol to the membrane. Treatment of cells with TNF-α also induced dephosphorylation of PKCα as detected by a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and inhibition of PKC phosphorylation as probed by anti-phospho-PKC antibodies. Since PKC is activated directly by diacylglycerol and inactivated indirectly by ceramide, we next examined the roles of these lipid mediators in the regulation of PKCα. Addition of TNF-α led to accumulation of both ceramide and diacylglycerol. Fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, and glutathione, an inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinase, both reversed the effect of TNF-α on PKCα activity, suggesting that ceramide production is necessary for the action of TNF-α. The diacylglycerol mimic phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was sufficient to cause translocation of PKCα, but not the mobility shift. Okadaic acid at 2 nm, a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the effects of TNF-α on PKCα activity, but not on PKCα translocation, thus demonstrating that dephosphorylation and translocation are independent processes. These results demonstrate that PKCα acts as a downstream target for TNF-α and that different lipid-mediated pathways in TNF-α signaling lead to opposing signals in the regulation of PKCα activity."

Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 6Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Despite the functional diversity of these nuclear proteins, participation in checkpoints responsive to DNA damage appears to be a unifying theme. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the BRCT motif has suggested that it might mediate interaction between proteins that contain it (7Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I.

DNA polymerase β (Pol β) plays an important role in base excision repair in mammals (8Wilson S. Abbotts J. Widen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Hammond R.A. McClung J.K. Miller M.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Wiebauer K.

The 39-kDa vertebrate protein is organized into a 31-kDa COOH-terminal domain that includes the polymerase active site (12Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and an 8-kDa NH2-terminal domain that participates in binding to DNA and exhibits 5′-deoxyribose phosphodiesterase (lyase) activity (13Wilson S.J. Singhal R.K. Kumar A. Bohr V.A. Wassermann K. Draemer K.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms. 35. Munksgaard, Copenhagen1992: 343-360Google Scholar). The presence of both polymerase and lyase activities suggests that Pol β functions in “short-patch” base excision repair by catalyzing both the removal of a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate intermediate and the subsequent filling of the resultant single-nucleotide gap (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Pol β is also implicated in “long-patch” base excision repair (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), suggesting functions in meiosis (16Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, Pol β-deficient cells are sensitive to DNA-alkylating agents such as methylmethane sulfonate but not to other DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet radiation (19Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), suggesting that another unidentified Pol β-like DNA polymerase might function in “long-patch” repair (including nucleotide excision repair). We have now isolated a human cDNA that encodes a Pol β-like protein, designated DNA polymerase β2 (Pol β2). The predicted Pol β2 protein contains a BRCT motif in its NH2-terminal region, and we describe its characterization as a Pol β-related DNA polymerase. Degenerate primers, 5′-GTIGTI(T/C)TNACNAA(T/C)AT(A/T/C)GG and 5′-CG(A/G/T)AT(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TGNGTNAC(A/G)TC, were designed on the basis of the sequence homology shared by the BRCT motifs ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe cut5 and human XRCC1 and were used to screen cDNAs from human MDAH041 cells with the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence analysis of a resulting PCR product revealed an incomplete open reading frame that encoded an amino acid sequence homologous to the BRCT domains of S. pombecut5 and human XRCC1. Additional 5′ sequences of this cDNA were obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and 3′ sequences were obtained by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene). The chromosomal location of the human Pol β2 gene was determined by fluorescencein situ hybridization as described previously (20Hirai M. Suto Y. Kanoh M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A biotinylated human Pol β2 cDNA probe that specifies nucleotide positions was allowed to hybridize overnight at 37 °C with R-banded chromosomes prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of normal donors. The slides were washed first for 10 min at 37 °C in 2× standard saline citrate containing 50% formamide and then for 15 min at room temperature in 1× standard saline citrate. Hybridization signals were detected with the use of rabbit antibodies to biotin (Enzo) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G (Enzo). The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide. Polyadenylated RNA isolated from the indicated human tissues (CLONTECH) was subjected to Northern blot analysis. Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide at 42 °C for 24 h with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of human Pol β2 cDNA (). Baculoviruses encoding Pol β2 tagged at its COOH terminus with the Myc epitope and six histidine residues (Pol β2-Myc-His6) were generated first by performing PCR with the 5′ primer 5′-TTTGAATTCACCACCATGGATCCCAGGGGTATCTGAAG (5′-1), the 3′ primer 5′-TTTCTCGAGCCAGTCCCGCTCAGCAGGTTCTCG (3′-1), and cDNA derived from human B cell leukemia (Raji) cells as template. The resulting PCR product was then digested with EcoRI andXhoI and ligated into pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen). The EcoRI-PmeI fragment of the resulting vector was subcloned into pVL1392 (Pharmingen) and introduced (1 μg) together with 2.5 μg of linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold; Pharmingen) into Sf9 cells by transfection. The truncated Pol β2 cDNA lacking the BRCT motif was generated by PCR with the 5′ primer TTTGAATTCACCACCATGTGTGCACAGCCCTCAAGCCAG, 3′-1, and pVL1392 hPol β2 cDNA as a template. The polymerase-inactive mutant (D427A-D429A) was generated by two-step PCR with 5′-1, 3′-1, the sense primer 5′-TGTGGTGCTGTCGCCGTGCTC, the antisense primer 5′-GAGCACGGCGACAGCACCACA, and pVL1392 hPol β2 cDNA as a template. Cells were lysed in ice-cold IP buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml)) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, phosphatase substrate (5 mg/ml) (Sigma)). Clear lysates were fractionated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% gel and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the Myc epitope or to the His6 tag (1:1000 dilution) (Medical and Biological Laboratory Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan and Invitrogen, respectively). Baculovirus-encoded wild-type Pol β2-Myc-His6, a truncation mutant of Pol β2 lacking the BRCT motif (ΔPol β2), and a catalytically inactive mutant (D427A-D429A) were immunoprecipitated from Sf9 cells with antibodies to Myc (MBL) and subjected to an in vitro DNA polymerase assay. The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, (dT)12–18 (40 μg/ml), activated DNA or poly(rA) (40 μg/ml), 0.1 mm[3H]dTTP (60 cpm/pmol), 15% glycerol, bovine serum albumin (400 μg/ml), 100 mm KCl, and enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C, the radioactive DNA product was collected on a disc of DEAE-cellulose as described (21Lindell T.J. Weinberg F. Morris P.W. Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Science. 1970; 170: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). One unit of DNA polymerase activity was defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of [3H]dTMP into polymeric DNA per 60 min. To isolate human cDNAs for previously unidentified proteins that contain a BRCT motif, we performed PCR with degenerate primers based on the sequence homology apparent between the BRCT motifs of S. pombe cut5, also known as rad4 (22Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and human XRCC1 (23Thompson L.H. Brookman K.W. Jones J.J. Allen S.A. Carrano A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A 114-base pair PCR product was then used to isolate a corresponding full-length human cDNA, the nucleotide sequence of which encodes a protein of 575 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 63,421 Da (Fig. 1 A). The predicted protein, which we have termed Pol β2, contains a BRCT motif in its NH2-terminal region (Fig. 1B). The COOH-terminal portion of the predicted protein exhibits 33 and 27% sequence identity to corresponding regions of human Pol β and human TdT, respectively (Fig. 1C). The distribution of Pol β2 mRNA among various normal human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis. The Pol β2-specific probe recognized a 2.0-kilobase mRNA that was most abundant in testis and ovary and was present in smaller amounts in prostate, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (Fig. 2). The expression of Pol β2 in the testis suggests that, like Pol β, this enzyme may contribute to meiotic cell division during spermatogenesis. In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed the cell cycle-dependent expression of Pol β2 mRNA with higher expression being observed in quiescent and S- to M-phase cells (data not shown). To determine the subcellular localization of Pol β2, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression vector for a fusion construct comprising Pol β2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and then examined the cells by ultraviolet microscopy. The Pol β2-GFP fusion protein was localized predominantly to the nucleus, whereas GFP alone was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3 A). The nuclear localization of Pol β2 is thus consistent with the presence of a putative nuclear localization signal in the COOH-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 1A), as well as with its predicted function as a DNA polymerase. Mutations in the Pol β gene that result in the loss of base excision repair have been frequently associated with certain types of cancer, including prostate (24Dobashi Y. Shuin T. Tsuruga H. Uemura H. Torigoe S. Kubota Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2827-2829PubMed Google Scholar), colon (25Wang L. Patel U. Ghosh L. Banerjee S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4824-4827PubMed Google Scholar), bladder (26Matsuzaki J. Dobashi Y. Miyamoto H. Ikeda I. Fujinami K. Shuin T. Kubota Y. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 15: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), kidney (27Yan Z.J. Roy D. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 175-183PubMed Google Scholar), lung (28Bhattacharyya N. Chen H.C. Comhair S. Erzurum S.C. Banerjee S. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and stomach (29Iwanaga A. Ouchida M. Miyazaki K. Hori K. Mukai T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) tumors. To determine whether the human chromosomal region that contains the Pol β2 gene might also be associated with cancer, we determined the chromosomal localization of this gene. Fluorescencein situ hybridization analysis revealed that the Pol β2 gene is localized to human chromosome 10q24.3–25.1 (Fig.3 B). Loss of heterozygosity at this region has been associated with several cancers, including glioma (30Albarosa R. Colombo B.M. Roz L. Magnani I. Pollo B. Cirenei N. Giani C. Conti A.M. DiDonato S. Finocchiaro G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 1260-1267PubMed Google Scholar), as well as lung (31Kim S.K. Ro J.Y. Kemp B.L. Lee J.S. Kwon T.J. Hong W.K. Mao L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), prostate (32Ford S. Gray I.C. Spurr N.K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1998; 102: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and bladder (33Cappellen D. Gil Diez de Medina S. Chopin D. Thiery J.P. Radvanyi F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) tumors, suggesting that mutation or deletion of the Pol β2 gene may contribute to oncogenesis. To determine whether Pol β2 actually possesses DNA polymerase or TdT activities, we first generated recombinant Pol β2 proteins, tagged at their COOH termini with Myc and His6 epitope tags, in insect cells. Lysates of Sf9 cells expressing Pol β2-Myc-His6 proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the Myc or His6 tags. The tagged wild-type protein and a mutant protein (ΔPol β2; amino acids 240–575) lacking the BRCT motif yielded immunoreactive bands corresponding to the expected sizes of ∼68 and 48 kDa, respectively, with both types of antibodies (Fig.4). The recombinant proteins were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the Myc tag and assayed for DNA polymerase activity with activated DNA or poly(rA) as templates. The activity of Pol β expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (34Mizushima Y. Tanaka N. Kitamura A. Tamai K. Ikeda M. Takemura M. Sugawara F. Arai T. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochem J. 1998; 330: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was also assayed. The specific activity of the recombinant enzymes was calculated from the measured activity and the amount of protein as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometric scanning of the stained bands. The specific activity of Pol β was thus estimated as 2030 units/nmol with activated DNA and 57,800 units/nmol with poly(rA) (Table I). Pol β did not possess TdT activity. Wild-type Pol β2 also exhibited DNA polymerase activity, although its specific activity was less than that of Pol β (60 units/nmol with activated DNA and 2480 units/nmol with poly(rA)). Like Pol β, Pol β2 did not possess TdT activity. As a control, a Pol β2 mutant (D427A-D429A) in which conserved aspartate residues (35Date T. Yamamoto S. Tanihara K. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5286-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were replaced by alanine showed neither DNA polymerase nor TdT activities. In contrast, the ΔPol β2 mutant that lacks BRCT motif retained substantial DNA polymerase activity (370 units/nmol with activated DNA and 7810 units/nmol with poly(rA)), indicating that the BRCT domain is dispensable for DNA polymerase activity.Table IDNA polymerase activity of recombinant Pol β2ProteinPolymerase activityunits/nmolActivated DNAPoly(rA)(−) TemplatePol β2,030 ± 91057,800 ± 50401 ± 0.1Pol β260 ± 202,480 ± 2001 ± 0.1ΔPol β2370 ± 1307,810 ± 16101 ± 0.1(D427A–D429A)Pol β21 ± 0.11 ± 0.11 ± 0.1TdTND240 ± 1.6271 ± 14None1 ± 0.11 ± 0.11 ± 0.1Purified human Pol β expressed in E. coli, as well as wild-type and mutant (ΔPol β2 and D427A–D429A) Pol β2 proteins expressed in insect cells, were assayed for DNA polymerase activity with activated DNA or poly(rA) as templates.

Purified recombinant TdT protein was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Data are means ± S.E. of values from three independent experiments. ND, not determined. In summary, our results indicate that Pol β2 possesses DNA polymerase activity similar to that of Pol β. Given that the BRCT motif is thought to mediate protein-protein interaction, it is possible that interaction of Pol β2 with an unidentified protein (or proteins), such as DNA ligase, through the BRCT motif may regulate its DNA polymerase activity. The identification of Pol β2 also raises the possibility that Pol β and Pol β2 may cooperatively regulate base excision repair or nucleotide excision repair. We thank Drs. Noboru Motoyama, Yuichiro Tojima, and Atsuhi Fujimoto for helpful discussion."

Berne R.M. Circulation. 1992; 85: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Adenosine also has protective effects when elevated prior to ischemia (2Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A.

A brief, ischemic episode can “precondition” the heart, through adenosine receptor-mediated mechanisms, and protect it against injury sustained during a subsequent period of prolonged ischemia. This preconditioning effect can be simulated, in cultures of primary cardiac myocytes and in the isolated heart, by exposure to adenosine agonists selective for either A1 or A3 adenosine receptor subtypes, each of which causes a reduction in damage comparable to that induced by prior exposure to ischemia (2Murry C.E.

Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 33: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the specific mechanism of protection elicited by each receptor appears to be distinct and associated with activation of either phospholipase C or phospholipase D, respectively (10Parsons M. Young L. Lee J.-E. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the co-activation of A1 and A3receptors may induce a greater protection than activation of each receptor individually. Thus, the protection offered by A1and A3 receptors is not redundant, and in fact the receptors may act together to produce an additive protection (10Parsons M. Young L. Lee J.-E. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The additivity of protection offered by A1 and A3 receptor activation has suggested to us that a single agonist capable of activating both A1 and A3, but not A2A, receptors (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), might represent a new class of highly effective cardioprotective agents. Activation of A2Areceptors has been shown to increase myocyte death in ischemia (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because most of the effort in developing potent adenosine agonists has been aimed at pure subtype selectivity (13Jacobson K.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 184-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), it was not immediately obvious which derivatives of adenosine might be utilized to test this concept. A novel means of achieving mixed selectivity for A1 and A3 adenosine receptors was to covalently link different functionalized congeners of adenosine (14Jacobson K.A. Kirk K.L. Padgett W.L. Daly J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar), each of which has agonist selectivity for one of the desired subtypes. The “binary drug” approach based on chemically functionalized congeners (15Jacobson K.A. Lipkowski A.W. Moody T.W. Padgett W. Pijl E. Kirk K.L. Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1529-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has been utilized in synthesis of combinations of adenosine receptor ligands and biologically active peptides, specifically neurokinin agonists. Using this novel binary conjugate design for adenosine receptor agonists, as well as a newly developed cardiac myocyte model for adenosine-elicited cardioprotection, our objective was to test the novel concept that simultaneous activation of both A1 and A3 receptors exerted a cardioprotective effect that was significantly more potent than the result of activating either receptor individually. The rationale was that it may be possible to achieve tissue selectivity, such that a biological effect would only be observed in cells that have both receptor subtypes. The models utilized native adenosine A1 and A3receptors in cultured chick embryo ventricular cells, which exhibited the adenosine-elicited cardioprotection characteristic of that found in the intact heart (3Downey J.M.

Jacobson K. Belardinelli L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H661-H671PubMed Google Scholar). The latter resulted in a recombinant cardiac myocyte model in which the human adenosine receptors were coupled to a well-characterized cardiac cellular response. This study showed that the protective effect mediated by co-activation of both A1 and A3receptors by a single compound was significantly more potent than that produced by activation of either receptor individually. Full protection required stimulation of both receptors and occured within a therapeutic dose window in which only cells expressing both receptors showed this highly potent response. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX),1 N 6-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5′-N-methyluronamide (IB-MECA), and 3-ethyl-5-benzyl-2-methyl-6-phenyl-4-phenylethynyl-1,4-(±)-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (MRS 1191) were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Full-length cDNAs encoding the human adenosine A1and A3 receptors were kindly provided by M. Atkinson, A. Townsend-Nicholson, and P. R.

Triethylamine (0.50 ml), triphenylphosphine (2.2 mg, 0.008 mmol), palladium chloride (0.8 mg, 0.004 mmol), and copper(I) iodide (0.2 mg, 0.001 mmol) were added while stirring. Propargylamine (74 mg, 1.08 mmol) was then added, and stirring was continued overnight at 35 °C. The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was lyophilized for 30 min. The product was purified using preparative TLC (run twice, Silica Gel 60, 2000 μm, using a mobile phase consisting of chloroform:methanol, 10:1).

Atrial and ventricular cells were cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovo and maintained in culture as described previously (11Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1769-H1777PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stambaugh K. Jacobson K.A. Jiang J.-L. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H501-H505PubMed Google Scholar,18Liang B.T. Donovan L.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on day 3 in culture, at which time the medium was changed to a HEPES-buffered medium containing (in mM): 139 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.9 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, before exposing the myocytes to simulated ischemia. Simulated ischemia was induced by exposing the myocytes to 90 min of hypoxia and glucose deprivation in a hypoxic incubator (NuAire), where O2 was replaced by N2 as described previously (11Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1769-H1777PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stambaugh K. Jacobson K.A. Jiang J.-L. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H501-H505PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the 90-min ischemia the extent of myocyte injury was determined, and the myocytes were removed from the hypoxic incubator and re-exposed to room air (normal percentage of O2). Aliquots of the media were then obtained for creatine kinase activity measurement, which was followed by quantitation of the number of viable cells, as determined by the ability to exclude Trypan blue (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Measurement of the basal level of cell injury was made after parallel incubation of control cells under normal percentage of O2. The extent of ischemia-induced injury was quantitatively determined by the percentage of cells killed and by the amount of creatine kinase (CK) released into the media according to a previously described method (11Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1769-H1777PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of CK was measured as enzyme activity (units/mg), and increases in CK activity were determined. The percentage of cells killed was calculated as the number of cells obtained from the control group (representing cells not subjected to any hypoxia or drug treatment) minus the number of cells from the treatment group divided by number of cells in control group multiplied by 100%. The myocyte injury caused by 90 min of ischemia simulated under the present condition appears to be primarily the result of cell lysis due to necrotic death, as evidenced by release of cellular enzymes and proteins (11Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1769-H1777PubMed Google Scholar) and retention of injured cells in the supernatant following low speed centrifugation (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and not due to apoptosis (as evidenced by lack of DNA laddering, data not shown). Atrial cardiac myocytes were isolated, maintained in culture for 24 h, and then transfected with either the vector pcDNA3, cDNA encoding the human adenosine A3 receptor, or cDNAs encoding both adenosine A1 and A3receptors (27Liang B.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1382-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 24 h after the transfection, myocytes were treated for 10 min with the irreversible A1 antagonist (m-DITC-XAC, 5 μm, synthesized as reported previously (19Stiles G.L. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 724-728PubMed Google Scholar)) to inactivate the endogenous A1 receptor as well as any of the exogenous human A1 receptor. The cells were washed three times with fresh medium and incubated with medium containing 6% fetal calf serum for 24 h. These myocytes were then exposed to simulated ischemia in the presence or absence of agonist. Because the expression of the exogenous receptor is driven by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, any receptor that appears after the m-DITC-XAC treatment is likely the exogenous adenosine receptor. This is supported by the lack of cardioprotective response to the A1 agonist ADAC in pcDNA3-transfected myocytes after the irreversible A1 antagonist treatment and the reappearance of an ADAC response in pcDNA3/hA1R-transfected myocytes (data not shown). These interventions allowed selective expression of only A1or A3 receptors or both A1 and A3receptors in the myocytes. To directly determine the effect of agonists at the exogenous adenosine receptors, adenosine deaminase was included with the agonists during the 90-min ischemia after the cells were pre-exposed to 5 min of ischemia. Myocytes can be protected by a 5-min exposure to ischemia before the 90-min ischemia. In this phenomenon, known as “ischemic preconditioning,” activation of the adenosine receptor by the endogenous adenosine is required during both the 5-min pre-exposure to ischemia and the 90-min ischemia (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protective effect induced by the 5-min exposure to ischemia can be abolished by eliminating the endogenous adenosine with adenosine deaminase (7Liang B.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The concomitant presence of receptor agonist along with adenosine deaminase during the 90-min simulated ischemia restored the protective effect, allowing a direct determination of the effect mediated by agonist at either the native or the transfected human adenosine receptor. Binding of [3H]R-N 6-phenylisopropyladenosine ([3H]R-PIA) to A1 receptors from rat cerebral cortex membranes and of [3H]-2-(4-[(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]ethylamino)-5′-N-ethylcarbamoyladenosine ([3H]CGS 21680) to A2A receptors from rat striatal membranes was performed as described previously (20Schwabe U. Trost T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 313: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Jarvis M.F. Schutz R. Hutchison A.J. Do E. Sills M.A. Williams M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine deaminase (3 units/ml) was present during the preparation of the brain membranes, in a preincubation of 30 min at 30 °C, and during the incubation with the radioligands. Binding of [125I]N 6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-5′-N-methylcarbamoyladenosine ([125I]AB-MECA) to membranes prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the human A3 receptor was performed as described (22Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982PubMed Google Scholar). The assay medium consisted of a buffer containing 10 mm Mg2+, 50 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA, at pH 8.0. The glass incubation tubes contained 100 ml of the membrane suspension (0.3 mg of protein/ml, stored at −80 °C in the same buffer), 50 ml of [125I]AB-MECA (final concentration 0.3 nm), and 50 ml of a solution of the proposed antagonist. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm N 6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA). All non-radioactive compounds were initially dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with buffer to the final concentration, where the amount of Me2SO never exceeded 2%. Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters, using a cell harvester (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD). The tubes were rinsed three times with 3 ml of buffer in each case. At least five different concentrations of competitor, spanning three orders of magnitude adjusted appropriately for the IC50 of each compound, were used. IC50 values, calculated with the nonlinear regression method implemented in the InPlot program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), were converted to apparent Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (23Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12265) Google Scholar) and Ki values of 1.0 nm([3H]R-PIA); 14 nm([3H]CGS 21680); 0.59 nm and 1.46 nm ([125I]AB-MECA at human and rat A3 receptors, respectively). Based on our previous study demonstrating a synergistic action of A1 and A3 adenosine receptors in cardioprotection, we sought to design novel, mixed A1/A3 adenosine receptor agonists using a “functionalized congener” approach (14Jacobson K.A. Kirk K.L. Padgett W.L. Daly J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar). Novel derivatives were created by the “binary drug” approach, in which two functionalized congeners of adenosine agonists, each of which was selective for either A1 or A3 adenosine receptor subtypes, were covalently coupled. This was a means of modulating the selectivity ratio to increase and approximately match affinities at A1and A3 receptors while diminishing affinity at A2A receptors (6Strickler J. Jacobson K.A. Liang B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The synthesis of an amine-functionalized congener, 3a, derived from the A3 receptor-selective agonist IB-MECA is shown in Fig. 1. This amine derivative was intended to serve as a common intermediate for two conceptual approaches: binary drugs (15Jacobson K.A. Lipkowski A.W. Moody T.W. Padgett W. Pijl E. Kirk K.L. Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1529-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and2) and amino acid conjugates (14Jacobson K.A. Kirk K.L. Padgett W.L. Daly J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar, 24Siddiqi S.M. Pearlstein R.A. Sanders L.H. Jacobson K.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1331-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The amine derivative 3a was adequately reactive toward acylation to form the desired conjugates. The inclusion of a rigid, narrow molecular “rod” in the form of an ethynyl group in3a as a means of preserving A3 receptor affinity was predicted by molecular modeling (24Siddiqi S.M. Pearlstein R.A. Sanders L.H. Jacobson K.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1331-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The m-position of the benzyl ring in receptor binding appeared to accommodate long chain extension having minimal steric bulk. This derivative was coupled to an adenosine carboxylic agonist, 4, which was previously shown to form amides that display selectivity for A1 adenosine receptors (17Jacobson K.A. Kirk K.L. Padgett W.L. Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 1341-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), to form the binary conjugate 5 (MRS 1543, Fig. 1). Compound 3a was also converted to a simple N-acylated derivative, 3b, which was tested for adenosine receptor affinity. In a separate reaction sequence (Fig. 2) the adenosine amine congener (ADAC, 7) was coupled to3a, leading to binary conjugates 8a (MRS 1740) and 8b (MRS 1741), containing longer spacers than in5. These two conjugates were regioisomers that differed only in the substitution pattern of the cross-linking moiety (19Stiles G.L. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 724-728PubMed Google Scholar) phenylene diisothiocyanate (DITC).Figure 2The synthesis of the binary conjugates MRS 1740 and MRS 1741. These conjugates are composed of separate adenosine moieties, each of which selectively activates either the A1 or A3 receptor. The A1-activating moiety is an amine congener of adenosine and the A3 receptor-activating moiety is a phenylpropargylamine derivative, the synthesis of which is outlined in Fig. 1. The covalent joining of the separate moieties is done through a cross-linking reagent, m- or p-phenylene diisothiocyanate.

https://openalex.org/W1991337227,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is able to phosphorylate a variety of agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and plays an important role in GPCR modulation. However, recent studies suggest additional cellular functions for GRK2. Phosducin and phosducin-like protein (PhLP) are cytosolic proteins that bind Gβγ subunits and act as regulators of G-protein signaling. In this report, we identify phosducin and PhLP as novel GRK2 substrates. The phosphorylation of purified phosducin and PhLP by recombinant GRK2 proceeds rapidly and stoichiometrically (0.82 ± 0.1 and 0.83 ± 0.09 mol of Pi/mol of protein, respectively). The phosphorylation reactions exhibit apparent Km values in the range of 40–100 nm, strongly suggesting that both proteins could be endogenous targets for GRK2 activity. Our data show that the site of phosducin phosphorylation by GRK2 is different and independent from that previously reported for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Analysis of GRK2 phosphorylation of a variety of deletion mutants of phosducin and PhLP indicates that the critical region for GRK2 phosphorylation is localized in the C-terminal domain of both phosducin and PhLP (between residues 204 and 245 and 195 and 218, respectively). This region is important for the interaction of these proteins with Gβγ subunits. Phosphorylation of phosducin by GRK2 markedly reduces its Gβγ binding ability, suggesting that GRK2 may modulate the activity of the phosducin protein family by disrupting this interaction. The identification of phosducin and PhLP as new substrates for GRK2 further expands the cellular roles of this kinase and suggests new mechanisms for modulating GPCR signal transduction.

The identification of phosducin and PhLP as new substrates for GRK2 further expands the cellular roles of this kinase and suggests new mechanisms for modulating GPCR signal transduction.

Interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins promotes GTP/GDP exchange and dissociation into Gα and Gβγ subunits, both of which modulate different membrane-bound effector proteins. This signal transduction process is regulated at different levels. Agonist-activated GPCRs are phosphorylated by a family of specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This is followed by binding of regulatory proteins termed arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor leading to uncoupling from G proteins, a process known as desensitization (reviewed in Refs.1Pitcher J.A.

Recent data indicate that GRK2 and β-arrestins play additional roles in GPCR regulation and signaling. These proteins also initiate receptor internalization by facilitating the interaction of the receptor complex with the endocytic machinery.

Moreover, recent data suggest that GRK2 and β-arrestin may directly participate in GPCR-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade by allowing the recruitment of signaling proteins such as Src-tyrosine kinase (8Luttrell L.M.

Agonist-induced translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane involves its interaction with receptor domains and binding of the C-terminal domain of GRK2 to both free Gβγ subunits and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (12Pitcher J.A.

In addition, an as yet unidentified anchoring protein present in microsomal membranes also modulates GRK2 localization and activity (21Garcı́a-Higuera I. Penela P. Murga C. Egea G. Bonay P.

The occurrence of different cellular pools of GRK2 suggests the existence of additional substrates and cellular functions for this kinase.Other regulatory mechanisms of GPCR signaling involve direct modulation of G-protein activities. Interaction of regulators of G-proteinsignaling family members with activated Gα subunits increases its GTPase activity and modulates termination of the signal (23Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosducin and phosducin-like proteins (PhLP) are able to preferentially bind to Gβγ subunits, thus interfering with Gβγ-mediated signaling pathways and with re-association with Gα·GDP (24Lee R.H.

Both proteins have been reported to compete for Gβγ binding with other targets such as adenylyl cyclases or phospholipase Cβ2 resulting in modulation of GPCR signaling (25Bauer P.H. Müller S.

In the case of phosducin, its ability to interact with Gβγ dimers is attenuated upon phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), thus providing a mechanism for regulating its function (35Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas regulation of PhLP remains unclear because PKA does not phosphorylate PhLP (37Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40-49PubMed Google Scholar).Despite this data, very little is known about how these regulatory mechanisms at the receptor and G-protein levels are integrated during cellular responses to agonists. Because both GRK2 and phosducins are able to interact with Gβγ subunits, it is tempting to suggest that they may influence one another. In fact, phosducins have been shown to inhibit Gβγ-mediated GRK2 activation and translocation (29Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Hekman M. Bauer P.H. Söhlemann P. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that phosducin and PhLP are high-affinity substrates for GRK2 and that such phosphorylation results in inhibition of the Gβγ binding ability. Together with recent data that identify tubulin as a substrate for GRK2 (39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

In line with recent reports that show that tubulin is phosphorylated by this kinase (39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

The emerging evidence that the activity of this kinase is not restricted to agonist-occupied GPCR suggests that GRK2 may also act as an effector of GPCR signaling and have additional cellular roles.Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of phosducin proteins may have physiological relevance. The phosphorylation reactions proceed rapidly and stoichiometrically. The apparent Km (40 nm for phosducin and 103 nm for PhLP) displays far higher affinity (10,000-fold) than that reported for peptide substrates of GRK2 (withKm in the range of 1.3 mm, Ref. 46Benovic J.L. Stone C.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and compares well with the Km for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin (0.4–1 μm, see Refs. 39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km data for phosducin and PhLP and the conditions of our assays are also well within the range of the reported total cellular concentrations of phosducin (∼1 μm, Ref. 31Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and GRK2 (0.01–0.02 μm, Ref. 40Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that phosducin and PhLP are high-affinity substrates for GRK2. Though the interaction of GRK2 with agonist-occupied receptors and Gβγ subunits promotes an allosteric activation of the kinase (14Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosducin phosphorylation by GRK2 is not altered in the presence of bleached rhodopsin (data not shown), suggesting that it is not the activated receptor itself that promotes phosducin phosphorylation. Future experiments will be directed to investigate the mechanisms of this phosphorylation process in living cells and its potential modulation by GPCR-mediated signaling pathways.Our results indicate that the critical determinants for GRK2 phosphorylation are located within the C-terminal domain of both phosducin and PhLP (between residues 205 and 245 and 196 and 218, respectively), thus suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism in which these regions contain the phosphorylation sites and/or required docking sites for the action of the kinase. These regions contain some serine and threonine residues in the vicinity of negative-charged amino acids, consistent with previous reports showing that GRK2 preferentially phosphorylates substrates containing acidic residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site (48Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These C-terminal domains are critically involved in the interaction of phosducin and PhLP with its main physiological target, the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The crystal structure of phosducin complexed with the βγ subunits of transducin (26Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) suggests that phosducin binds with its C-terminal domain to the side of the β-propeller, whereas its less well defined N terminus is stretched out on the face of the propeller, covering sites where Gβγ interacts with Gα. In fact, a small peptide fragment within the C terminus of phosducin (amino acids 215–232) appears to be sufficient for high-affinity Gβγ binding and is able to disrupt Gβγ-mediated functions (27Blüml K. Schnepp W. Schröder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, point mutations in this region markedly reduce functional activity of phosducin (27Blüml K. Schnepp W. Schröder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, a similar model of PhLP-Gβγ interaction has been predicted (26Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and several types of functional studies also indicate that the C-terminal part of PhLP plays a key role in Gβγ binding (30Thibault C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Through interaction with free Gβγ subunits, phosducin and PhLP have been shown to interfere with a variety of GPCR signaling pathways triggered by different G proteins (25Bauer P.H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reported modulation of phosducin function by PKA phosphorylation provides a clear feedback regulatory mechanism in the case of receptor signaling leading to changes in cellular cAMP concentrations. GRK2-mediated phosphorylation may represent an additional mechanism for the modulation of phosducin interaction with Gβγ subunits released upon receptor-mediated Gi or Go activation. GRK2-mediated regulation of phosducins further differs from that by PKA in three important ways. (a) The phosphorylation of phosducin by PKA and GRK2 is independent and takes place at different sites. (b) GRK2 has more subtle effects on phosducin function than PKA. (c) Although the effect of PKA is restricted to phosducin, GRK2 also phosphorylates PhLP. These data suggest independent control of phosducin functions by the two different types of kinases. Agonist occupancy of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 triggers interaction with different types of cellular proteins. Interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins promotes GTP/GDP exchange and dissociation into Gα and Gβγ subunits, both of which modulate different membrane-bound effector proteins. This signal transduction process is regulated at different levels. Agonist-activated GPCRs are phosphorylated by a family of specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This is followed by binding of regulatory proteins termed arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor leading to uncoupling from G proteins, a process known as desensitization (reviewed in Refs.1Pitcher J.A.

This binding process results in an enhanced activity of GRK2 toward its substrates (14Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, an as yet unidentified anchoring protein present in microsomal membranes also modulates GRK2 localization and activity (21Garcı́a-Higuera I. Penela P. Murga C. Egea G. Bonay P.

The occurrence of different cellular pools of GRK2 suggests the existence of additional substrates and cellular functions for this kinase. Other regulatory mechanisms of GPCR signaling involve direct modulation of G-protein activities. Interaction of regulators of G-proteinsignaling family members with activated Gα subunits increases its GTPase activity and modulates termination of the signal (23Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosducin and phosducin-like proteins (PhLP) are able to preferentially bind to Gβγ subunits, thus interfering with Gβγ-mediated signaling pathways and with re-association with Gα·GDP (24Lee R.H.

Both proteins have been reported to compete for Gβγ binding with other targets such as adenylyl cyclases or phospholipase Cβ2 resulting in modulation of GPCR signaling (25Bauer P.H. Müller S.

In the case of phosducin, its ability to interact with Gβγ dimers is attenuated upon phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), thus providing a mechanism for regulating its function (35Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol.

Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40-49PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this data, very little is known about how these regulatory mechanisms at the receptor and G-protein levels are integrated during cellular responses to agonists. Because both GRK2 and phosducins are able to interact with Gβγ subunits, it is tempting to suggest that they may influence one another. In fact, phosducins have been shown to inhibit Gβγ-mediated GRK2 activation and translocation (29Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Hekman M. Bauer P.H. Söhlemann P. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that phosducin and PhLP are high-affinity substrates for GRK2 and that such phosphorylation results in inhibition of the Gβγ binding ability. Together with recent data that identify tubulin as a substrate for GRK2 (39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have identified phosducin and PhLP as new substrates for GRK2. In line with recent reports that show that tubulin is phosphorylated by this kinase (39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

The emerging evidence that the activity of this kinase is not restricted to agonist-occupied GPCR suggests that GRK2 may also act as an effector of GPCR signaling and have additional cellular roles.Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of phosducin proteins may have physiological relevance. The phosphorylation reactions proceed rapidly and stoichiometrically. The apparent Km (40 nm for phosducin and 103 nm for PhLP) displays far higher affinity (10,000-fold) than that reported for peptide substrates of GRK2 (withKm in the range of 1.3 mm, Ref. 46Benovic J.L. Stone C.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and compares well with the Km for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin (0.4–1 μm, see Refs. 39Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A.

Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km data for phosducin and PhLP and the conditions of our assays are also well within the range of the reported total cellular concentrations of phosducin (∼1 μm, Ref. 31Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and GRK2 (0.01–0.02 μm, Ref. 40Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that phosducin and PhLP are high-affinity substrates for GRK2. Though the interaction of GRK2 with agonist-occupied receptors and Gβγ subunits promotes an allosteric activation of the kinase (14Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosducin phosphorylation by GRK2 is not altered in the presence of bleached rhodopsin (data not shown), suggesting that it is not the activated receptor itself that promotes phosducin phosphorylation. Future experiments will be directed to investigate the mechanisms of this phosphorylation process in living cells and its potential modulation by GPCR-mediated signaling pathways.Our results indicate that the critical determinants for GRK2 phosphorylation are located within the C-terminal domain of both phosducin and PhLP (between residues 205 and 245 and 196 and 218, respectively), thus suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism in which these regions contain the phosphorylation sites and/or required docking sites for the action of the kinase. These regions contain some serine and threonine residues in the vicinity of negative-charged amino acids, consistent with previous reports showing that GRK2 preferentially phosphorylates substrates containing acidic residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site (48Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These C-terminal domains are critically involved in the interaction of phosducin and PhLP with its main physiological target, the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The crystal structure of phosducin complexed with the βγ subunits of transducin (26Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) suggests that phosducin binds with its C-terminal domain to the side of the β-propeller, whereas its less well defined N terminus is stretched out on the face of the propeller, covering sites where Gβγ interacts with Gα. In fact, a small peptide fragment within the C terminus of phosducin (amino acids 215–232) appears to be sufficient for high-affinity Gβγ binding and is able to disrupt Gβγ-mediated functions (27Blüml K. Schnepp W. Schröder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, point mutations in this region markedly reduce functional activity of phosducin (27Blüml K. Schnepp W. Schröder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, a similar model of PhLP-Gβγ interaction has been predicted (26Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reported modulation of phosducin function by PKA phosphorylation provides a clear feedback regulatory mechanism in the case of receptor signaling leading to changes in cellular cAMP concentrations. GRK2-mediated phosphorylation may represent an additional mechanism for the modulation of phosducin interaction with Gβγ subunits released upon receptor-mediated Gi or Go activation. GRK2-mediated regulation of phosducins further differs from that by PKA in three important ways. (a) The phosphorylation of phosducin by PKA and GRK2 is independent and takes place at different sites. (b) GRK2 has more subtle effects on phosducin function than PKA. (c) Although the effect of PKA is restricted to phosducin, GRK2 also phosphorylates PhLP. These data suggest independent control of phosducin functions by the two different types of kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2039712280,"Calcyclin (S100A6) is an S100 calcium-binding protein whose expression is up-regulated in proliferating and differentiating cells. A novel 30-kDa protein exhibiting calcium-dependent calcyclin-binding (calcyclin-binding protein, CacyBP) had been identified, purified, and cloned previously (Filipek, A., and Kuznicki, J. (1998) J. Neurochem. 70, 1793–1798). Here, we have defined the calcyclin binding region using limited proteolysis and a set of deletion mutants of CacyBP. A fragment encompassing residues 178–229 (CacyBP-(178–229)) was capable of full binding to calcyclin. CacyBP-(178–229) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified. The protein fragment cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was shown by CD to contain 5% α-helix, 15% β -sheet, and 81% random coil. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine calcyclin dissociation constants of 0.96 and 1.2 μm for intact CacyBP and CacyBP-(178–229), respectively, indicating that the fragment can be used for characterization of calcyclin-CacyBP interactions. NMR analysis of CacyBP-(178–229) binding-induced changes in the chemical shifts of15N-enriched calcyclin revealed that CacyBP binding occurs at a discrete site on calcyclin with micromolar affinity.

Later calcyclin was found to be expressed at high levels in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, in cells with high proliferating activity, and those undergoing differentiation (8Leonard D.G. Ziff E.B.

Although the three-dimensional structures of calcyclin in the absence and presence of calcium have been determined (17Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J.

CacyBP was initially identified, purified, and characterized from EAT cells (16Filipek A. Wojda U. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing of chymotryptic fragments suggested that it was a novel protein, so CacyBP was cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library and sequenced (1Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Except for a recently submitted hypothetical protein, which is apparently a human homologue of CacyBP, the nucleotide sequence of CacyBP reveals no homology to any other sequence deposited in standard data bases. Recombinant CacyBP was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its interaction with calcyclin was shown to occur at physiological calcium concentration (1Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that CacyBP is present at high level in the mouse and rat brain, particularly in the neuronal cells (19Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Nowicka D. Kaczmarek L. Kuznicki J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since little is known about the functional role of calcyclin in the cell and CacyBP is one of the primary putative targets, we set out to identify the region of CacyBP responsible for binding to calcyclin and characterize the corresponding complex. To achieve this goal we first subcloned, expressed, and purified CacyBP. Then, we carried out a series of limited proteolysis experiments to search for evidence of CacyBP domain structure and probe the calcyclin-binding site. Deletion mutagenesis was used next to characterize the CacyBP-calcyclin interaction and further localize the binding site on CacyBP. NMR spectroscopy on 15N-enriched calcyclin was used to confirm that CacyBP has a specific binding site on calcyclin. Restriction enzyme recognition sites are in bold. The list is as follows: p30ATG-Bam, GGATCGGATCCATGGCTTCCGTTTTGGAAGAG; p30ATG-Eco, ATGTAGAATTCATGGCTTCCGTTTTGGAA; p30ATG-Nde, GAGAGCATATGGCTTCCGTTTTGGAA; p30TGA, GAGACGAATTCTCATCAAAATTCCGTGTCTTC; p30-(25C), GATAGGTCGACTCATCAGTCTCCGTCTTCATAAAT; p30-(50C), GAGAGGTCGACTCATCACTTTTCTTTCTCTTTGC; p30-(149N), GGCGTGGATATCACAGTAATTATTCTATGTAG; p30-(200N), GATAGCCATGGAAGACGGAGACGATGAT; p30-(1409–1391), GGTGGGAATTCTTTTTTTTTCATCTTTTAAG; p30–166f, CTCTCGGATCCTACTTAACACAGGTGGAA; p30–178f, GAGAGGGATCCGAAAAGCCTTCCTACGAC; and p30–206b, GAGAGGAATTCTCAATCATCGTCTCCGTCTTC. PCR was carried out with CacyBP cDNA in pBluescript vector (1Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as template and primers: p30ATG-Nde and p30TGA for rCacyBP; p30ATG-Eco and p30-(25C) for Δ25C mutant; p30ATG-Eco and p30-(50C) for Δ50C; p30-(149N) and p30TGA for Δ149N; p30-(200N) and p30-(1409–1391) for Δ200N; p30–166f and p30TGA for GST-CacyBP-(166–229); p30–178f and p30TGA for GST-CacyBP-(178–229); and p30–178f and p30–206b for GST-CacyBP-(178–206) (see “Primer List”). Pfu DNA polymerase was used in 30 cycles of PCR. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated with linearized pGEX-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST fusion proteins and pET30a vector (Novagen) for all other constructs. The ligation reaction mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli cells (TOP10F′). Potential clones were screened with colony PCR, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by restriction analysis. The constructs were then introduced into BL21 strain ofE. coli. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. BL21 cells carrying appropriate constructs were grown in LB medium with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) for pET30 constructs and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) for pGEX constructs. WhenA 600 reached a value of 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 1 mm (pET30) or 0.1 mm (pGEX), and the bacteria were further cultured for 3 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, washed once with ice-cold buffer A (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and resuspended in buffer A with 0.25 mm PMSF. For cells expressing GST fusion proteins, Triton X-100 was added to final concentration of 1%. The suspension was sonicated 6 times for 20 s with tip sonicator (Branson Sonifier 250). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. To purify rCacyBP, the cleared lysate was dialyzed overnight against buffer A with 0.25 mm PMSF. CaCl2 was added to 1 mm final concentration, and the preparation was applied to a Sepharose-calcyclin affinity column. Sepharose-calcyclin was prepared according to the procedure given by the manufacturer of the CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sepharose-calcyclin affinity column was equilibrated with buffer B (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.25 mm PMSF), and cleared cell lysates or proteolytic digest reactions were applied. The column was then washed extensively with buffer B plus 0.5 m NaCl, and the bound fraction was eluted with buffer C (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm PMSF). For the GST fusion proteins, the cleared lysates of BL21 cells carrying the appropriate constructs were applied to Sepharose-glutathione affinity column. The column was then washed extensively with buffer A, and the bound GST fusion protein was eluted with 10 mmreduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. 0.24 μg of protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus was added to 1.2 mg of purified rCacyBP in buffer A (w/w 1:5000). The reaction mixture was incubated for 40 min at room temperature. CaCl2 was added to 1 mm final concentration, and the preparation was applied to a Sepharose-calcyclin affinity column. Unbound and EGTA-eluted fractions were analyzed on Tricine-SDS gel prepared according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). For amino acid sequencing, the fragments were separated on SDS-15% PAGE and electroblotted on polyvinylidene (difluoride) membrane (Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS buffer with 10% methanol. Transferred peptides were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brillant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid and destained in 50% methanol. Three bands were excised from the membrane, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed on a gas phase sequencer (model 491, Perkin-Elmer) at the BioCenter of Jagiellonian University (Cracow, Poland). The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were analyzed by on-line gradient high performance liquid chromatography on a model 140C Microgradient Delivery System equipped with a model 785A Programmable Absorbance detection system (Perkin-Elmer). The binding of CacyBP deletion mutants and GST fusion proteins to calcyclin was characterized by calcyclin affinity chromatography and ligand blotting. For affinity chromatography experiments, unbound and EGTA-eluted fractions were analyzed on SDS-15% PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue R-250. Ligand blotting was carried out essentially as described (22Filipek A. Wojda U. Lesniak W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); recombinant mouse calcyclin was 125I-labeled with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech reagent. rCacyBP and CacyBP deletion mutants were analyzed on SDS-15% PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. After washing and blocking, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmCaCl2 (or 2 mm EGTA) with 10−5m calcyclin supplemented with125I-labeled calcyclin (3.7 105 cpm in 5 ml of incubation buffer). The blots were washed, dried, and exposed for 4 days to x-ray film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A solution of 20 mg of GST-CacyBP-(178–229) eluted from the glutathione affinity column was brought to 100 mm in NaCl and 2.5 mm in CaCl2. Biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) was added (20 units), and the protein was digested at room temperature for 24 h. 400 μl of 50% streptavidin-agarose slurry (Sigma) was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min to bind the protease. Streptavidin-agarose was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was ultrafiltered in an Amicon concentrator using a YM10 (M r 10,000 cut-off) membrane. The flow-through fraction was then concentrated using a YM3 (M r 3,000 cut-off) membrane, and the protein concentration was measured from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8250 m−1cm−1. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a J-720 Jasco spectropolarimeter. The spectrum of 10 μmCacyBP-(178–229) in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was collected from 180 to 260 nm, with a resolution of 0.2 nm and 1-s response time for each point. 14 scans were accumulated. The data were converted to mean residue ellipticity, and the secondary structure content was calculated according to the method of Chen and co-workers (23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar) using the Microsoft Dicroprot program. Protein concentration was measured from the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficient of 3840 m−1cm−1 for calcyclin and 26,150m−1 cm−1for CacyBP. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a SPEX FLUOROMAX spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 284 nm for CacyBP and 287 nm for CacyBP-(178–229). Emission was scanned from 300 to 400 nm with excitation and emission band passes set to 5 nm. The emission spectra of 2 μm CacyBP and 2 μm CacyBP-(178–229) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1 mm CaCl2 were recorded before and after addition of 10 μm calcyclin. For the titrations, 1.1 mm stock solution of calcyclin was added in 0.5–2-μl aliquots to 2.5 ml of 2 μm CacyBP and 2 μmCacyBP-(178–229). The fluorescence change ΔF was monitored at 370 nm for the intact protein and at 382 nm for the fragment. The data were corrected for calcyclin fluorescence and dilution and then normalized and plotted against calcyclin concentration ([calcyclin]). The ΔF versus[calcyclin] plots were then fitted using the KaleidaGraph program with Equation 1 as follows: ΔF=ΔFmax [calcyclin]/(Kd+[calcyclin])Equation 1 where K d is the dissociation constant and ΔF max the maximal fluorescence change. The NMR experiments were conducted at 25 °C on a Bruker AVANCE-500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance, three-axis gradient probe. The production of15N-enriched rabbit calcyclin by recombinant techniques has been described previously (18Sastry M. Ketchem R.R. Crescenzi O. Weber C. Lubienski M.J. Hidaka H. Chazin W.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 223-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The titration of calcyclin with CacyBP-(178–229) was carried out by adding 40-μl aliquots of a stock solution of 2.5 mm peptide in 150 mm NaCl to 450 μl of 0.5 mm15N calcyclin in 50 mm Tris-d 11, 30 mmCaCl2 at pH 7.1. The titration was followed by monitoring the chemical shift changes observed in two-dimensional15N-1H HSQC spectra (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional spectra were recorded with a 1H spectral width of 14 ppm centered at the water peak. The 15N spectral width of 30 ppm was centered at 119 ppm, and 160 experiments were collected with quadrature detection achieved using time proportional phase incrementation phase cycling. To maintain the sensitivity of the spectra during the titration, the number of transients were increased as the sample was diluted. All data sets were processed using FELIX 97.0 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego). The FID was convoluted with a low order polynomial to remove the residual water signal followed by a shifted (45o) sine-squared apodizing function. In the indirect dimension the FID was extended by linear predicting up to one-third the number of points before applying a shifted (54o) sine-squared window function. Both dimensions were zero-filled to yield a transformed matrix of size 1024 × 1024 real points. The expression of recombinant CacyBP (rCacyBP) was achieved by amplifying its cDNA in a PCR and subcloning into the pET30 vector. The construct was then introduced into E. coli strain BL21. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, expression of soluble rCacyBP was obtained at the level of ∼40 mg/liter of medium. Recombinant protein migrated on SDS-15% PAGE with apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa, the same as for native CacyBP. To purify rCacyBP we took advantage of its calcium-dependent binding to calcyclin. rCacyBP bound to the affinity column in the presence of Ca2+ and was eluted with buffer containing 4 mmEGTA (Fig. 1). The protein purity from visualization on SDS-PAGE was estimated to be around 95%. As the first step toward identifying the region of CacyBP responsible for calcyclin binding, limited proteolysis experiments were carried out with protease XIV from S. griseus. A fragment cleaved at residue 68 (residues 69–229) bound to calcyclin with an apparent affinity similar to that of the intact CacyBP, whereas a second fragment with the N terminus fully intact (i.e. cleaved at the C terminus) did not. Therefore, we concluded that the calcyclin binding domain(s) is located after residue 68 and likely in the C-terminal portion of CacyBP. Four deletion mutants of CacyBP were constructed to delineate more precisely the calcyclin binding region. Two of these mutants (Δ25C and Δ50C) were truncations of 25 and 50 amino acids from the C terminus of CacyBP, respectively. The other two mutants (Δ149N and Δ200N) were truncations from the N terminus, leaving the last 80 and 30 C-terminal residues, respectively (Fig.2 A). Lysates of E. coli expressing CacyBP and fusions of these deletion mutants with histidine tag and S-tag were applied to a calcyclin affinity column. Both the unbound and bound fractions (eluted with 2 mm EGTA buffer) were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. Fig.2 B shows that rCacyBP and the Δ149N mutant bound calcyclin, whereas the binding potential of Δ25C was reduced, and Δ50C and Δ200N did not bind. The binding of all deletion mutants to calcyclin was also assayed by ligand blotting. A nitrocellulose blot with rCacyBP and deletion mutants was probed with calcyclin labeled with 125I, and the results were essentially the same (data not shown). Additional constructs were then prepared in an effort to localize further the calcyclin binding region of CacyBP. DNA fragments corresponding to CacyBP residues 166–229, 178–229, and 178–206 were subcloned into pGEX vector (Fig. 3 A). The GST fusion proteins of these three CacyBP fragments were expressed in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column. Their ability to bind calcyclin was probed using the affinity chromatography approach described above. Fig. 3 B shows that GST-CacyBP-(166–229) and GST-CacyBP-(178–229) bound to calcyclin, but GST-CacyBP-(178–206) did not. Thus, the shortest fragment that retained calcyclin binding was CacyBP-(178–229) with sequence shown in Fig. 3 C. The purification of GST-CacyBP-(178–229) by glutathione-Sepharose affinity was scaled up to produce mg quantities of protein. The purified fusion protein was cleaved with biotinylated thrombin, and the resulting mixture was ultrafiltered using a YM10 membrane (M r 10,000 cut-off). The flow-through fraction contained pure CacyBP fragment (Fig. 4, lane e). The circular dichroism spectrum of CacyBP-(178–229) (not shown) revealed that the fragment is largely unstructured. Secondary structure content calculated according to the method of Chen and co-workers (23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar) estimated 5% α-helix, 15% β-sheet, and 81% random coil. Binding of CacyBP and CacyBP-(178–229) to calcyclin was next studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 5,A and C, shows that calcyclin binding induces a 32% decrease of tryptophan fluorescence intensity for CacyBP and both a 20% decrease and a blue-shift of ∼10 nm for CacyBP-(178–229). Fig. 5, B and D, shows that the quenching effect was dose-dependent, and the titration curves provided aK d value of 0.96 μm for intact CacyBP and 1.2 μm for CacyBP-(178–229). The interaction of calcyclin and CacyBP was further characterized by using NMR spectroscopy to monitor a titration of the protein with CacyBP-(178–229). A sample of15N-enriched calcyclin was titrated with unlabeled CacyBP-(178–229), and the chemical shift perturbations were monitored by acquiring 15N-1H HSQC spectra. An overlay of the initial and final points of the titration is shown in Fig.6. Addition of substoichiometric amounts of peptide led to broadening of selected resonances, indicative of a specific peptide-binding site on the protein. As the titration nears completion, the cross-peaks sharpen, and some reappear at different positions. The stoichiometry of the complex was determined to be 2 Eq of the peptide bound to the calcyclin homodimer. The observed changes in line shape and line width are typical of slow to intermediate exchange between the free and peptide-bound protein on the μs-ms time scale, which corresponds to a binding constant in the micromolar range. Thus, the results from NMR are fully consistent with parameters derived from the fluorescence experiments. In the present study we have identified the calcyclin binding domain of CacyBP and characterized its complex with calcyclin using various spectroscopic methods. Limited proteolysis of recombinant CacyBP expressed in E. coli produced a fragment that was approximately 1.5 kDa smaller than the wild type protein and whose affinity for calcyclin was lower than that of the whole protein. Since the N terminus was intact except for N-terminal methionine residue, we estimated that ∼15 residues were cleaved off the C terminus of the protein. These residues appear to form a portion of the calcyclin binding region. To test this hypothesis, a series of CacyBP deletion mutants were constructed and investigated for binding to calcyclin by affinity chromatography and ligand blotting. Although the Δ50C mutant (residues 1–179) and Δ200N (residues 201–229) failed to bind calcyclin, the Δ25C mutant (residues 1–204) did retain some binding potential for calcyclin. The Δ149N (residues 150–229) mutant bound calcyclin with apparent high affinity. We attempted to use the Δ149N mutant for more detailed analysis, but during purification we found it was impossible to cleanly remove the histidine and S-tags via the designed thrombin cleavage approach. Solubility problems, most likely caused by the presence of the highly charged tags, made the spectroscopic characterization of this mutant impossible. We then changed to a GST fusion strategy using the pGEX vector. Three fusion proteins of GST and CacyBP fragments were prepared encompassing residues 166–229, 178–229, and 178–206. The first two bound calcyclin, but the third failed to do so. These results indicated that the calcyclin binding domain was localized between residues 178 and 229. Since GST-CacyBP-(178–206) failed to bind calcyclin, we postulated that some or all of 23 C-terminal amino acid residues are required to obtain the full binding potential. We hypothesize that these residues are required to stabilize the actual calcyclin binding region, which is probably further upstream in the sequence. Interactions between S100 proteins and their targets have been characterized in detail for several systems, but their physiological relevance is still largely unknown. Among them are annexin XI binding to calcyclin (25Tokumitsu H. Mizutani A. Minami H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8919-8924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sudo T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4207-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and S100A11 interaction with annexin I (30Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F.

J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analysis of these interactions shows that S100 protein binding domains have high content of hydrophobic residues and have the potential to form amphipathic α-helices. CacyBP-(178–229) also contains high proportion of hydrophobic residues, and secondary structure prediction using PSIpred (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59892) Google Scholar) suggests that the fragment can have structure of amphipathic α-helix. CacyBP-(178–229) was the smallest fragment that retained calcyclin binding potential, and its interaction with calcyclin was characterized using spectroscopic methods. After the removal of GST from GST-CacyBP-(178–229) fusion protein, circular dichroism spectrum of the free fragment showed CacyBP-(178–229) to be largely unstructured. However binding to calcyclin appears to induce structure in the otherwise random coil fragment. Examples of such behavior have been noted for a wide variety of systems, including calmodulin target peptides (33Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 34Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2087-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The NMR data clearly show that the CacyBP-(178–229) binds to a specific site on calcyclin. We next compared the calcyclin dissociation constant of the whole CacyBP and CacyBP-(178–229) fragment. Calcyclin contains no tryptophan residues, and CacyBP and CacyBP-(178–229) contain 3 and 1 tryptophan residue, respectively, which enabled the binding constant to be measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission spectra of CacyBP and CacyBP-(178–229) revealed a decrease of tryptophan fluorescence intensity. For CacyBP-(178–229) a blue shift of the fluorescence peak was also observed. This suggests the tryptophan residue is transferred into a more hydrophobic environment upon binding to calcyclin. Fluorescence tritrations allowed us to determine the calcyclin dissociation constant for the whole CacyBP (0.96 μm) and for CacyBP-(178–229) (1.2 μm). The great similarity of these values and the agreement with the results from NMR analysis support the use of the fragment to further characterize calcyclin-CacyBP interactions. Efforts to elucidate the details of the key interactions in the binding site and understand how these contribute to the affinity and specificity are currently underway in our laboratories.

The NF-κB factors are normally sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment by physical association with inhibitors, including IκBα and related proteins (4.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In response to diverse stimuli, including cytokines, mitogens, and certain viral gene products, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded, which allows the liberated NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and participate in target gene transactivation (5.Mercurio F.

Although precisely how IKKs respond to the various stimuli remains unclear, recent studies have identified potential upstream kinases, such as the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (16.Nakano H.

NIK was originally identified as a protein interacting with the TRAF-2 component of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor complex (19.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). This MAP3K physically interacts with IKKα and IKKβ and stimulates the catalytic activity of these IKKs (10.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 11.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). NIK interacts with IKKs via its C-terminal region, and this interaction appears to be required for its function in NF-κB signaling (20.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in mammalian cells, NIK also form homodimers or oligomers (20.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these extensive investigations, it is currently unclear how the activity of NIK is regulated. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal noncatalytic region of NIK contains a negative-regulatory domain, which inhibits NIK function incis by interacting with the C-terminal IKK-binding domain of this MAP3K. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of NIK regulation. pCMV4–1HA is a modified form of the pCMV4 mammalian expression vector (21.Andersson S. Davis D. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It carries one copy of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) together with restriction sites for in-frame cloning of cDNA inserts. The expression vectors encoding wild type and truncated forms of NIK were generated by PCR amplification of a human NIK cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. David Wallach; Ref. 19.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), followed by subcloning the amplified DNA fragments into the pCMV4–1HA vector. The NIK truncation mutants are designated by the specific amino acid residues retained in the mutant protein. For example, NIK-(33–947) contains the region from amino acid 33 to amino acid 947. The internal deletion mutants of NIK were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the wild type NIK expression vector as template. The Myc-tagged NIK-(1–366) was obtained from Dr. Warner Greene (20.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant-active MEKK1 was provided by Dr. Michael Karin. The expression vectors for IKKα, IKKβ, and IκBα, and the κB-TATA-luc reporter plasmid were described previously (22.Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human 293 kidney carcinoma cells were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-treated 24-well plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected using DEAE-dextran (23.Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with 0.1 μg of HA-IκBα and other indicated expression vectors. After 40 h, whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (24.Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using anti-HA antibody. For immunoprecipitation studies, the cells were transfected in six-well plates and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture (Ref. 24.Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation in the radioimmune precipitation buffer as described previously (24.Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting. Jurkat T cells (1.25 × 106) were transfected using DEAE-dextran (23.Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with 50 ng of κB-TATA-luc together with the indicated cDNA expression vectors. After 40 h, the cells were lysed in 120 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, luciferase reporter system). Luciferase activity was detected by mixing 5 μl of cell extracts with 25 μl of luciferase substrate and then immediately measured with a single photon channel of a scintillation counter (Beckman). Transient transfection assays have demonstrated that NIK stimulates the catalytic activity of IKKα and IKKβ, leading to in vivo phosphorylation of IκBα (10.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar,11.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Since the phosphorylated IκBα migrates more slowly on SDS gels (25.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), it can be easily detected by immunoblotting assays. This in vivo assay approach was used to determine the functional domains of NIK. Briefly, wild type or mutant forms of NIK were coexpressed with IKKα or IKKβ in 293 cells together with the substrate protein IκBα. In the absence of NIK, neither IKKα (Fig.1 B, lane 2) nor IKKβ (lane 10) exhibited appreciable kinase activity, since the coexpressed IκBα was not phosphorylated. However, when the IKKs were expressed together with wild type NIK, IκBα was efficiently phosphorylated, as demonstrated by the appearance of the more slowly migrating IκBα band (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 11,IκBα-P). Deletion of 100 amino acids from the C terminus of NIK did not significantly inhibit its IKK activation function (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4and 12). However, further deletion of 52 amino acids or more from this end resulted in the abrogation of the signaling function of NIK (lanes 5–8 and 13–16). The failure of these NIK mutants to induce IκBα phosphorylation was not due to their inefficient expression or low stability since the steady expression level of these NIK mutants was similar to that of the wild type NIK (Fig. 1 C). The functional phenotypes of the NIK mutants were further assessed using the more quantitative reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig.1 D, expression of NIK in Jurkat T cells led to significant induction of the κB-directed luciferase reporter gene expression (column 2). Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal 100 amino acids of NIK led to a partial inhibition of NIK function (column 3). No NF-κB inducing activity was detected with the other NIK mutants lacking more C-terminal sequences (columns 4–7). Thus, the C-terminal non-catalytic region of NIK is essential for its signaling function. The N-terminal non-catalytic region of NIK contains 400 amino acids (19.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). To examine the role of this region in NIK function, N-terminal truncation mutants of NIK were subjected to functional assays (Fig. 2). In contrast to the C-terminal region, the majority of the N-terminal sequences appeared to be dispensable for NIK function (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of up to 348 amino acids did not block the function of NIK in activation of IKKβ (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–9) and IKKα (data not shown), as demonstrated by in vivophosphorylation of IκBα. Complete inactivation of NIK was observed only when 377 or more amino acids were deleted (lanes 10 and 11). Similar results were obtained with luciferase reporter gene assays (Fig. 2 D). More interestingly, we observed that several of the N-terminal NIK truncation mutants (152–947, 238–947, and 319–947) exhibited significantly higher activity in activation of IKKβ (Fig.2 B, lanes 6–8) and induction of κB (Fig. 2 D, columns 5–7) than the wild type form. This functional elevation was even more profound when lower amounts of expression vectors were used in the transfections (Fig.2 D, columns 12–15). Moreover, the differential activity of the NIK mutants was not due to the variation in their expression, since the more active forms of NIK were expressed at either equivalent or even lower levels compared with the wild type NIK (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of NIK functions as a negative-regulatory domain (NRD) and that the core sequences of this domain likely reside between amino acids 121 and 318. Sequence analyses of the negative-regulatory region of NIK revealed two interesting structural motifs (Fig.3 A). The first motif is similar to the basic region (BR) of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motifs present in various transcription factors, such as GCN4 and members of the Fos/Jun and CREB/ATF families (26.Lee K.A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 28.Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The bZIP motif is composed of a BR and a downstream leucine zipper. The NIK motif contains a perfect BR, although it lacks a leucine zipper (Fig. 3 B). The second structural domain observed in the negative-regulatory region of NIK is a proline-rich repeat (PRR) sequence located between amino acid 250 and amino acid 317 (Fig. 3 A). This domain is composed of a number of short repeats, which share a consensus sequence PXPXPX (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, repeats 4 and 5 share many other identical amino acid residues (Fig. 3 C, see sequence alignment). To determine the role of these motifs in regulation of NIK function, internal deletions were performed to selectively remove each of these structural sequences (Fig.4 A). Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that deletion of the BR led to a marked increase in the NF-κB-inducing function of NIK (Fig. 4 C, ΔBR). Furthermore, removal of the PRR motif or PRR together with the BR resulted in even more striking increase in the NF-κB inducing activity of NIK (ΔPRR and ΔBR/ΔPRR). Parallel immunoblotting assays showed that the expression levels of the NIK deletion mutants were either similar or even lower than that of the wild type NIK (Fig. 4 B). Thus, both the BR and the PRR motifs appear to play a negative-regulatory role in controlling the signaling function of NIK. We next examined whether expression of the N-terminal fragment of NIK is able to inhibit the NF-κB-inducing activity of this kinase in trans. For these studies, a NIK N-terminal fragment (NIK-(1–366)) containing the negative-regulatory motifs was coexpressed with various “super-active” NIK molecules lacking the N-terminal NRD (NIK-(152–947), NIK-(238–947), and NIK-(319–947)), together with the κB-TATA-luc reporter. In the absence of NIK-(1–366), all the super-active NIK proteins potently stimulated the κB-specific luciferase expression (Fig.5 A). Remarkably, expression of NIK-(1–366) led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the κB activation. The specificity of this inhibitory effect was demonstrated by the finding that NIK-(1–366) did not inhibit κB activation mediated by the dominant-active MEKK1 (Fig. 5 A,columns 15–17). To examine the role of the BR and PRR motifs in the negative regulation of NIK, N-terminal fragments of NIK lacking these motifs were subjected to thetrans-inhibition assays. When the BR and PRR motifs were deleted separately, the resulted N-terminal fragments of NIK (NIK-(1–366)ΔBR and NIK-(1–366)ΔPRR) partially lost their inhibitory effect on NIK function (Fig. 5 B,columns 2–7). Deletion of the PRR together with BR completely blocked the inhibitory action of the NIK NRD (Fig.5 B, columns 8–10). Immunoblotting assays revealed that the NIK-(1–366) also inhibited NIK-induced IκBα phosphorylation, and this inhibitory action required the BR and PRR motifs (Fig. 5 C). Together, these results strongly suggest that the signaling function of NIK is negatively regulated by its N-terminal structural motifs, including the BR and PRR. To investigate the mechanism by which the NRD inhibits NIK function, we examined whether the NRD of NIK interacts with other regions of this MAP3K. For these studies, NIK-(1–366) was expressed in 293 cells together with either the wild type NIK (NIKwt) or various NIK truncation mutants followed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. As expected from a previous study (20.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NIK-(1–366) physically associated with the NIKwt since these proteins were coprecipitated in the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6,upper panel, lane 2). The specificity of this molecular interaction was demonstrated by the lack of NIKwt precipitation in the absence of NIK-(1–366) (lane 1). More importantly, deletion of up to 650 amino acids from the N terminus of NIK did not affect its interaction with the NIK-(1–366) (lanes 3–5). On the other hand, removal of 100 or more amino acids from the C terminus of NIK completely abolished the association of this kinase with its N-terminal region (lanes 6 and 7). Parallel immunoblotting assays revealed that the different NIK mutants were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 6, lower panel). Thus, the N-terminal NRD specifically interacts with the C-terminal region of NIK. Since the C terminus of NIK is involved in binding to IKK (20.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the finding described above suggested the possibility that the N-terminal NRD of NIK may interfere with the NIK/IKK interaction. To examine this possibility, NIK-(152–947) was cotransfected with IKKα into 293 cells along with an increasing amount of the N-terminal fragment of NIK (NIK-(1–366)). In the absence of NIK-(1–366), NIK-(152–947) was readily coprecipitated with IKKα, suggesting an efficient interaction (Fig. 7, upper panel, lane 1). However, this molecular interaction was markedly inhibited by expression of NIK-(1–366) (lanes 2 and 3). This finding suggested that the N-terminal NRD indeed inhibits the binding of NIK to IKKα. Interestingly, the inhibitory action of the NRD was completely abolished, when the BR and PRR motifs were deleted from this N-terminal fragment of NIK (lanes 4 and5). Together, these findings suggest that the NRD of NIK interacts with the C terminus of NIK and interferes with the binding of NIK to IKK. Activation of NF-κB by various cellular stimuli is triggered by IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα. Recent studies suggest several potential IKK activating kinases, including NIK and MEKK1 (16.Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 17.Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Both MEKK1 and NIK belong to the MAP3K family, which share extensive sequence homology in their kinase domains. It is believed that MAP3Ks receive upstream signals and then phosphorylate and activate downstream kinases, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (29.Hardy K. Chaudhri G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 528-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain and a large N-terminal regulatory domain (30.Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Activation of this MAP3K is mediated through its phosphorylation by upstream kinases (31.Kaga S. Ragg S. Rogers K.A. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4182-4189PubMed Google Scholar) or by caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage involving the removal of its N-terminal regulatory domain (32.Cardone M.H. Salveson G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NIK is regulated has remained unknown. In the present study, we show that NIK also contains an NRD, although this region is shorter than the regulatory domain of MEKK1. The NIK NRD appears to function by interacting with the C-terminal region of this MAP3K. When expressed as an N-terminal fragment, the NRD forms a stable complex with the C-terminal fragment of NIK (Fig. 6). It is possible that this intramolecular interaction may induce conformational changes in NIK, which affects the function of its kinase domain. It is also likely that the N-terminal NRD interferes with the binding of NIK to its substrate IKK, since the IKK binding is mediated by the C terminus of NIK. Indeed, when overexpressed, the N-terminal fragment of NIK strongly inhibits the NIK/IKK interaction (Fig. 7). The NIK NRD contains two visible sequence motifs, BR and PRR, which contribute to the negative-regulatory function of this cis-acting domain. The BR shares remarkable sequence similarities with the basic region of the GCN-4 bZIP (see Fig. 3 B). Both the BR and PRR are important for the physical interaction of the NRD with the C terminus of NIK. Interestingly, we have observed that the C-terminal region of NIK undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, generating protein bands with different mobility (Fig. 6, lane 5, and data not shown). It remains to be examined whether the phosphorylated residues participate in binding with the basic residues in the BR located in the NRD. Although the precise mechanisms mediating the function of the BR and PRR motifs require further studies, the data presented in the current study demonstrate that NIK is regulated by acis-acting domain.

https://openalex.org/W2050401148,"The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) consists of an ∼350-amino acid-long N-terminal extracellular exodomain and a membrane-associated endodomain of similar size. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binds to the exodomain, and then hCG/exodomain complex is thought to make a secondary contact with the endodomain and generate hormone signals. The sequence alignment of the exodomain shows imperfectly matching eight to nine Leu-rich repeats (LRRs). In the preceding article (Song, Y., Ji, I., Beauchamp, J., Isaacs, N., and Ji, T. (2001) J.

In this work, we have examined the residues of LRR4, in particular Leu103 and Ile105 in the putative β strand. Our data show that Leu103 and Ile105 are involved in the specific, hydrophobic interaction of the LRR4 loop, likely to form the hydrophobic core. This loop is crucial for the structural integrity of all of the LRRs.

In the crystals of ribonuclease inhibitors, individual LRRs consist of a β strand connected to a parallel α helices despite divergent sequences. In each β strand, there are two conserved Leu and/or Ile residues in the alternate positions as Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile. Therefore, the primary homology among LRRs is the Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif in β strands. Furthermore, the β strands in ribonuclease inhibitors are involved in the interaction with ribonuclease. However, it has been unknown whether the putative LRRs of the LHR are active at all and what their nature and function are. In the preceding article (20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) we have shown that some, but not all, LRRs of the LHR and the FSH-R are crucial for hormone binding. In LHR, LRR2 and LRR4 are crucial. In this study, the residues around the Leu-Ser-Ile motif in LRR4 of LHR were examined. Our results suggest that the Leu and Ile are involved in the specific and tightly packed hydrophobic interaction in the core of LRR4 loop. In addition, our data implicate, for the first time, the involvement of LRR4 in the interaction of the hCG-exodomain complex with the endodomain. The evidence is presented in the following companion article (21Jeoung M. Phang T. Song Y. Ji I. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3443-3450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutant human LHR cDNAs were prepared, expressed in HEK 293 cells, and assayed for hormone binding and intracellular cAMP production as described previously (20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15970-15973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated four to six times. Means and standard variations were calculated. FLAG-LHR was prepared by inserting the FLAG epitope (23Prikett K. Amberg D. Hopp T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar), Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys, between the C terminus (Ser26) of the signal sequence and the N terminus (Arg27) of mature receptors. (20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate the Leu-Ser-Ile motif of LRR4 in LHR, we decided to examine the extended sequence encompassing the motif and the flanking residues, Arg99-Leu-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Ile-Cys-Asn-Thr-Gly-Ile-Arg-Lys112. These residues were individually substituted with Ala, and each of the Ala substitution mutants was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. They were assayed for 125I-hCG binding on intact cells or after solubilization in Triton X-100 and for hCG-dependent cAMP induction. As shown by the binding displacement data and Scatchard plots in Fig. 1, the cells transfected with the vector carrying the Arg99 → Ala mutant bound125I-hCG with a K d value of 1,410 pm as intact cells (Fig. 1, A and B) or 1,640 pm after solubilization (Fig. 1, C andD). These values were higher than the corresponding wild type values of 600 pm and 1,100 pm. In contrast, the cells that were transfected with the vector containing no receptor cDNA or were not transfected at all did not bind the hormone (data not included). These results indicate that the cells transfected with the Arg99 → Ala plasmid expressed the mutant receptor on the cell surface as well as in the cells and that the mutant was capable of binding hCG. In addition, the cells produced cAMP in response to hCG in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 230 pm and a maximum cAMP level of 72 fmol/1,000 cells. The EC50 value of cAMP induction, 230 pm, is 39% of the wild type value of 89 pm. Therefore, the higher K d value resulted in the higher EC50 value. However, the inverse was not observed. For example, a higher binding affinity does not necessarily correlates with lower EC50 for cAMP induction. Furthermore, maximum cAMP production does not consistently correlates with an EC50 value. Taken together, the affinities of hormone binding and cAMP induction of the Arg99 → Ala mutant are consistently less than one-half of the corresponding wild type affinities. Consequently, the lower affinity and efficacy to induce cAMP is likely due to the lower hormone binding affinity rather than to a defective intrinsic mechanism in cAMP induction. However, this correlation is limited, because the opposite is not true. In contrast to the hormone-responsive Arg99 → Ala mutant, the Leu100 → Ala did not show hCG binding to intact cells (Fig. 1). To test whether the Leu100 → Ala mutant was capable of binding hCG but trapped in cells, the cells transfected with the Leu100 → Ala mutant vector were solubilized in Triton X-100 and assayed for 125I-hCG binding (Fig. 1,C and D). Again, 125I-hCG binding was not observed. In addition, the cells did not respond to hCG to produce cAMP (Fig. 1 E). These results are generally considered as evidence for a receptor defective in hormone binding (18Bhowmick N. Huang J. Puett D. Isaacs N.W. Lapthorn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol.

To demonstrate their expression on the cell surface, the mutant receptor containing the FLAG tag and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was used. The antibody recognized the intact cells expressing the FLAG-Leu100 → Ala mutant (35 ± 9% of the wild type expression), indicating the surface expression of the FLAG-Leu100 → Ala mutant (20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Next, the Lys101 → Ala mutant was examined.125I-hCG bound to intact cells expressing the Lys101 → Ala mutant with a K d value of 1,640 pm and cells solubilized in Triton X-100 with aK d value of 1,860 pm (Fig. 1). cAMP was produced in response to hCG with an EC50 of 214 pm and a maximum cAMP level of 68 fmol/1,000 cells. These results are similar to those of the Arg99 → Ala mutant, indicating that the Arg99 → Ala and Lys101→ Ala mutants behaved the same and the Ala substitution for Arg99 and Lys101 had the similar effect. The effect of the Ala substitution for the next residue, Tyr102, was more severe, although it did not abolish the activity of the mutant (Fig. 1). For example, the K dvalues for binding to intact cells and solubilized cells were 4,610 and 7,800 pm, respectively, while the EC50 for cAMP production was 720 pm. These affinities of the mutant are only 12–14% of the wild type values, although the maximum cAMP level was 120 fmol/1,000 cells, which is nearly 80% of the wild type level (Table I).Table IPercent Kd, EC50, and maximum cAMP values of Ala substitution mutantsMutantHormone binding,K dwt/mutcAMP synthesisEC50wt/mutKdwt/mutMaxmut/wtKdwt/mutEC50wt/mutMaxmut/wtWild type1.001.001.001.001.00Arg99 → Ala0.440.390.470.881.07Leu100 → AlaNSNSNSLys101 → Ala0.380.420.441.101.16Tyr102 → Ala0.140.120.790.865.60Leu103 → AlaNSNSNSSer104 → Ala0.170.150.530.883.10Ile105 → AlaNSNSNSCys106 → Ala0.330.150.530.451.60Asn107 → Ala0.580.70.411.210.71Thr108 → Ala0.640.100.690.161.08Gly109 → Ala0.270.120.140.440.52Ile110 → Ala0.460.80.791.741.72Arg111 → Ala0.240.200.450.831.88Lys112 → Ala0.300.200.850.672.83K dwt/mut values for Ala substitution mutants in Fig. 1 were calculated by dividing the wild typeK d with the mutant K d values as were EC50 values. Maximum cAMP values were calculated by dividing maximum cAMP of each mutant with that of the wild type receptor.

Open table in a new tab K dwt/mut values for Ala substitution mutants in Fig. 1 were calculated by dividing the wild typeK d with the mutant K d values as were EC50 values. Maximum cAMP values were calculated by dividing maximum cAMP of each mutant with that of the wild type receptor. NS stands for “not significant.” In addition, ratios of (EC50wt/mut)/(K dwt/mut) and (maxmut/wt)/(K dwt/mut) are presented. The effects of the Ala substitution for the next three residues were similar to or more severe than the effect of the Tyr102 → Ala substitution. For example, the Ser104 → Ala mutant had K d values of 3,600 and 5,370 pm for hormone binding to intact cells and solubilized cells, respectively (Fig. 1, F–I). The EC50 value for cAMP induction was 599 pm (Fig.1 J). The affinities for hormone binding to intact cells and cAMP induction were, therefore, only 15–17% of the wild type affinities (Table I). Leu103 → Ala and Ile105→ Ala resulted in the complete loss of hormone binding both to intact cells and solubilized cells as well as hCG-dependent cAMP induction (Fig. 1, F–J). These two residues correspond to the conserved Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif in the β strands of LRRs. Ala substitutions for Cys106, Asn107, Thr108, Gly109, Ile110, Arg111, and Lys112 did not abolish hormone binding but attenuated the binding affinity (Fig. 1, F–O, and Table I). All of the mutant receptors were also capable of inducing cAMP synthesis. These results indicate that the conserved Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif, Leu103 and Ile105, is indeed more sensitive to Ala substitution than the flanking residues except Leu100. Interestingly, this was independent of the chemical and physical properties of the side chains of the flanking residues. Since these results are consistent with the LRR hypothesis, we investigated the nature of the Leu103 → Ala and Ile105 → Ala substitutions by replacing Leu103 and Ile105 with a panel of amino acids containing hydrophobic, hydrophilic, neutral, anionic, and cationic side chains. First, Leu103 was substituted with various hydrophobic amino acids. The substitutions of Val, Phe, and Ile increased the K d values up to 10-fold (Fig.2, A–D), thus reducing the affinity to 11–44% of the wild type (TableII), but did not abrogate hormone binding and cAMP induction (Fig. 2 E). It is notable that the Leu103 → Ile mutant was the one with the binding affinity of only 10% of the wild type. This suggests that Ile could not replace Leu103 without impacting the receptor function. When Leu103 was substituted with Trp, the bulkiest hydrophobic amino acid, the mutant did not show hormone binding to intact cells and solubilized receptors. Similarly, the mutant receptor with the substitution of hydrophilic Thr, neutral Asn, anionic Asp, or cationic Lys did not bind the hormone (Fig. 2, F–H). Since these substitutions introduced an amino acid with a different side chain, it is difficult to tell whether the substitution effects were due to the missing side chain of Leu or the newly introduced side chain. To test these possibilities, Leu103 was deleted, and the resulting Leu103 → deletion mutant did not bind the hormone (Fig. 2, F–H).Table IIKd, EC50, and maximum cAMP values of substitution mutants of Leu103 and Ile105MutantHormone binding,K dwt/mutcAMP synthesisEC50wt/mutMaxmut/wtWild type1.001.001.00Leu103 → Val0.440.220.76Leu103 → Phe0.170.320.69Leu103 → Ile0.110.170.53Ile105 → Phe0.560.100.37Ile105 → Val0.160.120.50Ile105 → Leu0.210.110.43Leu103 → Ile/Ile105→ Leu0.190.400.44K dwt/K dmut for Ala substitution mutants in Figs. 2 and 3 were calculated as described in Table I. Open table in a new tab K dwt/K dmut for Ala substitution mutants in Figs. 2 and 3 were calculated as described in Table I. Next, Ile105 was examined after substitutions. The substitutions of Phe, Val, and Leu were tolerable, as the resulting mutants were capable of hormone binding and inducing cAMP (Fig.3, A–E), although the affinities were reduced to 16–56% of the wild type affinity (TableII). This is similar to the Phe, Val, and Ile substitutions for Leu103. Interestingly, the Val substitution impacted the least for both Leu103, whereas the Phe substitution did the least for Ile105, suggesting the distinct environment of the two residues. On the other hand, the Trp substitution resulted in the complete loss of the activity for both of Ile105 and Ile103. The substitution for Ile105 with nonhydrophobic Thr, Asn, Asp, or Lys completely impaired the receptor activity as was the case with Leu103 (Fig. 3,F–H). To investigate the relationship between Leu103 and Ile105, a reciprocal mutant with Leu103 → Ile and Ile105 → Leu was generated. The resulting double mutant. Leu103 → Ile/Ile105 → Leu, poorly bound the hormone with aK d value of 3,340 pm on intact cells and with a K d value of 6,970 pm in solution (Fig. 4). These values indicate that the binding affinities are <20% of the corresponding wild type affinities, consistent with the view of the distinct environment of Leu103 and Ile105.Figure 4Reciprocal double substitutions for Leu103 and Ile105. Leu103 and Ile105 were substituted with a Ile and Leu, respectively, and the resulting mutant receptor was stably expressed on HEK 293 cells. Cells were assayed for 125I-hCG binding and hCG-dependent cAMP induction as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the double mutant receptor was expressed at all, the FLAG-Leu103 → Ile/Ile105 → Leu receptor was tested. 125I-Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody bound to the intact cells as well as solubilized cells that were transfected with the FLAG-Leu103 → Ile/Ile105 → Leu plasmid (data not included). In contrast, cells that were not transfected or transfected with the LHR with Leu103 → Ile/Ile105 → Leu plasmid did not bind the antibody. These results clearly indicate expression of FLAG-LHR with Leu103→ Ile/Ile105 → Leu on the cell surface and in cells, as well as expression of the Leu103 → Ile/Ile105→ Leu mutant lacking the FLAG epitope. When the Leu103→ Ile/Ile105 → Leu mutant was reverted to the wild type receptor, the revertant was capable of binding the hormone and inducing cAMP production. Therefore, the inability of the Leu103 → Ile/Ile105 → Leu mutant to bind the hormone and induce cAMP was due to the double substitutions, not due to unexpected random mutations during the mutagenesis and cloning. The results observed in this work show that the Ala substitutions for Leu103 and Ile105 abolished the hormone binding activity of the receptor, whereas the Ala substitution for Tyr102 and Ser104 severely impaired the receptor. In contrast to these four crucial and tandem residues, other residues among the sequence of the 14 amino acids, Arg99-Leu-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Ile-Cys-Asn-Thr-Gly-Ile-Arg-Lys112, in the putative LRR4 are marginally or less severely impacted by Ala substitution except Leu100. Therefore, the sequence of Tyr102-Leu103-Ser104-Ile105appears to be crucial for hormone binding and may constitute the core of the putative β strand of LRR4. This configuration would orient Leu103 and Ile105 at one side and Tyr102 and Ser104 at the other side of the β strand, suggesting a hydrophobic core comprising Leu103 and Ile105and a hydrophilic phase with Tyr102 and Ser104. The hydrophobic core may include Leu100, as it is equally sensitive to Ala substitution. In fact, the result of multiple substitutions for Leu103–Ile105 indicate such a hydrophobic core, since only hydrophobic residues larger than Ala, but less bulky than Trp, are tolerable at the positions of Leu103 and Ile105. Substitutions with hydrophilic, neutral, cationic, and anionic residues totally impaired the receptor activity. These results suggest that the hydrophobic core is compact and specific. It is interesting to note that the hormone binding affinity of the reciprocal double mutant, Leu103 → Ile/Ile105→ Leu was similar to the binding affinity of the single substitution mutant with Leu103 → Ile or Ile105 → Leu. These results indicate that Leu103 and Ile105in the putative LRR4 β strand could not be switched with each other, consistent with the compact and specific nature of the hydrophobic core. Furthermore, they suggest that the substitutions do not have a synergistic effect. A simple explanation in this particular case is that Leu103 or Ile105 may interact with each other as well as other residues. As a result, the interruption of either or both of them would have the similar effect. This hypothesis is consistent with the remarkably similar trends of substitutions for Leu103 and Ile105. For example, the substitutions of Val and Phe were tolerable to both Leu103and Ile105, whereas the substitutions of Ala, Trp, Thr, Asn, Asp, and Lys abolished the receptor activity. The Val substitution was most tolerable for Leu103 with a K dvalue of 1,410 pm, whereas the Phe substitution for Leu103 is less tolerable with a K d value of 3,730 pm. The trend was opposite for Ile105. The Phe substitution was most tolerable with a K dvalue of 1,110 pm, whereas the Val substitution is less tolerable with a K d value of 3,820 pm. The common and specific nature of their hydrophobic environment is consistent with our model (Fig. 5), showing the direct interaction of Leu103 with Ile105 and Leu100 in a hydrophobic pocket of LRR4. Our studies have been focused on the two primary targets, the interaction between the exodomain and hormone (initial high affinity binding) and the interaction between the hCG-exodomain complex and the endodomain (signal generation). It has been very difficult to find any clues for the contact site(s) of the exodomain for the endodomain. Our data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 as well as Table I are the first to implicate the involvement of LRR4 in contacting the endodomain, in particular, Gly109. The reason is as follows: most of Ala substitutions for LRR4 residues reduced the maximum cAMP induction up to 41% of the wild type value. The only exception is Gly109 → Ala substitution, which nearly abolished cAMP induction to 14% of the wild type value. This trend is more obvious when the (maximum cAMPmut/wt)/(K dwt/mut, where mut indicates mutant and wt indicates wild type) ratios are compared among the Ala mutants (Table I). The ratios are more than 1.00 for all except Gly109 → Ala and Asn107 → Ala. The ratios for the two mutants are 0.52 and 0.71, and such exceptionally low ratios are not found with any LRR2 Ala mutants (20Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment reveals the striking conservation of the amino acids from Leu97-Pro-Gly-Leu-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Ile-Cys-Asn-Thr-Gly109(Table III). Out of the 13 amino acids, 8 are absolutely identical among LHR, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor of all species. Interestingly, Asn107-Thr-Gly109 are uniquely in tandem and their maximum cAMPmut/wt)/(K dwt/mut) ratios are 0.71, 1.08, and 0.52, respectively. These residues are not essential for folding and surface expression, since the Ala mutants were successfully expressed on the cell surface and capable of binding the hormone. However, Ala substitution of them notably impaired cAMP induction as obvious by their significantly high EC50 for cAMP and/or low maximum cAMP level (TableI), suggesting an intriguing possibility of their interaction with the endodomain.Table IIIComparison of the LRR4 sequence 90 100 110LHR (human)PGAFINLPG LKYLSICNTG IRKFPDVTKVLHR (sheep)PG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** ***L*****ILHR (bovine)AG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** *H*L*****ILHR (pig)PG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** ***L*****ILHR (rat)PG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** **TL*****ILHR (mouse)PG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** **TL***S*ILHR (canfa)PG*FTN**R *KY*S*C*** *********IFSHR (human)PE*FQN**N *QY*L*S*** *KHL***H*IFSHR (bovine)PD*FQN**N *RY*L*S*** *KHL*A*H*IFSHR (sheep)PD*FQN**N *RY*L*S*** *KHL*A*H*IFSHR (horse)HD*FQN**N *QY*L*S*** *KHL*A*H*IFSHR (pig)PD*FQN**N *RY*L*S*** VKHL*A*H*IFSHR (rat)PE*FQN**S *RY*L*S*** *KHL*A*H*IFSHR (macfa)PE*FQN**N *RY*L*S*** *KHL*D*H*IFSHR (chick)QD*FQH**S *RY*L*S*** LSFL*V*H**TSHR (human)PD*LKE**L *KF*G*F*** LKM***L***TSHR (bovine)SG*LKE**L *KF*G*F*** L*V***L**ITSHR (sheep)SG*LKE**L *KF*G*F*** L*V***L**ITSHR (rat)PD*LTE**L *KF*G*F*** L*I***L**ITSHR (mouse)PD*LTE**L *KF*G*F*** L*I***L**ITSHR (canfa)PD*LKE**L *KF*G*F*** LGV*******The sequences encompassing the Leu-X-Ile in the β strand of LRR4 of glycoprotein hormone receptors were aligned.

Absolutely conserved residues are marked with “*”. In conclusion, the Leu103–Ile105 sequence is crucial for the specific interaction to form the hydrophobic core of LRR4. In addition, the downstream sequence consisting of Asn107, Thr108, and Gly109 is crucial for cAMP induction but not for hormone binding, folding, and surface expression. Therefore, they are likely involved in the interaction with the endodomain. This is the first evidence suggesting an endodomain contact point in the exodomain. Then, the inevitable question is whether LRR4 interacts with hCG at all. In the following article (21Jeoung M. Phang T. Song Y. Ji I. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3443-3450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) we show evidence that LRR4 does interact with hCG and, furthermore, is involved in the interaction of hCG-exodomain complex with the endodomain."
https://openalex.org/W2031195527,"A mutational analysis of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of c-Raf-1 identified three amino acid positions (Asn64, Ala85, and Val88) where amino acid substitution with basic residues increases the binding of RBD to recombinant v-Ha-Ras. The greatest increase in binding (6–9-fold) was observed with the A85K-RBD mutant. The elevated binding for the A85K-RBD and V88R-RBD mutants was also detected with Ras expressed in cultured mammalian cells, namely NIH-3T3 and BAF cells. None of the wild type residues in RBD positions Asn64, Ala85, and Val88 have been previously implicated in the interaction with Ras (Block, C., Janknecht, R., Herrmann, C., Nassar, N., and Wittinghofer, A.

Ras-binding domain wild type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) epidermal growth factor receptor glutathione S-transferase epidermal growth factor Ras is a small G protein that functions as a molecular switch for the transduction of signals generated by a variety of activated cell surface receptors. In resting cells Ras exists in its inactive GDP-bound form. Upon receptor activation, guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins catalyze the replacement of GDP by GTP (3Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M.

RBD expression in v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblasts leads to the suppression of the transformed phenotype (17Fridman M. Tikoo A. Varga M. Murphy A., -E- Kamal M.S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30105-30108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of RBD to reverse v-Ha-Ras-induced cell transformation makes the Ras·RBD interface a target for the development of Ras antagonists. The details of the RBD interaction with Ras revealed in part by a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the complex between the RBD and another Ras family member, Rap1A (2Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A computer model of the RBD·Ras complex has been generated on the basis of the Rap1A·RBD crystal complex (18Zeng J. Treutlein H.R. Simonson T. Proteins. 1999; 35: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several RBD residues that are in direct contact with Ras have been inferred from the crystal structure (2Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) as well as from a mutational analysis of the proposed binding surface of RBD (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1283-1290PubMed Google Scholar). RBD residues Gln66, Arg67, Lys84, Arg89, Arg59, Gln64, and Thr68 are in direct contact with Ras (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis of the RBD binding site showed that Gln66, Lys84, and Arg89 are the major contributors to the binding affinity between Ras and Raf (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Genetic studies on Drosophila melanogaster have also demonstrated that Arg89 is important to the interaction with Ras both in vivo and in vitro (20Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Even a highly conservative substitution of Arg89-RBD with lysine abolished the binding between v-Ha-Ras and RBD (21Zeng J. Fridman M. Maruta H. Treutlein H.R. Simonson T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Lys84is thought to be responsible for effector specificity, favoring the formation of the Ras·Raf complex in preference to the Rap1A·Raf complex (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Terada T. Ito Y. Shirouzu M. Tateno M. Hashimoto K. Kigawa T. Ebisuzaki T. Takio K. Shibata T.

Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Arg59 represents a point of A-Raf and c-Raf-1 isozyme discrimination; it is one of the residues that determine the higher affinity of binding for the c-Raf-1·v-Ha-Ras complex compared with the A-Raf·v-Ha-Ras complex (24Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Herrmann C. Schuler M. Rapp U.R. Block C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The measurement Ras activation is critical to the analysis of Ras function. If a significant change in the Ras·GDP:Ras·GTP ratio is detected between unstimulated and stimulated cells, it indicates that, at least in part, the signal from the ligand of interest is being mediated by Ras (25Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding domains from effector proteins of small GTPases have been used previously as activation-specific probes to discriminate between GTP- and GDP-bound forms of G-proteins, with differences in binding affinities of several orders of magnitude (26Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the minimal RBD of c-Raf-1 was used as an activation-specific probe for Ras (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The affinity of wild-type (wt) RBD for Ras·GDP is 100-fold lower than for Ras·GTP (29Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). GST·RBD fusion protein linked to Sepharose beads has been used to precipitate oncogenic Leu61-Ha-Ras, which is bound constitutively with GTP (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The dominant negative Asn17-Ha-Ras, which is in the constitutively GDP-bound form (30Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), does not associate with the RBD·GST fusion protein (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Recently, another activation-specific probe for Ras has been described, in the form of a Fab antibody fragment that exclusively binds Ras·GTP but not Ras·GDP (31Horn I.R. Wittinghofer A. de Bruine A.P. Hoogenboom H.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous mutational studies of RBD described a reduced or unaltered affinity for Ras (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Marshall M.

The present work has identified several RBD mutants with increased binding to Ras. These mutants provide new tools to analyze the Ras-Raf interaction and can be used as more sensitive probes than wt-RBD for GTP-bound Ras. The mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis (33Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Google Scholar), using c-Raf-1 cDNA (17Fridman M. Tikoo A. Varga M. Murphy A., -E- Kamal M.S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30105-30108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. Oligonucleotides were synthesized incorporating the desired mutations as well as EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′-end to facilitate subcloning into the pGEX-2TH vector linearized with EcoRI. Mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The procedure used for the expression and affinity purification of the glutathione S-transferase· RBD fusion proteins, using glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (Center for Protein and Enzyme Technology, LaTrobe University), was described by J. Frangioni and B. Neel (34Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Sepharose-linked GST·RBD fusion proteins were suspended in storage buffer (34Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) as a 1:1 suspension and then stored in 1-ml aliquots at −20 °C. v-Ha-Ras was expressed in NM522 cells (17Fridman M. Tikoo A. Varga M. Murphy A., -E- Kamal M.S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30105-30108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the pUC8 expression vector (35Stein R.B. Robinson P.S. Scolnick E.M. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (36Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). v-Ha-Ras was isolated using the procedure of Johnson and Hecht (37Johnson B.H. Hecht M.H. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The proteins released from bacterial cells were resolved on a 15 × 3 cm DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column with a 120-ml linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in buffer A (38Gibbs J.B. Sigal I.S. Poe M. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Fractions containing v-Ha-Ras (determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and stored at −20 °C. The concentrations of proteins linked to Sepharose beads (GST·RBD as well as RBD-bound Ras) were determined after scanning Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics 300 series computing densitometer) and measuring band densities relative to bovine serum albumin standards with ImageQuant 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). The concentration of purified Ras was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). [γ-32P]GTP or GTPγS labeling of v-Ha-Ras and its binding to GST·RBD fusion proteins were performed as described previously (17Fridman M. Tikoo A. Varga M. Murphy A., -E- Kamal M.S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30105-30108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled v-Ha-Ras was added to GST·RBD constructs linked to glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (Center for Protein and Enzyme Technology, LaTrobe University). Dilutions of the beads were carried out with 200-μl pipette tips that had been cut with a scalpel to allow unobstructed movement of the beads. Each sample contained 0.9 μmRBD·GST and 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP labeled v-Ha-Ras. The reactions were carried out in 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 m NaCl), on a rotating wheel, at room temperature for 15–30 min. The beads were washed four times in binding buffer by centrifugation. The radioactivity associated with the beads was measured using a Tri-CarbR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard United Technologies). The binding between v-Ha-Ras and the different RBD mutants was expressed as a percentage of the radioactivity associated with wt-RBD. Reaction mixtures contained 6.0 μmGST·RBD linked to Sepharose beads as well as 1.2 μmv-Ha-Ras·GTP or v-Ha-Ras·GDP in 200 μl of binding buffer. The reactions were shaken for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer, suspended in 100 μl of sample buffer, and heated (95 °C for 5 min). Aliquots (50 μl) of the supernatants were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. GTPγS-labeled v-Ha-Ras (2.3 μm) was incubated with 1.1 μmwt-RBD·GST or A85K-RBD·GST linked to glutathione-coated Sepharose beads. After a 75-min incubation period, the Sepharose beads were washed three times by centrifugation. Dissociation of the Ras·RBD complexes was commenced by adding 287 μm GTPγS. At given intervals, aliquots (60 μl) were taken from the dissociation mixture (500 μl starting volume) and washed four times by centrifugation. The radioactivity associated with the beads was determined using a Tri-CarbR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard United Technologies). BAF cells, which had been transfected with a human EGF receptor or a kinase negative EGF receptor mutant expression vector (39Walker F. Kato A. Gonez L.J. Hibbs M.L. Pouliot N. Levitzki A. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), were starved of serum and interleukin-3 for 5 h in minimal medium (RPMI). The cells (107cells/sample) were collected as a pellet after centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min, Sigma 4K15 centrifuge), transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and suspended in 1 ml of serum-free medium. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm/ml EGF (40Basu T. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar, 41Buday L. Downward J. Mol. Cell.

The cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were snap frozen on dry ice and stored at −70 °C overnight. The freezing step facilitated cell lysis. A modification of the method described by de Rooij and Bos (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) was used. Frozen NIH-3T3 cells, which had been transfected with v-Ha-Ras (17Fridman M. Tikoo A. Varga M. Murphy A., -E- Kamal M.S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30105-30108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or activated BAF/EGFR cells were lysed in 200 μl/sample of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Trasylol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble cellular debris were removed after centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was then added to tubes containing 1 ml of cold binding buffer and 100 μg of GST·RBD fusion protein linked to Sepharose beads. In positive control samples, total cellular Ras was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras Y13–259 antibody (American Type Culture Collection) prebound to protein-G-coated Sepharose beads (20 μl). All assay samples were incubated on a rotating wheel (4 °C, 30 min). The beads were then washed three times in binding buffer by centrifugation. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. Proteins resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). RBD-bound Ras was visualized using the Pan-ras (AB-2) antibody (Calbiochem), horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) antibody, the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Eastman Kodak Co. X-AR x-ray film. Ras signals were quantified by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics 300 Series computing densitometer) with ImageQuant 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics). The structure of the wild type Ras·RBD complex (18Zeng J. Treutlein H.R. Simonson T. Proteins. 1999; 35: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used to model the complexes between RBD mutants and Ras. The procedure involved two steps. First, Ala85 was replaced with Lys85, Val88 with Arg88, and Asn64 with Lys64. Second, the complexes were energy minimized with the CVFF force field, as implemented in DISCOVER (INSIGHTII, 1999). A 500-step conjugate gradient energy minimization was carried out to optimize position and orientation if side chains of the mutants with the rest of Raf and Ras protein fixed. The nonbonded (electrostatic and van der Waals) interactions were truncated at 10 and a distance-dependent dielectric constant (4r) was used to mimic solvent. A mutational scan of the c-Raf-1 RBD involved the measurement of in vitro v-Ha-Ras binding to the point mutants of RBD, which were expressed as GST fusion proteins and linked to Sepharose beads. The results of the scan are summarized in Fig.1. The substitution of alanine in RBD position 85 with arginine resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in binding to v-Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B). Ala85 is part of an α-helix in RBD (Fig. 2). Residues Arg84 and Arg89, which are adjacent to Ala85 within the helix (Fig. 4 A), are part of the Ras/Raf binding interface (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, Ala85 had not been previously implicated in the formation of the Ras·Raf complex.Figure 2Sequence alignment and secondary structure assignment for c-Raf-1 RBD (2Nassar N.

The mutant side chain is shown in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purity of GST·RBD fusion proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A). In some instances the mutations destabilized the structure of RBD making it more susceptible to degradation by Escherichia coliproteases. The degradation products are clearly visible in some of the mutant preparations and are most prominent in the R98V-RBD preparation. The degradation products were excluded from the estimates of GST·RBD concentrations, because the protein estimates were based on the densities of the discrete GST·RBD bands (see “Experimental Procedures”). The remaining RBD mutants in the binding scan showed reduced binding to v-Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B). Residues Arg59, Arg67, Lys84, and Arg89 are part of the binding interface between Raf and Ras (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In previous investigations, substitution of the basic residues in these positions with neutral amino acids similarly reduced the affinity of the RBD for Ras (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29927-29933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The substitution of arginine with leucine in position 89 abolished the interaction between Ras and Raf both in vivo and in vitro (see Fig. 1 B (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,20Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). The affinity of the K84A mutant was reduced by more than 100-fold (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the binding of R59A-RBD was 3.4% relative to wt-RBD, whereas the binding of R67A was 6.2%. In our hands, mutation of the known interactive RBD residues led to less dramatic reductions in binding than in previous studies (1Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1283-1290PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 B, the binding relative to wt-RBD was 8.6% for K84L-RBD, 43% for R59L-RBD, and 42% for R67L-RBD. The discrepancy in the binding ratios could arise from the differences in the particular neutral residues used. Leu has a longer hydrophobic side chain than Ala, which can alter the RBD-solvent interactions. Furthermore, in the present investigation, the assays were carried out at high protein concentrations, which should minimize the difference between high and low affinity constructs. Arginine substitutions at positions 91 and 98, which appear to be adjacent to the binding interface, lead to a dramatic loss of binding (Fig. 1 B). According to a computer simulation of the Ras·RBD complex (18Zeng J. Treutlein H.R. Simonson T. Proteins. 1999; 35: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), RBD Leu91-RBD forms hydrogen bonds with Arg41-Ras and Lys42-Ras. The L91R-RBD mutant disrupts this interaction. The side chain of Val98-RBD is located within the hydrophobic core of the RBD molecule (43Zeng J. Treutlein H.R. Simonson T. Proteins. 1998; 31: 186-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The V98R-RBD mutant is likely to abolish RBD/Ras binding as a consequence of distorted RBD folding. The Ala103–111cluster mutant, in which a 9-residue stretch of random coil was replaced with alanines, also displayed reduced binding to v-Ha-Ras. It must be noted that no steps were taken to monitor correct folding of the RBD mutants. Therefore, misfolding cannot be ruled out as the cause of reduced binding. An attempt was made to purify other arginine RBD mutants, V72R, C81R, L86R, L121R, and V128R, but the protein yields of these"

The rational design of better antineoplastic agents depends on understanding cellular mechanisms involved in cytotoxicity and/or cellular escape from cytotoxicity. One class of compounds, which has recently shown clinical promise, is structural analogues of the natural polyamines that are essential for cellular growth and differentiation (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 3Pegg A.E.

Two bis(ethyl) analogues of spermine, BE 3-4-3 and BE 3-3-31 have been shown to have cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in model systems for non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer (1Casero R.A.

Cancer Res. 1999; 55: 1638-1641Google Scholar). These analogues have been shown to down-regulate polyamine synthesis, deplete intracellular polyamine pools, inhibit cell growth, and activate programmed cell death pathways. Additionally, an apparent correlation has been demonstrated between the cytotoxic effects of BE 3-3-3 and BE 3-4-3 and their ability to induce the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine catabolism, SSAT (1Casero R.A.

A number of other structural polyamine analogues have also been developed, including some that are unsymmetrically alkylated and some bis(ethyl) analogues in which the numbers of carbon atoms in the internal part of the polyamine structure have been modified (13Basu H.S.

Unfortunately, however, rather than clarifying the mechanisms of action, these studies have demonstrated that it is difficult to delineate the specific mechanisms of action that are integral to the cytotoxic action of the structural polyamine analogues. For example, for two analogues that show significant cytotoxic activity, CHENSpm and BE 4-4-4-4, it has been demonstrated that both analogues are poor inducers of SSAT. In addition, CHENSpm treatment does not deplete natural polyamine pools, and BE 4-4-4-4 does not activate programmed cell death pathways in prostate cancer cells, which are activities that have been linked to the effective action of the bis(ethyl) polyamine analogues BE 3-4-3 and BE 3-3-3 (18McCloskey D.E. Woster P.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 17-23PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One approach to understanding cellular mechanisms of cytotoxicity is to develop a model cell system that is resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent of interest and to utilize that system to determine the changes that are responsible for cellular escape from cytotoxicity. The current studies were carried out using this approach to develop a model system of resistance to the bis(ethyl)polyamine analogues. We have used the analogue BE 3-4-3 to select a resistant derivative of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line C55.7 (22Pilz R.B. Steglich C. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was chosen to help ensure that mutants displaying transport alterations would not be selected. C55.7 cells lack ODC activity because of a point mutation in the ODC gene, which results in production of an inactive mutant ODC protein. Therefore, C55.7 cells are unable to synthesize the polyamine putrescine and must rely on salvage of putrescine from the external environment. This auxotrophy for putrescine requires that the polyamine transport system (23Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C545-C553Crossref Google Scholar, 24Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell.

Physiol. 1993; 155: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) of these cells be functional in order for the cells to survive. Because the structural polyamine analogues of interest also enter the cell through the specific polyamine transport system (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), use of the C55.7 cell line should favor selection of resistant mutants that do not have alterations in polyamine transport but rather exhibit mechanisms of resistance related to intracellular mechanisms of cytotoxicity. Following the selection, the cell line was characterized with respect to mechanisms of the observed resistance. These studies have demonstrated that altered SSAT regulation is a cause of the resistance and have provided definitive evidence that SSAT activity is a requisite part of the cytotoxic action of the tested bis(ethyl)polyamine analogues.

Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and were passaged every 5–7 days to maintain exponential growth. For all experiments, concentrated solutions of BE 3-3-3 and BE 3-4-3 (10 mm and 1 mm, respectively, in water, stored at −20 °C) were diluted with medium to the desired concentrations. Exponentially growing cells were plated in triplicate at 2 × 103 cells/cm2in 100 μl of medium/well in 96-well plates. After a 12- to 18-h period for the cells to attach, 200-μl medium containing 1.5× the desired final drug concentration was added. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of at least six drug concentrations for 144 h, at which time, the medium was aspirated and 100 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT in Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. The cells were incubated an additional 4–6 h at 37 °C, after which 100 μl of 50% EtoH in Me2SO was added to each well. After 20 min, theA 570 (a value directly proportional to the number of viable cells (26Mosmann T. J. Immunol.

IC50 values were determined from plots of percentage of untreated control cell number versus the logarithm of the drug concentration. The transfection of pCMV-SSAT into C55.7 and C55.7Res cells was accomplished using LipofectAMINE, as described previously (27McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

Exponentially growing cells were plated in triplicate at 2–4 × 104cells/cm2. Following attachment, the medium was changed and cells were incubated for the desired time. SSAT activity was determined in cell extracts by an assay that measures the incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA into [1-14C]acetylspermidine in 10 min at 30 °C as described previously (28Matsui I. Wiegand L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2454-2459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm spermidine, and 12.7 μm (63 mCi/mmol) [1-14C]acetyl-CoA in a total volume of 100 μl. Cells were plated as described for SSAT activity determination and then harvested and extracted with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots were assayed for polyamine content using ion-paired, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and post-derivatization witho-phthalaldehyde as described previously (29Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins present in cell extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 15% gel. Electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Waterborough, MA) was followed by hybridization with a polyclonal anti-SSAT antibody (prepared as described previously (30Casero Jr., R.A. Gabrielson E.W. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3955-3958PubMed Google Scholar)) and detection using the Vistra Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Molecular Dynamics FluorImager model 595 and ImageQuaNT application software were used for visualization and quantitation. Total cellular RNA was prepared using the Totally RNA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Northern analysis was carried out using a Hybond N+ membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ethidium bromide staining was used as a loading control. A fluorescein-labeled full-length SSAT probe, to which membranes were hybridized, was prepared by transcription from the T3 promoter of the pSAT9.3 plasmid containing the SSAT cDNA in the Bluescript vector (31Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Vistra signal amplification kit was used for signal detection, and visualization and quantitation were the same as for the Western analysis. Reverse transcription of total cellular RNA from C55.7 and C55.7Res cells was carried out using SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR to enrich for SSAT cDNA was accomplished according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) with sense primer 5′-GGGAAGAAAAGCAAAAGACG and antisense primer 5′-AATGGAGGTTGTCATCTACAGC. Triplicate RT and PCR reactions were carried out for each cell line followed by sequencing of the products by the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Macromolecular Core Facility. The polyamine analogue BE 3-4-3 was used to select a resistant derivative of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line C55.7 (22Pilz R.B. Steglich C. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method used for selection was a defined period of exposure to the drug (96–144 h) followed by a recovery period in drug-free medium until the cells regained exponential growth (32Pizzorno G. Mini E. Coronello M. McGuire J.J. Moroson B.A. Cashmore A.R. Dreyer R.N. Lin J.T. Mazzei T. Periti P. Bertino J.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2149-2155PubMed Google Scholar). As the population of resistant cells increases, the recovery period becomes shorter (32Pizzorno G. Mini E. Coronello M. McGuire J.J. Moroson B.A. Cashmore A.R. Dreyer R.N. Lin J.T. Mazzei T. Periti P. Bertino J.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2149-2155PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of a BE 3-4-3-resistant derivative of the C55.7 cell line was accomplished through four cycles of drug treatment and recovery as shown in Table I. The short recovery period following the fourth treatment suggested that this cell population was resistant to BE 3-4-3. To confirm resistance to the similar polyamine analogue BE 3-3-3, the cells were exposed to 100 μm BE 3-3-3 for an additional 120-h period during which their growth was observed to be only slightly slower than that of the untreated parental C55.7 cells. The resistant cell line was then designated C55.7Res and was routinely maintained in drug-free medium.Table IScheme of drug treatment and recovery periods used to select a BE 3-4-3-resistant cell lineCycle no.[BE 3-4-3]Exposure timeTime for recoveryμmhdays110962021014423310012022410120<5 Open table in a new tab The level of resistance was assessed using 144-h growth inhibition assays. The IC50 values for BE 3-3-3 were determined to be 7 and 70 μm, respectively, for the C55.7 and C55.7Res cell lines, indicating 10-fold resistance of the C55.7Res cell line to the polyamine analogue. Another indication of the resistance of the C55.7Res cell line is that these cells can be continuously passaged in 100 μm BE 3-3-3 while ≤10% of the parental C55.7 cells survive 96-h exposure to 10 μm BE 3-3-3. To determine whether the observed resistance phenotype was a stable trait, the C55.7Res cells were maintained in drug-free medium and the IC50 values relative to the parental C55.7 cells were monitored over time. The average IC50 values of 6.2 ± 1.3 μm for C55.7 (n = 8) and 63.0 ± 18 μm C55.7Res cells (n = 8), determined over a 9-month period and 40 cell passages in the absence of selective pressure, indicated that the 10-fold resistance of the C55.7Res cells to BE 3-3-3 was stable and was the result of a heritable genotypic change in the C55.7Res cell line. To verify that the C55.7Res resistance to bis(ethyl)polyamine analogues did not result from an altered ability of the cells to transport the analogue, the intracellular level of BE 3-3-3 was measured for C55.7 and C55.7Res cells following 15- and 30-min exposure to 10 μm BE 3-3-3. The results (Fig. 1) indicated that the uptake of BE 3-3-3 by C55.7Res cells did not differ significantly from that of the parental C55.7 cells over the 30-min period. Additionally, the reduced uptake of the analogue in the presence of exogenous putrescine confirmed that the analogue was competing with putrescine for uptake by the polyamine transport system. As an initial investigation of possible mechanisms of resistance, the C55.7Res cells were assessed for cross-resistance to MGBG, adriamycin, and cisplatin. MGBG targets the polyamine synthetic pathways through inhibition ofS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (33Seppänen P. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Jänne J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 18: 571-576Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Seppänen P. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Jänne J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 674: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), adriamycin is a classic indicator of multi-drug resistance through ap-glycoprotein efflux pump (35Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and a cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line has been shown to be cross-resistant to BE 3-4-3 (36Marverti G. Piccinini G. Ghiaroni S. Barbieri D. Quaglino D. Moruzzi M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If the pathways or enzymes that are targets of these agents were altered in the C55.7Res cells and thus responsible for the resistance, it would be expected that the C55.7Res cells would also exhibit cross-resistance to these agents. However, the C55.7Res cells were as sensitive to these drugs as the parental C55.7cells (TableII), suggesting that neither multi-drug resistance nor the targets of the polyamine analogue MGBG are factors contributing to the bis(ethyl)polyamine analogue resistance of the C55.7Res cells and that there is no obligatory link between resistance to cisplatin and resistance to these analogues.Table IISensitivity of C55.7 and C55.7Res cells to MGBG, adriamycin, and cisplatinDrugIC50 valueC55.7C55.7ResmMGBG1.4 × 10−51.9 × 10−5Adriamycin1.1 × 10−71.1 × 10−7Cisplatin4.0 × 10−74.0 × 10−7IC50 values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values reported are averages from duplicate experiments. Open table in a new tab IC50 values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values reported are averages from duplicate experiments. SSAT is the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine catabolism, and its activity is known to be induced in many cell systems by polyamine analogues (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 10Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 11Davidson N.E. Mank A.R. Prestigiacomo L.J. Bergeron R.J. Casero R.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2071-2075PubMed Google Scholar, 12Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, because the observed resistance could result from changes in polyamine catabolism, the activity of SSAT was assessed in C55.7 and C55.7Res cells. The results (Fig. 2) indicated that SSAT activity was low, but measurable, in untreated parental C55.7 cells at both time points. However, the SSAT activity of the untreated C55.7Res cells was at or below the limit of detection of the activity assay, indicating that it was reduced in comparison to the C55.7 cells. Exposure to BE 3-3-3 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of SSAT activity in the C55.7 cells, with induction ranging from 3-fold in response to 1 μm BE 3-3-3 to ∼300-fold resulting from 25 μm BE 3-3-3. In contrast, SSAT activity of the C55.7Res cells exposed to BE 3-3-3, for all conditions tested, remained at or below the limit of detection of the assay with no detectable induction of SSAT activity resulting even after 48-h exposure to 25 μm BE 3-3-3. This difference between the C55.7Res cell line and the parental cells in response to BE 3-3-3 suggested that the reduced SSAT activity and altered SSAT regulation of the C55.7Res cells was contributing to the observed resistance to polyamine analogues. The intracellular polyamine pools were assessed, following exposure to 10 or 100 μm BE 3-3-3 for up to 48 h, to examine the effects of the altered SSAT regulation in the C55.7Res cells. The polyamine profile of the parental C55.7 cells (TableIII) was consistent with a normal cellular response to BE 3-3-3 in that the spermidine and spermine concentrations decreased and the putrescine concentration increased as a consequence of SSAT induction, whereas BE 3-3-3 accumulated. The response was concentration-dependent as exposure to the higher BE 3-3-3 concentration resulted in a greater decrease in spermidine and spermine (∼90% depletion by 48 h) as well as a larger intracellular accumulation of the analogue. In the C55.7Res cells, the spermidine and spermine concentrations decreased to a lesser extent than in the C55.7 cells and the putrescine concentration decreased rather than increasing. The effects in the C55.7Res cells were also concentration-dependent, as lower spermidine and spermine concentrations and greater analogue accumulation resulted from exposure to 100 μm BE 3-3-3. However, the maximum decreases in the spermidine and spermine concentrations of the C55.7Res cells (59% and 65%, respectively) were still significantly less than those of the parental cells. N 1-Acetylspermidine and N 8-acetylspermidine, products that can accumulate as a result of active polyamine catabolism, were detected only in the C55.7 cells. Intracellular BE 3-3-3 concentrations of 12.8 ± 1.3 and 21.1 ± 5.2 nmol/mg of protein for C55.7 and 5.2 ± 0.4 and 12.8 ± 1.0 for C55.7Res after 24-h exposure to 10 and 100 μm BE 3-3-3, respectively, indicated that the analogue accumulated to significant levels in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell lines. The lack of depletion of the natural polyamine pools of the C55.7Res cells in response to the polyamine analogue, which was consistent with the reduced cytotoxicity and the inability of the analogue to induce SSAT in these cells, also suggested that the altered SSAT regulation was related to the resistance phenotype of the C55.7Res cells.Table IIIIntracellular polyamine content of C55.7 and C55.7Res cellsCell lineTreatmentIntracellular polyaminesBE 3-3-3PutrescineSpermidineSpermineN 1-AcetylspermidineN 8-Acetylspermidinenmol/mg of protein0 h3-aTime 0 was 12–16 h after cells were plated.

Table IV shows the SSAT activities of the selected clones in the absence and presence of 10 μm BE 3-3-3. The sensitivity of the clones transfected with pCMV-SSAT to BE 3-3-3 was assessed by determination of IC50 values, and the results are shown in Fig.3.

Mutagenesis studies were carried out to map residues important in the copper inhibition of Mac1 activity. Seven new missense mutations were identified that resulted in copper-independent Mac1 transcriptional activation. All seven mutations were clustered in one of two C-terminal cysteine-rich motifs, designated the C1 motif. All but one of the constitutive Mac1 mutations occurred in one of the conserved six residues in the264CXC(X)4CXC(X)2C(X)2H279C1 motif. The lone exception was a L260S substitution. Two additionalMAC1 mutations exhibiting constitutive activity were in-frame deletions encompassing portions C1. Engineered mutations in the second cysteine-rich motif did not yield a constitutively active Mac1. These results are consistent with the C1 motif being the copper-regulatory switch. Both cysteine-rich motifs exhibited transactivation activity, although the C1 activator was weak relative to the C2 activator. Limited copper metalloregulation of Mac1 was observed with only the C1 activator fused to the N-terminal DNA binding domain. Thus, the two Cys-rich motifs appear to function independently.

Nutritional deprivation of copper, iron, and zinc ions inSaccharomyces cerevisiae results in up-regulation of specific high affinity transporters arising from the activation of specific transcription factors (1Dancis A. J. Pediatr. 1998; 12: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Nutritional deprivation of copper ions in yeast leads initially to the activation of the Mac1 transcription factor and subsequent stimulated transcription of three genes encoding proteins involved in high affinity copper ion uptake (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, Mac1 lacks transcriptional activation activity in copper-replete cells (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mac1 is critical for expression of the high affinity copper uptake system; therefore, cells lacking Mac1 exhibit phenotypes consistent with a copper-deficient state. Copper ions are necessary in yeast for formation of active cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and the Fet3 ferro-oxidase. The high affinity uptake system in yeast consists of two copper ion permeases, Ctr1 and Ctr3, and a metalloreductase Fre1 capable of cupric ion reduction (6Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fourth gene activated by Mac1 is the Fre1 homolog, Fre7, the function of which remains unknown (7Martins L. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. Keller G. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Reduction of extracellular cupric and ferric ions is an important step in high affinity copper and iron uptake in yeast. An important facet of copper homeostasis in yeast is the ability to restrict entry of copper ions when cells are copper-replete. This is illustrated by the redundant cellular mechanisms to block copper ion uptake and buffer cellular copper levels. The initial event is the specific inhibition of DNA binding and transactivation functions of Mac1 that occurs in cells cultured in medium containing nm Cu(II) (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Georgatsou E. Mavrogiananis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In response to elevated cellular copper, the Mac1 protein is degraded, ensuring that expression of the high affinity uptake system is shut down (10Zhu Z. Labbe S. Pena M.M.O. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, pre-existing copper transporters are internalized and degraded (11Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A further, protective response occurs in cells cultured in medium containing μmCu(II) salts. Copper ions activate the nuclear transcription factor Ace1 which induces transcription of three distinct genes, products of which bind copper ions, protecting the cell from deleterious effects of elevated copper levels (12Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The copper-dependent inhibition of Mac1 function appears to arise from direct interaction of Cu(I) with Mac1 (13Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mac1 contains two C-terminal cysteine rich sequences with a repeating motif of CXC(X)4CXC(X)2C(X)2H (14Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These two Cys-rich sequences, designated C1 and C2, bind a total of 8 Cu(I) ions (13Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Mac1 ortholog, Grisea from Podospora angerina, contains two related C-terminal Cys-rich motifs that are important for metalloregulation (15Borghouts C. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Also, theSchizosaccharomyces pombe Mac1 ortholog, Cuf1, has a single Cys-rich motif homologous to the Mac1 motif above (16Labbe S. Pena M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Cys-rich motifs occur in the segment of Mac1 responsible for transactivation (9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The transactivation function of Mac1 is copper-modulated (9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Inhibition of transactivation is seen in chimeric molecules containing Mac1 fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (8Georgatsou E. Mavrogiananis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA binding function of Mac1 is inhibited in copper-replete cells (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity of Mac1 maps to the N-terminal 159 residues, but copper repression of DNA binding requires the C-terminal Cys-rich motifs (17Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, full copper repression of transactivation activity is dependent on a portion of the DNA binding domain. Thus, Cu(I) binding in the C-terminal domains inhibits functions of both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the protein. The copper repression of Mac1 function appears to arise from a copper-induced, intramolecular interaction of the C-terminal Cys-rich motifs and the N-terminal DNA binding domain (13Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mac1 was originally identified as a semidominant mutation, designatedMAC1 up1, that abrogated copper inactivation of Mac1 function (14Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This mutation results in constitutive expression ofCTR1 and FRE1 (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol.

Copper ion uptake is markedly enhanced in MAC1 up1 cells, and one resulting phenotype is hypersensitivity to elevated copper levels in the growth medium (18Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

All four constitutive mutations map to the first cysteine-rich motif, designated C1 (Fig. 1). The constitutive mutations result in substitutions of three of the six conserved residues in the consensus,264 C XC(X)4 C XC(X)2C(X)2 H 279. The residues in bold are substituted to yield the four known constitutive mutants designated Mac1up1(H279Q), Mac1up2 (C271Y), Mac1up3(C264Y), and Mac1up4 (H279Y) (5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D.

The copper-induced inhibitory, intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal DNA binding domain and the C-terminal Cys-rich motifs is expected to involve residues in both domains. Since mutations in the C1 motif abolish the inhibitory interaction, we sought to map the interactive region in the N-terminal DNA binding domain of Mac1 by isolating additional constitutive Mac1 mutants. The question was whether any mutations within the DNA binding domain would abolish the repressive intramolecular interaction, without perturbing DNA binding activity. The second motive for the present work was to determine whether the repeated Cys-rich sequence motifs function separately or as a single domain in mediating copper metalloregulation of Mac1. Conceivably, the binding of 8 Cu(I) ions in a polypeptide containing both C1 and C2 sequences may occur due to 4 Cu(I) ions binding in each motif. Alternatively, the two Cys-rich motifs may come together creating a single octa-copper center. The clustering of constitutive mutations in the C1 motif is consistent with C1 being an independent copper regulatory domain. The presence of two Cys-rich motifs in Mac1 and Grisea leaves open the possibility that both motifs function in copper metalloregulation. We show in the current work that the C1 motif is indeed an independent copper regulatory domain. The yeast strains used, CM66J (MATα, ino1-13, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3::LEU2) and CM66E (MATa, trp1-63, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3:: LEU2), were derived from strains 66 (MATα, trp1-63, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3::LEU2) and CM3262 (MATa, ino1-13, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, ino1-13). Strains 66 and CM3262 were generously provided by Andrew Dancis (19Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CM66Δmac1 was constructed by integratingURA3 at the MAC1 locus in strain CM66E by one-step gene replacement as described (20Baker Brachmann C. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The disruption was verified by diagnostic PCR1and sequencing. CM66Δmac1 was then crossed with YJJ1 (MATα, his3-Δ200, leu2-3, 112, lys2-801, trp1-1, ura3-52, mac1-1) (14Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), sporulated, and dissected. A resulting spore that was ura3, and thusmac1-1, was selected and designated CMΔmac1. Two-hybrid experiments were conducted in strain Y190 (MATa, ade2-101, cyh2, his3, leu2-3, 112, trp1-901, ura3-52, gal4, gal80, LYS2:pGAL-HIS3, URA3:pGAL-lacZ) (21Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One-hybrid experiments were carried out in strain DY2042 (MATa, ade2-101, his3, leu2-3, trp1, ura3-52, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, MEL1, GAL1, GAL1-10:lacZ). Yeast strains were cultured in YPD, complete medium (SC), or low copper complete medium (LCCM) using copper and iron-limiting yeast nitrogen base (Bio 101, Inc.), and lacking the appropriate amino acids to ensure maintenance of plasmid and reporters. Strain CM66J was grown overnight in LCCM lacking leucine and plated to a density of 108 cells/plate on 40 LCCM plates, lacking leucine and histidine. Mutants were isolated following UV irradiation. Plates were exposed to 50 J/m2 UV light, corresponding to approximately 50% survival rate, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 3 days while wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. The resulting colonies were plated onto LCCM lacking leucine and histidine but containing 30 μm Cu(II). Mutants were confirmed by re-plating on the same medium and screened for copper sensitivity on SC medium containing 1.75 mmCuSO4. In addition, CTR1 expression was assessed by S1 nuclease assay. The affected mutant allele was determined to be a single nuclear, recessive gene by crossing candidate mutants with the isogenic wild-type strain, CM66E. The resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected, and mutant status was assessed by growth on LCCM lacking histidine and containing 30 μm Cu(II). A 1.7-kilobase pair Sau3A genomic fragment containing MAC1 was subcloned from pYACu1 (generously provided by D. Hamer) into pBluescript (Stratagene) at theBamHI site, generating pBSMAC1. pBSMAC1 was then subjected to XL1-Red mutagenesis according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The resulting plasmids were rescued from XL1-RedEscherichia coli, inserts cleaved byXbaI/BamHI digest, cloned into pRS316 (22Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and transformed into E. coli DH5α. The resulting library of mutagenized MAC1 was transformed into CMΔmac1. Transformants were replica-plated onto LCCM containing 30 μm Cu(II), lacking histidine and uracil and medium containing 1.75 mm CuSO4. Positive growth on the former and negative growth on the later was indicative of a plasmid-borne MAC1 up allele and was verified by loss of histidine prototrophy following shedding of plasmid by growth on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The ability of each mutagenized plasmid to confer elevated CTR1 transcript levels was determined by S1 nuclease assay. Each plasmid conferring aMAC1 up phenotype was rescued to E. coli DH5α and sequenced. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 377 Sequencer using Taq FS DNA polymerase. The 1.7-kilobase pairXbaI/BamHI MAC1 fragment from pBSMAC1 was subcloned into pAlter (Promega). Mutagenesis was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were verified by sequencing and subsequently cloned into either pRS316 or pRS426. Phenotypes were determined by transforming into CMΔmac1. MAC1 and MAC1 up1truncates encoding codons 1–311 were generated by PCR amplification using PstI and SalI cleavage sites for subcloning into vector pVT102U. pVT102U is a YEp-based vector containing theADH1 promoter and terminator (23Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The HA epitope tag encoding the sequence YPYDVPDYA was inserted at the 3′ end of codon 311 of MAC1. GAL4/MAC1 fusions, engineered previously (9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), were excised as HindIII/SalI fragments and inserted into pRS425, a YEp based vector containing the MET25promoter and CYC1 terminator (24Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). GAL4/MAC1constructs were transformed into DY2042 that contains theGAL1–10/lacZ fusion reporter gene. The two hybridMAC1 vectors were described previously (13Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DNA sequences coding for residues 240–417 of Mac1 and containing the double Cys → Ser substitutions (residues 264, 266; 271, 273; 322, 324; and 329, 331) previously engineered (9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the vector pVT-VP16 at BamHI/ClaI sites, generating vectors fused to the minimal activation domain from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (25Sadowski I. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Sequences encoding residues 1–159 were subcloned into pBG4D-1 creating vector Mac1-(1–159)-pBG4D-1. Two-hybrid vectors were co-transformed into strain Y190. Total RNA isolated from mid-logarithmic cells by the hot acid phenol method was hybridized with a 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide and digested with S1 nuclease. The samples were electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide, 5 m urea gel, and data were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. S1 probes used included 60 nucleotides of the 5′ CTR1 ORF, 40 nucleotides of the calmodulin (CDM1) 5′ ORF, and 60 nucleotides from the lacZ ORF. Cellular lysates for immunoprecipitation analysis were prepared by glass beading in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and a protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant was incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody or a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gal4 DBD antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was collected by centrifugation, washed six times, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked and probed with either mouse monoclonal anti-HA or mouse monoclonal anti-Gal4 DBD. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cellular lysates for VP16 Western analysis were prepared by glass beading in 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12% (v/v) glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant was collected and treated with SDS. Thirty micrograms of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-VP16 antibody. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. FRE1 is one of the four known Mac1-regulated genes in S. cerevisiae (14Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Mac1 activates FRE1 expression in copper-deficient cells. Cells harboring aMAC1 up1 allele show elevated FRE1expression even in copper-replete conditions (14Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition,FRE1 expression is also enhanced in iron-deficient cells due to the iron-regulated Aft1 transcriptional activator (19Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The dual regulation of FRE1 by the copper and iron status of cells enabled a genetic screen utilizing a FRE1/HIS3 fusion gene to identify a variety of genes whose products were involved in copper and iron uptake (26Dancis A.

Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). This elegant screen also identified Aft1 as the primary iron regulator in S. cerevisiae and uncovered a second Mac1 constitutive mutant designatedMAC1 up2 (5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The successful use of the FRE1/HIS3 fusion gene to identify a Mac1 mutant that was not repressed in copper-replete cells validated its use in mapping other constitutive MAC1 alleles. The starting strain (CM66J) exhibited histidine (His) prototrophy only when cultured in low copper medium containing a Cu(I)-specific chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate. The cells were His-auxotrophic when cultured in medium containing 10 μm Cu(II). Following ultraviolet-induced mutagenesis, mutants exhibiting His prototrophy were selected on medium containing 30 μm Cu(II). Subsequently, His+ colonies were screened for growth sensitivity to 1.75 mm CuSO4. Wild-type cells were resistant to elevated copper levels, whereas cells containing a constitutively active mutant Mac1 failed to grow due to unrestricted uptake of copper ions. Colonies conforming to both selection criteria, growth on −His+Cu medium and copper sensitivity (Cus), were analyzed for constitutive expression of chromosomalCTR1 by quantifying CTR1 mRNA levels. Eight mutants exhibited high, constitutive CTR1 expression. The eight mutants were determined to carry a single nuclear, recessive mutation by crossing with the isogenic wild-type strain followed by tetrad analysis. Diploids of the mutants crossed with CMΔmac1 showed His prototrophy in medium containing 30 μm CuSO4. These experiments suggested that the mutations were in MAC1. The MAC1 locus was PCR-amplified and sequenced in multiple reactions. All eight clones showed mutations in the C1 region of MAC1 with the following substitutions (number in parentheses indicate number of independent isolates): L260S (2Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), C264Y, C271Y, C271G, H279Q (3Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The C264Y, C271Y, and H279Q substitutions represent three of the four known constitutive Mac1 mutants (5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Zhu Z. Labbe S. Pena M.M.O. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two new constitutive alleles were L260S and C271G. The involvement of Leu260 in copper regulation of Mac1 function has not been previously reported. To verify that the L260S substitution abolished copper inhibition of Mac1 function, the mutation was engineered in MAC1, and the mutant gene was subcloned into a low copy YCp vector for transformation into CMΔmac1cells containing the FRE1/HIS3 fusion gene. ThisMAC1 mutant and all subsequent mutants were tested in the context of the MAC1 promoter and terminator on a low copy vector. Cells harboring L260S Mac1 were His prototrophs on medium containing 30 μm CuSO4 and were Cus, confirming the constitutive nature of the L260S substitution (Fig. 2, line 3). A second approach, taken simultaneously, to identify constitutive Mac1 mutations was to mutate randomly MAC1 in a mutator E. coli strain (XL1-Red), defective in three primary DNA repair genes. After propagation of episomal MAC1 in XL1-Red cells, plasmid DNA was recovered and the MAC1 locus excised and subcloned into a yeast YCp vector. Eleven transformants of CMΔmac1 cells were His prototrophs on medium containing 30 μm CuSO4 and failed to grow on medium containing 1.75 mm CuSO4. These phenotypes were reversed in cells in which the URA3-based plasmid was shed following selection on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The 11 transformants also exhibited high, constitutive expression of chromosomal CTR1. Sequencing of the MAC1 locus in rescued plasmids revealed eight distinct MAC1 mutations. Three such mutations were isolated in two independent colonies. All eight mutations occurred within the C1 region of Mac1. Six missense mutations were found with the following codon substitutions: C264F, C266G, C271W, C271F, H279N, and H279Y (Fig. 1). The phenotypes of these mutants are shown in Fig. 2 (lines 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, and16). Only the H279Y substitution was observed previously, but other substitutions at residues Cys264 and Cys271 have been shown to yield constitutive Mac1 function (5Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The remaining two mutations were deletions encompassing portions of C1 (Fig. 2, lines 19 and 20). A six-base deletion of codons 262–264 and a 120-base deletion removing codons 226–267 yielded in-frame Mac1 truncates with constitutive Mac1 activity. The conserved residues in the C1 motif are as follows:264CXC(X)4CXC(X)2C(X)2H279. Substitutions at four of the six conserved residues yielded constitutive Mac1 activity. No mutations were isolated at the remaining codons, Cys273 and Cys276. To determine whether substitutions at these codons yielded a similar constitutive phenotype, Cys → Tyr substitutions were engineered at codons 273 and 276.MAC1 mutants with these changes were evaluated in CMΔmac1 cells containing the FRE1/HIS3 reporter gene on a low copy YCp vector. Unexpectedly, cells harboring either the C273Y or the C276Y Mac1 were His auxotrophic and were copper-resistant (Fig. 2, lines 12 and 14). Expression of either C273Y or the C276Y mutant Mac1 on a high copy YEp vector imparted a weak His prototrophy to cells (Fig. 3,lines 6 and 8). Quantitation of CTR1expression in cells expressing these mutant Mac1 molecules revealed constitutive mRNA levels (Fig.4 A).Figure 4A, expression of CTR1 in cells harboring MAC1 mutants expressed on high copy YEp vectors. Cells were cultured in low copper medium containing 100 μm bathocuproine sulfonate (−Cu) or 100 μmCuSO4.

It was first identified as a positive regulatory factor that, together with a second DNA binding factor PHO4 (4Vogel K. Horz W. Hinnen A. Mol. Cell.

Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1981: 159-180Google Scholar). A current model for the acid phosphatase regulation proposes that the two positive regulatory factors encoded by PHO4 and PHO2 are indispensable for the transcription of PHO5 (10Oshima Y. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1981: 159-180Google Scholar). In high phosphate medium, the complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase PHO85 and cyclin PHO80 phosphorylates and presumably inactivates the transcriptional factor PHO4 (11Kaffman A. Herskowitz I Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). When the concentration of phosphate in the medium is sufficiently low, PHO81 protein, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, inhibits the kinase activity of the PHO80·PHO85 complex (12Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), thus allowing the hypophosphorylated PHO4 protein, together with PHO2 protein, to activate the transcription of PHO5 gene.PHO2 has four conspicuous regions (see Fig. 1). The first one is a glutamine-rich region (amino acids 23–52), the deletion of which was showed to have no effect on PHO2 function (13Yang J. Wu J.S. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1995; 27: 165-172Google Scholar). The other three regions include the homeodomain (amino acids 77–136) (14Burglin T.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 339-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the acidic region (amino acids 294–329), and the region (amino acids 241–258) with homology to PHO80 protein. Homeo boxes were found in many genes of higher eukaryotes involved in development (e.g. Drosophila, mouse and human). The PHO2 homeodomain is directly involved in DNA recognition. The acidic region of PHO2 contains continuous stretches of aspartic acid and asparagine. The PHO80 homologous region may be an association domain of PHO2 with PHO4, the deletion of which inactivated the PHO2 protein (13Yang J. Wu J.S. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1995; 27: 165-172Google Scholar). The deletions at the C-terminal end of PHO2 protein may go up to residue 408 without strongly affecting the derepression of PHO5 (15Berben G. Legrain M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) argued that DNA binding by PHO4 is dependent on the phosphate-sensitive interaction with PHO2. It was also suggested that interaction with PHO2 increases the accessibility of the activation domain of PHO4 (17Shao D. Creasy C.L. Bergan L.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, immunoprecipitation experiments and protein binding assays showed that PHO2 and PHO4 form a complex with a DNA fragment and interacted with each other directly in vivo (18Magbanua J.D. Ogawa N. Harashima S. Oshima Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Protein phosphorylation has been found to play an important role in the control of diverse cellular processes, especially that of transcriptional factors in the regulation of gene expression. PHO80-PHO85 cyclin-CDK (CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase) complex can regulate the expression of PHO5 gene by phosphorylating PHO4 (11Kaffman A. Herskowitz I Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) has also been observed to exert its function in the synthesis of repressible acid phosphatase (19Matsumoto K. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Genetics. 1984; 108: 53-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As well, cdc2/CDC28 type kinase can affect gene expression by phosphorylation. The consensus motif of sites phosphorylated by cdc2/CDC28-type kinase is (Ser/Thr)-Pro-X-(Lys/Arg) (20Hill C.S. Packman L.C. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This sequence is found more frequently in nuclear proteins involved in transcriptional regulation than in proteins generally. Many of these proteins also contain DNA binding motif such as zinc fingers or helix-turn-helix structures (21Ward G.E. Kirschner M. Cell. 1990; 61: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Pearson R.B.

Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar).In this report we describe the identification of a potential phosphorylation site near the PHO80 homologous region of PHO2 protein. The mutation of the site can affect the function of PHO2 protein. Moreover, the introduction of a negative charge to this residue seems to be necessary for PHO2 functions. We also demonstrate that PHO2 can be phosphorylated by CDC28 kinase in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe functions of many transcriptional factors are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which may act in several aspects. First, phosphorylation can change the cellular location of some transcriptional factors. An S. cerevisiaetranscriptional factor, SWI5, which is localized in the cytoplasm at the G2 phase of cell cycle due to its phosphorylation by the cyclin-CDC28 protein kinase, enters the nucleus at Start in the G1 phase and activates HO gene expression (35Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, PHO4 is localized in the cytoplasm under high phosphate conditions (36O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) due to hyperphosphorylation by the PHO80-PHO85 cyclin-CDK (CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase) (11Kaffman A. Herskowitz I Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Second, some transcriptional activation factors, such as GAL4 and GCN4 (37Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 38Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), which have acidic transcriptional activation domains, may have a higher transcriptional activation activity upon point mutations to increase negative charges. It is conjectured that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may regulate the transcriptional activation activity by the increase or decrease of negative charges in response to the change of the circumstance. Third, phosphorylation may affect the interaction between transcriptional factors. Here we found that phosphorylation of PHO2 can affect the transcriptional activation activity. Only when PHO2 is phosphorylated, the secreted acid phosphatase, PHO5, can be expressed under low phosphate conditions. Further investigations indicated that the phosphorylation of PHO2 not only improve the transcriptional activation activity but facilitate the interaction between PHO2 and PHO4. These results suggested the pleiotropy of PHO2 phosphorylation. How the critical phosphorylation contributes to transcriptional activation activity and interaction is unclear. Because the previous deletion analysis showed that the possible PHO4 binding domain of PHO2 does not include the SPIK site (13Yang J. Wu J.S. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1995; 27: 165-172Google Scholar, 17Shao D. Creasy C.L. Bergan L.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar) and our results indicated that the negative charge of PHO2 (Ser230 → Asp) is sufficient to help the interaction between PHO2 and PHO4 in vitro suggests that the phosphorylation of the Ser-230 residue in PHO2 may alter the conformation of PHO2, making the PHO4 binding domain of PHO2 suitable for interaction with PHO4 but not participating in the interaction directly. The phosphorylation may also increase the ability of PHO2 to activate transcription by altering the three-dimensional conformation of PHO2. Furthermore, the phosphate group may be directly involved in transcriptional activation by increasing the negative charges of activation domain of PHO2.PHO2 has a potential phosphorylation site, SPIK (230), that resembles the consensus sequence of site recognized and phosphorylated by cdc2/CDC28-type kinase (20Hill C.S. Packman L.C. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Ward G.E. Kirschner M. Cell. 1990; 61: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). We found that GST-PHO2 fusion protein expressed in E. coli could be phosphorylated by yeast cell extract from YPH499 strain grown under low phosphate conditions. Further investigation showed that CDC28HA immunoprecipitate derived from yeast grown under low phosphate conditions could phosphorylate GST-PHO2 in vitro. These results indicate that CDC28 may be the kinase of PHO2. CDC28 is an essential regulator of cell cycle progression, whereas PHO2 is required for several metabolism processes. Another yeast cyclin-dependent kinase, PHO85, has provided a link between cell cycle regulation and phosphate metabolism (11Kaffman A. Herskowitz I Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 39Espinoza F.H. Ogas J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Science. 1994; 266: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40Measday V. Moore L. Ogas J. Tyers M. Andrews B. Science. 1994; 266: 1392-1395Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By association with different cyclin subunits, PHO85 may be directed to distinct biological functions. If CDC28 could be proved to be the physiological kinase of PHO2, another link between cell cycle progression and metabolism would be found. Perhaps a new cyclin would be found to help CDC28 participate in metabolism. In addition to PHO85, CDC28 might also serve to coordinate nutritional state and cell cycle progression.Homeo box-encoding genes appear to be associated with developmental control or cell type regulation. Previous investigations carried out by Gilliquet and Berben (41Gilliquet V. Berben G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reveals the involvement of PHO2 that contains a homeo domain in the life cycle. Homozygous PHO2null diploids show a deficiency to progress through meiosis, which can be corrected when the cells are transformed withPHO2-bearing plasmid. Many nuclear factors involved in the cell cycle have been observed to be phosphorylated and regulated by cdc2/CDC28-type protein kinase, which is activated only at specific cell cycle stages (42Forsburg S.L. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Our present findings show that PHO2 may be phosphorylated by CDC28. These evidences also suggest that there is some association between metabolism and cell cycle machinery. PHO2 (also known as GRF10, BAS2) (1Yoshida K. Ogawa N. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a protein of 559 amino acids (3Sengstag C. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is currently known as a transcriptional activator ofPHO5 (4Vogel K. Horz W. Hinnen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2050-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), PHO81 (5Wu J.S. Chen J.L. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1996; 28: 507-515Google Scholar), HIS4 (2Arndt K.T. Styles C.

A. 1993; 90: 11237-11241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), andADE1, ADE2, ADE5, 7, and ADE8 genes (9Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was first identified as a positive regulatory factor that, together with a second DNA binding factor PHO4 (4Vogel K. Horz W. Hinnen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2050-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), activated the transcription of PHO5, PHO11, PHO81, andPHO84 in the so-called S. cerevisiae PHO system. The transcription of PHO5 gene encoding a secreted acid phosphatase in S. cerevisiae is regulated in response to the extracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate through a system consisting of the products of at least five genes, PHO2, PHO4 PHO80, PHO85, and PHO81 (10Oshima Y. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1981: 159-180Google Scholar). A current model for the acid phosphatase regulation proposes that the two positive regulatory factors encoded by PHO4 and PHO2 are indispensable for the transcription of PHO5 (10Oshima Y. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1981: 159-180Google Scholar). In high phosphate medium, the complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase PHO85 and cyclin PHO80 phosphorylates and presumably inactivates the transcriptional factor PHO4 (11Kaffman A. Herskowitz I Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). When the concentration of phosphate in the medium is sufficiently low, PHO81 protein, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, inhibits the kinase activity of the PHO80·PHO85 complex (12Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), thus allowing the hypophosphorylated PHO4 protein, together with PHO2 protein, to activate the transcription of PHO5 gene. PHO2 has four conspicuous regions (see Fig. 1). The first one is a glutamine-rich region (amino acids 23–52), the deletion of which was showed to have no effect on PHO2 function (13Yang J. Wu J.S. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1995; 27: 165-172Google Scholar). The other three regions include the homeodomain (amino acids 77–136) (14Burglin T.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 339-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the acidic region (amino acids 294–329), and the region (amino acids 241–258) with homology to PHO80 protein. Homeo boxes were found in many genes of higher eukaryotes involved in development (e.g. Drosophila, mouse and human). The PHO2 homeodomain is directly involved in DNA recognition. The acidic region of PHO2 contains continuous stretches of aspartic acid and asparagine. The PHO80 homologous region may be an association domain of PHO2 with PHO4, the deletion of which inactivated the PHO2 protein (13Yang J. Wu J.S. Ao S.Z. Acta Biochim. Biophy. Sin. 1995; 27: 165-172Google Scholar). The deletions at the C-terminal end of PHO2 protein may go up to residue 408 without strongly affecting the derepression of PHO5 (15Berben G. Legrain M. Hilger F. Gene. 1988; 66: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of the two-hybrid assay (16Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) argued that DNA binding by PHO4 is dependent on the phosphate-sensitive interaction with PHO2. It was also suggested that interaction with PHO2 increases the accessibility of the activation domain of PHO4 (17Shao D. Creasy C.L. Bergan L.W. Mol. Gen.

By association with different cyclin subunits, PHO85 may be directed to distinct biological functions. If CDC28 could be proved to be the physiological kinase of PHO2, another link between cell cycle progression and metabolism would be found. Perhaps a new cyclin would be found to help CDC28 participate in metabolism. In addition to PHO85, CDC28 might also serve to coordinate nutritional state and cell cycle progression. Homeo box-encoding genes appear to be associated with developmental control or cell type regulation. Previous investigations carried out by Gilliquet and Berben (41Gilliquet V. Berben G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reveals the involvement of PHO2 that contains a homeo domain in the life cycle. Homozygous PHO2null diploids show a deficiency to progress through meiosis, which can be corrected when the cells are transformed withPHO2-bearing plasmid. Many nuclear factors involved in the cell cycle have been observed to be phosphorylated and regulated by cdc2/CDC28-type protein kinase, which is activated only at specific cell cycle stages (42Forsburg S.L. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Our present findings show that PHO2 may be phosphorylated by CDC28. These evidences also suggest that there is some association between metabolism and cell cycle machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2024666387,"Abstract N-Methylcyclopeptides like cyclosporins and enniatins are synthesized by multifunctional enzymes representing hybrid systems of peptide synthetases andS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependentN-methyltransferases. The latter constitute a new family of N-methyltransferases sharing high homology within procaryotes and eucaryotes. Here we describe the mutational analysis of the N-methyltransferase domain of enniatin synthetase fromFusarium scirpi to gain insight into the assembly of the AdoMet-binding site. The role of four conserved motifs (I,2085VLEIGTGSGMIL; II/Y, 2105SYVGLDPS; IV,2152DLVVFNSVVQYFTPPEYL; and V,2194ATNGHFLAARA) in cofactor binding as measured by photolabeling was studied. Deletion of the first 21 N-terminal amino acid residues of the N-methyltransferase domain did not affect AdoMet binding. Further shortening close to motif I resulted in loss of binding activity. Truncation of 38 amino acids from the C terminus and also internal deletions containing motif V led to complete loss of AdoMet-binding activity. Point mutations converting the conserved Tyr223 (corresponding to position 2106 in enniatin synthetase) in motif II/Y (close to motif I) into Val, Ala, and Ser, respectively, strongly diminished AdoMet binding, whereas conversion of this residue to Phe restored AdoMet-binding activity to ∼70%, indicating that Tyr223 is important for AdoMet binding and that the aromatic Tyr223 may be crucial for AdoMet binding in N-methylpeptide synthetases."

While norepinephrine causes vasoconstriction following reflex sympathetic stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) formation results in vasodilatation via a guanylyl cyclase-dependent mechanism. In this report, we investigated the relationship between NO and DβH enzymatic activity. In the initial in vitroexperiments, the activity of purified DβH was inhibited by the NO donor, diethylamine/NO (DEA/NO), with an IC50 of 1 mm. The inclusion of either azide or GSH partially restored DβH activity, suggesting the involvement of the reactive nitrogen oxide species, N2O3. Treatment of human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC) with diethylamine/NO decreased cellular DβH activity without affecting their growth rate and was augmented by the depletion of intracellular GSH. Co-culture of the SK-N-MC cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, which release NO, also reduced the DβH activity in the neuroblastoma cells.

DβH,1 the third enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of norepinephrine, can hydroxylate the β-carbon of a variety of phenylethylamine derivatives. DβH is a tetrameric copper-containing oxidoreductase with conserved homology among mammalian species (1.Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 12: 315-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that is localized in both noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons of the central nervous system, sympathetic ganglia, and adrenal medulla (1.Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 12: 315-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2.Axelrod J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1972; 24: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological regulation of DβH activity includes axonal transport rate, transcriptional factors such as nerve growth factor, and cyclic AMP (3.Kobayashi K. Kurosawa Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4.Thoenen H. Angeletti P.U. Levi-Montalcini R. Kettler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Germ line mutations in DβH result in systemic hypotension mediated by increased dopamine levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood (5.Robertson D. Haile V. Perry S.E. Robertson R.M. Phillips III, J.A.

Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide, NO) is a prominent cellular messenger involved in several important biological processes including the regulation of neurotransmission and cardiovascular function (7.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The physiological effects of NO occur with relatively low concentrations and primarily involve direct reactions with metal-containing proteins and radicals (7.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide fluxes, generated from nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzymes, are present in endothelia, and selected neurons mediate these direct effects (8.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In contrast, indirect effects of NO are likely to occur during pathological states. Indirect effects require relatively higher levels of NO and involve the formation of reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS) prior to target modification. In general, this chemistry is a consequence of the NO fluxes generated by the isoenzyme, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) (7.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide regulates the release and uptake of dopamine and the activity of a number of catecholamines in the striatum and other dopaminergic cells (9.Palacios M. Knowles R.G. Palmer R.M.

In anococcygeus muscle preparations, the contractile response to noradrenergic stimulation is enhanced in the presence ofl-N-monomethylarginine as well (16.Li C.G. Rand M.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These studies show that an interrelationship exists between catecholamines and NO in the neuronal-endothelial control of blood flow. In this study, we sought to determine if there was an effect of NO on DβH and under what conditions these might exist in vivo. A modified spectrophotometric assay (18.Kato T. Kuzuya H. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Med. 1974; 10: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used to detect DβH activityin vitro. This assay was based on the conversion of substrate tyramine to octopamine, and the octopamine was converted top-hydroxybenzaldehyde by sodium periodate treatment. Thep-hydroxybenzaldehyde is measured spectrophotometrically. Bovine adrenal DβH (40 units/liter; Sigma) in PBS was mixed with DEA/NO (a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Saavedra, SCAI, Frederick, MD) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then the DβH with or without exposure to DEA/NO was added to a substrate mixture (600 μl). The substrate mixture contained N-ethylmaleimide (40 mm), sodium acetate buffer (200 mm, pH 5.0), tyramine (20 mm), sodium fumarate (10 mm), pargyline (1 mm), catalase (0.1 mg), fresh ascorbic acid (10 mm), and PBS (400 μl). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of 3 m cold trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was immediately centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min (MX/TX-160, TOMY Technology), and the supernatant was transferred to a microbio-spin column (400-μl bed volume) of GA-50W-X4 (H+, 200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad). After washing with 2 ml of distilled water, the absorbed reaction product octopamine was eluted with 1 ml of 4m ammonia. Octopamine in the eluate was converted top-hydroxybenzaldehyde by adding 0.2 ml of 2% sodium periodate, and the excess sodium periodate was reduced by adding 0.2 ml of 10% sodium metabisulfite. The absorbance was measured by a dual wavelength spectrophotometer at 330 nm. The blank value was obtained by substituting water for the enzyme. One hundred mm DEA/NO in NaOH and NaNO2 in water were used as stock to detect the NO inhibition effect. Preventing the inhibition of DβH activity by DEA/NO was preformed by directly adding GSH (Sigma) and sodium azide (Sigma) into the reaction before incubation. To eliminate the possibility that DEA/NO might interact with octopamine directly, the absorbance was measured after the co-incubation of 5 mmoctopamine (Sigma) with 5 mm DEA/NO. The neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When the culture was 85–90% confluent, cells were harvested, suspended at a density of 107 cells/ml in PBS, and stored at −70 °C. To investigate the dose response and time course of inhibition of DβH activity, various amounts of DEA/NO were added to the cell cultures with different incubation times according to the experimental design. The cells were trypsinized, harvested, counted, and lysed by freezing and thawing three times and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the DβH activity was measured as described above. To eliminate the possibility that the reduction of DβH activity was caused by a decreased number of viable cells, the cell growth rate was examined by a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (MTS assay; Promega). The SK-N-MC cells, with and without DEA/NO treatment, were washed with the culture medium and subcultured into a 96-well plate. The number of viable cells was measured by the MTS assay in the first, second, third, and fourth day after 24 h of subculture. Purified bovine adrenal DβH (40 units/liter) was exposed to 5 mm fresh and decomposed DEA/NO in PBS for 2 h at room temperature before the enzyme reaction. The decomposed DEA/NO was made by incubating DEA/NO at 37 °C for 1 h in PBS with shaking. The enzyme activities were measured at 15-min intervals throughout the total 2-h incubation time. The activity of the purified DβH without DEA/NO was measured as a positive control. The cultured neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC) were incubated with 0 and 5 mm DEA/NO for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS four times and continually cultured with fresh medium. The cells were collected for DβH activity measurement at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h after DEA/NO exposure. Immortalized C3 murine microglial cells (kindly provided by Dr. C. A. Colton, Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.) were seeded (2 × 106 cells) into 100-mm2 Petri dishes and were stimulated for 12 h with both IFN-γ (20 ng/ml) and LPS (20 ng/ml). The nitrosative capacity of C3 cells under these conditions was monitored by the release of nitrite and the ability to form triazole from the target compound, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene, present in the medium. Nitric oxide was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy (19.Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Cook J.C. Grisham M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 105-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells were trypsinized, washed with the culture medium, and seeded into the C3 cultures at an effector-to-target ratio of 1:3. The iNOS inhibitorl-N-methylarginine (NMA) was added into the co-culture either at the beginning of co-culture or 4 h before harvest to investigate whether the inhibition can be prevented or restored. Following 12 h of co-incubation, the cells were suspended, washed, and lysed as described previously. The activity of DβH was detected with a dual wavelength spectrophotometer. To rule out the possibility that the overnight co-culture may affect the SK-N-MC cells' growth and viability, the number of viable SK-N-MC cells after co-culture was counted by bright line hemocytometer (Sigma) with trypan blue staining. The concentration of GSH was determined in both DEA/NO-treated (5 mm, 1 h) and nontreated SK-N-MC cells. Intracellular GSH was determined as described previously (20.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5554) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with PBS four times, harvested, and then suspended in 2 ml of 0.69% sulfosalicylic acid and stored at −70 °C. Spectra were performed on a UV-visible spectrophotometer, model U-3000/U-3300 (Hitachi). To investigate whether a selective inhibitor of GSH synthesis, buthionine suloximine (BSO; Sigma), affected DβH inhibition by NO, SK-N-MC cells were treated with 5 mm fresh BSO for 12 h before DEA/NO was added into the culture. After DEA/NO treatment, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and lysed as described above. In each experiment, experimental and control cells were matched for seeding density, number of passages, and the percentage of confluence. The experiments were repeated at least three times. Student's pairedt tests were used to determine the significance of differences between the means of experiments and controls. To verify the reliability of the spectrophotometric assay for the detection of DβH activity, purified bovine adrenal DβH activity was measured. In this assay, the reaction containing both enzyme and substrate was incubated, and the absorbance was measured. The enzyme activities (absorbance) showed a linear relation with the amount of DβH added from a range of 0–80 units/liter (Fig.1 A). To determine the effect of NO on DβH activity, the protein was exposed to the reaction buffer with different amounts of the NO donor DEA/NO. Exposure of DβH to increasing concentrations of DEA/NO in vitro resulted in a marked decrease in the conversion of tyramine to octopamine (Fig.1 B). The absolute absorbance of octopamine remained the same with and without DEA/NO co-incubation (data not shown). The concentration of DEA/NO required to reduce DβH activity by 50% was 1 mm. Nitrite is a by-product of the decomposition of DEA/NO, which can produce both NO and RNOS under acidic conditions. Because the assay for DβH was performed under acidic conditions (21.Williams D.L. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of nitrite on DβH. The effect of increasing nitrite on DβH caused a decrease in DβH activity (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that NO/RNOS, produced in the presence of nitrite under acidic conditions, could be responsible for this inhibition (Fig.1 B). Despite the effect of nitrite, complete inhibition required 50 mm nitrite, a dose 10 times higher than DEA/NO to inhibit the enzyme activity to the same extent. These results suggest that the vast majority of the inhibition by DEA/NO resulted from the liberation of nitric oxide and not nitrite; thus, increasing nitric oxide concentrations inhibit DβH. The inhibition of DβH activity by DEA/NO could be mediated by either NO or an RNOS, such as N2O3. A significant amount of N2O3 is formed at 5 mmconcentrations of DEA/NO, which has been shown to inhibit other enzymes (22.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Chistodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the chemical intermediate responsible for the decomposition, the same experiments were performed in the presence of azide, an efficient scavenger of N2O3 (21.Williams D.L. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23.Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Miles A.M. Nims R.W. Krishna M.C. Pacelli R. Teague D. Poore C.M. Cook J.A. Ford P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 120-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of DEA/NO to DβH in the presence of sodium azide showed abrogation of the inhibitory effect of DEA/NO (Fig. 2 A). The same concentration of azide had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, when GSH was substituted with the azide as a scavenger of N2O3, abrogation of DEA/NO-mediated inhibition also was observed (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that 10 mm GSH inhibited the assay, which is not surprising, because previous reports have shown that thiol-containing substances such as cystamine inhibited DβH (24.Terry L.C. Craig R. Neuroendocrinology. 1985; 41: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the pretreatment of the isolated protein in the presence of GSH with excess DEA/NO results in nearly a 100% conversion to S-nitrosoglutathione (22.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Chistodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the S-nitrosothiol,S-nitrosoglutathione, does not inhibit DβH. Hence, scavenging of N2O3 by GSH resulted in the protection of the enzyme. Because NO does not directly react with either azide or GSH, these data clearly indicate that N2O3, not NO, was responsible for the inhibition of DβH activity in this in vitro experimental model. As shown above, the purified enzyme can readily be inhibited by N2O3. To extend these findings, we selected a human neuroblastoma cell line as a model to detect and measure the possible alteration of DβH activity by NO. Human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) cells have been shown to contain endogenous DβH (25.Brewster M.A. Berry D.H. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 9: 343-346PubMed Google Scholar). Although we did not detect any DβH activity in the cell culture medium (data not shown), we were able to measure the activity of DβH in the SK-N-MC cell lysate. The activity of DβH was positively correlated with the number of cells used for lysis (Fig.3 A). The different negative controls including boiled cell lysate, buffer only, 100 μm specific DβH inhibitor, fusaric acid (Sigma) (26.Kato T. Wakui Y. Nagatsu T. Ohnishi T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and zero incubation time showed either very low or no DβH activity (Fig. 3 B). The DβH activity in the cell lysates was partially decreased when DEA/NO was added to the culture before cellular lysing of the cells (Fig. 3 C). Unlike the results with the isolated protein (Fig. 1 B), 5 mm DEA/NO reduced cellular DβH activity to a lesser extent, i.e.50%. An increase of DEA/NO concentrations had no further effect on the reduction of DβH activity. A major difference between the experiments, exposing DEA/NO directly to the isolated protein or to the DβH-containing cell lysate, is the presence of cellular defenses against NO/RNOS such as GSH. It has been shown that GSH protects cells against N2O3 toxicity (22.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Chistodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); therefore, GSH may be expected to attenuate the inhibitory effect of DEA/NO. SK-N-MC cells contain 20 μg of GSH/mg of protein, which is considerably more than most other mammalian cells. Exposure of 10 mm DEA/NO only reduced GSH levels modestly (data not shown). To determine if GSH affected the DEA/NO-mediated inhibition of DβH, cells were pretreated with BSO to deplete intracellular GSH. In controlled experiments, the BSO treatment had no effect on the DβH activity of the cells. However, BSO increased the DEA/NO-mediated inhibition from 50 to 90% (Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that the presence of intracellular GSH plays a role in partially protecting DβH from NO-mediated inhibition. The cells treated with DEA/NO did not show any significant alteration of cell growth rate in comparison with the non-DEA/NO-treated control. The doubling times of the cells, with and without DEA/NO, were 64 and 60 h, respectively. We investigated whether the inhibition of DβH activity by NO is reversible or irreversible in our experimental models. The activity of the purified DβH was inhibited completely by 5 mm of the fresh DEA/NO, and even when the incubation time was prolonged to 2 h, there was no recovery of the enzyme activity (Fig.4 A). Because the half-life of DEA/NO is about 4 min at 37 °C (27.Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DEA/NO cannot generate any NO in this system when the preincubation time is extended to 2 h at room temperature. The composite spectra for the decomposition of DEA/NO in our experimental conditions show that the concentration of DEA/NO is almost down to zero after a 2-h period (data not shown). The activity of the DβH treated with decomposed DEA/NO showed a slight reduction because of the DEA/NO by-product nitrite (Fig. 4 A), which is consistent with the data showing DβH activity after exposure to NaNO2 only (Fig. 1 B). After removing 5 mm DEA/NO exposed for 1 h, no recovery of DβH activity was detected in the continuing culture of SK-N-MC cells, even up to 5 h (Fig. 4 B). Although 5 mm of DEA/NO inhibited both the purified and the cellular DβH, it could be argued that these conditions are not relevant in biological systems. Therefore, we sought to determine if NO, derived from activated microglial cells, could inhibit DβH activity in co-cultured SK-N-MC cells. SK-N-MC cells were plated in Petri dishes containing murine macrophage C3 cells untreated or activated by IFN-γ and LPS. The C3 cells showed no detectable DβH activity (data not shown). A marked inhibition of DβH was observed in the SK-N-MC cells co-cultured with activated C3 cells (Fig.5). This inhibition was abated in the presence of the NOS inhibitor NMA during the co-culture (Fig. 5). However, the activity of DβH was not restored by the addition of NMA for 4 h after 8 h of co-culture (Fig. 5). The number and the viability of the SK-N-MC cells after co-culture were found to be similar to those of the companion cultures without C3 cells (>95%). These data indicate that NO, derived from iNOS, could produce an environment to inhibit DβH similar to 5 mm DEA/NOin vivo. Because either DEA/NO or cytokine-activated C3 cells inhibited DβH activity in the SK-N-MC cells, we determined the relative NO concentration that was produced by these two methods. A solution of 10 mm DEA/NO was dissolved in an appropriate buffer at 37 °C. Aliquots of samples were taken every 30 s at different time points and evaluated by a chemiluminescent method. The flux of NO rose to 50–100 μm and then decreased as described previously (23.Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Miles A.M. Nims R.W. Krishna M.C. Pacelli R. Teague D. Poore C.M. Cook J.A. Ford P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 120-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined NO production by the cytokine-activated C3 cells in which aliquots were obtained hourly. As seen in Table I, the activated C3 cells produced 10–15 μm of nitrite during the course of the experiment where DEA/NO generated 10 mm (data not shown).Table INitrosative capacity of activated microgliaStimulantsNitriteTriazolenm/hNone30 ± 0.10IFN-γ + LPS910 ± 3272 ± 9Data are derived from triplicate values ± S.E. of the nitrite andN-nitrosated product of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene, triazole that accumulated over a period of 3 h.

Our results show that the activity of DβH, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, is inhibited by NO, derived from either a synthetic donor or macrophage/microglial iNOS. DEA/NO decomposes to release a high flux of NO at a physiological pH (27.Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an aerobic environment, NO can combine with molecular oxygen to form RNOS such as N2O3 (28.Ford P.C. Wink D.A. Stanbury D.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The RNOS scavenger compounds, GSH and azide (21.Williams D.L. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), attenuated DEA/NO-mediated inhibition of DβH (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that N2O3, rather than NO alone, was the effector molecule. N2O3 can transfer an NO+ equivalent to nucleophilic sites in a reaction known as nitrosation (22.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Chistodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 29.Wink D.A. Vodovotz Y. Laval J. Laval F. Dewhirst M.W. Mitchell J.B. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Enzymes containing cysteine-zinc finger motifs, unprotonated lysyl, or reduced cystyl residues at key sites are susceptible to nitrosation-mediated inhibition (29.Wink D.A. Vodovotz Y. Laval J. Laval F. Dewhirst M.W. Mitchell J.B. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In addition, N2O3 can nitrosate tyrosine residues in proteins (30.Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that multiple residues are critical for DβH activity (31.Sams C.F. Matthews K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 787: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Incubation of DβH with diazonium tetrazole, iodoacetamide, or diethylpyrocarbonate caused complete inhibition of the enzyme activity, indicating that lysine, tyrosine, and histidine residues are critical for catalytic function. Interestingly, the only thiol sites in DβH are oxidized on cystine bridges that maintain the tetrameric structure of the protein complex. This precludes their accessibility to N2O3. The reaction of the DβH complex with dithiothreitol reduces it into a dimeric form without affecting DβH activity (31.Sams C.F. Matthews K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 787: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Similar to other metalloenzymes, such as P450 hydroxylase and cytochrome coxidase in the mitochondrial respiration chain (7.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), our data showed that DβH activity was irreversibly inhibited by 5 mm of DEA/NO and microglia-derived NO. The higher local concentration of NO could form N2O3 and cause indirect effects on DβH. The formation of a benzylic radical intermediate in the hydroxylation of DβH has been proposed (32.Fitzpatrick P.F. Villafranca J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 257: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our data show that the unpaired electron of NO does not contribute to DβH inhibition. However, the benzylic radical mechanism could play a role under turnover conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that nitrosation-mediated inhibition of DβH activity may occur at either lysine and/or tyrosine residues. Additional studies are needed to further test this hypothesis. Neuroblastoma is composed of primitive cells derived from the neural crest and contains a high level of DβH activity roughly equivalent to adrenal medulla tissue (25.Brewster M.A. Berry D.H. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 9: 343-346PubMed Google Scholar). While 5 mm DEA/NO inhibited the purified enzyme completely, this concentration of DEA/NO reduced the activity of DβH within intact SK-N-MC neurons by only 50% (Fig.3 C). The inclusion of BSO resulted in full (>90%) inhibition, showing that the thiol-containing tripeptide GSH was a protective agent against nitrosative DβH inhibition for only 50% of the intracellular enzyme population. GSH concentrations of 5 mm were sufficient to protect purified DβH (Fig.2 B). SK-N-MC cells contain a reduced GSH pool in the range of 12–30 mm. These data demonstrated that GSH was unable to protect approximately half of the intracellular DβH against nitrosative inhibition despite relatively high levels. DβH exists in both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound forms in approximately equal amounts (5.Robertson D. Haile V. Perry S.E. Robertson R.M. Phillips III, J.A. Biaggioni I. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33.Sokoloff R.L. Frigon R.P. O'Connor D.T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reaction between NO and molecular oxygen to form N2O3 is accelerated greatly in the hydrophobic phase of lipid bilayers (34.Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The insertion of DβH into membranes may augment nitrosative inhibition by 1) placing it in an environment of relatively higher NO+equivalents and 2) concealing lysine and/or tyrosine sites from the GSH protection. The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by DβH requires the reduction of ascorbate as the electron donor. Sequestration of the active site of DβH into the hydrophobic phase of the membrane may be necessary to avoid interference from the high cytoplasmic pool of reduced GSH. By this mechanism, GSH may maintain DβH in an inactive state as it is transported down axons restricting norepinephrine synthesis to nerve terminals. The term nitrosative stress has been used to describe biological components that are nitrosated by species derived from N2O3 (7.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). A nitrosative stress microenvironment can occur under very distinct conditions including high concentrations of NO for prolonged periods of time. Constitutive NOS are unlikely to produce these conditions, because they produce NO for only short periods of time generally, and they also are inhibited by high fluxes of NO (35.Griscavage J.M. Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, the iNOS would be the most likely source. Nitrosative stress can occur following the expression of iNOS in activated leukocytes (36.Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Pluta R.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11341-11347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Co-culture of SK-N-MC cells with macrophages/microglia stimulated to produce N2O3, resulted in DβH inhibition equivalent to that observed with 5 mm DEA/NO (Fig. 5). The inhibition of iNOS with l-N-monomethylarginine fully restored DβH activity, ruling out the potential influence of other inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that a condition of nitrosative stress is required in vivo to inhibit DβH. The possibility of DβH inhibition in cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and adrenal medulla may be a significant feature of nitrosative stress, particularly during infection that localizes the leukocytes to express iNOS in the proximity of catecholaminergic systems. Under these circumstances, the resultant increase in both dopamine and NO with a decrease in norepinephrine would increase vasodilation, regional blood flow, and tissue permeability. Nitrosated DβH may then be replaced by the GSH-protected pool mobilized from the cellular perikarya. Chronic nitrosation, however, may lead to a more severe dysregulation of the catecholamine balance. NO, as an important intercellular messenger, may regulate catecholamine and blood flow by the modulation of DβH activity. We thank D. Dudek for editorial assistance."

The amino acid sequences of the archaeal RadA proteins are more similar to the eukaryotic Rad51s rather than the bacterial RecAs, and the N-terminal region containing domain I is conserved among the RadA and Rad51 proteins but is absent from RecA. To understand the structure-function relationship of RadA, we divided the RadA protein from Pyrococcus furiosus into two parts, the N-terminal one-third (RadA-n) and the residual C-terminal two-thirds (RadA-c), the latter of which contains the central core domain (domain II) of the RecA/Rad51 family proteins. RadA-c had the DNA-dependent ATPase activity and the strand exchange activity by itself, although much weaker (10%) than that of the intact RadA. These activities of RadA-c were restored to 60% of those of RadA by addition of RadA-n, indicating that the proper active structure of RadA was reconstituted in vitro. These results suggest that the basic activities of the RecA/Rad51 family proteins for homologous recombination are derived from domain II, and the N-terminal region may help to enhance the catalytic efficiencies.

The eukaryotic Rad51 has a unique N-terminal region, which is therefore thought to have important roles for the interactions with these proteins. On the other hand, a recent mutational analysis indicated that the N-terminal domain of the human Rad51 protein constitutes a DNA binding domain (14Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Terada T. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 290: 495-504Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From this result, it has been proposed that the N-terminal domain of Rad51 could have the same function as the C-terminal domain of RecA, although they have no structural homology to each other (14Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Terada T. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 290: 495-504Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We cloned the two genes, radA and radB from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, expressed them in Escherichia coli, and characterized the gene products, RadA and RadB (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33782-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of RadA and RadB are very similar to that of eukaryotic Rad51 (54 and 29% similarity, respectively, to S. cerevisiae Rad51). RadA has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, D-loop formation activity, and strand exchange activity, which are similar to the abilities of the other RecA family proteins. On the other hand, RadB has a very weak ATPase activity that is not stimulated by DNA. Little RadB strand exchange activity could be detected with either a plasmid substrate or an oligonucleotide substrate, even though the protein had very strong DNA binding ability. An immunological analysis showed that the amount of RadB protein in the P. furiosus cell was 200 times less than that of RadA. RadA contains an N-terminal region like that of the eukaryotic Rad51. On the other hand, RadB has only the central core region of the RecA family proteins and has neither the N-terminal nor C-terminal extra domain. To explore the structure-function relationship for the DNA pairing and strand exchange activities of the RecA/Rad51 family proteins, we made deletion mutant proteins, RadA-n and RadA-c, which contain only the N-terminal and C-terminal (central core) regions of RadA, respectively. The RadA-c had the strand exchange activity by itself, although it was much weaker than that of intact RadA. The decreased activity of RadA-c was restored by the addition of RadA-n, indicating that the appropriate conformation of RadA was reconstituted. The construction of the expression plasmid of the radA gene inE. coli and the purification procedure of the RadA protein are described in the accompanying paper (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J.

The N-terminal- and C-terminal truncated RadAs (RadA-n, Met1–Arg107; RadA-c, Ala108–Asp349) were prepared by expression of each truncated gene in E. coli. The genes, radA-nand radA-c were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two sets of primers (RADAF, ACATATGGCTGGTGAGGAAGTTAAGGAGAT, and RADANR, CACGAGCTCGAGTTATTATCTCTTCTTGAGATATTC, or RADACF, CACGAGCATATGGCTACAATAGGGAGAATTTC, and RADAR, TCTCGAGTCTAATCCTCTATCCCTTTTTCA) and were inserted into the NdeI-XhoI sites of the pET21a expression plasmid. The resultant plasmids were designated pPFRADAN and pPFRADAC, respectively. E. coli JM109 (DE3) carrying pPFRADAN or pPFRADAC was cultivated, and the expression of theradA-n or radA-c gene was induced under the same conditions as for pPFRADA/JM109 (DE3). The heat-resistant fractions were prepared from cells carrying either pFURADAC or pFURADAN, in sonication buffer with or without 0.4 m NaCl by sonication and heat treatment. After treatment with 0.5% polyethylenimine, the supernatant from each cell was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation). The RadA-n precipitate was resuspended in and dialyzed against buffer A and was applied to a HiTrap Q column. The fractions eluted at 0.12–0.36 m NaCl were mixed with four volumes of buffer A and were applied to a heparin column. The protein fraction (0.12–0.35 m NaCl) was combined with four volumes of buffer C (buffer A, except at pH 8.8) and was applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column. The pass fraction was applied to a HiTrap Q column, and the RadA-n was eluted at 0.24–0.36 NaCl. The RadA-c precipitate was resuspended in buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. The RadA-c protein was eluted at 0.7–0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and the fractions were dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was applied to a heparin column, and the protein was eluted at 0.2–0.3 m NaCl. The fractions were diluted with four volumes of buffer C and then applied onto a HiTrap Q column. The RadA-c protein was eluted at 0.12–0.23 NaCl and was stored on ice. The concentrations of RadA-n and RadA-c were determined by using molar extinction coefficients (εM) of 2560m−1·cm−1 and 10810m−1·cm−1, respectively, which were obtained by the method of Gill and von Hippel (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

The fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the bands were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The native molecular mass of each protein was determined by comparison with gel filtration standards (thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; IgG, 158 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; myoglobin, 17 kDa; vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa from Bio-Rad). A multiple sequence alignment was constructed with the alignment software, CLUSTAL W 1.7 (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). The obtained alignment was modified by visual inspection to adjust the gap positions to exclude the gaps in the secondary structure elements as much as possible. The tertiary structure of RecA (35Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steiz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) was referred to for the modification. Because of the high sequence divergence, the inclusion of Rad55 and Xrcc2 reduced the accuracy in the residue correspondence of the alignment. Therefore, the two sequences were not included in the alignment. For the molecular phylogenetic analysis, the sites including gaps were excluded from the multiple alignment. To construct a phylogenetic tree, the genetic distance between every pair of aligned sequences was calculated as a maximum likelihood estimate (36Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Jones, Taylor, Thornton model (37Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar) for the amino acid substitutions. Based on the distance, a tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (38Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The statistical significance of the neighbor-joining tree topology was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis (39Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with one thousand iterative constructions of the neighbor-joining tree. For the molecular phylogenetic analyses, two software packages, PHYLIP 3.5c (44Felsenstein J. PHYLIP , version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar) and MOLPHY 2.3b3 (45Adachi J. Hasegawa M. MOLPHY , version 2.3b3. Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo1996Google Scholar) were used. The trees thus obtained were drawn by TREEVIEW (40Page R.D. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons showed that RadA has 40% identity (54% similarity) to yeast Rad51. In contrast, it exhibited only 29% similarity to E. coli RecA. Fig.1 shows a diagram of the sequence alignment using representative RecA/Rad51 family proteins. RadA has an N-terminal domain (domain I) that shares a conserved sequence with the N-terminal domains of the eukaryotic Rad51 proteins. The amino acid sequence of RadA domain I is 25% (34%) and 28% (38%) identical (similar) to yeast Rad51, and human Rad51, respectively. The N-terminal domain is absent from E. coli RecA. On the other hand,E. coli RecA has an additional C-terminal domain instead of the N-terminal domain. RadB consists solely of the central core domain (domain II) of this protein family. The amino acid sequence identity of the domain II in RadA and RadB is about 28% (45% similarity). Our biochemical analysis showed that RadA, but not RadB, has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, D-loop formation activity and the strand exchange activity (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33782-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To understand the structure-function relationship of the RecA family proteins, RadA was separated into two parts, the N-terminal one-third (an additional domain only in Rad51 proteins) and the C-terminal two-thirds (the central core domain of the recA family proteins). From a sequence alignment of the archaeal RadA and eukaryotic Rad51 proteins (Fig.1 B), a region from Ser36 to Arg107at the N terminus of the P. furiosus RadA protein was found to be strongly conserved. Therefore, we decided to cleave RadA between Arg107 and Ala108. The corresponding regions in the radA gene for both parts of RadA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the appropriate primers and were cloned into the expression vector, pET21a, followed by confirmation of the sequences. In the construct for the C-terminal region, a translational initiation codon (ATG) was inserted in front of the codon for Ala108. The two proteins, named RadA-n (Met1–Arg107) and RadA-c (Met + Ala108–Asp349), were successfully produced inE. coli and were purified to homogeneity after sequential chromatographies, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). Neither RadA-n nor RadA-c precipitated with 0.5% (final concentration) polyethylenimine, in contrast to RadA, indicating that the division of the RadA protein into two parts causes the proteins to have decreased affinity to DNA. The hydrophobic column chromatography was very effective for the separation of the RadA protein from the DNA (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33782-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic column was still effective for RadA-c, but it could be omitted for the purification of the RadA-n to obtain the pure proteins with an absorbance ratio (A 280/A 260) higher than 2.0. From 1 liter of E. coli culture, about 5.5 mg of RadA-n and 2.9 mg of RadA-c were purified. The RadA-n and RadA-c proteins were assayed for ATPase activity. As shown in Fig.3 and TableI, RadA-c, but not RadA-n, had ATPase activity, although it was 10-fold lower than that of the wild-type RadA. The activity from RadA-c also showed some DNA dependence, and it increased 2-fold in the presence of ssDNA or dsDNA as compared with the absence of DNA. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of RadA-c increased when RadA-n was added to the reaction, suggesting that RadA-n and RadA-c reconstituted the active structure of RadA in the solution during the incubation. To obtain the optimal molar ratio of RadA-n and RadA-c to be mixed, the ATPase activities of the reconstituted samples by different ratios were measured. When RadA-n was added to RadA-c with 2:1 molar ratio, the ATPase activity increased to 60% of the wild-type level. No more increase was observed even though RadA-n was added with 5:1 ratio. A typical result from experiments repeated several times using the reconstituted sample by 2:1 ratio is presented in Fig. 3. The calculated k cat values of each sample is shown in Table I.Table IATPase activity of wild-type and mutant RadA proteinsRadAAdditionK cat/minRadA wild type−DNA0.10 ± 0.01ssDNA2.07 ± 0.12dsDNA1.01 ± 0.04RadA-n−DNA0.02 ± 0.01ssDNA0.01 ± 0.00dsDNA0.01 ± 0.00RadA-c−DNA0.09 ± 0.04ssDNA0.22 ± 0.03dsDNA0.24 ± 0.03RadA-c + n−DNA0.12 ± 0.05ssDNA1.09 ± 0.08dsDNA1.27 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab The pairing and strand transfer abilities of RadA-n and RadA-c were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 A, neither RadA-n nor RadA-c had D-loop formation activity under the conditions for RadA activity. However, a very weak ability for the three-strand exchange was observed with RadA-c alone, and the joint molecules produced by RadA-c increased with increasing amounts of RadA-c used for the reaction (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the joint molecule production increased when increasing amounts of RadA-n were added to the reaction. The decreased efficiency of the joint molecule formation by RadA-c was restored to 60% of the wild-type level when RadA-n was added with 2:1 or 5:1 more ratio. The effect of RadA-n on RadA-c strand exchange reaction is consistent with that on the ATPase activity. Neither D-loop formation nor the strand exchange activity was observed with RadA-n. These results indicate that the central core domain of RadA is essential for the strand exchange activity and that the N-terminal domain contributes to the enhancement of the reaction efficiency. To determine whether the N-terminal domain contributes to the self-assembly of RadA for cooperative DNA binding, the affinities of the truncated RadA proteins to DNA were compared by the gel mobility shift assays. RadA-c bound to both ssDNA and dsDNA, but its affinity was severalfold lower than that of RadA (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the weak stimulation of the RadA-c ATPase activity by DNAs. No DNA binding was detected in the experiment using RadA-n under the same conditions (data not shown), which suggests that the N-terminal domain of RadA has little DNA binding activity by itself. In contrast to the expectation from the results of the ATPase assay, no difference was observed in the patterns of the shifted bands by RadA-c and the mixture of RadA-n and RadA-c under our assay conditions (Fig. 5). The DNA-protein complexes observed in the gel shift assay probably do not directly reflect the active nucleoprotein filaments. RadA forms a nucleoprotein filament with DNA in the presence of ATPγS. In the absence of DNA, most of the electron microscopic images of RadA are ring-like structures (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33782-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, neither the nucleoprotein filament in the presence of DNA nor the ring-like structure in the absence of DNA was observed when RadA was substituted by RadA-c or the mixture of RadA-n and RadA-c (data not shown). Then purified RadA-n and RadA-c, as well as wild-type RadA, were subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 6). The peaks of the eluted fractions of RadA-n and RadA-c corresponded to 25 and 22 kDa, respectively. Some of RadA-c eluted close to the position corresponding to 52 kDa. These results indicate that RadA-n and RadA-c mainly exist as a dimer and a monomer, respectively, and some of the RadA-c form a dimer. When the two proteins were mixed to 2:1 ratio, the main peak appeared at around the size of 45 kDa, indicating that the two proteins form a 1:1 complex. The band intensities of RadA-n and RadA-c on a SDS-PAGE of the fractions supported the one-to-one complex formation of the two proteins. The small amount of proteins eluted at 100 kDa may be the 2:2 complex. The excess RadA-n eluted at the same position as that of RadA-n alone. On the other hand, the wild-type RadA eluted much earlier, at the position corresponding to 520 kDa, indicating the stable self-association of the RadA proteins. We present here that RadA-c, with only the central core domain of the RecA family proteins, has basic strand exchange activity in vitro. The DNA binding ability of RadA-c was weaker than that of RadA, and probably because of its lower affinity for DNA, the ATPase activity of RadA-c was only slightly stimulated by DNA. From the gel shift assays, RadA-n does not seem to be able to form stable complexes with DNA by itself. However, the DNA-dependent ATPase activity and the strand exchange activity of RadA-c were enhanced by the addition of RadA-n into the reaction mixtures. The N-terminal domain of RadA may contribute to change the conformation of RadA-c to a more preferable form for making the nucleoprotein filament. A direct contribution of the N-terminal region in human Rad51 to the DNA binding has been proposed (46Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this case, however, the dissociation constant (K d) values to the 12-base pair double-stranded DNA and the single-stranded DNA are 0.31 and 0.89 mm, respectively, which indicate a very weak binding affinity of the N-terminal fragment of human Rad51 to DNA. A homotypic interaction (self-association) of the eukaryotic Rad51 proteins has been found (16Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Tarsounas M. Morita T. Pearlman R.E. Moens P.B. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4925-4946Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal region mediates this interaction (16Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results for the archaeal RadA, from the EM observation and the gel filtration, are consistent with the fact that the N-terminal region is important for the self-association of Rad51. For the self-association of the mouse Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins, the N-terminal truncated proteins can interact with the intact Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins, respectively (29Tarsounas M. Morita T. Pearlman R.E. Moens P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is not known, in those cases, if the truncated Rad51 or Dmc1 proteins can self-associate. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism of the self-association of the Rad51 family proteins and how the assembled structures contribute to the strand exchange activity. One interesting contrast is that RadB, with only the central core domain and 28% sequence identity (45% similarity) to RadA-c, lacks the DNA-dependent ATPase activity and the strand exchange activity. The oligopeptide with 20 amino acid residues, derived from loop 1 in the RecA protein, has strand-pairing activity by itself (41Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1996; 272: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences of this region in RadA and RadB revealed that 11 and 4 of 20 residues are similar for RadA and RadB, respectively, to the RecA sequence. The divergence of this region in RadB may reflect the lack of strand exchange activity. For the purpose of obtaining some insight into the origin of the RecA family proteins, the amino acid sequences of the RecA/Rad51 family proteins were compared in detail. Fig. 7 shows a phylogenetic tree focused on the relationship of archaeal RadA and RadB. Given the fact that genes encoding sequences homologous to RadA and RadB have been found in the genomes of all the sequenced archaea to date, RadB must have important roles, too. It is difficult to predict the function of RadB from this phylogenetic relationship of the RecA/Rad51 family proteins. However, one interesting finding from this analysis is that RadB evolved two times faster than RadA (compare the lengths of the branches in the RadA and RadB clusters in Fig. 7). To confirm the difference in the evolution rate between RadA and RadB, the nucleotide sequences of the radA and radB genes from three Pyrococcal strains were compared. Base substitutions that cause amino acid changes (nonsynonymous changes) were observed with 2–3 times higher frequency in radB than in radA,although the same level of synonymous changes occurred between the two genes (data not shown). For both genes, any number of nonsynonymous changes per site was one order less than the corresponding number of synonymous changes per site. This result suggests that RadB does not have a specific pressure stimulating amino acid substitution but is more accepting of sequence changes than RadA during evolution. If this is true, then RadA may be involved in more essential processes than RadB for the maintenance of the organism. RadB has much higher DNA binding activity than RadA-c. When RadA-n was mixed with RadB with the same condition as the reconstitution of RadA-n and RadA-c, neither DNA binding nor ATPase activity was different from those by RadB alone (data not shown). It would be interesting to compare in more detail the structural and functional differences between RadA-c and RadB. The Rad51 protein is known to interact with other proteins in the RAD52 epistasis group, and it has been suggested that the N-terminal region may be important for specific interactions with other proteins, because it is conserved in Rad51 but not in RecA. The N-terminal region of RadA may have roles in interactions with other proteins. RadA interacts with RadB, as determined in our immunoprecipitation assay. In this case, the interaction seems to be disrupted when RadA is separated into RadA-n and RadA-c (30Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33782-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To understand these specific protein-protein interactions, more detailed structure-function studies will be necessary. P. furiosus RadA is a very heat stable protein and is easy to handle and to store. Structural analyses of this archaeal RadA will contribute immensely to an understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms of the DNA strand pairing and exchange reactions. We thank Drs. J.

Mot1-catalyzed dissociation of TBP from DNA was not prevented by a psoralen cross-link positioned immediately preceding the TATA sequence.

Factors that negatively regulate eukaryotic transcription utilize a wide variety of mechanisms, including quenching of activators, promoting assembly of chromatin, recruiting chromatin-binding proteins or histone-modifying enzymes, and interfering with the general transcription machinery itself.

Another kind of negative regulator of TBP action was first identified both genetically and biochemically in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A TBP-targeted repressing activity, termed ADI for “ATP-dependent inhibitor” of TATA binding, was detected in yeast nuclear extracts (25.Auble D.T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ADI removed TBP from the TATA element of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) in an ATP-dependent manner. TFIIA, and to some extent TFIIB, inhibited ADI activity by competing for binding to TBP or by stabilizing the TBP·DNA complex, or both (25.Auble D.T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that ADI corresponded to the product of the MOT1 gene (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The MOT1 locus had been previously identified by temperature-sensitive mutations that increased basal expression of many Pol II-specific genes (27.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

The MOT1 gene was isolated by complementation of the temperature-sensitive lethality of the mot1-1 allele and encodes an 1867-residue protein (calculated at 210 kDa), which is essential for yeast cell viability (27.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The C-terminal third of the polypeptide (residues 1270–1747) bears strong sequence similarity to a domain conserved in a large superfamily of ATPases (reviewed in Ref.29.Gorbalenya E.G. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and is an efficient ATPase in vitro (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mutants defective in ATP hydrolysis in vitro are non-functionalin vivo (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This domain is characterized by seven signature motifs, including a nucleotide-binding element. Some of the members of this superfamily are demonstrated DNA or RNA helicases (reviewed in Refs. 30.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 31.Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 32.Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Mot1 is the founding member of a distinct class of these proteins (27.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), now generally referred to as the “Snf2 family” after its most well known member, S. cerevisiae Snf2/Swi2 (reviewed in Refs. 33.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 34.Peterson C.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proteins in this family, which includes representatives from bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, and man, are significantly more closely related to each other than to any other member of this ATPase superfamily. Thus, Mot1 is a novel type of TBP inhibitor, one that requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis for its action. Because of the effects of Mot1 and Snf2 on transcription and because more distantly related members of the ATPase superfamily are well characterized helicases (35.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2926-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it was originally proposed that Mot1 (27.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), Snf2 (38.Laurent B.C. Yang X. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and other members of that family (31.Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) might be DNA-dependent helicases. To date, however, no member of the Snf2 family has been shown to possess helicase activity. To assess the properties of Mot1 and to begin to explore the mechanism by which Mot1 removes TBP bound to a TATA sequence, we undertook the purification of native Mot1 from yeast cells and investigated its solution structure and catalytic properties in vitro. Here we describe this purification and analysis of Mot1 and the cumulative evidence indicating that Mot1-dependent ATP hydrolysis does not act to release TBP from DNA by a strand-unwinding mechanism. All reagent chemicals were purchased from Sigma or other appropriate commercial suppliers, as specified. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or other commercial sources. To facilitate purification of Mot1, a sequence encoding a (His)6 tract was fused to the 3′-end of the MOT1 open reading frame using a simple method for precise gene fusion based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (39.Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For this purpose, amplification was carried out under standard conditions using Taq polymerase, 10 fmol ofNotI-linearized pRSMOT1 (27.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as template, and primers CM7 (5′-AAA TTT CCA CCG CGG TGG ATT AAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAC CTC GTA AAG TTT TGA TGA-3′) and CM2 (5′-CTA GAC ATG GTT GAA AAT GA-3′). The resulting 670-bp PCR product was digested with BstXI and inserted into the BstXI sites of plasmid pKH6 (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), yielding pCM112, a URA3-marked 2 μm DNA-containing plasmid that carries MOT1-(His)6 under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The construction ofMOT1-(His)6 was verified by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR-derived DNA. The deduced C-terminal sequence of Mot1-(His)6 is -KTLR 1867GHHHHHH-COOH (authentic Mot1 residues are in boldface). S. cerevisiaestrain SC295 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 reg1-501 gal1 pep4-3) (40.Joshua-Tor L. Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. Rees D.C. Science. 1995; 269: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which is both vacuolar protease-deficient and unable to impose glucose-mediated repression, was transformed with pCM112 using a lithium acetate procedure (41.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on synthetic-complete medium containing 2% glucose (dextrose) and lacking uracil (SCD-Ura) (42.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The plasmid-bearing cells were grown to saturation in 5 ml of liquid SCD-Ura at 30 °C and used to inoculate a larger culture (250 ml) of SCD-Ura + 25 mg/ml kanamycin, which was also grown to saturation and then used as the inoculum for an 110-liter culture of SCD-Ura + 25 mg/ml kanamycin in a 200-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific). Cells were grown in the fermenter at 30 °C with vigorous aeration and stirring to anA 600 nm = 0.6, whereupon solid galactose was added to a final concentration of ∼2%, and the culture was incubated for additional 6 h. Cells were then harvested using a compressed air-driven super-centrifuge (Sharples), washed by resuspension in 500 ml of Lysis Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA), and recollected by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g. The washed cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (2 ml/g wet weight of cell paste), frozen dropwise by dripping into liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C until used. For a typical preparation, 270 g of frozen cell beads were thawed in a water bath at room temperature and then immediately placed on ice. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. A battery of protease inhibitors were added to the cell suspension (final concentration indicated) as follows: EDTA (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (1 mm), benzamidine (1 mm), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (5 μg/ml). The cell suspension was lysed by cavitation with glass beads (0.45 mm) using 10 30-s pulses, separated by 1-min intermittent periods of cooling, in a stainless steel Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) surrounded by an ice-water jacket. The lysate was decanted, and the beads were rinsed with a small volume (100 ml) of Lysis Buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and 1 mm EDTA (Lysis Buffer + PMSF + EDTA). The lysate and rinse were pooled and clarified by centrifugation at 19,600 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was decanted into fresh tubes and clarified again in the same manner. The clarified material (crude extract) was pooled, and the protein concentration was determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (43.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The crude extract was diluted to 15 mg/ml using Lysis Buffer + PMSF + EDTA and slowly adjusted to a final ammonium sulfate concentration at 25% of saturation by addition of the finely ground solid salt with stirring on ice over the course of 15 min. After equilibration with stirring for an additional 30 min, the precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 16,300 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant solution was decanted to a fresh container, additional ammonium sulfate added in a similar manner to a final concentration at 50% of saturation, and the precipitated material again collected by centrifugation. The 25–50% precipitate was redissolved in 1 liter of Binding Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 5 mm imidazole and protease inhibitors, as above, and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a column containing a bed (10 ml) of Ni2+-iminodiacetate-agarose (His-Bind™, Novagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with Binding Buffer containing 5 mmimidazole. The flow-through was reloaded at the same flow rate and then collected. The column was washed and eluted with Binding Buffer plus increasing concentrations of imidazole in a stepwise fashion, as follows: four 20-ml washes of 5 mm imidazole, five 20-ml fractions of 20 mm imidazole, two 20-ml fractions of 40 mm imidazole, and three 10-ml fractions of 500 mm imidazole. The majority of the Mot1-(His)6eluted in the 40 and 500 mm imidazole fractions. The 40 and 500 mm eluates were pooled separately, placed in dialysis tubing (SpectraPor), and dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and then against Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). The dialysates were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration under N2 gas in a stirred pressure cell (Amicon) fitted with a YM30 Diaflo membrane (Amicon) to a protein concentration of 0.64 mg/ml. The protein was quantitatively precipitated by addition of ground ammonium sulfate to a final concentration at 85% of saturation and collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 17,300 × g. The pellet was redissolved in 2.5 ml of Buffer A, and the insoluble particulate material was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf). The redissolved material was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an FPLC apparatus (Waters) onto a column (Hi-Prep 16/60) containing a bed of a size-exclusion resin (Sephacryl S-300HR; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was eluted with Buffer A, and fractions (2 ml) were collected. The elution position of Mot1-(His)6 was detected using a flow-cell, UV monitor, and chart recorder and confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and by immunoblotting using specific rabbit polyclonal anti-Mot1 antibodies (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments were performed with the peak fractions eluted from the size-exclusion column, unless otherwise indicated. Globular protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were purchased as lyophilized powders and resuspended individually, or as a mixture, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml each in either Buffer A or Buffer A containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. The standards were loaded in a volume of 2 ml at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an FPLC apparatus (Waters) onto a column (Hi-Prep 16/60) containing a bed of a size-exclusion resin (Sephacryl S-300-HR; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with the same buffers. The column was eluted with the same buffers, and 2-ml fractions were collected. Elution position of each protein standard was monitored both by an in-line UV detector and by spectrophotometric analysis of corresponding fractions. Elution volumes of the standards were used to construct a selectivity curve (K av versus logM r). After calibration with the standards in each of the two different buffers, purified Mot1-(His)6(Ni2+-iminodiacetate-agarose eluate) was loaded onto the calibrated column in the same volume at the same flow rate and eluted. The fractions obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and by immunoblotting to determine the elution volume of Mot1-(His)6. Solutions of 20, 15, 10, and 5% sucrose (w/v) in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) were layered sequentially into upright 13 × 51-mm Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (Beckman), then equilibrated at 4 °C for 4 h in a horizontal position, and returned to an upright position, thereby generating a linear 5–20% sucrose gradient. Fractions from representative tubes were collected and analyzed using a refractometer to confirm the linearity of the gradients (data not shown). Lyophilized globular protein standards were resuspended in Buffer B at 1 mg/ml and mixed with purified Mot1 (Sephacryl S-300-HR eluate), either individually, in pairs, or all together. Samples (150 μl) of the protein solution were layered on top of four separate gradients and then subjected to centrifugation in an SW-55Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm (250,000 × g atr avg) for 6 h at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman L8–80M), which was allowed to decelerate without braking. Fractions (100 μl) were collected from each tube using an automated apparatus (model 640 Density Gradient Fractionator, ISCO), and the positions of the proteins were determined by UV spectrometry (for hemoglobin, λmax = 555 nm), by protein assay (for catalase and aldolase), and SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (for Mot1-(His)6). Yeast strain BJ2168 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2 trp1 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407) (44.Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) was transformed with 2 μm DNA-containing plasmids expressing MOT1-myc (pKH7) (45.Hansen K. Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of Mot1 and Its Interaction with Components of the Basal Transcription Complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar) and either MOT1-(His) 6 (pCM112) or untaggedMOT1 (pKH6) (45.Hansen K. Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of Mot1 and Its Interaction with Components of the Basal Transcription Complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar). Cells were grown in an appropriate selective medium and induced for 2 h by the addition of galactose (2% final concentration). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in Binding Buffer. Extracts were prepared immediately thereafter by vigorous vortex mixing with glass beads and, after clarification, were loaded in parallel onto Ni2+-iminodiacetate-agarose columns. The columns were washed with the same buffer, then eluted using the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (20, 40, 60, and 500 mm), and then stripped with Binding Buffer + 100 mm EDTA. Proteins present in the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an appropriate antibody. The construction of a plasmid that expresses the catalytically active C-terminal ATPase domain of Mot1 (Mot1C) inEscherichia coli and purification of this fragment of the enzyme from this source have been described previously (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Likewise, full-length yeast TBP (SPT15 gene product) was expressed inE. coli and purified by a procedure described in detail elsewhere (46.Adamkewicz J.I. Biochemical and Genetic Analysis of Mot1, A Regulator of Basal Transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1999Google Scholar). Samples of Mot1-(His)6(765 ng) or Mot1C (700 ng) in Buffer A containing 10% glycerol, or an equal volume of the same buffer, were incubated, in duplicate, in a total volume of 50 μl containing 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.25 mm [α-32P]ATP (20 μCi/mmol), and 50 mm HEPES (and/or other buffering species adjusted to the pH value indicated in the experiments shown) with or without added salt at the concentrations indicated in the experiments shown. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and terminated by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 100 mm EDTA. Products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and scintillation counting as described before (26.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When present, yeast TBP purified from E. coli was added in the amounts indicated; likewise, when present, “TATA DNA” was added as a 28-base oligonucleotide containing the sequence of the TATA element of the AdMLP (5′-CCT GAA GGG GGG CTA TAA AAG GGG GTG G-3′), which was generated by chemical synthesis, and used either in single-stranded (ssDNA) or double-stranded (dsDNA) form, the latter of which was prepared by annealing to a perfectly complementary oligonucleotide. The universal template for each substrate was a circular single-stranded phage DNA containing the complement of a TATA box. To prepare this molecule, a 101-bpEcoRI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pRW2 (47.Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contains the AdMLP TATA sequence was inserted into the corresponding sites of the replicative form of M13mp18, yielding plasmid pKH50. Progeny single-stranded phage DNA was isolated from E. colicells infected with pKH50 using precipitation with polyethylene glycol according to standard procedures (48.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A helicase substrate with a flush-ended double-helical region was prepared by annealing the circular phage DNA with the perfectly complementary 28-base TATA DNA oligonucleotide. Helicase substrates with 5′- and 3′-single-stranded tails were prepared by annealing the circular phage DNA with oligonucleotides “5′-TATA” and “3′-TATA”, which were otherwise identical to the TATA DNA oligonucleotide, except that each contained an additional 10-base, non-complementary, overhanging sequence at its 5′- or 3′-end, respectively. The oligonucleotides were labeled using two different strategies. The TATA DNA and 5′-TATA oligonucleotides were labeled at their 3′-ends, as follows. The single-stranded template (1 pmol) was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide, heated to 85 °C, and cooled slowly to room temperature on the benchtop. To the annealed substrate, 20 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP (3 Ci/μmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 10 units of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (New England BioLabs) were added in a buffer (60 μl total volume) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 6.67 mm DTT. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then reaction was terminated by extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The “3′-TATA” oligonucleotide was labeled at its 5′-end using [α-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol; NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Bio-Labs), as recommended by the manufacturer, and the reaction was terminated by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Thereafter, a 10-fold molar excess of the labeled 3′-TATA oligonucleotide was mixed with 1 pmol of the single-stranded template, heated to 85 °C, and cooled slowly to room temperature. All three annealed substrates were separated from unincorporated label by gel filtration over a bed (1 ml) of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in TE Buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,"

Significantly, these studies, which employed N-terminal sequence, mass spectral, proteolytic, immunological, and functional analyses, led to the following novel findings. First, at the top of F1 within F0F1, all six N-terminal regions derived from α + β subunits are shielded, indicating that one or more F0 subunits forms a “cap.” Second, at the bottom of F1 within F0F1, the N-terminal region of the single δ subunit and the C-terminal regions of all three α subunits are shielded also by F0. Third, and in contrast, part of the γ subunit located at the bottom of F1 is already shielded in F1, indicating that there is a preferential propensity for interaction with other F1 subunits, most likely δ and ε. Fourth, and consistent with the first two conclusions above that specific regions at the top and bottom of F1 are shielded by F0, further proteolytic shaving of α and β subunits at these locations eliminates the capacity of F1 to couple a proton gradient to ATP synthesis.

In contrast, the subunit source of the ring-like disc or “collar” surrounding the central stalk in animal ATP synthases (11Karrash S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) remains unknown. Nature's rationale for providing ATP synthases with this unique molecular architecture has become apparent only in recent studies where evidence that these fascinating enzymes contain two motors has been mounting (31Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 32Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). One of the proposed motors is F1, which is driven by ATP binding and/or hydrolysis (31Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), whereas the other is contained within F0 and driven by a proton gradient (33Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Osmote H. Iwamato-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). During ATP synthesis, the proposed motor within F0, composed of 10–12 subunit c molecules (30Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 34Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure. 1999; 7: R67-R72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) via a central rotor, the F1-γ subunit. This subunit extends from a ring of subunit c molecules in the F0 basepiece (19Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), through the central stalk region, and finally through the center of F1 where it interacts differently with each of the three αβ pairs (26Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 27Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Udea T. Sekimato Y. Kambara M.

A. 1999; 96: 13697-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). During one 360° rotation of the γ subunit, the binding of ADP and inorganic phosphate, the synthesis of ATP, and the release of this ATP are believed to occur on each αβ pair as proposed by the “binding change mechanism” (2Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 714-749Crossref Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 36Cross R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 681-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). During this process, the ε subunit in bacteria, or its δ subunit equivalent in animals, is also believed to rotate (32Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), presumably at the bottom of F1 within the central stalk region. Although much has been learned about the structure and function of ATP synthases as summarized above, a three-dimensional structure has not been obtained for the complete enzyme (F0F1) from any source. In fact, of the 16 different subunit types within the mitochondrial ATP synthase of animal cells, only two and a half of these (α, β, and about half of γ) have been solved at atomic resolution (26Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 28Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Consequently, there are still many important questions that remain unanswered about structure/function relationships in ATP synthases, and how, within these remarkably complex machines, energy coupling between the proposed proton gradient-driven motor within F0 is coupled to the reversal of the ATP-driven F1 motor. Specifically, one important question relates to the identity of exterior subunit regions at the top and bottom of F1 that are shielded by F0 in the complete ATP synthase, because these regions may include F0/F1 contact sites essential for energy coupling during ATP synthesis. Although information about these regions, particularly at or near the top of F1, is gradually being generated for the Escherichia coli and chloroplast enzymes (12Wilkens S. Zhou J. Nakayama R. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Lill H. Hensel F. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), little information is available for animal ATP synthases. In studies reported below, we used a variety of approaches to identify exterior subunit regions at the top and bottom of rat liver F1 that are shielded by F0. We then assessed the requirement of these regions for coupling a proton gradient to ATP synthesis. In addition, we obtained evidence for the involvement of an F0 subunit unique to animal ATP synthases. Rats (Harlan Sprague-DawleyCD, white males) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. ATP, MgCl2, 2EDTA, DTT,1 tricine, Sephadex G-25 (coarse), soybean trypsin inhibitor, oligomycin, and DCCD were from Sigma. SDS, acrylamide, and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad, PVDF membranes from Millipore, and Western blot reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Modified trypsin (sequencing grade), pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The detergent CHAPS was obtained from Anatrace, whereas sucrose, urea, and potassium phosphate were from J.T. Baker. Coomassie Blue dye binding reagent for protein determination was from Pierce, AEBSF was from Calbiochem, and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid were from Aldrich. Centriprep filtration units for protein concentration were from Amicon. Venturicidin was from BDH Chemicals. The antibodies to F0 components were generous gifts from Drs. Y. Hatefi and Akemi Matsuno Yagi. All other products were of the highest purity or grade commercially available. This complex was purified from rat liver mitochondria by a modification of a previously described method developed in this laboratory (6McEnery M.W. Buhle Jr., E.L. Aebi U. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4642-4651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A washed submitochondrial particle fraction, referred to previously as 3X membranes (6McEnery M.W. Buhle Jr., E.L. Aebi U. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4642-4651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was stored at ∼15 mg/ml and −20 °C in TA buffer (50 mm Tricine, 1 mm ATP, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% ethylene glycol, pH 7.9), thawed, and solubilized at 4 mg/ml in 0.6% CHAPS for l h on ice with occasional stirring. After centrifugation for 1 h at 48,000 rpm at 4 °C in a 70.1-Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima LE 80K ultracentrifuge to remove unsolubilized material, the supernatant was concentrated using Amicon's Centriprep filtration unit (molecular mass cutoff = 50 kDa). The concentrate was diluted with TA buffer to give a CHAPS concentration of 0.1% and frozen in dry ice and ethanol, and then stored at −20 °C for 3 h. The sample (∼20 ml) was then thawed, and 5-ml aliquots (2.0–2.5 mg/ml) were placed on 20 ml of 25% sucrose in TA buffer without CHAPS and centrifuged 12 h and 45 min at 4 °C in the same centrifuge described above but using the SW-28 rotor. The pellet, F0F1 (7–10 mg/ml), judged to be >90% pure, was stored at −80 °C in TA buffer. The specific activity was 14–15 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed × min−1 × mg−1 protein based on the ATPase and protein assays described below. F1 with a specific activity of about 25 μmol × min−1 × mg−1 in TrisCl buffer was purified from isolated rat liver mitochondria exactly as described by Catterall and Pedersen (37Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with one modification. The terminal Sephadex G-200 step was replaced by chromatography on a 2.1- × 13-cm Sephadex G-25 column packed on top of a 1.5-cm layer of sea sand and a 1-cm layer of glass wool. It was then stored or prepared for use as described by Ko et al. (38Ko Y.H. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out exactly as described previously by Pedersen and Hullihen (39Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2176-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove the N-terminally blocked group on the α subunit, F0F1 (1 mg/ml) was placed in a 200 μl of digestion buffer containing 100 mm sodium Pi, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.6% CHAPS, and pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (0.019 mg/ml). The enzyme was then incubated in this mixture first for 12 h at 4 °C and then for 2 h at 25 °C, after which the entire reaction mixture was added to SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The α subunit band was then subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis exactly as described below. F1 and F0F1 (each 160 μg) were subjected to digestion for various incubation times at 25 °C in a final volume of 0.1 ml containing 250 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 μg of trypsin. Trypsin inhibitor (50 μg), or AEBSF at a final concentration of 5 mm, was then added at various incubation times to stop the reaction. Following the addition of ammonium sulfate to the mixture to give 65% saturation, the resultant suspension was centrifuged at 13, 000 rpm in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor for 1 h at 25 °C. ATPase activity was assayed exactly as described previously (37Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a spectrophotometric procedure in which ADP formed was coupled to the pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase reactions. ATP synthesis was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 25 °C by coupling the production of ATP to the reduction of NADP+ via the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reactions. The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 10 mmpotassium Pi, 10 mm succinate, 50 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm glucose, 1 mmNADP+, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine albumin, 200 mm sucrose, 20 IU hexokinase, 0.25 IU glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 100–200 μg of inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm ADP. This was carried out as indicated either by the method of Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or the more sensitive method of Schägger and von Jagow (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) for separating proteins in the molecular mass range of from 1 to 100 kDa. After conducting SDS-PAGE, the proteins on the gel were transferred electrophoretically at 4 °C in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol transfer buffer, pH 11, onto a PVDF membrane (1 h at 100 V and 0.2 amp). The membrane was then blocked for l h with 2% bovine albumin plus 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline T buffer (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5), incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with polyclonal antibodies as indicated in the figure legends, and then further incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG). The immunoreactive bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. Mass spectra were acquired on samples of 10–20 pmol in a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager MALDI-TOF-DE mass spectrometer using a nitrogen laser (wavelength 337 nm). The matrix was either 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid. Positive ion mass spectra were analyzed using PerSeptive GRAMS software version 3.01c. F1 or F0 subunits were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels onto PVDF membranes by electroblotting. Transfer conditions were for 1 h in 10 mm CAPS buffer, 10% methanol, pH 11, at 4 °C. The peptides were then excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (42Edman P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencing system (43Hunkapillar M.W. Hood L.E. Science. 1983; 219: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Three different methods were used to determine protein, Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), biuret (45Jacobs E.E. Jacobs M. Sanadi D.R. Bradley L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Coomassie dye (Pierce). In all cases bovine albumin was used as the standard. The first objective of this study was to identify exterior regions on F1 that are shielded by F0 within a fully active, complete ATP synthase (F0F1) preparation from an animal mitochondrial source. The regions on F1 of most interest (Fig.1 A) were its top where the N-terminal regions of α and β subunits reside (26Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the δ subunit (25Pan W. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6911-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), and likely also the ε subunit. The second objective was to assess the importance of these regions for coupling an electrochemical proton gradient to ATP synthesis. This information is generally lacking for animal ATP synthases, which are much more complex in their F0 subunit composition than related enzymes from E. coli and chloroplasts. The third objective was to identify at least one F0 subunit unique to the animal enzyme involved in shielding F1, because such a subunit would represent a candidate for part of the stator or second stalk believed to stabilize the F1 motor. To complete these objectives, it was essential to have at hand, in addition to our extensively studied rat liver F1 preparation (25Pan W. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6911-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1978; 253: 2176-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an intact, highly purified preparation of the complete ATP synthase from the same source. This was accomplished by introducing several modifications (see “Methods”) into the CHAPS-based procedure previously developed in this laboratory (6McEnery M.W. Buhle Jr., E.L. Aebi U. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4642-4651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant preparation exhibits a specific activity of 14–15 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed × min−1× mg−1 protein, contains all 16 subunits (Fig.1 B) previously reported for the bovine heart ATP synthase (20Belogrudov G.I. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20340-20345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and is markedly inhibited by oligomycin, DCCD, and venturicidin (Fig. 1 C), agents known to bind to F0 (46Sebald W.

The ribbon representation of the F1 structure was constructed using the atomic coordinates of the rat liver enzyme (1mab (28Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The α-helical, β-sheet, and loop structures are colored in green, yellow, and purple, respectively. Nucleotides are shown in red. Regions examined in this study are located at the top and bottom of F1. These include the N-terminal regions of the α and β subunits (top) and the C-terminal regions of these same subunits (bottom), together with the central stalk (“stem”) region (bottom). The central stalk region includes two sections, one that projects about 20 Å out of the F1headpiece as revealed by x-ray crystallography (28Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Regions of the γ subunit that were resolved by crystallography include residues 4–48, 209–273, and 77–90 (28Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The δ subunit (not shown) is believed to be located also within the region of the central stalk, both on the basis of biochemical studies (25Pan W. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L.

Using a model-based site-directed mutagenesis strategy, we have identified residues of the mouse γc extracellular domain that are required for normal γc-dependent enhancement of IL-2 and IL-7 binding. One of these sites, Tyr-103, is homologous to key ligand-interacting residues in the growth hormone and erythropoietin receptors, whereas Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 may function indirectly by maintaining the functional conformation of γc via formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. These two cysteines are also required for the integrity of a putative epitope recognized by TUGm2, an antagonistic monoclonal antibody that blocks γc-dependent cytokine binding and bioactivity. These results are consistent with the involvement of three predicted loops in γc that contribute to the binding of both IL-2 and IL-7.

Our data suggest that IL-2 and IL-7 binding are dependent on overlapping regions of the mγc ectodomain that include at least three distinct putative loop segments of the γc structure.DISCUSSIONThe development of molecular models for the interactions of γc with several of its cognate cytokines (14Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Gustchina A. Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) provides a conceptual framework to investigate the structural basis of the role of γc in ligand binding. We have used this information and performed extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the extracellular region of mγc to identify residues involved in receptor-ligand interactions in the context of the IL-2R and IL-7R.All models have excluded the first 34 residues of γc because this region shows no homology to other members of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily. Our data directly demonstrate that this portion of γc is dispensable for IL-2 and IL-7 binding. All γc models also predicted that Tyr-103 is necessary for the binding of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, and our data support this hypothesis. Substitutions of Tyr-103 to either alanine or arginine partially decreased IL-2 and IL-7 binding to their receptors, although mγc surface expression and the binding of three distinct anti-mγc mAbs remained unaffected. These data suggest that Tyr-103 is not critical for folding, in agreement with its predicted location in the EF1 loop of γc. Because Tyr-103 is homologous to known receptor-ligand contact sites in the GHR (Trp-104) (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) and EPOR (Phe-93) (24Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we propose that this mγc residue is directly involved in the binding of IL-2 and IL-7.A second functionally important region of mγc has been localized to residues Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211, of which mutations resulted in severe inhibition of γc-dependent IL-2 and IL-7 binding. These mutations also consistently resulted in low surface expression of mγc, probably because of erroneous folding and/or decreased protein stability. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis of ligand binding as a function of mγc surface expression suggests that it is highly unlikely that the loss of γc-specific cytokine binding was simply due to this poor expression. The functional importance of this region is further highlighted by the involvement of residues 158–162 and 210–211 in a putative discontinuous epitope for the anti-mγc mAb TUGm2 that blocks the binding of all γc-dependent cytokines (7Kondo M. Takeshita T. Higuchi M. Nakamura M. Sudo T. Nishikawa S. Sugamura K. Science. 1994; 263: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S.

Immunol. 1995; 7: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Epitope-mapping studies of the antagonistic PC.B8 mAb that reacts with a discontinuous site on human γc are also consistent with a role for this region of γc in cytokine binding (26Raskin N. Jakubowski A. Sizing I.D. Olson D.L. Kalled S.L. Hession C.A. Benjamin C.D. Baker D.P. Burkly L.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Because Cys-161, Leu-162, Cys-210, and Gly-211 are conserved in all known mammalian γc sequences, it is highly unlikely that these residues function directly in antibody specificity but may rather control the local conformation of the epitope. It should also be stressed that receptors carrying the conservative mutations C161S and C210S were just as impaired in their ability to bind IL-2 or IL-7 as those with substitutions to alanine. One plausible interpretation of this result is that Cys-161 and Cys-211 are required for both structural and functional integrity of mγc via the formation of a disulfide bond connecting the BC2 and FG2 loops of the C domain. In fact, the most recent structural model of γc (16Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) predicted the formation of such an intrachain disulfide bond, based on an improved sequence alignment between human γc (hγc) and GHR. Alternatively, we cannot rule out a direct participation of either of these cysteines in ligand binding because other models predicted interactions between cytokine residues and backbone atoms of Cys-160 in the hγc (14Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Gustchina A. Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A. Proteins. 1995; 21: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To date, more than 90 naturally occurring mutations have been identified in the human γc gene of X-SCID patients, of which at least 42 were missense mutations affecting extracellular residues (27Puck J.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 507-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, only a few of these mutants have been characterized in terms of γc expression and function. Our study opens the way for a better understanding of this rich reservoir of data. Importantly all human counterparts of the mγc residues Tyr-103, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 have been implicated in X-SCID. Interestingly although our mutations of the mγc Tyr-103 only partially affected ligand binding, the Y103N substitution in humans resulted in immunodeficiency, suggesting a critical role of this residue in cytokine signal transduction. Numerous X-SCID sites were localized to the BC2 and FG2 loops of hγc (C160R, L161R, F205C, L209P, C209Y, G210Y, mutations of the WS XWS motif) supporting the functional significance of this region. In addition, several X-SCID mutations in the C domain of hγc were substitutions to cysteine (R200C, R204C, F205C, and W240C), consistent with a role of disulfide bond formation in the C domain of γc.The functional region composed of the EF1, BC2, and FG2 loops of mγc shows numerous similarities with other type I cytokine receptors. For example, critical ligand binding sites have been found in the corresponding loops of GHR (28Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

Our results suggest that the binding interface of mγc may have a similar organization. Importantly Tyr-103 of mγc is homologous to critical ligand binding sites located in the hydrophobic clusters of GHR (Trp-104) (28Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

Moreover, in the γc model that is most consistent with our data (16Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the human equivalents of Leu-102, Tyr-103, Gly-211, and the disulfide-linked Cys-161 and Cys-211 form a hydrophobic cluster that may interact with the cytokines.

Therefore, it is not surprising that although 31 residues of the mγc have been analyzed, only the mutations of four residues had significant effects on γc-dependent cytokine binding.The functional sites identified by us are not necessarily hot spots of γc-ligand interaction. Although Tyr-103 was important, none of the mutations in the N domain abrogated ligand binding. On the other hand, the residues in the C domain may have a structural role rather than act as contact residues. Thus, other amino acids with key functions in cytokine binding may exist elsewhere in the γc. In this regard it is interesting to note that we have not identified an epitope for the 4G3 mAb that blocks the binding of IL-2 and IL-7 to mγc (19He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar). We have also not found unique contact residues used by individual cytokines although such cytokine-specific interactions have been suggested, e.g. for the binding of IL-4 (19He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether the mγc residues identified in this study are also required for the binding of IL-4 or other γc-dependent cytokines. The common γ chain (γc)1 is a member of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily and functions as a shared subunit of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (reviewed in Refs. 1He Y.W.

Our data suggest that IL-2 and IL-7 binding are dependent on overlapping regions of the mγc ectodomain that include at least three distinct putative loop segments of the γc structure. DISCUSSIONThe development of molecular models for the interactions of γc with several of its cognate cytokines (14Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Gustchina A. Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A. Proteins. 1995; 21: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) provides a conceptual framework to investigate the structural basis of the role of γc in ligand binding. We have used this information and performed extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the extracellular region of mγc to identify residues involved in receptor-ligand interactions in the context of the IL-2R and IL-7R.All models have excluded the first 34 residues of γc because this region shows no homology to other members of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily. Our data directly demonstrate that this portion of γc is dispensable for IL-2 and IL-7 binding. All γc models also predicted that Tyr-103 is necessary for the binding of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, and our data support this hypothesis. Substitutions of Tyr-103 to either alanine or arginine partially decreased IL-2 and IL-7 binding to their receptors, although mγc surface expression and the binding of three distinct anti-mγc mAbs remained unaffected. These data suggest that Tyr-103 is not critical for folding, in agreement with its predicted location in the EF1 loop of γc. Because Tyr-103 is homologous to known receptor-ligand contact sites in the GHR (Trp-104) (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) and EPOR (Phe-93) (24Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we propose that this mγc residue is directly involved in the binding of IL-2 and IL-7.A second functionally important region of mγc has been localized to residues Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211, of which mutations resulted in severe inhibition of γc-dependent IL-2 and IL-7 binding. These mutations also consistently resulted in low surface expression of mγc, probably because of erroneous folding and/or decreased protein stability. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis of ligand binding as a function of mγc surface expression suggests that it is highly unlikely that the loss of γc-specific cytokine binding was simply due to this poor expression. The functional importance of this region is further highlighted by the involvement of residues 158–162 and 210–211 in a putative discontinuous epitope for the anti-mγc mAb TUGm2 that blocks the binding of all γc-dependent cytokines (7Kondo M. Takeshita T. Higuchi M. Nakamura M. Sudo T. Nishikawa S. Sugamura K. Science. 1994; 263: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S.

Immunol. 1995; 7: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Epitope-mapping studies of the antagonistic PC.B8 mAb that reacts with a discontinuous site on human γc are also consistent with a role for this region of γc in cytokine binding (26Raskin N. Jakubowski A. Sizing I.D. Olson D.L. Kalled S.L. Hession C.A. Benjamin C.D. Baker D.P. Burkly L.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Because Cys-161, Leu-162, Cys-210, and Gly-211 are conserved in all known mammalian γc sequences, it is highly unlikely that these residues function directly in antibody specificity but may rather control the local conformation of the epitope. It should also be stressed that receptors carrying the conservative mutations C161S and C210S were just as impaired in their ability to bind IL-2 or IL-7 as those with substitutions to alanine. One plausible interpretation of this result is that Cys-161 and Cys-211 are required for both structural and functional integrity of mγc via the formation of a disulfide bond connecting the BC2 and FG2 loops of the C domain. In fact, the most recent structural model of γc (16Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) predicted the formation of such an intrachain disulfide bond, based on an improved sequence alignment between human γc (hγc) and GHR. Alternatively, we cannot rule out a direct participation of either of these cysteines in ligand binding because other models predicted interactions between cytokine residues and backbone atoms of Cys-160 in the hγc (14Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Gustchina A. Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A. Proteins. 1995; 21: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To date, more than 90 naturally occurring mutations have been identified in the human γc gene of X-SCID patients, of which at least 42 were missense mutations affecting extracellular residues (27Puck J.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 507-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, only a few of these mutants have been characterized in terms of γc expression and function. Our study opens the way for a better understanding of this rich reservoir of data. Importantly all human counterparts of the mγc residues Tyr-103, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 have been implicated in X-SCID. Interestingly although our mutations of the mγc Tyr-103 only partially affected ligand binding, the Y103N substitution in humans resulted in immunodeficiency, suggesting a critical role of this residue in cytokine signal transduction. Numerous X-SCID sites were localized to the BC2 and FG2 loops of hγc (C160R, L161R, F205C, L209P, C209Y, G210Y, mutations of the WS XWS motif) supporting the functional significance of this region. In addition, several X-SCID mutations in the C domain of hγc were substitutions to cysteine (R200C, R204C, F205C, and W240C), consistent with a role of disulfide bond formation in the C domain of γc.The functional region composed of the EF1, BC2, and FG2 loops of mγc shows numerous similarities with other type I cytokine receptors. For example, critical ligand binding sites have been found in the corresponding loops of GHR (28Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

Therefore, it is not surprising that although 31 residues of the mγc have been analyzed, only the mutations of four residues had significant effects on γc-dependent cytokine binding.The functional sites identified by us are not necessarily hot spots of γc-ligand interaction. Although Tyr-103 was important, none of the mutations in the N domain abrogated ligand binding. On the other hand, the residues in the C domain may have a structural role rather than act as contact residues. Thus, other amino acids with key functions in cytokine binding may exist elsewhere in the γc. In this regard it is interesting to note that we have not identified an epitope for the 4G3 mAb that blocks the binding of IL-2 and IL-7 to mγc (19He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2080919449,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator Tat is a potent activator of transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat and is essential for efficient viral gene expression and replication. Tat has been shown to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery and transcriptional activators. Here we identify the cellular coactivator PC4 as a Tat-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed this interaction both in vitro and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that this interaction has a functional outcome in that PC4 overexpression enhanced activation of the HIV long terminal repeat in transient transfection studies in a Tat-dependent manner. The domains of PC4 and Tat required for the interaction were mapped. In vitro binding studies showed that the basic transactivation-responsive binding domain of Tat is required for the interaction with PC4. The minimum region of PC4 required for Tat binding was amino acids 22–91, whereas mutation of the lysine-rich domain between amino acids 22 and 43 prevented interaction with Tat. Tat-PC4 interactions may be controlled by phosphorylation, because phosphorylation of PC4 by casein kinase II inhibited interactions with Tat both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that PC4 may be involved in linking Tat to the basal transcription machinery. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator Tat is a potent activator of transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat and is essential for efficient viral gene expression and replication. Tat has been shown to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery and transcriptional activators. Here we identify the cellular coactivator PC4 as a Tat-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed this interaction both in vitro and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that this interaction has a functional outcome in that PC4 overexpression enhanced activation of the HIV long terminal repeat in transient transfection studies in a Tat-dependent manner.

Tat expression is essential for HIV viral replication, because Tat defective viruses are unable to replicate or express viral proteins efficiently (1.Dayton A.I. Sodroski J.G. Rosen C.A. Goh W.C.

Debouk C. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1986; 320: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Tat-responsive region of the HIV LTR has been mapped to an element immediately downstream of the transcription start site (3.Muesing M.A. Smith D.H. Capon D.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 691-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4.Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Tat is unusual in that it is targetted to the promoter by binding to a 59-nucleotide stem-loop structure in the nascent RNA called the transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, which is found at the 5′ end of all HIV viral RNAs (5.Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M. Skinner M.A. Valerio R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although Tat has been demonstrated to have effects on transcriptional initiation (9.Laspia M.F. Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), it differs from conventional activators in that its primary effect appears to be on transcriptional elongation (9.Laspia M.F. Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10.Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Goh W.C. Dayton A.I. Lippke J. Haseltine W.A.

In the absence of Tat, short prematurely terminated RNA transcripts are produced, but Tat appears to modify RNA polymerase II to a form that elongates more efficiently (12.Kato H. Sumimoto H. Pognonec P. Chen C. Rosen C.A. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently a mechanism has been established to explain how Tat promotes transcriptional elongation. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II by cellular kinases marks the transition from an initiation complex to an efficiently elongating polymerase complex, and a primary role of Tat appears to be to recruit such kinases. Tat targets two cyclin-dependent kinases, cdk7, the kinase component of TFIIH, and cdk9, the kinase component of positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb), which together are proposed to hyperphosphorylate RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Refs. 13.Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 14.Yankulov K. Bentley D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R447-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tat, through its activation domain, interacts with the general transcription factor, TFIIH (15.Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and stimulates the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II by its kinase component, cdk7 (16.Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17.Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation domain of Tat interacts with the cyclin T component of pTEFb, forming a complex with high affinity for the TAR element and recruiting the cdk9 component of pTEFb, which can phosphorylate RNA polymerase II (18.Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is therefore proposed that Tat stimulates hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by recruiting cdk7 and cdk9 and thus creates a highly efficient and processive RNA polymerase II complex. However, Tat has been shown to interact with a wide range of cellular proteins, and it is unclear how these interactions fit into the above model of Tat transactivation. For example, Tat is found complexed to components of the basal machinery such as the core RNA polymerase II itself (21.Mavankal G. Ou S.H.I. Oliver H. Sigman D. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22.Cujec T.P. Cho H. Maldonado E. Meyer J. Reinberg D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID (23.Kashanchi F. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Duvall J.F. Fattaey A. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Brady J.N. Nature. 1994; 367: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,24.Veschambre P. Simard P. Jalinot P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 7: 169-180Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the TFIID associated factor, TAFII55 (25.Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Replication of the HIV virus is regulated by both viral and cellular proteins, and Tat also functions in concert with cellular transcription factors, which bind to and activate the HIV LTR. For example, the core region of the HIV LTR contains three SP1-binding sites. Tat, via its basic domain, interacts with SP1 (26.Jeang K.T. Chun R. Lin N.H. Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction has been shown to enhance phosphorylation of SP1 by double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (27.Chun, R. F., Semmes, O. J., Neuveut, C., and Jeang, K. T. (1998) 72, 2615–2629Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of SP1 has been correlated to enhanced HIV LTR function. The enhancer region of the HIV LTR contains binding sites for transcription factors such as NF-KB, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and activator protein 1. This region includes a tandem NF-KB repeat, which is essential for viral replication and gene expression (28.Alcami J. de Lera T.L. Folgueira L. Pedraza M. Jacque J. Bachelerie F. Noriega A.R. Hay R.T. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B. Virelizier J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1552-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Maximal activation of the HIV LTR results from the co-operative actions of Tat and the NF-KB proteins, which bind to these elements (29.Liu J. Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells, which has been shown to compete with NF-KB for occupancy of these sites, interacts directly with the N-terminal region of Tat and represses Tat activation of the HIV LTR (30.Macian F. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tat via its basic domain has been shown to interact with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (31.Hottiger M.O. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Benkarine M. Chun R.F. Xiao X. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which may serve to complex Tat with the basal transcription machinery. These coactivators are also associated with histone acetylation and chromatin remodelling. Other cellular cofactors may also interact with Tat and mediate interactions with the transcription machinery or enhancer complex. In fact, there are presently several other cellular proteins of unknown function that have been isolated as Tat interactors (33.Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34.Yu L. Zhang A. Lowenstein P.M. Desai K. Tang Q. Mao D. Symington J.S. Grenn M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Goebl M. Taniguchi T. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1992; 357: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36.Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for cellular proteins in CD28 activated T cells that might interact with Tat and modulate its function. There is recent evidence that Tat may modify T cell gene expression through the CD28 costimulatory receptor signaling pathway (37.Ott M. Emiliani S. Lint C.V. Herbein G. Lovett J. Chirmule N. McClosky T. Pahwa S. Verdin E. Science. 1997; 275: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38.Ott M. Lovett J.L. Mueller L. Verdin E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2872-2880PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore CD28 activated cells may have unique Tat-interacting proteins. We isolated a transcriptional cofactor known as PC4 (positive cofactor 4) in this screen. We have demonstrated a specific interaction between Tat and PC4 and identified the regions of the proteins involved. In addition we have shown a functional consequence of this interaction on transcription from the HIV LTR. Yeast two-hybrid plasmids, pEG202, pSH18-34, pJG4–5 and the yeast strain EGY48 were donated by Dr. R. Brent and have been described previously (39.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Tat (amino acids 1–86) was amplified by PCR from the clone pCDM-Tat (40.Peng H. Reinhart T.A. Retzel E.F. Staskus K.A. Zupancic M. Haase A.T. Virology. 1995; 206: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and ligated into pEG202 in frame and C-terminal to the LexA DNA-binding domain, usingEcoRI and XhoI sites generated in the PCR, forming pEG-Tat86. Similarly, Tat86 was ligated into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in frame with the bacterial glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene to generate the plasmid pGEX-Tat86. The deletion constructs GST-Tat 1–48, 49–86, and 1–57 were generated similarly, by cloning the respective PCR products into pGEX-4T-1. GST-Tat Basic and Tat 1–57Basic were generated using PCR products amplified from pDex-Tat K/R (50.Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M.

J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX-Myb was provided by Dr. T. Gonda and has been described previously (pGEX2TK-NRD2, 42). PC4 cDNA was released from the library vector pJG4.5 by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) to generate SG5-PC4. PC4 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pSG5 in the reverse orientation to generate SG5-αPC4. The N-terminal 1–62 amino acids and C-terminal 63–127 amino acids of PC4 (see Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR from pJG-PC4 and ligated into RcCMV (Invitrogen) to generate the constructs CMV-PC4NT and CMV-PC4CT, respectively. Tat86 was amplified by PCR from pCDM-Tat and ligated into RcCMV in frame and N-terminal to a synthetic influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag using HindIII andSacII sites generated by the PCR to produce the construct CMV-TatHA. PC4 was amplified from pJG-PC4 and ligated into RcCMV in frame and N-terminal to a synthetic c-Myc tag to produce the construct CMV-PC4Myc. The PC4 bacterial expression plasmid pet11a PC4WT and derivatives have been described previously (43.Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Lysine mutants were generated using the following oligonucleotides: K23E/K26E (GGAATTCCATATGGACGAAAA GTTAGA GAGGAAAA) and K24E/K28E (GGAATTCCATATGGACAAAGAGTTAAAGAGGGAAA). The bacterial expression plasmids pBAD-PC4, 43–127, 31–127, and 1–62 (see Fig. 1) were generated by cloning the respective PCR products into pBAD/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen) N-terminal and inframe with the Myc-His tag. The scanning PC4 mutants that replace 6 wild type amino acids with the sequence AAASAA where constructed using a PCR technique (44.Zaret K.S. Lin J. DiPersio C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, two external primers were designed complementary to the pBad-PC4 plasmid, 5′ and 3′ to the PC4 insert and containing a BstEII and XbaI restriction site, respectively. For each mutant two internal primers were designed. The primer for the 5′ product contained gcg, 6 bases forming a NheI site (gctagc), ggcagc, and 15 bases complementary to the PC4 sequence. The primer for the 3′ product contained cgc, 6 bases forming a NheI site (gctagc), gctgct and 15 bases complementary to the PC4 sequence. Using the appropriate external and internal primer, the two products were generated by PCR, cleaved with BstEII and NheI or NheI and XbaI, gel purified, and ligated together. The full-length product was then gel purified and ligated into aBstEII/XbaI-digested pBad vector. The HIV LTR reporter construct (pHIVluc) was generated by cloning −453 to +80 of the HIV LTR into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter pXp1. Jurkat T cells were stimulated for 9 h with 20 ng/ml PMA, 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Roche Diagnostics), and a 1:10,000 dilution of α-CD28 ascites (Bristol Myers Squibb). Total RNA was isolated by a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (45.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162 (159): 256Crossref Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in guanidinium solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol), phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in DEPC-treated water. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (DYNAL), according to the manufacturers instructions. A cDNA library was prepared by a modification of the method of Gubler and Hoffman (46.Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligo(dT) primers incorporating aXhoI restriction site were hybridized to the mRNA, and the first strand was synthesized using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Supercript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) and dNTP mix including 5-methyl-dCTP rather than dCTP. The RNA was removed and second strand generated using RNaseH and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The cDNA was blunt-ended using Vent DNA Polymerase andEcoRI adaptors (Promega) ligated onto the blunt ends. The cDNA was digested with XhoI, with any internalXhoI sites being protected by 5-methyl-dCTP incorporation, and ligated into the vector pJG4.5 at the unique EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as detailed elsewhere (47.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 20.1.1-20.1.23Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strain EGY48 (ura3 trp1 his3 3LexA-operator-LEU2) was cotransformed by the lithium acetate method, with pEG-Tat86 and the LacZ reporter pSH18-34, which contains eight LexA operator-binding sites (LexAop). The yeast were then transformed with the pJG4.5 activated Jurkat T cell cDNA library and plated onto galactose-containing minimal medium. 74 Leu+ colonies were replica plated onto β-galactosidase assay plates containing galactose or dextrose as the carbon source. Of these, 17 colonies that demonstrated β-galactosidase activity on galactose- but not dextrose- containing medium were further characterized. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these colonies transformed into MC1061 E. coli by electroporation, and the plasmid DNA was subsequently isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies. Rescued library plasmids were transformed back into EGY48 with the Tat86 bait to confirm an interaction and also with unrelated baits to test for specificity. Clones that specifically interacted with pEG-Tat86 were sequenced using the ABI PRISM Dye terminator Cycle Sequencing protocol (Perkin-Elmer). BL21 E. coli were transformed with pGEX constructs. Expression of fusion proteins was induced in exponentially growing bacteria with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. GST proteins were purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. BL21(DE3) E. coli were transformed with pET11a-PC4 plasmids. Expression of PC4 proteins was induced as above. Alternatively, TOP10E. coli were transformed with pBAD-PC4 plasmids and expression of PC4 proteins induced with 0.02% arabinose. Bacterial cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Transfected COS-7 cells were released from flasks with 0.1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Binding assays were performed for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin using 10 μg of GST proteins bound to Sepharose beads and 20 μl of cell lysate containing approximately 1 μg of PC4 protein. The Sepharose beads were washed in lysis buffer, and bound complexes were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE load buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide, transferred to nitrocellulose for 16 h and subjected to Western analysis using anti-PC4 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal) or anti-Myc antibodies (monoclonal, 9E10). Cell lysates containing approximately 1 μg of PC4 were treated with 10 units alkaline phosphatase (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, New England Biolabs) in phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction. Alternatively, lysates were treated with 1 unit of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) in CKII buffer (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. Human Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Jurkat T cells (4.5 × 106 cells in 300 μl of RPMI supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum) were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 280 V and a capacitance of 975 microfarads. In all transfections 5 μg of reporter plasmid was used, and varying amounts of expression constructs were equalized by addition of parent plasmids, pSG5, or RcCMV. Cells were stimulated with a final concentration of 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm calcium ionophore at 24 h post transfection. For HIV LTR transfections, 1 × 105 cells were aliquotted into 96-well trays before stimulation. Luciferase assays were performed according to the previously published method (48.Himes S.R. Katsikeros R. Shannon M.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Light emission was measured using a Packard Top Count Luminescence Counter. COS-7 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS cells were released from flasks with trypsin, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were transfected by electroporation at 280 V and a capacitance of 500 microfarads. COS cells were transfected with a total of 20 μg of expression plasmids. Transfected COS cells (1 × 106) were lysed 48 h post transfection in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were precleared for 1 h by incubation with 50 μl of 50% Sepharose CL4B slurry. Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 16 h with 100 μl of 50% anti-HA-Sepharose slurry. After washing in lysis buffer, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, for quantitation proteins were visualized using the Fuji luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 plus) and quantitated using the Fuji Image Gauge software. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for Tat-interacting proteins expressed in activated Jurkat T cells. A Tat bait construct (pEG-Tat86) was generated in the vector pEG202 to produce a fusion protein comprising the first 86 amino acids of HIV Tat as a C-terminal fusion to a LexA DNA-binding domain. The bait was targeted to LexA DNA-binding sites upstream of the endogenous LEU2 gene in the yeast strain EGY48 (ura3 trp1 his3 3LexA-operator-LEU2) and also upstream LexA DNA-binding sites of the LacZ reporter construct, pSH18-34. Target proteins encoded by a cDNA library were expressed as fusion proteins to an “acid blob” activation domain under the control of a GAL1 promoter. Interaction of the bait and a target protein activated the endogenous LEU2 gene, detected by growth of yeast on leucine-deficient medium and activation of the LacZ reporter, which was visualized by a β-galactosidase assay. A cDNA library was generated in the vector pJG4.5 from Jurkat T cells activated with PMA, calcium ionophore and an anti-CD28 antibody. This expression library was screened for proteins that interacted with the Tat86 bait. Three distinct clones were detected that interacted with the Tat86 bait but did not interact with several nonrelated baits, including a Drosophila bicoid protein bait and baits generated from human c-Rel cDNA. The cDNAs encoding the interacting proteins were recovered from the yeast and sequenced. A clone that represented a particularly strong Tat interactor as assessed by β-galactosidase activity was found to be a full-length cDNA clone of the previously characterized transcriptional coactivator, PC4 (Refs. 49.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar and 43.Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). PC4 is a 127-amino acid bipartite protein (Fig. 1). The N-terminal region of PC4 (amino acids 1–62) contains two serine-enriched acidic (SEAC) domains (43.Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 49.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal region of the protein (amino acids 63–127) contains a single-stranded DNA-binding motif (50.Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A lysine-rich region, which may be involved in the nonsequence specific binding of PC4 to double-stranded DNA, is situated between the 2 SEAC domains in the N-terminal region of the protein (50.Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PC4 has been demonstrated to function as a coactivator for a range of transcriptional activators in in vitro transcription systems. It has been suggested that PC4 may act as an adaptor type molecule linking activators with the preinitiation complex because PC4 has been shown to interact with both transcription factors and components of the basal transcription machinery (e.g.TFIIA). Therefore, PC4 is a candidate for a Tat coactivator involved in the interaction of Tat with the basal transcription machinery. To confirm the interaction between Tat and PC4, binding assays were performed between a GST-Tat protein expressed in bacteria and subsequently immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and a bacterially expressed PC4 protein. Western analysis of E. coli lysates using an anti-PC4 antibody revealed a 16-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). This PC4 protein bound to the GST-Tat fusion protein (Fig.2 A, lane 3) but did not bind to a GST protein alone or to a GST-Myb fusion protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). The presence of GST fusion proteins in the binding studies was confirmed by reprobing the blot with an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). To determine whether Tat could also interact with endogenous cellular PC4, binding assays were performed between GST-Tat fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and COS cell lysates. Cell lysates were incubated with GST alone or GST-Tat protein. Western analysis of the COS cell lysate with an anti-PC4 antibody revealed a single 16-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). This protein bound to GST-Tat (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) but not to the GST control (lane 2). These experiments show that Tat can interact with both bacterially expressed and endogen"

By following the addition of sugar chains to engineered glycosylation sites (glycosylation mapping) in Na,K-ATPase β isoforms expressed in vitro and in Xenopusoocytes, in combination with biochemical techniques, we have defined the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain of these type II proteins. N-terminal truncation and the removal of a single charged residue at the N-terminal start of the putative transmembrane domain influence the proper positioning of the transmembrane domain in the membrane as reflected by a repositioning of the transmembrane domain, the exposure of a putative cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site, and the production of protein species unable to insert into the membrane. Glycosylation mapping in vivo revealed that the degree of glycosylation at acceptor sites located close to the membrane increases with the time proteins spend in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, core sugars added to such acceptor sites cannot be processed to fully glycosylated species even when the protein is transported to the cell surface. Thus, the glycosylation mapping strategy applied in intact cells is a useful tool for the study of determinants for the correct membrane insertion of type II and probably other membrane proteins, as well as for the processing of sugar chains in glycoproteins.

Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer, New York1997: 173-188Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPases are interesting model proteins for the study of functional roles of different subunit interaction sites, because these two enzymes are the only members of the cation-transporting P-type ATPase that are oligomeric and contain, in addition to the catalytic α subunit, a second subunit, the β subunit in the functionally active enzyme. Similar to most other P-type ATPases, the α subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPases are polytopic membrane proteins with 10 transmembrane segments that carry the main functional properties. The β subunits associated with Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α subunits are type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic N terminus, a single transmembrane domain, and a large glycosylated ectodomain. To date, three Na,K-ATPase and one gastric H,K-ATPase β isoforms have been identified, which exhibit a similar domain structure but a low degree of sequence identity of 20–35%. At present, we know that β subunits have several functions that may be finely regulated by different isoforms. A primary role of the β subunit is to support the maturation of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α subunits, which, in contrast to other P-type ATPases, are stably expressed and become functionally active only when properly associated with a β subunit (2Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition to this chaperone function, the β subunit has also been shown to influence the transport properties of the mature Na,K-ATPase,e.g. its apparent affinities for K+ and Na+ (3Lutsenko S.

Interaction sites that have been identified in Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α and β subunits involve the extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. By using the two-hybrid system, an extracellular β domain adjacent to the transmembrane segment has been shown to interact with the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments M7 and M8 of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase (8Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and H,K-ATPase (9Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A β sheet-like structure formed by the 10 most C-terminal amino acids most likely represents another α-interaction site in the ectodomain of the β subunit (10Beggah A.T. Beguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interactions in the ectodomains of α and β subunits are important for the correct folding and the stabilization of the α subunit of oligomeric P-type ATPases (11Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A.

Furthermore, studies performed on chimeras formed between Na,K-ATPase β1 and gastric H,K-ATPase β subunits suggest that interactions with the β-ectodomain are responsible for the differences observed in the transport properties of the Na,K-ATPase associated with different β isoforms (5Eakle K.A.

Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Evidence for interactions between transmembrane segments of the Na,K-ATPase α and β subunits has been obtained by cross-linking experiments (14Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

Analysis of chimeric Na,K-ATPase/H,K-ATPase β subunits suggests that only transmembrane interactions of Na,K-ATPase β but not that of H,K-ATPase β subunits permit the correct folding and ER1 exit of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit (7Hasler U.

Finally, the functional implications of subunit interactions in the cytoplasmic domains, which are supported by proteolysis protection assays (2Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2019-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), are the least well understood. Indeed, truncation of the N terminus of Na,K-ATPase β1subunit does not impede α interaction and stabilization but significantly decreases the apparent K+ and/or Na+ affinity of the Na,K-ATPase (2Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, results of a detailed mutational analysis indicated that the β N terminus may not be directly involved in the functional effects observed after complete N-terminal truncation (7Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but rather that N-terminal truncation could indirectly affect another domain of the β subunit. To better understand the structural and functional roles of α-interaction domains in Na,K-ATPase β subunits, we aimed in this study to 1) define the membrane-spanning domain of the β subunit by identifying the amino acids that actually make up the transmembrane α-helix of Na,K-ATPase β subunits and 2) probe potential changes in the transmembrane domain after N-terminal truncation. To address these questions, we have applied a glycosylation mapping technique (17Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the observation that an engineered consensus glycosylation acceptor site can be modified by oligosaccharyltransferase only if this site is placed at a precise “minimal glycosylation distance” from a transmembrane segment (17Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the active site of oligosaccharyltransferase can be used as a reference point against which the position of membrane helices can be determined (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we apply for the first time the glycosylation mapping assay to proteins synthesized in intact cells, and our results show that the minimal glycosylation distance in intact cells is shorter than that of proteins synthesized in anin vitro translation system. Our studies also suggest that the C-terminal ends of the transmembrane helices of Na,K-ATPase β1 and β3 subunits are located near Leu58 and Met61, respectively. N-terminal truncation of β1 and β3 subunits results in a repositioning of the transmembrane helices relative to the membrane. Although these results do not resolve the question of the functional role of cytosolic α-β interactions, they clearly show that the N terminus of Na,K-ATPase β subunits is crucial for a correct β subunit topology that is compatible with proper assembly and, in consequence, the acquisition of the correct structural and functional properties of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit. The results also support our hypothesis that structural changes in the ectodomain and/or the transmembrane domain are responsible for the K+ effect observed in Na,K-ATPase associated with N-terminally truncated β subunits. Finally, our results validate the glycosylation assay applied in intact cells as a general tool to identify determinants of correct membrane insertion and, in addition, of the glycosylation processing of membrane proteins. Truncation and point mutants ofXenopus Na,K-ATPase β1 and β3isoforms contained in the pSD5 vector (19Good P.J. Welch R.C. Barkan A. Somasekhar M.B. Mertz J.E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 944-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by using the polymerase chain reaction method of Nelson and Long (20Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). β1 subunits lacking 33 amino acids after the initiator methionine (β1t34, see Fig. 1) were prepared as described previously (2Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For the preparation of β3t37, lacking 36 amino acids after the initiator methionine, a β3 cDNA fragment was amplified using an antisense oligonucleotide consisting of nucleotides 301–320 tailed by primer D of Nelson and Long (20Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and a sense oligonucleotide comprising part of the noncoding sequence, the ATG coding for the first methionine, and the sequence coding for the amino acids Leu38 to Tyr43 of the β3 isoform. The amplified DNA fragment was then used as a primer to elongate the inverse DNA strand and was finally amplified using a sense oligonucleotide encoding part of the pSD5 vector and primer D of Nelson and Long. The mutated DNA fragment was introduced into the pSD5β1 vector using NheI and StuI restriction sites. N-Linked glycosylation acceptor sites were introduced in the β1 and β3 isoforms at various positions after the putative end of the transmembrane domain predicted by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). For this purpose, β1 fragments were amplified between an antisense oligonucleotide covering nucleotides 628–648 and tailed by primer D of Nelson and Long and sense oligonucleotides containing codons for the glycosylation acceptor site Asn-Ser-Thr. In these replacement mutants, Asn was placed at amino acid positions 59, 63, 65, 67, 70, and 74 for β1 glycosylation mutants −5, −1, +2, +6, +7, and +11, respectively (see Fig. 1). The mutated DNA fragments were introduced into the β1 cDNA lacking codons for the three natural glycosylation sites (22Beggah A.T. Jaunin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10318-10326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using NheI and BamHI restriction sites. The β1 glycosylation mutant +2 served as a template for the mutant Q56Lglyc+2 in which Gln56 of β1 was replaced by a leucine residue. N-Linked glycosylation acceptor sites were introduced in the β3isoform by first amplifying fragments of β3 cDNA using an antisense oligonucleotide consisting of nucleotides 301–320 and sense oligonucleotides containing codons for the glycosylation acceptor site Asn-Ser-Thr where Asn was placed at amino acid positions 65, 68, 70, 72, and 75 for β3 glycosylation mutants −1, +3, +5, +7, and +10, respectively (see Fig. 1). The mutated DNA fragments were introduced into the pSD5β3 vector usingNheI and StuI restriction sites. For the preparation of β1t34/K35L in which Lys35 of β1t34 was replaced by a leucine residue, a fragment of the β1 cDNA was amplified using β1t34 cDNA as a template, a sense oligonucleotide containing the point mutation, and the same antisense oligonucleotide used for the preparation of β1glycosylation mutants. For the preparation of β3t37/L38K in which Leu38 of β3t37 was replaced by a lysine residue, and of β3t37/L62A/T64G and β3t37/L62V/T64A, in which Leu62 and Thr64 were replaced by alanine and glycine residues, respectively, or by valine and alanine residues, respectively, a fragment of the β3 cDNA was amplified using β3t37 cDNA as a template, a sense oligonucleotide containing the point mutation, and the same antisense oligonucleotide used for the preparation of β3 glycosylation mutants. Chimera were constructed between the Xenopus Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit and Escherichia coli leader peptidase (Lep) (23Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the second Lep transmembrane domain (H2) by amino acid residues Gly27 to Thr61 of β1. This was performed by introducing BclI andNdeI restriction sites at nucleotides coding for amino acids 27 and 61 of β1 and amino acids 59 and 80 of Lep, which permitted the replacement of the BclI-NdeI Lep fragment with that of β1 subunits. The Lep cDNA contained N-linked glycosylation acceptor sites at positions +3, +16, and +20 from the putative end of H2 (17Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

In vitro translation was performed using the Promega TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System kit. Briefly, 60 ng of cRNA was added to 20 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix, 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) at 10 mCi/ml (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.3 μl of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes to give a final volume of 25 μl and was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. In some cases, the proteins were subjected to endoglycosidase H (EndoH, Calbiochem) treatment as described (13Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Protein quantification was performed using a laser densitometer (KB Ultrascan 2202). Oocytes were obtained from Xenopusfemales as described (29Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, 7 ng of Na,K-ATPase α and/or 0.5–3 ng of β cRNA were injected into oocytes, and in some cases β and α cRNA were co-injected with 4 μCi/oocyte of Easy Tag Express (NEN Life Science Products). Oocytes not injected with [35S]methionine were incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. After a pulse of 4, 6, or 24 h, oocytes were subjected to a chase period of 24, 48, or 72 h in the presence of 10 mmcold methionine. Microsomes and in some instances digitonin extracts were prepared as described (2Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the Na,K-ATPase α and β subunits were immunoprecipitated under denaturing or non-denaturing conditions as described (2Geering K.

Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The dissociated immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Quantification of immunoprecipitated bands was performed with a laser densitometer (LKB Ultrascan 2202). To identify the cytosolic localization of the 35-kDa protein species produced in oocytes expressing β3t37 mutants, we followed its release into the medium after permeabilization of oocytes with saponin. For this purpose, oocytes were injected with wild type β3 or β3t37 mutant cRNA and labeled for 20 h with [35S]methionine. Twelve oocytes were incubated for 2 h at 19 °C in 500 μl of modified Barth's medium with or without 0.1% saponin before collection of the media and preparation of oocyte microsomes by centrifugation of the yolk-depleted homogenate at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed with a β3 antibody on the total volume of the collected media and on microsomes corresponding to six oocytes. To test the protease sensitivity of the 28-kDa protein species produced in β3t37-expressing oocytes, we used two assays. In the first assay, oocytes were injected with wild type β3 or β3t37 mutant cRNA together with 4 μCi/oocyte of Easy Tag Express (NEN Life Science Products). After a 4-h pulse period, oocytes were homogenized with a plastic pestle in an Eppendorf tube in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots were incubated with 10 mm CaCl2 in the absence or presence of 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (Merck) for 1 h at 4 °C before addition of 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitations were performed under denaturing conditions with a β3 antibody. In the second protease assay, oocytes were injected with wild type β3 or β3t37 mutant cRNA or with BiP cRNA and labeled for 24 h. Oocytes were then injected with 30 nl of H2O or 30 nl of a solution containing 25 mg/ml trypsin (TPCK-treated, Fluka). Oocytes were left for 1 h at 19 °C before preparation of digitonin extracts and immunoprecipitation with a β3 or a BiP antibody (27Beggah A. Mathews P. Beguin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20895-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Na,K-pump activity was measured as the K+-induced outward current using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described earlier (4Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Current measurements were performed 3 days after injection of oocytes with Bufoα cRNA together with different β cRNAs. To determine the maximal Na,K-pump current (I max), oocytes were loaded with Na+ in a nominally K+-free solution containing 200 nm ouabain, a concentration that inhibits endogenous Na,K-pumps but not the moderately ouabain-resistant exogenous Bufo Na,K-pumps (32Wang X.Y. Horisberger J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the Na,K-pump current by K+ was determined in a Na+-free solution (140 mm sucrose, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-HEPES, 5 mmBaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4), and the current induced by increasing concentrations of K+ (0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 mm K+) was measured at −50 mV. To determine I maxvalues, the Hill equation was fitted to the data of the current (I) induced by various K+ concentrations ([K]) using a least square method, I =I max/(1 + (K12/[K])nH), whereK12 is the half-activation constant. According to previously published data (4Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the Hill coefficient was set to a value of 1.0. To define the transmembrane domains of Na,K-ATPase β1 and β3 isoforms and the possible changes in the transmembrane domain topology after N-terminal truncation, we have used a glycosylation mapping assay together with other biochemical techniques. For the glycosylation mapping assay, we have introduced Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor sites at various positions around the predicted C-terminal ends of β1 and β3subunit transmembrane domains and have used the concept of minimal glycosylation distance defined as the number of amino acids separating the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain from the first Asn residue that is half-maximally glycosylated (17Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transmembrane domain predictions of β1subunits by various computer programs are shown in Fig.1 A. All programs predict that β1 contains a transmembrane domain α-helix, but prediction of its N- and C-terminal ends vary between programs. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis predicts that the β1transmembrane domain begins at Trp33 and ends at Ser63. With the exception of the HMMTOP program, predictions of the N-terminal end of the β1 transmembrane domain was similar with all programs and was located downstream of that predicted by Kyte-Doolittle analysis. Predictions of the C-terminal end of the β1 transmembrane domain ranged between Gly53 and Ser63. To determine experimentally the C-terminal end of the β1transmembrane domain, we first deleted the three natural glycosylation sites in the β1 lumenal domain and then introducedN-glycosylation acceptor sites (Asn-Ser-Thr) with Asn at positions −5, −1, +2, +4, +7, and +11 relative to Ser63,i.e. the C-terminal end of the β1transmembrane domain predicted by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (see Fig. 1 A). Glycosylation of these proteins was first studied after in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes. About 80% of wild type Xenopus β1subunits containing the three natural glycosylation sites were glycosylated and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a higher molecular mass species (Fig.2 A, lane 1) compared with β subunits lacking the natural glycosylation sites (lane 2). Glycosylation was absent in β1subunits containing a single engineered glycosylation site at position −5 (lane 3), but the proportion of glycosylated species gradually increased in β1 subunits containing single glycosylation sites at more distal positions and reached about 80% at position +11 (lanes 4–7, Fig. 2 D). As shown for the β1 glycosylation mutant +11 (Fig. 2 A,lane 8), all glycosylated species were sensitive to EndoH treatment, which specifically cleaves N-linked core sugars. Because half-maximal glycosylation occurs at a distance of about 10–11 amino acid residues away from the C-terminal end of natural, synthetic, or heterologous transmembrane domains introduced into the model membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep) (17Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the β1 transmembrane domain is shorter than predicted by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis and ends around Leu58. To confirm this result, we also introduced the β1 transmembrane domain into the previously characterized Lep protein. For this purpose, we replaced the second transmembrane segment of Lep with the β1 transmembrane domain preceded by the last 6 cytoplasmic amino acids to ensure topological stability (Fig. 2 B). Wild type Lep containing a glycosylation site at position +20 from the end of the Lep transmembrane domain served as a control and was almost entirely glycosylated (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2). The Lep/β1 chimera containing a glycosylation site at position +3 (counting from the first Lep amino acid following the putative β1 transmembrane domain) was glycosylated by 30–40% (lanes 3 and4) and that containing a glycosylation site at position +16 was entirely glycosylated (lanes 5 and 6).

Loss of the receptor is associated with an accumulation of IGF-II, which can cause perinatal lethality if it is systemic, or local proliferation and tumorgenesis if it is spatially restricted. The extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor consists of 15 homologous repeats, of which repeat 11 carries the IGF-II-binding site of the multifunctional receptor.

The extracytoplasmic domain is composed of 15 repeating units with an average length of 147 amino acids and an overall identity of 26 (4). The extracytoplasmic domain contains two binding sites for mannose 6-phosphate located in repeats 3 and 9. In both domains, a conserved arginine residue is critical for binding of mannose 6-phosphate (5Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through a separate binding site located in repeat 11 the M6P/IGF-II receptor binds IGF-II with high affinity (K D between 0.2 and 14.5 nm (see Refs. 6Tong P.Y. Tollefsen S.E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Presence of the amino-terminal 58 residues of repeat 11 (residues 1508–1566) in a truncated M6P/IGF-II receptor is sufficient for high affinity binding of IGF-II (9Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As substitution of isoleucine 1572 by threonine abolishes IGF-II binding (10Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the conformation or accessibility of the IGF-II-binding site appears to be sensitive to mutations within repeat 11 that are located outside of the IGF-II-binding site itself. The M6P-binding sites are critical for the role of the M6P/IGF-II receptor in targeting lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. Lysosomal enzymes that are synthesized as soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum acquire mannose 6-phosphate residues during their transport through the Golgi, which mediate in the TGN binding to the M6P/IGF-II receptor and/or to a second mannose 6-phosphate receptor of smaller size with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. The receptor-ligand complexes are ferried via AP 1/clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN to endosomes, where the ligands are released due to an acidic pH and transported to the lysosomes (11Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The receptors return back to the TGN or can be transported to the cell surface. Cell surface-associated M6P/IGF-II receptors can bind extracellular ligands and mediate their endocytosis. IGF-II which binds to M6P/IGF-II receptors at the cell surface is internalized and delivered to lysosomes, where it is degraded (12Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nielsen F.C. Wang E. Gammeltoft S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Auletta M. Nielsen F.C. Gammeltoft S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the binding of IGF-II to IGF I receptors, which elicits the known metabolic and mitogenic effects of IGF-II through activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity (15Yu K.T. Peters M.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11341-11349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not coupled to intracellular signaling cascades, the function of the M6P/IGF-II receptor is critical for the balance between IGF-II, soluble IGF-II binding proteins, and IGF-I receptors. A loss of M6P/IGF-II receptors in mice by targeted disruption leads to an abnormal increase of IGF-II causing fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality (16Lau M.M. Steward C.E. Liu Z. Bhatt H. Rotwein P. Steward C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2953-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These mice can be rescued by either disrupting the IGF-II or the IGF-I receptor gene (17Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), suggesting that the perinatal lethality is caused by an excessive activity of the IGF-I receptor stimulated by an excess of IGF-II, which is normally prevented by the M6P/IGF-II mediating the delivery of IGF-II to lysosomes for degradation.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2003-2009PubMed Google Scholar) with a loss of M6P/IGF-II receptor expression has suggested that the M6P/IGF-II receptor acts as a tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, this could be explained by an excess of IGF-II-induced mitogenic stimulation or by a loss of transforming growth factor β-activation (23Wang S. Souza R.F. Kong D. Yin J. Smolinski K.N. Zou T-T. Frank T. Young J. Flanders K.C. Sugimura H. Abraham J.M. Meltzer S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2543-2546PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of transforming growth factor-β, which acts as a tumor suppressor, requires the binding of the latent transforming growth factor β-precursor to the M6P-binding sites of the M6P/IGF-II receptor (24Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of repeat 11 independent of the remaining 14 repeats of the extracellular domain of the M6P/IGF-II receptor, we fused repeat 11 to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the M6P/IGF-II receptor. The construct was expressed as a stable and IGF-II binding mini-receptor, which differs in localization from the M6P/IGF-II receptor, but is capable to mediate internalization of IGF-II and its delivery to lysosomes. Two constructs coding for extracellular repeat 11 of the human M6P/IGF-II receptor were generated. The first construct (HisR11) comprised the single repeat 11(R11) with the signal sequence of preprolactin followed by a His-tag at its NH2 terminus. The His-tag was fused to the NH2 terminus of repeat 11 (nt 4669) by employing polymerase chain reaction techniques. The 5′ primer included the 5′BspEI restriction site, the AGAGGATCGCATCACCATCACCATCAC sequence for the RGS(H6)-tag and the priming sequence that is homologous to the 5′ end of repeat 11 (nt 4669–4687). The 3′ primer was located outside the multicloning site of the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) with the sequence CACTGCATTCTAGTTGTG. The template cDNA for this polymerase chain reaction was receptor construct 10–11 published previously (9Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This polymerase chain reaction construct was cut to give a BspEI/SalI fragment which was inserted into the pCI-neo vector containing the signal sequence of preprolactin (nt 60–149). The other construct, R11MT, encoded a membrane-bound protein with the signal sequence of preprolactin at the NH2 terminus of extracellular repeat 11 (R11) (nt 4669–5094) followed by the transmembrane domain (M) (nt 6991–7128) and cytoplasmic tail (T) (nt 7129–7620) of the human M6P/IGF-II receptor. The constructs were generated by overlap extension-polymerase chain reaction as described (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pearse L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pearse L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). In order to generate construct R11MT two overlapping fragments were amplified using the cDNA of wild type M6P/IGF-II receptor as template and the primers SGR 17 (CGGAATTCCGGCAGAAGCTCAGAATAAAC) and SGR 22 (AAAGCCCACCGCTTGCTCGCAGGC) and the primers SGR 23 (GCAAGCGGTGGGCTTTGACAGCG) and SGR 24 (TCCCCCGGGTCGACGCGTCAGATGTGTAAGAGGTC), respectively. The two fragments served as templates for the external primers SGR 17 and SGR 24. The product was cut with EcoRI/SalI and cloned into pMPSVEH expression vector. For each construct the correct DNA sequence was confirmed by fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing. BHK cells stably expressing HisR11 were generated as described (27Hemer F. Körner C. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17108-17113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of R11 protein in the medium was determined by slot blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the His epitope (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For purification of HisR11, cells were grown for 48 h in 20 ml of DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum. Medium was collected, centrifuged, and the proteins were precipitated by the addition of 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and stored at 4 °C. HisR11 was affinity purified using Ni-NTA-agarose matrix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eluates from the Ni-NTA-agarose column were further purified by a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with TBS, pH 7.5. The fractions were analyzed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE and by Western blot analysis using an antibody against the His-epitope (28Sosa M.A. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-II binding was tested by an IGF-II cross-linking assay as described (9Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interaction between HisR11 and IGF-II was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance detection (29Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using a BIAcore 2000 Biosensor (BIAcore AB). The purified HisR11 (250 nm) was immobilized to the surface of a NTA sensor chip (carboxymethylated dextran) via its His-tag following the manufacture's instructions. IGF-II was used at 100 nmin 20 mm NaPi, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in MPR 46 and M6P/IGF-II receptors (mpr− cells) were used for expression of R11MT (30Pohlmann R. Wendland M. Böker C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Clones were tested for expression by Western blot and ligand blot analysis. The mpr− clone C expressing human M6P/IGF-II receptor was described by Kasper et al. (31Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde or methanol and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. HisR11 and the wild-type M6P/IGF-II receptor were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic tail of the human M6P/IGF-II receptor (32Rosorius O. Mieskes G.

Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The primary antibody against the IGF-II receptor tail was detected with a CY2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (green fluorescence, Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and the monoclonal mouse antibodies with a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (red fluorescence, Dianova). After embedding in Fluoromount (Dako), fluorescence was examined using a confocal laser scaning microscope (LSM 2; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with the filter combinations described (35Schulze-Garg C. Böker C. Nadimpalli S. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For determination of the amount of R11MT and M6P/IGF-II receptor the cells were incubated in the presence of saponin as described (36Chao H. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the iodinated monoclonal antibody 2C2. This antibody blocks binding of IGF-II to the M6P/IGF-II receptor (37Braulke T. Causin C. Waheed A. Junghans U. Hasilik A. Maly P. Humbel R.E. von Figura K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1988; 150: 1287-1293Google Scholar) and was used for detection of the extracytoplasmic domain of the mini-receptor. In order to determine the amount of receptors located at the cell surface incubation with the antibody was performed in the absence of saponin. Cells expressing R11MT were homogenized and subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. R11MT was detected by Western blot analysis using an antiserum against the cytoplasmic tail of the M6P/IGF-II receptor (38Böker C. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1023-1032PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-II binding was assayed by ligand blot analysis as described (39Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Binoux M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using phosphorimaging for detection. Cells expressing R11MT were labeled with [35S]methionine as described (9Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After a chase for 0–24 h labeled cells were homogenized and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (40Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with an antiserum specific against the cytoplasmic tail of the human M6P/IGF-II receptor (38Böker C. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1023-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity incorporated into R11MT was quantified by phosphorimaging after separating the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE. 125I-IGF-II was cross-linked to cell surface or total membrane of R11MT expressing cells in the absence or presence of saponin as described (41Ballard F.J. Ross M. Upton F.M. Francis G.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, chilled to 4 °C, washed three times and incubated for 16 h with 125I-IGF-II (106 cpm/35-mm dish) in the presence or absence of 0.1% saponin. After washing the cells, bound 125I-IGF-II was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped and cells were solubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) under reducing conditions and analyzed by phosphorimaging. For determination of binding affinity of R11MT toward IGF-II cells were incubated with 125I-IGF-II in the presence of 0.1% saponin and increasing amounts of unlabeled IGF-II (10−10 to 10−6m). After cross-linking, immunoprecipitation of R11MT and SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) radioactivity was quantified by phosphorimaging. Cells expressing R11MT and control cells grown to confluency on 35-mm dishes were incubated with125I-2C2 antibody (about 200,000 cpm/dish) in 1 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for varying times at 37 °C. Incubation was stopped by rapidly cooling the cells to 4 °C. Medium was collected and cells were washed with ice-cold Hanks' buffer, followed by washing with 25 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, containing 150 mm NaCl for 2 × 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were harvested in 1 n NaOH and disrupted by ultrasonification. The protein concentration and cell associated radioactivity were determined. For determination of 2C2 bound to the cell surface and resistant to acid wash the cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C and processed as described above. To determine endocytosis of 125I-IGF-II, cells grown to confluency on 35-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Then the cells were incubated at 37 °C for up to 1 h in 0.6 ml of this medium containing 200,000 cpm of125I-IGF-II. Incubation was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold Hanks' buffer, followed by washing with 0.2m acetic acid, pH 2.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl for 2 × 5 min at 4 °C and once more with Hanks' buffer. The cells were harvested in 1 n NaOH and used for determination of protein and cell associated radioactivity. For determination of unspecific binding, mpr− cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and processed as described above. Cells were incubated with125I-IGF-II for 1 h at 37 °C as described above. The cells were then washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 2.54 mm CaCl2, 0.9% NaCl, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. After the chase the medium was collected, and radioactivity in the medium, the washing fraction, and in the cells was determined. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released to the medium during the chase was determined by precipitation with 0.2 mg/ml trichloroacetic acid on ice for 2 h, followed by centrifugation and counting of the supernatant and precipitate. Repeat 11 (residues 1508–1650) was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells as a fusion protein containing the signal sequence of preprolactin at the NH2 terminus followed by RGSH6 and repeat 11 of the human M6P/IGF-II receptor (HisR11 in Fig.1). Clones secreting about 1 μg of HisR11/ml medium in 24 h were isolated. HisR11 protein was purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA-agarose. The apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa corresponds to the calculated weight of the unglycosylated HisR11 protein (Fig. 2 A). Amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the integrity of the NH2 terminus of HisR11 and revealed that the only potentialN-glycosylation site (position 1520 of the wild-type receptor) is not glycosylated (data not shown). In cross-linking experiments we analyzed binding of IGF-II in the presence of various amounts of unlabeled IGF-II (Fig. 2 B) and determined a half-maximal inhibition constant (IC50) of 10 nm. To determine the equilibrium rate constant (K D) of the interaction between IGF-II and HisR11 we coupled HisR11 to a sensor chip for analysis by surface plasmon resonance. IGF-II bound to coupled HisR11 with a K Dof 23 nm, a 2-fold lower affinity when compared with the IC50 of 10 nm that was found by the cross-linking experiments. Taken together, these data show that repeat 11 is sufficient for high affinity binding of IGF-II.Figure 2Analysis of purity and IGF-II binding of HisR11. A, purified HisR11 was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by silver staining (S) or Western blotting using an antibody against the His-tag (W). B, purified HisR11 was cross-linked to 125I-IGF-II via the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled IGF-II (indicated as nanomolar IGF-II). The cross-linked product was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography. The apparent molecular weights of standard proteins are indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of the M6P/IGF-II receptor in the physiology of the IGF II system is considered to the control of the concentration of IGF-II in tissues and body fluids by delivering IGF-II through receptor-mediated endocytosis to lysosomes, where IGF-II is degraded. To analyze whether repeat 11 is sufficient to trigger endocytosis of IGF-II and its transport to lysosomes we constructed a type I membrane protein with the extracytoplasmic domain represented by R11 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (residues 2282–2491) of the M6P/IGF-II receptor (Fig. 1). The construct encoding a potential IGF-II mini-receptor (R11MT) was stably transfected into mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are deficient in both the M6P/IGF-II receptor and the second mannose 6-phosphate receptor in mammalian cells, the MPR 46 (30). Cell clones were obtained, in which a protein with the expected molecular mass of 39 kDa for R11MT was detected by Western blot using an antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of the M6P/IGF-II receptor. Ligand blot analysis demonstrated the binding of IGF-II by R11MT (Fig.3). The intracellular localization of R11MT was compared with that of wild-type M6P/IGF-II receptor expressed in mpr− cells by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic tail of M6P/IGF-II receptor. R11MT was localized in punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.4 B), while the wild-type receptor was also concentrated in perinuclear structures (Fig.4 A). Colocalization with γ-adaptin, a commonly used TGN marker (42Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 43Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the perinuclear structures mainly represent TGN (Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, little if any R11MT colocalized with γ-adaptin (Fig. 4 D). Partial colocalization was observed for R11MT and the transferrin receptor, a marker for recycling endosomes and presumably other endosomal subcompartments (44Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This colocalization was much more prominent for the R11MT than for the wild-type M6P/IGF-II receptor (compare Fig. 4,F and E). Neither R11MT nor the wild-type M6P/IGF-II receptor colocalized with the late endosomal/lysosomal markers lamp1 (Fig. 4, H and G) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (not shown). To determine the distribution of R11MT between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes we used the monoclonal antibody 2C2 raised against the human M6P/IGF-II receptor. This antibody inhibits binding of IGF-II to the M6P/IGF-II receptor (37Braulke T. Causin C. Waheed A. Junghans U. Hasilik A. Maly P. Humbel R.E. von Figura K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1988; 150: 1287-1293Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to recognize repeat 11. Cells expressing R11MT or the intact M6P/IGF-II receptor were incubated with 125I-2C2 at 4 °C in the absence or presence of saponin. In the absence of saponin the antibody can only bind to cell surface exposed receptors, while in cells permeabilized with saponin it binds also to receptors in intracellular membranes. In permeabilized cells expressing R11MT the amount of bound125I-IGF-II was 4–5-fold higher than in cells expressing wild-type receptor. Binding to non-transfected cells was up to 2% of that to R11MT expressing cells (Fig. 5). The fraction of R11MT expressed at the cell surface was 24%. This was about 2.5-fold higher than observed for the wild-type receptor (9%, Fig. 5). These results were confirmed by cross-linking 125I-IGF-II to R11MT (Fig. 6). After incubation of cells for 16 h at 4 °C with 125I-IGF-II in presence or absence of saponin, unbound 125I-IGF-II was removed by washing and cells were exposed to the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate. Cells were homogenized and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorimaging of the gels revealed a signal with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass expected for the complex of R11MT (39 kDa) with IGF-II (7.5 kDa). In agreement with the values obtained from labeling with125I-2C2 antibody, 24% of total bound125I-IGF-II were found at the surface of cells expressing R11MT. In the presence of 10−6m unlabeled IGF-II binding of 125I-IGF-II was reduced to 26% indicating the specificity of binding IGF-II. Taken together, these results show that the intracellular distribution of the IGF-II mini-receptor differs from that of the wild-type receptor. The mini-receptor could not be detected at the TGN but in endosomal compartments missing the wild-type receptor. At steady state the fraction at the cell surface is about 2.5-fold higher than observed for wild-type receptor. It is notable that for the wild-type receptor the expression level never exceeded that of endogenous M6P/IGF-II receptor more than 2–3-fold (31Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), while significantly higher expression levels were tolerated for R11MT. Stability of R11MT was determined by metabolic labeling cells with [35S]methionine for 1 h followed by a chase for up to 24 h. [35S]R11MT was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fig.7). The apparent half-life of R11MT turned out to be 10 h, comparable to that of the intact M6P/IGF-II receptor (10–29 h, Refs. 45Gartung C. Braulke T. Hasilik A. von Figura K.

BPV-1 has served as the prototype for studies of the molecular biology of the papillomaviruses. BPV-1 efficiently induces anchorage-independent growth and focus formation in murine C127 cells. The transforming properties of BPV-1 primarily reside in two genes, E5 and E6. Each of these genes is sufficient to transform cells. Although no independent transformation activity has been detected for E7, it was shown to be required for full transformation of C127 by BPV-1. We investigated the biological activities of BPV-1 E7 in several assays. Our results indicate that expression of BPV-1 E7 sensitizes cells to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF)-induced apoptosis. The TNF-induced apoptosis in E7-expressing cells was accompanied by increased release of arachidonic acid, indicating that phospholipase A2 was activated. Unlike the E7 proteins from the cancer-related human papillomaviruses, the BPV-1 E7 protein does not associate efficiently with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in vitro, nor does it significantly affect the pRB levels in cultured cells. Furthermore, BPV-1 E7 sensitizes Rb-null cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that BPV-1 E7 can sensitize cells to apoptosis through mechanisms that are independent of pRB.

Papillomaviruses replicate in the stratified layers of skin and mucosa and usually give rise to benign lesions such as warts or papillomas. Some animal papillomaviruses, including bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1),1 induce fibropapillomas. Because of its ability to transform cells and to replicate its genome in established murine cell lines, BPV-1 has served as the prototype for studies of molecular biology of the papillomaviruses (for review see Ref. 1Howley P.M.

Specific types (“high risk”) of human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect the anogenital tract and are strongly associated with the development of cervical carcinoma (for review see Ref. 2zur Hausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The low risk HPV types, such as 6 and 11, are found associated primarily with benign lesions that rarely progress to cancer. Papillomavirus oncogenes manifest their transforming potential in various cell culture based assays and transgenic models (1Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 3rd Ed. Fields Virology. 2.

To establish stable BPV-1 E7-expressing cell lines, plasmids encoding wild-type BPV-1 E7 and AU1 epitope-tagged E7 in pBabe Puro vector were transfected into the amphotrophic retrovirus packaging cell line PA317 (57Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), respectively, by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Transfected cells were selected for puromycin resistance. Viruses were collected and titered on C127 cells to determine the puromycin-resistant colony-forming units. C127 or MEF cells were then infected with retroviruses containing an approximately equal number of colony-forming units. After puromycin selection, populations of infected cells were pooled and used for subsequent experiments. All experiments were performed using cells within 12 passages (7 passages for MEFs). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. The following day, the medium was changed to regular medium (untreated cells) or medium supplemented with various concentrations of murine recombinant TNF (Sigma) as indicated in the text or figure legend (treated cells). In some experiments, TNF was added to the medium together with 2 μg/ml of cycloheximide as indicated in figure legend. Following treatment with TNF, viable cells were measured using the quantitative colorimetric MTT assay kit (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) according to the manufacture's protocol. MTT is cleaved by living cells to yield a dark blue formazan product. Plates were analyzed in an ELISA plate reader at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. The following day, the medium was changed to regular medium (untreated cells) or medium containing 10 ng/ml TNF (treated cells) and incubated for 24 h. Of 200 μl of cell extract collected from each well, 20 μl were used for analysis of nucleosomes in cytoplasmic fractions by a Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enrichment factor represents the absorbance measured at 405 nm with a reference of 492 nm of treated cells divided by that of the corresponding untreated cells. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105/well. The following day, the medium was changed to regular medium (untreated cells) or medium containing 1 ng/ml TNF plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (treated cells) and incubated for hours as indicated in figure legends. For viability assay, both floating and adherent cells were harvested and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI), and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) in logarithmic scale. For DNA fragmentation analysis, cells were processed as described previously (58Ferlini C. Biselli R. Scambia G. Fattorossi A. Cell Prolif. 1996; 29: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, both floating and adherent cells were harvested and fixed in 50% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Following fixation, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of sample buffer (one part of PBS and three parts of 0.2m Na2HPO4, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100 with 10 μg/ml of PI). After an incubation of 30 min. at room temperature, the cell samples were stored on ice and analyzed for DNA content on the FACScan flow cytometer in linear scale. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. After adhering to the plates, cells were labeled overnight in 200 μl of complete medium containing 0.33 μCi/ml [3H]AA ([5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15-3H]AA, 100 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products). The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 48 h in regular medium or medium containing 10 ng/ml of TNF. The medium was collected, and the amount of released AA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. One-liter cultures were inoculated with 100 ml of stationary cultures and grown for 1 h before induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of low salt association buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 0.03% SDS, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min., supernatant was collected and mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After rotary shaking for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, washed three times with 20 volumes of low salt association buffer, and stored at 4 °C.In vitro translated E7 proteins were prepared by using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription and translation system (Promega) and 35S-labeled cysteine (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). For in vitro binding, 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 2 μg of GST fusion proteins were combined with 2–20 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro translated proteins in lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a total volume of 250 μl. The mixtures were subjected to rotary shaking for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were then washed extensively with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and scanned by Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). To detect E7 proteins, proliferating cells were metabolically labeled overnight with 1 mCi of 35S-labeled cysteine/10-cm dish in cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-AU1 antibody (BAbCO) and protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive washes with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The epitope-tagged BPV-1 E7 band was analyzed by Molecular Imager. To compare p53 levels, PBE7 and PURO cells were metabolically labeled overnight with [35S]methionine. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (34Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Munger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Lysates containing equal numbers of cpms were immunoprecipitated with a p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab421; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following extensive wash, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and analyzed by Molecular Imager. To examine the stability of pRB, exponentially growing PBE7 and PURO cells were treated with 20 μg/ml of cycloheximide for various time periods, harvested, and lysed in the 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After removing cell debris by centrifugation, 130 μg of proteins were fractionated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then blotted simultaneously with an anti-pRB monoclonal antibody pMG3–245 (PharMingen) and an anti-tubulin β antibody (Sigma). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). To detect E7 mRNA expression, 1 μg of total cellular RNA isolated from various cell lines was used as a template to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT) primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). BPV-1 E7 specific primers (sense, nucleotides 1–19: 5′-ATGGTTCAAGGTCCAAATA-3′; antisense, nucleotides 381–365: 5′-TCGTTTGCCATGACGCT-3′) were used to amplify a 381-nucleotide fragment from the E7 cDNA. Kruskal-Wallis test has been used to assess statistical significance of differences in E7-expressing cells and control cells. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate the effect of BPV-1 E7 expression on cell growth, a cell line that expresses BPV-1 E7, named PBE7, was established. For this purpose, C127 cells were infected with amphotrophic retrovirus expressing BPV-1 E7. After puromycin selection, populations of infected cells were pooled and used for subsequent experiments. To avoid the possibility of chromosomal instability because of the expression of BPV-1 E7, all experiments described here were performed using cells within 12 passages. To facilitate detection, a cell line that expresses BPV-1 E7 with a C-terminal AU1 epitope tag (PBAUE7) was also made. BPV-1 E7 gene expression was confirmed in the E7 expressing cell lines by PCR amplification of the cDNA after reverse transcription of cellular mRNA (Fig. 1 A). To examine the expression of BPV-1 E7 protein, a monoclonal antibody against the AU1 epitope was used to precipitate the epitope-tagged E7 protein from PBAUE7 cells, because antibody to BPV-1 E7 was not available. In agreement with previous observations in BPV-1-transformed cells (50Jareborg N. Alderborn A. Burnett S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4957-4965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BPV-1 E7 protein was present at a low level (Fig.1 B). This result indicates that in the PBAUE7 cells, overexpression of the E7 protein did not occur. Morphologically, PBE7 and PBAUE7 cells were indistinguishable from parental cells or retrovirus vector-infected PURO cells (59Rapp L. Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For comparison, C127 cells expressing BPV-1 E6 (PBE6) were also examined (59Rapp L. Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Within 24 h of confluence, PBE6 cells piled up and became highly spindle shaped, indicating a loss of contact inhibition as observed in focus formation assays with BPV-1 E6. Unlike PBE6 cells, cell piling-up was not found in PBE7 or PBAUE7 cells for up to 3 weeks (data not shown). This phenotype of E7-expressing cells is consistent with the results of focus formation assays, in which no foci were observed in C127 cells infected with BPV-1 E7-expressing retrovirus. In contrast, BPV-1 E6 efficiently induces focus formation in this assay. This result is also in agreement with the previous report that BPV-1 E7 transformed neither C127 nor NIH3T3 cells (60Schiller J.T. Androphy E.J. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Cancer Cells/DNA Tumor Viruses. 1986; 4: 571-579Google Scholar). We have previously observed that expression of BPV-1 E6 sensitizes C127 cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (59Rapp L. Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine the TNF susceptibility of E7-expressing cells, PBE7 and PBAUE7 cells were treated with various concentrations of murine TNF, and cell viability was determined quantitatively by analysis of MTT conversion (61Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, E7-expressing cells were much more susceptible to TNF treatment compared with the control cells. Although TNF induced less than 4% of the PURO cells to undergo cytolysis at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, 28% of PBE7 cells exhibited cytolysis. The TNF sensitivity of PBAUE7 cells was similar to that of PBE7 cells, suggesting that the AU1 tag did not alter the activity of BPV-1 E7. The TNF sensitivity of E7-expressing cells was compared with that of PBE6 cells. We previously showed that BPV-1 E6 was a strong inducer of apoptosis compared with other known pro-apoptosis viral oncogenes such as the polyomavirus middle T antigen (59Rapp L. Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the effects of BPV-1 E6 and E7 on cell viability were similar, indicating that BPV-1 E7 is an equally potent inducer of cell death. In addition to the MTT conversion assay, we employed an alternate assay to evaluate cell viability. This assay is based on the fact that live cells with intact plasma membrane exclude PI because of the charged nature of PI, whereas dead or dying cells with damaged cell membrane uptake PI and thus fluoresce when PI intercalates into DNA. After TNF and cycloheximide treatment, both floating and adherent cells were pooled, resuspended in PBS containing a low concentration of PI, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. As shown in Fig. 2 B, whereas cell death in TNF-treated PURO cells showed modest increase over the spontaneous cell death in untreated PURO culture, TNF-treated PBE7 cells exhibited bigger increase in cell death. TNF kills most cell types by apoptosis rather than necrosis (62Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2629-2634PubMed Google Scholar). Although the MTT conversion assay and the PI permeability analysis measure cell survival and cytotoxicity, they do not differentiate between cells dying of necrosis or apoptosis. To examine whether the cytolysis of PBAUE7 cells after TNF treatment is apoptotic, we performed the Cell Death Detection ELISAplusassay. This assay provides a qualitative and quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments resulting from DNA degradation that occurs specifically in apoptotic cells. During the process of apoptosis, a number of cellular proteases and endonucleases are activated and cellular DNA is degraded to characteristic nucleosome-sized fragments. Treatment of PBAUE7 cells with TNF for 24 h resulted in specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A). Approximately 2.5-fold enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm was observed in PBAUE7 cells as compared with PURO cells. These results demonstrate that E7 expressing cells undergo enhanced apoptosis after TNF treatment. To assess TNF-induced DNA fragmentation further, we compared the TNF-induced DNA fragmentation in E7-expressing cells and the control cells by flow cytometric analysis. Samples from TNF-treated or untreated cells were stained with PI after fixation, and the DNA content was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. Both PURO and PBE7 cells showed a sub-G1 population in response to TNF. However, PBE7 cells exhibited approximately 2.5-fold increase of sub-G1 population relative to that of PURO cells after incubation with TNF, indicating that E7 expression enhances TNF-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3 B). The TNF-induced lysis of susceptible cells is usually accompanied by the release of AA into the culture medium (63Hayakawa M. Ishida N. Takeuchi K. Shibamoto S. Hori T. Oku N. Ito F. Tsujimoto J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11290-11295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of AA also accompanies the lysis of cells rendered sensitive to TNF by inhibitors of transcription or translation and some viral proteins (64Voelkel-Johnson C. Thorne T.E. Laster S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 1"
https://openalex.org/W2053972887,"Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) acts by a double displacement mechanism, catalyzing the second step in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Impairment of this enzyme results in the potentially lethal disorder, galactosemia. Although the microheterogeneity of native human GALT has long been recognized, the biochemical basis for this heterogeneity has remained obscure. We have explored the possibility of covalent GALT heterogeneity using denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis to fractionate and visualize hemolysate hGALT, as well as the human enzyme expressed in yeast. In both contexts, two predominant GALT species were observed. To define the contribution of uridylylated enzyme intermediate to the two-spot pattern, we exploited the null allele, H186G-hGALT. The Escherichia coli counterpart of this mutant protein (H166G-eGALT) has previously been demonstrated to fold properly, although it cannot form covalent intermediate. Analysis of the H186G-hGALT protein demonstrated a single predominant species, implicating covalent intermediate as the basis for the second spot in the wild-type pattern. In contrast, three naturally occurring mutations, N314D, Q188R, and S135L-hGALT, all demonstrated the two-spot pattern. Together, these data suggest that uridylylated hGALT comprises a significant fraction of the total GALT enzyme pool in normal human cells and that three of the most common patient mutations do not disrupt this distribution."
