https://openalex.org/W167038568,This study attempted to show directly how antiestrogens (tamoxifen and nafoxidine) affect the estrogen receptor (ER) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The mechanisms of estrogen action through the unfilled ERs in both cytoplasm (Rc) and nuclei (Rn) of this cell line were contrasted with the effects of estradiol (E) and antiestrogens on receptor binding nuclear processing reactions and progesterone receptor (PgR) synthesis. Within 5 minutes E bound Rc and translocated it to the nucleus; E also bound Rn directly. Beginning 30 minutes after E and continuing for 3-5 hours a progressive depletion of about 70% of filled nuclear receptors (RnE) occurred without reappearance of unfilled receptor. From that point on the RnE levels stabilized a step coincident with PgR induction. The antiestrogens also bound Rc and Rn as demonstrated by in vitro competition studies and by exchange rates of tritiated E for ER complexed to antiestrogens in whole cells. However the nuclear antiestrogen receptor complexes were aberrantly processed; 3-5 hours after tamoxifen only 30% of nuclear-bound receptors were lost before nuclear receptor levels stabilized whereas nafoxidine-bound nuclear receptors were not processed at all. In spite of the only partial ER processing after tamoxifen PgR was induced as long as lower steady-state ER levels were maintained. When tamoxifen was removed total cell ERs returned to control levels as Rc were restored. Simultaneously PgR falls. Rc binding and translocation alone however are not sufficient for PgR induction since if nuclear processing fails PgR induction is prevented (as is the case with nafoxidine). These data suggest that nuclear processing steps may be integral to the function of estrogenic compounds as inducers of PgR.
https://openalex.org/W2154551468,"Fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation were examined in rat hepatocytes under a variety of experimental conditions. In cells from fed animals, glucagon acutely switched the direction of fatty acid metabolism from synthesis to oxidation. Addition of lactate plus pyruvate had the opposite effect. The inhibitory action of glucagon on fatty acid synthesis and its stimulatory effect on fatty acid oxidation were largely, but not completely, offset by the simultaneous addition of lactate plus pyruvate. Changes in cellular citrate and malonyl-CoA levels indicated that glucagon exerted its inhibitory effect on fatty acid synthesis at two levels: (i) blockade of glycolysis; and (ii) partial inhibition of a more distal step, probably acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Under all conditions, fatty acid oxidation was related in a linear and reciprocal fashion to the rate of fatty acid synthesis and the tissue malonyl-CoA content. The latter fluctuated through a range of 1 to 6 nmol per g wet weight of cells. Since malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase I of liver mitochondria with a Ki in the region of 1 to 2 micron, the present studies support the concept that this compound plays a pivotal role in the coordination of hepatic fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. The ketogenic effect of glucagon on liver appears to be manifested in large part through the ability of the hormone to reduce the tissue malonyl-CoA concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1593261391,"Glycopeptides of molecualr weight range 7,000 to 11,000, unusual in size and structure, have been partially purified from pronase digests of lipid-free human erythrocyte ghosts; we term this fraction erythroglycan. These substances comprise about one-third of the galactose and glucosamine of the ghost. Methylation analysis of erythroglycan yields mainly 4-linked glucosamine, 3-linked galactose, and 3,6-linked galactose, along with mannose and fucose derivatives. Hydrazinolysis and nitrous acid deamination degrade erythroglycan to galactosyl-2,5-anhydromannose, indicating a repeating structure of galactosyl, (1 leads to 4)-2deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl (1 leads to 3). Digestion with the endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii gives only partial cleavage of the erythroglycan, probably because of the arborized structure indicated by the branched galactose. Since sphingosine is not detectable after methanolysis by chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and since amino acids are present, we conclude that these substances are probably glycopeptidic in origin and are not macroglycolipids. Erythroglycan may have the same type of keratan-like core structure as the long chain blood group glycolipids from human erythrocytes and could be a protein-bound carrier of the ABO determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1503255196,"A simple radioisotopic assay for malonyl-CoA is described. The method is based on the malonyl-CoA-dependent incorporation of labeled acetyl-CoA into palmitic acid catalyzed by fatty acid synthetase in the presence of NADPH. Its main advantages over the more conventional spectrophotometric procedure is that it is extremely sensitive and allows the simultaneous determination of picomole quantities of malonyl-CoA in multiple tissue extracts. It should prove particularly suitable for studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism in isolated hepatocytes where the quantity of tissue available for analysis is frequently very small. Application of the method to the measurement of malonyl-CoA in livers from fed, fasted, and diabetic rats yielded values that were consistent with the recently postulated role of malonyl-CoA in the regulation of hepatic ketone body production."

They do not respond for a wide range of other types of sounds or for sonar echoes at longer or shorter pulse-echo intervals; they may, therefore, be specialized for detection and ranging of sonar targets."
https://openalex.org/W1979682242,Cells originating from one of the first two blastomeres of the frog embryo were labeled either by injecting them with horseradish peroxidase or by changing the ploidy of one blastomere. Both methods show the labeled cells confined to the same side of the brain as the labeled blastomere except for cells that have moved from the opposite side into the ventral diencephalon and ventral part of the retina. Reciprocal movement of cells from each side of the prospective forebrain into the prospective retina on the opposite side starts before the neural tube closes and results in the formation of an incipient optic chiasma which may provide the pathway for optic axons to grow from the retina to the opposite side of the brain.

https://openalex.org/W168504699,"SUMMARY Polyadenylated RNA prepared from a murine pitui- tary tumor that produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was translated in membrane-free heterologous cell-free systems derived from wheat germ, reticulo- cytes, and Krebs ascites cells. By electrophoretic anal- yses, the predominant labeled product had an apparent molecular weight (&fr) of 14,000. Several tryptic pep- tides of this major translation product matched those obtained from the authentic, secreted (Y subunit of TSH. The protein of M, = 14,000 is the product of the trans- lation of the mRNA coding for the (Y subunit of TSH. In addition, a second protein of M, = 17,000 was detected in the wheat germ system. Both the M, = 14,000 and M, = 17,000 translation products are larger by approxi- mately 3,000 to 4,000 daltons than are the putative core unglycosylated (Y (Mr = 10,600) and p (Mr = 13,000) subunits of TSH, respectively, but are smaller than those of the glycosylated native TSH-cu subunits se- creted by intact tumor cells in vitro (apparent M, = 22,000) and TSH-P (apparent M, = 18,000). The effects of magnesium and potassium on the synthesis of these proteins in the wheat germ system were examined. Increasing concentrations of magnesium (1.7 to 3.7 mM) resulted in a 6-fold decrease in the amount of (Y product and a a-fold increase in the amount of M, = 17,000 product. Increasing concentrations of potassium (40 to 115 mM) had little effect on the relative amounts of the M, = 14,000 (a product) and M, = 17,000 products at low magnesium concentration [1.7 mM], but stimulated the synthesis of both products at high magnesium concen- tration [3.2 mM]. The results suggest that the product of the translation of the mRNA coding for the (Y subunit is probably a precursor form of the subunit with an additional sequence of approximately M, = 3,000, sim- ilar to the precursor forms found in the analogous translation products for other protein hormones. It is likely that the (Y and fl subunits of TSH are coded for by"
https://openalex.org/W203284130,"A scheme is presented for cloning a double-stranded cDNA molecule that codes for a portion of chicken preproalbumin. This method, which does not require pure mRNA or cDNA, has widespread applicability. Chicken preproalbumin was identified as a Mr = 72,000 polypeptide by immunoprecipitation of proteins synehesized in a wheat germ cell-free translation system from total, guanidine.HCl-extracted, rooster liver RNA. After removal of the bulk of the ribosomal RNA by poly(U)-Sephadex G-10 chromatography, albumin mRNA was enriched approximately 2-fold by centrifugation through low salt, isokinetic sucrose gradients, until it represented about 30% of the mRNA sequences present. Double-stranded cDNA prepared from this mRNA was then inserted into the Pst 1 site of the plasmid PBR322 by the G-C tailing technique and the recombinant DNA was used to transform Echerichia coli stran X1776. Transformants containing putative albumin DNA sequences were identified by colony hybridization with a cDNA probe that was highly enriched for albumin cDNA sequences. This probe was isolated by hybridizing the partially purified RNA preparation to its cDNA, under conditions of RNA excess, to a R0t value such that only the most abundant cDNA sequences had hybridized. Unhybridized, less abundant, sequences were destroyed by subsequent S1 nuclease digestion. The identity of clones that hybridized to this abundant class cDNA was established by DNA-mRNA hybrid-arrested cell-free translation. Hybridization of nick-translated, albumin-containing, plasmid DNA to total liver poly(A)+ RNA, that had been separated on methyl mercury agarose gels and transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper, established that avian albumin mRNA has a molecular weight of 850,000. This molecular weight corresponds to approximately 2,600 nucleotides, or 600 nucleotides longer than the size required to code for the preproalbumin polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1482128126,"Chemical modification studies of bovine liver rhodanese have underscored important distinctions between free rhodanese and the catalytic intermediate in which the sulfane atom of the sulfur donor is bound covalently to the enzyme (sulfur-rhodanese). Treatment of free rhodanese with near-stoichiometric quantities of either iodoacetate or phenylglyoxal results in the rapid modification of the essential sulfhydryl group of Cys-247 and the consequent inactivation of the enzyme. Analysis of rate data for the iodoacetate reaction showed that the apparent pK of this group is 7.8 in free rhodanese and 6.7 to 7.0 in complexes of the enzyme with analogs of sulfur donor substrates, in agreement with the previous inference from steady state kinetic observations. Inactivation of free rhodanese by phenylglyoxal in the presence of cyanide was shown to be caused by a novel reaction in which disulfide bonds are formed between Cys-247 and either Cys-254 or Cys-263. In contrast to these results with free rhodanese, the sulfur-substituted enzyme is not inactivated by iodoacetate and is only relatively slowly inactivted by treatment with substantial excesses of phenylglyoxal. The loss of enzyme activity in sulfur-rhodanese does not involve cysteinyl residues but can be correlated with the modification of guanidino groups, notably that of Arg-186, the side chain of which may play a role in substrate binding. These chemical modification studies have implications with respect to the chemical mechanism of rhodanese catalysis and the interpretation of the x-ray crystallographic analysis of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516608985,"The near-neighbor relationships of proteins in the myelin membrane were examined using dinitrodifluorobenzene and other cross-linking reagents. When intact cat dorsal column or isolated myelin fragments were treated with cross-linking reagents, up to 20% of the myelin basic protein dimerized. The only other cross-linked product formed in the intact cat dorsal column was a heterodimer consisting of myelin basic protein and either the major or minor proteolipid protein. The remaining myelin proteins, including the major proteolipid protein, were cross-linked into very high molecular weight aggregates. In contrast, when the myelin membrane was dipersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate before the addition of cross-linking reagent, all the proteins remained essentially monomeric, with the exception of myelin basic protein which dimerized to some extent. In the absence of cross-linking reagent, it was shown by radioimmunoassay that small amounts of myelin basic protein dimer and the heterodimer were normally present in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. We found no evidence of intramolecular cross-links between the two peptides formed by N-bromosuccinimide cleavage or between the two peptides formed by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the basic protein monomer. The regions of the myelin basic protein molecule involved in dimerization were also determined by similar cleavage of the cross-linked dimer. A rudimentary model for the structure of basic protein dimer in myelin is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2097429100,"Derivatives of cytochrome b5 that had been selectively shortened at the COOH-terminal, membrane binding segment of this amphipathic protein were employed to examine the minimum structural requirements for binding to phospholipid vesicles and for catalytic interactions in the stearyl-CoA desaturase system. Three derivatives shortened by 6, 18, and 27 amino acid residues were produced by controlled proteolysis with carboxypeptidases. The two largest derivatives bound to synthetic lipid vesicles and interacted with cytochrome b5. The third derivative neither bound to vesicles nor reacted with the desaturase. Whole nonpolar peptide and the nonpllar peptides of the two largest derivates contain only 29 to 34% polar residues, whereas the nonpolar peptide of the third derivative contains 44% polar residues. The secondary structure of the membrane binding segment was studied by circular dichroism of whole nonpolar peptide and the corresponding peptides of the three derivatives. The data for whole nonpolar peptide are consistent with a structure containing approximately 50% helical and 25% beta sheet structure. The CD of the nonpolar peptides of the two largest derivatives are consistent with structures containing 56% helix and 19% beta sheet structure, and 40% helix and 20% beta sheet structure. These data support a predicted model for secondary structure, proposed previously, based upon the primary structure (Fleming, P. J., Dailey, H. A., Corcoran D., and Strittmatter, P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5369-5372)."
https://openalex.org/W2137982418,"Indirect measurements of membrane potential in human diploid fibroblast cells indicate that there is a growth-related difference in membrane potential between subconfluent, growing cells (-49 mV) and serum-deprived, quiescent cells (-22 mV). The elevated membrane potential in growing cells appears to be solely responsible for the 2-fold higher ..cap alpha..-aminoisobutyric acid accumulating capacity that we observed previously in growing cells, as compared to quiescent cells. When the membrane potentials of quiescent and growing cells are set equal, using valinomycin and varying (K/sup +/)/sub 0/, ..cap alpha..-aminoisobutyric acid accumulation is dependent on the magnitude of the potential, but it is independent of the growth state of the cell. The data indicate that both the accumulation of ..cap alpha..-aminoisobutyric acid in human diploid fibroblast cells and the K/sub m/ for its transport are sensitive to experimentally induced changes in membrane potential, and furthermore, that the observed growth-related difference in membrane potential between growing and quiescent cells can account for their growth-associated differences in ..cap alpha..-aminoisobutyric acid accumulation and K/sub m/."

https://openalex.org/W2415095732,"The rates of DNA synthesis were determined for each of two consecutive journeys through S-phase by highly synchronized HeLa cells. Cells at various times after release from the metabolic block were pulsed with [3H]thymidine. The amount of radioactivity in whole cells, purified DNA, and Okazaki fragments provided indexes of the rates of DNA synthesis. Measurements of the average DNA content per cell by the diphenylamine method and the individual DNA content per cell by DNA:propidium fluorescence provided better estimations of the actual rates of DNA synthesis, independent of thymidine metabolism. Unsynchronized cells that had been pulsed with [3H]thymidine were sorted into early, middle, and late S-phase preparations for estimations of the amount of radioactivity per cell. There were differences in the rates predicted by each of the various methods. Rates estimated by fluorescence measurements of DNA content per cell, or by diphenylamine measurements of average DNA content per cell exhibited a pattern of an initial burst, followed by a decreased rate then a final burst. Similar patterns were obtained for the amount of radioactivity in Okazaki fragments, and in early, middle, and late S-phase cells separated from a log-phase culture by electronic cell sorting. Rates estimated by measurements of the amount of radioactivity in whole cells, and the specific activity of purified DNA exhibited a different pattern of an initial slow rate, followed by a maximal rate then a slow rate."
https://openalex.org/W1500317471,"Perfusion of a rabbit kidney 72 h after ureter obstruction resulted in a progressive increase in bioassayable prostaglandin-like substances released in response to a fixed dose of bradykinin with time. Contralateral or normal kidneys showed no progressive increase with time of prostaglandin-like substances released in response to the same dose of agonist during perfusion. Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis and cycholeximide, reversibly blocked the time-dependent progressive increase in renal prostaglandin-like substances released from the obstructed kidney. Acetylsalicylic acid, which covalently acetylates the cyclooxygenase, inhibited initial bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin biosynthesis by 95% in the ureter-obstructed kidney, but within 60 to 90 min of perfusion there was progressive bioassayable prostaglandin E2 release in response to bradykinin which paralleled the non-aspirin-treated control. In the aspirin-treated contralateral (unobstructed control) and normal kidneys bradykinin-stimulated release of prostaglandin-like substances was inhibited by 85% and did not recover during the perfusion experiments consistent with the evidence that the control kidneys are not synthesizing new enzyme. These experiments suggest that the progressive enhanced prostaglandin release to fixed bradykinin doses in the ureter-obstructed kidney is dependent on de novo cyclooxygenase synthesis."

These RNA preparations were used to synthesize labeled cDNA for solution and filter hybridization (Southern blotting) experiments. Hybridization of cDNAs prepared with separated adult alpha- and beta-mRNAs and of rabbit globin-specific probes to restriction enzyme-digested, filter-bound chicken chromosomal DNA has shown that the adult globin genes of the chicken exist within EcoRI-cleaved chromosomal DNA fragments which are 4.3, 6.0, and 12.5 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size. These fragments contain the majority or entirety of the adult alpha D, beta, and alpha A genes, respectively. Furthermore, we present evidence that the predominant chicken embryonic globins are contained within EcoRI fragments 9.4 and 15 kbp in size. Evidence is also presented that the same globin organization exists in several different breeds of chickens and in several chicken culture cell types. Finally, it is demonstrated that the pattern of globin-specific hybridization to reticulocyte chromosomal DNA digested with several restriction enzymes is unchanged during erythropoietic development."
https://openalex.org/W1542151477,"Binding properties of detergent-solubilized receptors for alpha-bungarotoxin from skeletal muscle of the 13th day chick embryo and from optic lobe of the hatching chick were compared. It was found that both types of receptor are nicotinic, although they differ in their affinities for individual ligands and in the rank order of ligands. In contrast to the muscle receptor, the neuronal receptor binds the toxin in a reversible fashion (KD = 2.1 X 10(-10) M at 23 degrees C). Small ligands inhibit brain equilibrium procedures. Toxin and ligands compete for a single type of noninteracting site, and the ratio of toxin binding sites to ligand-binding sites is unity. The inhibitory potency of ligands parallels their ability, at higher concentrations, to accelerate receptor . toxin by interaction with the same site on the receptor derived from the optic lobe."

The second order rate constant of interaction of filipin with cholesterol, determined by stopped flow measurements of the initial rate, is slower in sealed ghosts than in unsealed ghosts by a factor of 2.0, whereas identical rate constants were obtained with right-side-out and inside-out vesicles. These results suggest that the cholesterol accessible to rapid reaction with filipin is distributed symmetrically between the inner and outer halves of the lipid bilayer of erythrocyte ghost membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1541049200,"Cyanogen bromide fragments from reduced and carboxymethylated rhodanese have been isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-50 and sulfoethyl-Sephadex C-25, respectively. Partial or complete structural analysis of these fragments has permitted the ordering in sequence of all eleven of the nonaligned tryptic peptides from citraconylated, S-carboxymethylcysteinyl-rhodanese and has thus provided the complete covalent structure of the enzyme. Rhodanese is a single polypeptide of 293 residues and the molecule weight calculated from the covalent structural analysis is about 32,900. The cysteinyl residue implicated in the catalytic function of rhodanese is at position 247. In some preparations of the enzyme the NH2-terminal dipeptide Val-His is missing and the sequence begins with the glutamine at position 3. The rhodanese thus obtained contains 291 amino acid residues and possesses full enzymic activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of rhodanese has shown that the halves of the molecule (Domains I and II) are nearly identical in conformation. Comparative analysis of the sequences in Domains I and II containing residues with conformationally equivalent alpha C atoms has revealed some degree of homology between the halves of the rhodanese polypeptide. Nethertheless, the structural equivalence of the rhodanese domains is reflected much more by their similarity in tertiary structural than by their sequence homology, even when the sequence comparisons are optimized with reference to the crystallographic results."

https://openalex.org/W2419441174,"Difference fluorescence emission spectra, reciprocal Stern-Volmer plots, and variable excitation wave-lengths have been used to evaluate the selective quenching of the two tryptophan residues/subunit of liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Trp-15, at the surface of the enzyme, is quenched by KI consistent with a collisional mechanism, and has a blue-shifted excitation and red-shifted emission spectrum when compared with the spectral properties of TRP-314, which is in a hydrophobic milieu at the subunit interface of the dimeric enzyme. With excitation at 295 nm, Trp-314 is 80% quenched by formation of a ternary enzyme.NAD+.trifluoroethanol complex, and the quenching is essentially additive to that caused by KI. Alkaline pH also results in selective quenching of Trp-314. These results, and considerations of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, indicate that the quenching of protein fluorescence of liver alcohol dehydrogenase by either ternary complex formation or alkaline pH is due to resonance energy transfer to tyrosinate. Likely candidates as energy acceptors are the Tyr-286 residues are within transfer distance for each Trp-314 residue, as well as being at the surface of the enzyme and 30 A from the active center zinc atom. Alkaline pH directly ionizes this tyrosine residue, while ternary complex formation causes a conformational change resulting in its ionization."

Isolated membrane pellets were centrifuged through linear sucrose gradients, and the distributions of the activities of seven membrane-bound enzymes were measured. The distribution of acyltrasferase activity was similar to that of the endoplasmic reticulum enzymes. Gradient fractions which contained intact mitochondria had very low activities of acyltransferase. Experiments using mixed fractions and measurements made under conditions which inhibit phospholipase A2 showed that no acyltransferase activity from this location was masked by competing activities. When membranes were treated with digitonin, plasma membranes specifically increased in density, facilitating their separation from endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The plasma membranes were free of acyltransferase activity. We conclude that in cultured swine arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells, acyltransferase is located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum."

Parathyroid extract prompted an increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 in thyroparathyroidectomized rats whereas the administration of exogenous 1,25 (OH)2D3 resulted in stimulated 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and suppressed 1,25-(OH)2D3 serum levels. The actions of parathyroid and 1,25-(OH)2D3 to modulate kidney 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 hydroxylase enzyme activities were not additive; rather, the hormone and metabolite acted to suppress each other's in vivo regulatory action. The specificity and rate of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 hydroxylation was determined by the interdependent modulatory actions of parathyroid extract and 1,25-(OH)2D3. Such results suggest that the kidney 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1- and 24-hydroxylase enzyme systems are regulated in response to the relative modulatory activities of parathyroid hormone and 1,25-(OH)2D3."

The final malpha-acrosin preparation resulted in a single protein band with a molecular weight of 49,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis. Disc arginine naphthylamide hydrolyzing band with a relative migration of 0.39 malpha-acrosin catalyzed the hydrolysis of synthetic substrates containing arginine and lysine, but not phenylalanine. Although calcium ions were not required for enzymatic activity, the addition of calcium chloride stimulated the activity through an increased substrate affinity and an increased maximal velocity. Polyamines stimulated the maximal velocity of the reaction, but were without effect on the substrate affinity. malpha-Acrosin was inhibited by lima bean, ovo-mucoid, and seminal plasma proteinase inhibitors. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and 1-chloro-3-tosylamide-7-amino-L-2-heptanone treatment resulted in an irreversible inhibition, while L-arginine, benzamidine, and p-aminobenzamidine were competitive inhibitors with respect to substrate. These properties of malpha-acrosin are very similar to those previously reported for mbeta-acrosin and suggest that the portion of the molecule lost during the conversion of malpha-acrosin to mbeta-acrosin contributes little to the topography of either the active site or regulatory sites of the enzyme."

These Tc fragments account for all of the 293 residues in the parent polypeptide and their partial or complete sequences have been determined by automated and manual Edman degradation. In some cases, sequence analyses were completed by degradation of peptides derived by secondary cleavages of the decitraconylated Tc fragments with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or the protease from Staphylococcus aureus. Automated Edman degradation of intact S-carboxymethylcysteinyl-rhodanese was performed for 60 cycles; the information thus obtained permitted the alignment of seven of the Tc fragments and gave the sequence of the first 79 residues in the polypeptide chain. The Tc peptide at the COOH terminus of rhodanese was placed by virtue of the fact that it contained no arginine. Structural analysis of the Tc peptides provided the sequences surrounding all five of the methionyl residues in the enzyme. One of the methionines was found in a 19-residue Tc fragment which also contained the cysteinyl residue essential for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1593757208,"The influence of urea, guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and granidinium thiocyanate (GdmSCN) on the solution structure of lipophilin was examined by circular dischroism and fluorescence techniques. According to the CD results, lipophilin retained at least 60% of organized secondary structure in 8 M urea and 6 M GdmCl (measurements were not possible in GdmSCN). This partial denaturation was of a complex, irreversible nature, and was not appreciably enhanced by prolonged incubation (8 days), by heating to 70 degrees C, by disulfide bond reduction, or by pH variation in the range pH 1.5 to 11. Fluorescence studies demonstrated that the tryptophan residues were only slightly perturbed by 8 M and 6 M GdmCl and remained well buried to the permeant quenching agent acrylamide. A greater, but still far from complete, disruption of lipophilin was achieved in 6 M GdmSCN, and fluorescence polarization provided evidence for some form of cooperative structural change induced by increasing concentrations of this reagent. Transfer of the protein from 2-chloroethanol, in which the tryptophan residues are fully exposed, into 6 M GdmSCN by dialysis resulted in reburial of the fluorophores owing to development of tertiary structure. The combined evidence suggests that the extraordinary resistance of lipophilin to these denaturants is due to the presence of an impervious hydrophobic core. In lipophilin and some other membrane-associated proteins, extended sequences of apolar residues might provide the nuclei for such structural domains."

The time course of formation of a M2 . con A complex is clearly biphasic, whereas the association with con A of p-nitrophenyl 2-O-methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and other monosaccharides is a monophasic process. The biphasic time course of the binding of M2 to conA is most simply explained in terms of a model wherein the disaccharide can bind to con A two different ways. In the initial rapid phase of the biphasic reaction, both complexes form in amounts determined by the relative values of the rate constants for association. In the subsequent slow phase, the complexes equilibriate according to the relative values of the initial constants for formation of each complex. The enthalpy of activation for formation of the initial complexes with M2 is about 4 kcal/mol less favorable than for monosaccharides, whereas the entropy of activations about 14 e.u. more favorable for binding of the disaccharide. These differences in the activation parameters for binding M2 and monosaccharides suggest that con A interacts simultaneously with groups on both mannopyranosyl residues."

https://openalex.org/W1567181638,"Isolated nuclei frommouse myeloma cells which were active in RNA synthesis did not synthesize detectable amounts of poly(A)-containing RNA. On addition of a soluble protein extract from crude nuclei, the highly purified nuclei synthesized significanamounts of poly(A)-containing RNA, as analyzed by chromatography on poly(U)-Sepharose. The poly(A) tract was totally synthesized de novo and was indistinguishable from poly(A) synthesized in vivo. Twenty per cent of the RNA polymerase II products were polyadenylated. More than 80% of the newly synthesized poly(A) was present on molecules at least partially transcribed in vitro. The transcription and polyadenylation reaction could be separated temporally and a portion (10%) of the polyadenylated RNA was released into the extra nuclear fraction. We conclude that this system carries out one RNA processing reaction, polyadenylation, faithfully."
https://openalex.org/W1481956156,"A low molecular weight DNA polymerase which sediments at 3.3 S on sucrose gradients has been purified from total cell homogenates of rapidly dividing embryos of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. In the presence of 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide, it is the major polymerase activity in whole cell homogenates when assayed with an oligo(dT)10.poly(dA)200 template; a template which it uses about 200 times more efficiently than activated DNA. The requirement for N-ethylmaleimide exists only in crude cell fractions where it acts to inhibit a template digesting nuclease activity. The polymerase is highly stable if maintained in the presence of 20% glycerol, is completely dependent on added template, and shows no end addition activity. The physical and enzymatic properties of this enzyme clearly distinguish it from the DNA polymerase previously described by Loeb (Loeb, L. A. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 1672-1681) which sediments as a high moeluclar weight (5.6 to 6.6 S) enzyme and prefers the activated DNA template. In addition, these two DNA polymerase enzymes show distinctive chromatographic properties using DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns as well as their sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. The properties of the low molecular weight polymerase indicate close similarity to the beta-polymerase isolated from mammalian cells. These low molecular weight enzymes are both sensitive to phosphate salt and able to utilize the artificial ribohomopolymer template oligo(dT)10.poly(rA)200. A quantitative analysis of the low molecular weight DNA polymerase during early embryonic development indicates that the activity of this enzyme increases at least 2-fold immediately following fertilization and again during early blastula stage (hatching). Such quantitative changes in a beta enzyme activity are in contrast to findings with the alpha-polymerase which remains constant during early development."
https://openalex.org/W1513455608,"Salt-soluble elastin, isolated by coacervation from extracts of copper-deficient pig aorta, contains a minor protein component separable by gel electrophoresis in 6 M urea. This protein has a molecular weight of 150,000 compared to 75,000 of the major component. The amino acid analyses of both proteins are typical of elastin but the higher molecular weight component has a significantly lower lysine content and lysine-derived cross-links that are lacking from the major component. The proteins were labeled by incubation of the fresh aortic tissue with [14C]lysine. The acid hydrolysate of the borohydride-reduced higher molecular weight protein contained a labeled amino acid eluting at a time identical to standard merodesmosine and a trace of radioactivity corresponding to lysinonorleucine. We conclude that the higher molecular weight protein is a cross-linked dimer of the previously identified soluble elastin."
