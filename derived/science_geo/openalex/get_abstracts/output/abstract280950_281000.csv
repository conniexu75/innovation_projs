https://openalex.org/W2008848599,"A method has been developed for the efficient emission of light from subwavelength dimensions. It is based on packaging photons as molecular excitons, effectively reducing the volume of the light beam by 10(9) and making possible propagation through dimensions of 1 nanometer. Molecular microcrystals are grown in the tips of micropipettes that have inner diameters of 100 nanometers or less. Measurements are presented that demonstrate this improvement in transmission for pipettes of various diameters. The ultrasmall dimensions of these light sources, the wavelength range (ultraviolet to red) of their emission, their ease of production, and their expected unique abilities for high efficiency excitation-imaging of surfaces portend significant applications for this methodology."
https://openalex.org/W1967978721,"Radiometric measurements during the past decade from the Solar Maximum Mission and Nimbus 7 satellites have shown that the total solar irradiance varies in step with the sun's 11-year magnetic activity cycle. Stellar observations from the Lowell and Mount Wilson observatories now confirm and elaborate this discovery. These measurements show that older stars similar to the sun tend to become brighter as their magnetic activity level increases, just as the sun does during its 11-year activity cycle. Younger stars, however, tend to become fainter as their magnetic activity level increases. This contrasting behavior suggests that the balance between the competing phenomena that influence solar brightness variability has shifted during the sun's lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2016473933,"The defect structure of in situ pulsed, laser-deposited, thin films of the high-transition temperature superconductor Y-Ba-Cu-O has been observed directly by atomic resolution electron microscopy. In a thin film with the nominal composition YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) (123), stacking defects corresponding to the cationic stoichiometry of the 248, 247, and 224 compounds have been observed. Other defects observed include edge dislocations and antiphase boundaries. These defects, which are related to the nonequilibrium processing conditions, are likely to be responsible for the higher critical currents observed in these films as compared to single crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2074257291,"In the absence of oxidizing or reducing agents the chromatographic and coprecipitation behavior of element 102 is similar to that of the alkaline earth elements. After oxidation with ceric ions, the behavior is that expected of a trivalent actinide. Nobelium is the first actinide for which the +2 oxidation state is the most stable species in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W2085970602,"The alpha-scattering experiment aboard Surveyor VII has provided a chemical analysis of the moon in the area of the crater Tycho. The preliminary results indicate a chemical composition similar to that already found at two mare sites, but with a lower concentration of elements of the iron group (titanium through copper)."
https://openalex.org/W4236450711,"The alpha-scattering experiment aboard soft-landing Surveyor VI has provided a chemical analysis of the surface of the moon in Sinus Medii. The preliminary results indicate that, within experimental errors, the composition is the same as that found by Surveyor V in Mare Tranquillitatis. This finding suggests that large portions of the lunar maria resemble basalt in composition."

https://openalex.org/W2022702984,"Potassium-argon determinations of age from whole-rock samples of tholeiitic basalts, dredged from the crest of the East Pacific Rise and from the flanks of three seamounts at varying distances from the crest, show that the crest is younger than 1 million years and that age does not correlate with distance from the crest. Our data, however, do not necessarily oppose the general concept of spreading of the ocean floor."

Gregory. Mr. Gregory's address is Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa."
https://openalex.org/W2017860256,"Isobases constructed from recently published data are strikingly parallel to both the edge of the continental shelf off the northeastern United States and the Fall Zone. Our analyses suggest that the downwarping recorded by these isobases may be explained by Daly's hypothesis of a collapsing peripheral or marginal ""bulge."""

https://openalex.org/W2071413000,"Optical observations of the 18th magnitude blue star and of the faint red object in the approximate location of the pulsating radio source CP 1919 disclose no pulsations of visible light, in a mode similar to that of the radio pulsations, of more than 0.4 percent or 0.8 percent, respectively, of the total visible output; or, for a sinusoidal modulation with the same period, no more than a 4-percent, or 8-percent, root-mean-square intensity fluctuation."
https://openalex.org/W1993003518,"to as supporters ofthe report are reported to be scientists whose major work is largely outside the grenhouse field. It is hard to know what is meant by this. Virtually no one I know of has devoted his or her career to the greenhouse field. However, each of the scientists mentioned (Reginald Newell, Jerome Namias, and myself) has published more papers on climate dynamics in the refereed professional literature than have any of the other figures mentioned in the article. In the letter by Namias and myself that is referred to by Roberts, we simply endorsed the major conclusions of the Marshall Institute report: namely, that first, no evidence for the existence of the greenhouse effect can be found in the temperature records of the last 100 years; and second, current forecasts of global warming for the 21st century are so inaccurate and fraught with uncertainty as to be useless to policy-makers. We still endorse these conclusions. As for the importance of research,"

https://openalex.org/W2027054119,"U.S. trade policy since the end of World War II has rested on two pillars: a multilateral approach to trade agreements and a commitment to rules rather than results. Support for each principle is rapidly eroding because of, among other things, record trade deficits and pessimism about the effects of exchange rate movements on trade flows. In fact, however, U.S. trade deficits are largely ""homemade,"" and trade flows are responsive to changes in exchange rates. The U.S. has played a leadership role in promoting freer trade on a multilateral basis. Adoption of any one of a number of recently proposed alternative trade policy frameworks would be counter to that role."
