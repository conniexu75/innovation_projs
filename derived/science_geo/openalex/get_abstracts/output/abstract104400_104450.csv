https://openalex.org/W1980477780,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons, leading to progressive paralysis with muscular atrophy. The gene for SMA has been mapped to chromosome 5q13, where large-scale deletions have been reported. We describe here the inverted duplication of a 500 kb element in normal chromosomes and narrow the critical region to 140 kb within the telomeric region. This interval contains a 20 kb gene encoding a novel protein of 294 amino acids. An highly homologous gene is present in the centromeric element of 95% of controls. The telomeric gene is either lacking or interrupted in 226 of 229 patients, and patients retaining this gene (3 of 229) carry either a point mutation (Y272C) or short deletions in the consensus splice sites of introns 6 and 7. These data suggest that this gene, termed the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene, is an SMA-determining gene."
https://openalex.org/W2117669008,"The small guanine nucleotide binding protein Ras participates in a growth promoting signal transduction pathway. The mechanism by which interaction of Ras with the protein kinase Raf leads to activation of Raf was studied. Raf was targeted to the plasma membrane by addition of the COOH-terminal localization signals of K-ras. This modified form of Raf (RafCAAX) was activated to the same extent as Raf coexpressed with oncogenic mutant Ras. Plasma membrane localization rather than farnesylation or the presence of the additional COOH-terminal sequence accounted for the activation of RafCAAX. The activation of RafCAAX was completely independent of Ras; it was neither potentiated by oncogenic mutant Ras nor abrogated by dominant negative Ras. Raf, once recruited to the plasma membrane, was not anchored there by Ras; most activated Raf in cells was associated with plasma membrane cytoskeletal elements, not the lipid bilayer. Thus, Ras functions in the activation of Raf by recruiting Raf to the plasma membrane where a separate, Ras-independent, activation of Raf occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1975449325,"The spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs), characterized by spinal cord motor neuron depletion, are among the most common autosomal recessive disorders. One model of SMA pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of normally occurring motor neuron apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the novel gene for neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) has been mapped to the SMA region of chromosome 5q13.1 and is homologous with baculoviral apoptosis inhibitor proteins. The two first coding exons of this gene are deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis reveals internally deleted and mutated forms of the NAIP transcript in type I SMA individuals and not in unaffected individuals. These findings suggest that mutations in the NAIP locus may lead to a failure of a normally occurring inhibition of motor neuron apoptosis resulting in or contributing to the SMA phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2079439306,"Peptides from endogenous proteins are presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, but antigens (Ags) in the extracellular fluids are generally not. However, pathogens or particulate Ags that are internalized into phagosomes of macrophages (M phi s) stimulate CD8 T cells. The presentation of these Ags is resistant to chloroquine but is blocked by inhibitors of the proteasome, a mutation in the TAP1-TAP2 transporter, and brefeldin A. Moreover, phagocytosis of a ribosomal-inactivating protein inhibited M phi protein synthesis. These results demonstrate that M phi s transfer Ags from phagosomes into the cytosol and that endogenous and exogenous Ags use a final common pathway for class I presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1972607828,"Orotic acid is decarboxylated with a half-time (t1/2) of 78 million years in neutral aqueous solution at room temperature, as indicated by reactions in quartz tubes at elevated temperatures. Spontaneous hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, such as those present in the backbone of DNA, proceeds even more slowly at high temperatures, but the heat of activation is less positive, so that dimethyl phosphate is hydrolyzed with a t1/2 of 130,000 years in neutral solution at room temperature. These values extend the known range of spontaneous rate constants for reactions that are also susceptible to catalysis by enzymes to more than 14 orders of magnitude. Values of the second-order rate constant kcat/Km for the corresponding enzyme reactions are confined to a range of only 600-fold, in contrast. Orotidine 5′-phosphate decarboxylase, an extremely proficient enzyme, enhances the rate of reaction by a factor of 1017 and is estimated to bind the altered substrate in the transition state with a dissociation constant of less than 5 × 10-24 M."
https://openalex.org/W1985360296,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are thought to influence many processes in vertebrate development because of their diverse sites of expression and wide range of biological activities in in vitro culture systems. As a means of elucidating embryonic functions of FGF-4, gene targeting was used to generate mice harboring a disrupted Fgf4 gene. Embryos homozygous for the null allele underwent uterine implantation and induced uterine decidualization but did not develop substantially thereafter. As was consistent with their behavior in vivo, Fgf4 null embryos cultured in vitro displayed severely impaired proliferation of the inner cell mass, whereas growth and differentiation of the inner cell mass were rescued when null embryos were cultured in the presence of FGF-4 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2068712558,"The contributions of adaptation, chance, and history to the evolution of fitness and cell size were measured in two separate experiments using bacteria. In both experiments, populations propagated in identical environments achieved similar fitnesses, regardless of prior history or subsequent chance events. In contrast, the evolution of cell size, a trait weakly correlated with fitness, was more strongly influenced by history and chance."
https://openalex.org/W2064194464,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2007255413,"The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) regulates progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The activity of CDK4 is controlled by the opposing effects of the D-type cyclin, an activating subunit, and p16INK4, an inhibitory subunit. Ectopic expression of p16INK4 blocked entry into S phase of the cell cycle induced by oncogenic Ha-Ras, and this block was relieved by coexpression of a catalytically inactive CDK4 mutant. Expression of p16INK4 suppressed cellular transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by oncogenic Ha-Ras and Myc, but not by Ha-Ras and E1a. Together, these observations provide direct evidence that p16INK4 can inhibit cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1566117045,"In response to a septic injury (pricking with a bacteria-soaked needle) larvae and adults of Drosophila produce considerable amounts of a 44-residue peptide containing 8 cysteines engaged in intramolecular disulfide bridges. The peptide is synthesized in the fat body, a functional homologue of the mammalian liver, and secreted into the blood of the insect. It exhibits potent antifungal activity but is inactive against bacteria. This novel inducible peptide, which we propose to name drosomycin, shows a significant homology with a family of 5-kDa cysteine-rich plant antifungal peptides recently isolated from seeds of Brassicaceae. This finding underlines that plants and insects can rely on similar molecules in their innate host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2075834102,"Inward rectifier K+ channels mediate the K+ conductance at resting potential in many types of cell. Since these K+ channels do not pass outward currents (inward rectification) when the cell membrane is depolarized beyond a trigger threshold, they play an important role in controlling excitability. Both a highly voltage-dependent block by intracellular Mg2+ and an endogenous gating process are presently assumed to underly inward rectification. It is shown that strong voltage dependence of rectification found under physiological conditions is predominantly due to the effect of intracellular spermine. Physiological concentrations of free spermine mediate strong rectification of IRK1 inward rectifier K+ channels even in the absence of free Mg2+ and in IRK1 mutant channels that have no endogenous rectification."
https://openalex.org/W2033543877,"For almost 30 years, the predictions of big-bang nucleosynthesis have been used to test the big-bang model to within a fraction of a second of the bang. The agreement between the predicted and observed abundances of deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7 confirms the standard cosmology model and allows accurate determination of the baryon density, between 1.7 x 10(-31) and 4.1 x 10(-31) grams per cubic centimeter (corresponding to about 1 to 15 percent of the critical density). This measurement of the density of ordinary matter is pivotal to the establishment of two dark-matter problems: (i) most of the baryons are dark, and (ii) if the total mass density is greater than about 15 percent of the critical density, as many determinations indicate, the bulk of the dark matter must be ""non-baryonic,"" composed of elementary particles left from the earliest moments."
https://openalex.org/W2017533703,"Somatic hypermutation of light chain V genes during development of B cells in sheep ileal Peyer's patches was studied in three experimental conditions: in sterile fragments of the ileum surgically isolated from the gut during fetal life, in germ-free sheep, and in animals thymectomized during early fetal life. The somatic mutation pattern was found identical to control tissues in all three experiments. The same age-dependent amount of mutations, a higher than theoretical R/S ratio in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), and a similar clustering of mutations in CDRs were observed. The mechanism, as estimated from the silent mutation pattern, appears to target mutations to CDRs; moreover, the major V lambda genes have a specific codon usage with a high purine content at the first two bases of the codons and a low content at the third position, which, together with a specific targeting of mutations to purines, favors replacement mutations in CDRs."
https://openalex.org/W2039068784,"Yeast TFIIH that is active in transcription can be dissociated into three components: a 5-subunit core, the SSL2 gene product, and a complex of 47 kDa, 45 kDa, and 33 kDa polypeptides that possesses protein kinase activity directed towards the C-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II. These three components can reconstitute fully functional TFIIH, and all three are required for transcription in vitro. By contrast, TFIIH that is highly active in nucleotide excision repair (NER) lacks the kinase complex and instead contains the products of all other genes known to be required for NER in yeast: RAD1, RAD2, RAD4, RAD10, and RAD14. This repairosome is not active in reconstituted transcription in vitro and is significantly more active than any of the constituent polypeptides in correcting defective repair in extracts from strains mutated in NER genes."
https://openalex.org/W1575127176,"We have cloned an alternatively spliced glycosaminoglycan attachment domain (GAG-alpha) of human versican from cDNA libraries derived from U251MG glioma cells. Inserted carboxyl-terminal of the hyaluronan-binding region, this domain adds another 987 amino acids to the original versican (V1) core protein giving rise to the large V0 isoform with 3396 amino acids and 17-23 putative glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The GAG-alpha domain is encoded by exon 7 of the human versican gene (Naso et al., J. Biol. Chem., 32999-33008). Sequence comparisons revealed a slight similarity to the alternative splice domain of PG-M, further supporting the notion that PG-M is the chicken homologue of versican. On immunoblots of a proteoglycan preparation from U251MG culture medium, anti-GAG-alpha antibodies reacted exclusively with the larger of two versican core proteins recognized by antibodies against the original GAG-beta domain. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected both the V0 and V1 isoforms in the cerebral cortex, aorta, intervertebral disc, liver, myometrium, and prostate, whereas keratinocytes exclusively expressed versican V1. In brain tissue, we identified a short versican variant (V2) including only the GAG-alpha domain. By expressing particular splice forms of versican, cells may control the hydration properties of their pericellular hyaluronan coat and thus could modulate interactions with the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051379969,"Extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) induces the formation of prespore cells in Dictyostelium but inhibits stalk cell formation. We have cloned gskA, which encodes the Dictyostelium homolog of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and discovered that it is required for both cAMP effects. Disruption of gskA creates a mutant that aggregates but forms few spores and an abnormally high number of stalk cells. These stalk cells probably arise from an expanded prestalk B (pstB) cell population, which normally produces the basal disc of the fruiting body. In cultured mutant cells, cAMP neither inhibits pstB cell differentiation nor induces efficient prespore cell differentiation. We propose that cAMP acts through a common pathway that requires GSK-3 and determines the proportion of prespore and pstB cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034018916,"Overexpression of a yeast gene, HAL2, allows the cells to tolerate higher than normal extracellular salt concentrations. HAL2 encodes a 3'(2')5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase that serves to remove the end products of sulfate transfer during cellular metabolism. The enzyme is inhibited by lithium and sodium and is activated by potassium. Metabolic systems that are sensitive to salt, as well as those governing osmolyte synthesis and ion transport, offer routes by which genetic engineering can be used to improve the tolerance of various organisms to salt."
https://openalex.org/W2043813249,"The mechanism of translocation of matrix-targeted, cleavable preproteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane was studied using purified outer membrane vesicles. The N-terminal presequence interacts in a sequential and reversible fashion with two specific binding sites. The first one is provided by protease-sensitive receptors on the surface of the membrane (cis site); the second one is located at the inner face of the outer membrane (trans site). Binding to the trans site drives translocation of the N-terminal portion of the preprotein and, at the same time, unfolding of its mature part. We suggest that the outer membrane protein import machinery forms a translocation channel that permits reversible sliding of preproteins and prevents their lateral aggregation in the membrane. Although translocation can be initiated by the outer membrane, its completion requires coupling to the energetic system of the inner membrane. Our data assign an essential role to the presequence, not only for efficient targeting, but also for the translocation step."
https://openalex.org/W1617781531,"Proteoglycans synthesized by chondrocytes in alginate beads are found in two compartments: the cell-associated matrix and the further removed matrix (Hauselmann, H. J., Aydelotte M. B., Schumacher B. L., Kuettner K. E., Gitelis, S. H., and Thonar, E. J.-M. A. (1992) Matrix 12, 116-129). To study the metabolism of aggrecan in these two compartments, mature bovine articular chondrocytes in alginate beads were pulsed with [35S]sulfate for 30 min or 16 h on day 7 of culture and then chased in isotope-free medium for up to 21 days. At different times, the two matrix pools were separately isolated, and the 35S-proteoglycans quantified, purified, and characterized. Radiolabeled aggrecan molecules exhibited a very long average half-life in the beads (t1/2 = 95 days). In contrast, small non-aggregating proteoglycans, which made up approximately 4% of the 35S-proteoglycans synthesized, were rapidly lost from the beads (t1/2 = 95 days versus 15 days). Radiolabeled aggrecan subunits in the two matrix compartments had a similar average hydrodynamic size and polydispersity; importantly, the size of these molecules did not change during the chase period. Catabolism of 35S-aggrecan in the cell-associated matrix was the only significant contributor to the appearance in the medium of partially degraded 35S-aggrecan which had lost the ability to bind to hyaluronan. These results strongly suggest aggrecan molecules which reside in the pericellular and territorial matrix compartments in close proximity to the chondrocytes have a much faster rate of turnover than their counterpart in the interterritorial areas further removed from the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140242855,"Small differences in the ratio of neodymium-142 to neodymium-144 in early formed mantle reservoirs in planetary bodies are the result of in situ decay of the extinct radionuclide samarium-146 and can be used to constrain early planetary differentiation and therefore the time scale of planetary accretion. The martian meteorite Nakhla (approximately 1.3 billion years old), the type sample of the nakhlite subgroup of the Shergottite-Nakhlite-Chassigny (SNC) meteorites, exhibits a 59 +/- 13 parts per million excess in the ratio of neodymium-142 to neodymium-144 relative to normal neodymium. This anomaly records differentiation in the martian mantle before 4539 million years ago and implies that Mars experienced no giant impacts at any time later than 27 million years after the origin of the solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2022704908,"Computer modeling suggested that transcription factors with novel sequence specificities could be designed by combining known DNA binding domains. This structure-based strategy was tested by construction of a fusion protein, ZFHD1, that contained zinc fingers 1 and 2 from Zif268, a short polypeptide linker, and the homeodomain from Oct-1. The fusion protein bound optimally to a sequence containing adjacent homeodomain (TAATTA) and zinc finger (NGGGNG) subsites. When fused to an activation domain, ZFHD1 regulated promoter activity in vivo in a sequence-specific manner. Analysis of known protein-DNA complexes suggests that many other DNA binding proteins could be designed in a similar fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1995866544,"A variant form of a group I ribozyme, optimized by in vitro evolution for its ability to catalyze magnesium-dependent phosphoester transfer reactions involving DNA substrates, also catalyzes the cleavage of an unactivated alkyl amide when that linkage is presented in the context of an oligodeoxynucleotide analog. Substrates containing an amide bond that joins either two DNA oligos, or a DNA oligo and a short peptide, are cleaved in a magnesium-dependent fashion to generate the expected products. The first-order rate constant, kcat, is 0.1 x 10(-5) min-1 to 1 x 10(-5) min-1 for the DNA-flanked substrates, which corresponds to a rate acceleration of more than 10(3) as compared with the uncatalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2005697722,"DNA solutions subjected to an electric field exhibit an instability that leads to DNA segregation in aggregates tilted with regard to the field. With the use of epifluorescence videomicroscopy, the evolution of DNA patterns in capillaries as a function of DNA concentration, DNA size, field strength, and field frequency was studied. The field threshold for segregation was decreased when the frequency was lowered or when the DNA molecular weight or concentration was increased. Aggregation is attributed to an electrohydrodynamic instability triggered by the dipole-dipole interaction. This phenomenon explains the failure of earlier attempts to separate large DNA in capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W1592954421,"The fluorogenic maleimide 7-diethylamino-3-(4'-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) has been shown to selectively form Michael adducts with hyperreactive sulfhydryls on the skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and triadin which are essential for normal Ca2+ channel function (Liu, G., Abramson, J.J., Zable, A.C., and Pessah, I.N. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 189-200). The present report demonstrates a functionally important interaction between RyR1 and triadin which involves, in part, redox cycling of hyperreactive sulfhydryls in response to channel activation and inactivation. Nanomolar CPM is shown to selectively label RyR1 and triadin only in the presence of Ca2+ channel inhibitors (Mg2+, neomycin, ruthenium red, or anti-triadin antibody). Treatment of SR with channel activators (micromolar Ca2+, nanomolar ryanodine, or millimolar caffeine), 1) slows CPM labeling kinetics > 10-fold, 2) negates CPM labeling of channel-associated sulfhydryls, and 3) stabilizes a high molecular weight complex (HMWC) which appears on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The HMWC is positively identified as RyR1 and triadin by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses. High-affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding sites are immunoprecipitated by either anti-RyR1 or anti-triadin antibody dose dependently. 1,4-Naphthoquinone (< or = 40 pmol/micrograms protein) selectively oxidizes hyperreactive sulfhydryls on RyR1 and triadin, induces Ca2+ efflux from SR, and stabilizes the HMWC. The HMWC is reduced by beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol into its component RyR1 and triadin promoters. The results provide direct evidence for the existence of a functionally important complex between RyR1 and triadin whose stability is determined by the redox state of hyperreactive sulfhydryl moieties which are allosterically regulated by physiological and pharmacological channel ligands. The present results suggest a possible molecular mechanism by which localized transient changes in the redox state within the RyR1-triadin complex can signal information across the SR membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1574978057,"The T4 bacteriophage gene 59 protein is required for normal T4 DNA replication. We have purified this protein to homogeneity in two steps and show that it binds both to single-stranded DNA and to the T4 gene 32 protein, a DNA single strand binding protein. In in vitro assays, covering DNA with 32 protein makes this DNA inaccessible to the 41 protein, the highly processive DNA helicase, that associates with the T4 DNA primase (gene 61 protein) to form an active primosome. However, the 59 protein brings about the rapid assembly of 41 protein onto single-stranded DNA, even if this DNA is covered with 32 protein. The 59 protein is therefore a DNA helicase assembly protein. The observed requirements for the 59 protein in the vivo T4 DNA replication are explained by there being two alternative pathways for loading the 41 protein onto a replication fork at early times of T4 DNA synthesis, with only a 59 protein-mediated pathway remaining operative for the recombination-mediated replication that dominates later in infection (Barry, J., and Alberts, B. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 33063-33068)."
https://openalex.org/W1645430207,"Transthyretin (TTR) is the principal carrier of thyroid hormones in rodent plasma and the major protein synthesized by the choroid plexus. Mice lacking TTR generated by targeted disruption (Episkopou, V., Maeda, S., Nishiguchi, S., Shimada, K., Gaitanaris, G. A., Gottesman, M. E., and Robertson, E. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 2375-2379) had a 50% decrease in total thyroxine (T4) plasma levels but had normal free hormone levels as compared to wild-type mice. In the mutant serum there was increased T4 binding to thyroxine-binding globulin. Thyroxine-binding globulin mRNA levels were the same in mutant and wild-type animals. Wild-type serum depleted of TTR also presented increased T4 binding to thyroxine-binding globulin, suggesting that TTR competes with thyroxine-binding globulin for T4 binding. Total and free triiodothyronine and thyrotoropin-stimulating hormone levels were not affected by the absence of TTR. Liver deiodinase-I activity, mRNA levels, and brain deiodinase-II activity were normal in the mutant mice, suggesting that the absence of TTR does not affect tissue thyroid hormone content. The low T4 levels found in the mutant mice sera cannot be accounted for by increased glucuronidation because the liver activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase was not affected in the TTR-deficient mice. We concluded that transthyretin-deficient mice are euthyroid in the absence of the major plasma T4 carrier. We ascribed this to the normal free hormone levels in the serum of the mutant mice. Our data, therefore, strongly supported the free hormone hypothesis for thyroxine uptake (Mendel, C. M. (1989) Endocr. Rev. 10, 232-274)."
https://openalex.org/W1517759896,"The activation of p21ras by receptor tyrosine kinases involves the translocation of the growth factor receptor bound protein 2-mammalian son of sevenless protein (Grb2-SOS) complex to the plasma membrane where p21ras is localized. Insulin receptors induce p21ras-GTP formation by two possible mechanisms: tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and its subsequent association with Grb2, or Shc phosphorylation and its subsequent association with Grb2. We investigated the contribution of the major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163 of the insulin receptor to IRS1.Grb2 and Shc.Grb2 association and the formation of p21ras-GTP. Chinese hamster ovary-derived cell lines were used overexpressing mutant insulin receptors in which the major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites were stepwise replaced by phenylalanines. In cell lines expressing wild type or mutant Y1158F,Y1162,Y1163 (FYY) receptors, insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and Shc and the formation of IRS1.Grb2 and Shc.Grb2 protein complexes, together with an increase in p21ras-GTP. Cell lines expressing mutant Y1158,Y1162F,Y1163F (YFF) receptors showed insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, Shc.Grb2 complex formation, and p21ras-GTP formation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 was strongly decreased and formation of IRS1.Grb2 complexes was undetectable. The activity of FYY and YFF receptors to mediate p21ras-GTP formation correlated with their activity to induce Shc phosphorylation and Shc.Grb2 association. The mutant insulin receptors Y1158F,Y1162F,Y1163 and Y1158F,Y1162F,Y1163F were inactive in inducing any of these responses. We conclude that phosphorylation of Tyr1158 and Tyr1162 of the insulin receptor is linked to distinct post-receptor processes and that YFF receptors generate p21ras-GTP via the Shc.Grb2 pathway rather than one involving IRS1.Grb2 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1534872681,"The T4 gene 59 protein (gp59) serves as an accessory protein to the essential T4-encoded DNA helicase, the gene 41 protein (gp41). gp59 stimulates gp41-dependent DNA synthesis reactions by promoting the assembly of gp41 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where the enzyme is activated to perform its DNA helicase functions. To better understand the mechanism of helicase-ssDNA assembly, we have studied the effects of gp59 on the intrinsic and ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activities of gp41. Our results indicate that gp59 exerts a direct effect upon the conformation and ATPase activity of gp41, by increasing the affinity of gp41 for ATP. In addition, we find that gp59 is nearly essential for promoting the assembly of gp41 onto ssDNA molecules that are covered with saturating amounts of the T4-encoded helix-destabilizing protein, gene 32 protein (gp32). Results of protein affinity chromatography experiments suggest that gp59 contains distinct binding sites for gp41 and gp32 and may therefore act as a molecular adapter between the helicase and helix-destabilizing proteins. Together, the data indicate that specific gp59-gp41 and gp59-gp32 protein-protein interactions both play important roles in the assembly of the helicase onto single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1552964273,"We examined the expression and activity of Cdk4 and Cdk2 in resting, competent, and proliferating normal human T cells. Expression of Cdk4 but not of Cdk2 was induced in competent T cells independent of an IL-2 signal. This up-regulation of Cdk4 mRNA and protein was resistant to the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. A further increase in Cdk4 expression was seen upon stimulation of competent T cells by IL-2, as was de novo expression of Cdk2. Cyclin D2, a Cdk4 partner, showed similar patterns of regulation as Cdk4. The increases in Cdk4 and cyclin D2 expression seen in competent T cells were functionally significant since Cdk4 immunoprecipitates from these cells phosphorylated recombinant RB protein in vitro. Despite the lack of an increase in the expression of Cdk2, a small pool of pre-existing Cdk2 protein detected in resting T cells could be activated upon induction of competence. These data demonstrate that 1) the signals that lead to induction of competence in T cells stimulate an IL-2-independent and CsA-resistant phase of Cdk4 and cyclin D2 expression, Cdk4 kinase activity, and Cdk2 kinase activity, and 2) IL-2 stimulates a second phase of Cdk4 and cyclin D2 expression and de novo expression of Cdk2 in these cells. The data show that the expression and activity of these major cell cycle regulatory proteins are controlled differentially by growth factors and indicate a role for Cdk4 and cyclin D2 in T-cell cycle entry and/or early G1 progression and for Cdk2 in later G1 progression and G1/S transition."
https://openalex.org/W1993651755,A biosensor system based on the response of living cells was demonstrated that can detect specific components of a complex mixture fractionated by a microcolumn separation technique. This system uses ligand-receptor binding and signal-transduction pathways to biochemically amplify the presence of an analyte after electrophoretic separation. The transduced signal was measured by means of two approaches: (i) fluorescence determination of intracellular calcium concentrations in one or more rat PC-12 cells and (ii) measurement of transmembrane current in a Xenopus laevis oocyte microinjected with messenger RNA that encodes a specific receptor. This analysis system has the potential to identify biologically active ligands present in a complex mixture with exceptional sensitivity and selectivity.
https://openalex.org/W1559031924,"We describe an assay for measuring both the extent and kinetics of the severing of F-actin, based on the enhanced fluorescence emission of tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin bound to F-actin. The enhanced fluorescence is lost after exposure to active gelsolin by displacement of the phalloidin from actin during severing. This assay requires small amounts of actin and gelsolin, can be used to measure reaction times ranging from 1 to 10(3) s, and does not require covalent modification of either protein. The rate of fluorescence loss is linearly related to the concentrations of both actin and gelsolin. However, the apparent rate constant of the reaction is highly dependent on the divalent cation concentration, varying between 10(4) and 10(6) M-1 s-1 when the [Ca2+] varies between 20 and 200 microM. Addition of Mg2+ increases the apparent rate constant at equivalent Ca2+ concentration. These results suggest that in vitro the rate-limiting step in the severing process is the activation of gelsolin by the binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to several low affinity (Kd approximately 100 microM) sites on gelsolin. While activation of gelsolin by Ca2+ is a slow process, the binding and severing of actin occurs at a rate approaching the diffusion limit."
https://openalex.org/W1509358926,"In order to examine how norepinephrine stimulates proliferation and differentiation in brown fat cells, we have investigated the ability of brown fat cells to respond to norepinephrine stimulation with an increase in the expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos. Stimulation of brown fat precursor cells (isolated from young mice and grown for 4 days in culture) with norepinephrine led to a marked but transient (maximal approximately 30 min) induction of c-fos expression. The magnitude of this induction was similar in pre- and postconfluent cells. The norepinephrine effect could be blocked by both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. Forskolin had a small inductive ability, as had the selective alpha 1-agonist cirazoline, but with both together a high induction was obtained. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) could in itself induce c-fos expression, but pretreatment with TPA did not abolish the ability of norepinephrine to induce c-fos expression, indicating that TPA-sensitive protein kinase C was not a primary mediator in this pathway. Also the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 had in itself an inductive ability, but A23187 in combination with forskolin led to a large increase in c-fos expression, indicating synergistic interaction between a cAMP pathway and a [Ca2+]i pathway. This interaction was not proximal, i.e. alpha 1 stimulation or increase in [Ca2+]i by A23187 did not augment forskolin-induced cAMP levels, and beta stimulation or forskolin did not affect [Ca2+]i levels; and it did not require protein synthesis. It was concluded that norepinephrine, in agreement with its fundamental role in the control of brown fat cell growth and development, was able to induce c-fos expression, that this induction was not exclusively linked to promotion of either proliferation or differentiation, and that the induction was mediated via a distal synergism between beta/cAMP and alpha 1/[Ca2+]i pathways, thus conferring to the alpha 1-adrenoreceptors on the cell a potentially significant role in the control of cell growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W1491052444,"The interaction between the translational stop signal and the polypeptide chain release factor protein (RF) within complexes of Escherichia coli ribosomes has been investigated by site-directed photochemical cross-linking experiments. Twelve mRNA analogues containing 4-thiouridine residues as part of stop signals were synthesized. Highly efficient cross-linking to RF-2 from 4-thiouridine (sU) residues of sUGAN-containing mRNAs was observed, and cross-linking from those of sUAAN was observed at a lower efficiency. This indicates that RF-2 is in close physical contact with the stop signal on the ribosome. The yield of the RF-2-mRNA cross-link depended on the identity of the fourth base for the sUGAN set of signals, suggesting that the fourth base of the stop signal affects the interaction between RF-2 and the stop codon. A region previously implicated as part of the decoding site of the small ribosomal subunit, 1385-1420 of the 16 S rRNA, was also cross-linked with these mRNAs. No new cross-links were obtained in the presence of the release factor. The data are consistent with models in which the RF has an anticodon-like domain that contacts the stop signal directly at or near the ribosomal site in which sense codons are decoded."
https://openalex.org/W1489547525,"Aspartylation of mammalian tRNAAsp by bacteria-expressed human aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (hDRS) was examined. The kinetics of the aspartylation of tRNA was consistent with the following reaction pathway, [formula: see text] where E, represents aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. A set of rate constants was obtained which fit single turnover time courses at varying concentrations of the enzyme, tRNA, and AMP using the SAAM program. The dissociation of Asp-tRNA (k3) was found to be rate limiting. The elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1 alpha) and GTP stimulated the hDRS aspartylation. The stimulation depended on the presence of both EF1 alpha and GTP. Kinetic analysis indicated that EF1 alpha formed a complex with the hDRS-Asp-tRNA complex and stimulated the dissociation of Asp-tRNA. In the presence of 0.5 M NH4Cl, which enhances the binding of Asp-tRNA by EF1 alpha, hDRS-bound Asp-tRNA can be transferred directly to EF1 alpha. The implications of these results on the function of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556554561,"The insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), a nonlysosomal enzyme involved in the metabolism of internalized insulin, is a member of a new family of metalloproteases which has an HXXEH active site motif. We have previously shown that both His108 and Glu111 within the HXCEH domain of human IDE are necessary for catalytic activity. Comparison to the prototypic zinc metalloprotease thermolysin, which contains an inversion of this motif, would predict that His112, as well as a downstream glutamate, serves as the second and third zinc ligands of IDE. To examine the role of His112, we mutated this residue to glutamine, leucine, or arginine. To identify a downstream zinc ligand, we substituted a glutamine for glutamate at either Glu182 or Glu189, both of which are conserved in human, rat, and Drosophila IDE. Vectors containing wild type or mutant IDE genes were transfected into COS cells, and the enzymes were analyzed for insulin degradation, insulin cross-linking, and zinc binding. Our results suggest that His108, His112, and Glu189 are the zinc ligands of human IDE, and Glu182 can influence zinc binding. In addition to a catalytic role, zinc binding to these residues appears to play a role in stabilizing the structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1601391254,"A chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) protein from an epithelial cell line of Chironomus tentans (Diptera) was purified to homogeneity and chemically characterized. cDNA clones encoding this protein were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high similarity to HMG protein I of mammalia. This insect protein has therefore been designated cHMGI. It has a deduced molecular mass of 10,371 kDa and appears to be a product of a single gene copy. Similarly to mammalian HMGI/Y proteins the insect cHMGI protein has three putative DNA-binding motifs with a sequence K/RXRGRP that are each encoded by one exon of the gene. Using synthetic peptides we have shown that the first and the second motif are necessary for high-affinity binding of the protein to DNA. Protein cHMGI binds preferentially to AT-rich DNA with a half-saturation value of 1.1 nM. Both cHMGI and human HMGI proteins recognize specifically a four-way junction DNA. We have also purified a related protein with similar physico-chemical properties from Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells. The identification and characterization of HMGI proteins in insects with polytene chromosomes and with the cytologic and genetic potential of Chironomus and Drosophila opens new possibilities for studying function(s) of this group of chromosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1480830299,"Vitellogenin genes are expressed specifically in the liver of female oviparous vertebrates under the strict control of estrogen. To explain this tissue-specific expression, we performed a detailed analysis of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin gene B1 promoter by DNase I footprinting and gel mobility-shift assays. We characterized five binding sites for the ubiquitous factor CTF/NF-I. Two of these sites are close to the TATA-box, whereas the others are located on both sides of the estrogen responsive unit formed by two imperfect estrogen response elements. Moreover two liver-enriched factors, C/EBP and HNF3, were found to interact with multiple closely spaced proximal promoter elements in the first 100 base pairs upstream of the TATA-box. To confirm the physiological significance of this in vitro analysis, in vivo DNase I footprinting experiments were carried out using the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique. The various cis-elements characterized in vitro as binding sites for known transcription factors and more particularly for liver-enriched transcription factors are efficiently recognized in vivo as well, suggesting that they play an important role in the control of the liver-specific vitellogenin gene B1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1593414662,"Mycoplasma fermentans is thought to be a pathogen of rheumatoid arthritis or cofactor of AIDS. A novel phosphocholine-containing glycoglycerophospholipid named GGPL-I was isolated from a M. fermentans-infected human helper T-cell culture. It was revealed that GGPL-I is a lipid component of the M. fermentans and a major immunological determinant. The GGPL-I was purified by DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography and repeated Iatrobeads column chromatography. The purified glycophospholipid was subjected to structural characterization by thin-layer chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Its structure was determined to be as follows: 6'-O-phosphocholine-alpha-glucopyranosyl-(1'-3)-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol. This glycoglycerophospholipid is unique in containing phosphocholine, which is attached to C-6 of glucose. The stereospecific numbering (sn) of naturally occurring GGPL-I was determined through comparison with chemically synthesized compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2110425817,"We have determined the precise chromosomal location, the exon structure, and the expression pattern of CGM2, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. CGM2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) from the colon adenocarcinoma cell line, LS174T. A defective exon is missing from this cDNA clone, leading to a novel domain organization for the human CEA family with two immunoglobulin-like domains. The derived C-terminal domain predicts that the CGM2 protein is membrane-bound through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. RT/PCR analyses identified CGM2 transcripts in mucinous ovarian and colonic adenocarcinomas as well as in adjacent colonic tissue, but not in other tumors including leukocytes from six chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Thus, unlike several other family members, CGM2 is not expressed in granulocytes but reveals a more CEA-like expression pattern. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.5-kilobase CGM2 mRNA that is strongly down-regulated in colonic adenocarcinomas compared with adjacent colonic mucosa, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function. In addition, a 3.2-kilobase transcript was observed in a number of colon tumors that is not detectable in normal colonic tissue. This mRNA species could represent a tumor-specific CGM2 splice variant."
https://openalex.org/W1541138432,"The kinetics of the N-terminal 32 residue-deleted human aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (hDRS delta 32) was analyzed. The kinetics of aspartyl-adenylate formation and Asp-tRNA synthesis by hDRS delta 32 were indistinguishable from those of hDRS. However, the dissociation of Asp-tRNA from hDRS delta 32 was much faster than that of hDRS. Unlike hDRS delta 32-catalyzed aspartylation of tRNA was not affected by the elongation factor 1 alpha. Two N-terminal peptides of hDRS, hDRS(T5-E26) and hDRS(D12-R27), were synthesized. Both peptides bind to tRNA-Sepharose. Both peptides, hDRS(T5-E26) and hDRS(D12-R27), are monomeric and oligomerize at high peptide concentration or in 50% propylene glycol. The peptide hDRS(T5-E26) showed little alpha-helical content as analyzed by CD spectroscopy, while hDRS(D12-R27) showed appreciable alpha-helical contents in nonpolar solvents. These results suggest that the N terminus in hDRS may mediate the slow release of Asp-tRNA and facilitate the interaction of the hDRS.Asp-tRNA complex with the elongation factor 1 alpha. The demonstration of alpha-helix formation of the hDRS N-terminal peptide is consistent with the hypothetical amphiphilic helix of the N-terminal extension in hDRS. A model for the transfer of Asp-tRNA from hDRS to elongation factor 1 alpha is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1600484978,"The T4 bacteriophage gene 41 protein is the highly processive DNA helicase of the T4 primosome, a central part of the protein machinery that moves the T4 DNA replication fork. The T4 gene 59 protein accelerates the loading of 41 protein onto DNA covered with 32 protein (the T4 single strand binding protein), and it makes the 41 protein DNA helicase activity rapidly available to catalyze replication fork movement through a DNA double helix (Barry, J., and Alberts, B.M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 33049-33062). With the aid of the 59 protein, we show that the T4 primosome (the T4 gene 41 and 61 proteins) can move rapidly through a promoter-bound RNA polymerase molecule that would otherwise stop replication fork movement. A second, very different DNA helicase, the T4 dda protein, provides an alternative pathway for replication past this DNA-bound RNA polymerase (Bedinger, P., Hochstrasser, M., Jongeneel, C. V., and Alberts, B.M. (1983) Cell 34, 115-123). Combined with other data, these in vitro experiments allow us to propose a model that explains why either the 59 protein or the dda protein, but not both, are required to begin efficient DNA replication inside the T4 bacteriophage-infected cell."
https://openalex.org/W1531011031,"Ras p21 in the GTP-bound form was shown to act as an upstream activator for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MAPKK) and MAP kinase, and Raf-1 was reported to act as a MAPKK kinase. Further, physical association between Ras and Raf-1 was demonstrated. Here we have shown that incubation of Xenopus immature oocyte extracts with Ras enhances the ability of endogenous Raf-1 to activate MAPKK. Moreover, a dominant negative form of Raf-1 blocked the Ras-induced activation of MAPKK and MAP kinase in the extracts, but not the cyclin A-dependent activation of MAP kinase. When the extracts were depleted of 45-kDa MAPKK with polyclonal anti-MAPKK antibody, no activation of MAP kinase occurred even after incubation with Ras. These results suggest that Ras can activate the MAPKK kinase activity of Raf-1 in the extracts and that MAPKK is indispensable for the Ras-induced MAP kinase activation. It is well known that Ras can induce oocyte maturation when injected into immature Xenopus oocytes. Co-injection of Ras with an anti-MAPKK antibody that inhibits the MAPKK activity prevented the Ras-induced germinal vesicle breakdown, suggesting that MAPKK mediates, at least, one of cellular functions of Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1598520374,"Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the presence of ATP and E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein forms an initiation complex on a primed template capable of rapid and highly processive DNA replication. DNase I digestion of initiation complexes demonstrated that holoenzyme protected 27-30 nucleotides of primer. Like the formation of initiation complexes, this protection required both ATP and E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Initiation complexes assembled with core DNA polymerase III (alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits), gamma-complex (gamma, delta, delta', chi, and omega) and the beta subunit produced a footprint identical to that formed with intact holoenzyme, indicating that initiation complexes formed with reconstituted enzyme and those formed with holoenzyme were equivalent. The presence of the tau subunit in reconstituted initiation complexes did not alter the DNase I footprint. Preinitiation complexes (gamma-complex plus beta subunit) assembled onto primer-template in an ATP-dependent reaction protected a larger region of the primer than did holoenzyme. The addition of core DNA polymerase III to preintiation complexes restored the 30-nucleotide footprint observed with intact holoenzyme. These results suggest that holoenzyme subunits rearrange during initiation complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1541130370,"A novel membrane-bound serine proteinase has been purified from the microsomal membranes of porcine intestinal mucosa. It was solubilized from the microsomal membrane fraction with 1% sodium deoxycholate, then purified by a series of column chromatographic steps on DE52, butyl-Toyopearl, Bio-Gel P-150, Mono Q, and benzamidine-Sepharose in the presence of 0.02% Lubrol PX. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 50 kDa both by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions and by gel filtration, and to be 32 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, suggesting that the enzyme may exist as a homodimer in which two subunits are linked by disulfide bond(s). It had a pH optimum at around 9 and did not require Ca2+ for activity. It cleaved several peptide 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide substrates almost exclusively after arginine residues, the best substrate among those tested being t-butyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide. Various neuropeptides were also cleaved by this enzyme after arginine, mainly between paired basic amino acid residues, Arg-Arg or Arg-Lys. Activity toward protein substrates was scarcely detected. Further, its partial amino acid sequences were highly homologous, but not identical, with those of trypsin-type serine proteinases. These results indicate that the present enzyme is a novel arginine-specific trypsin-like endopeptidase, possibly involved as a processing proteinase in the production of certain gastrointestinal neuropeptides or peptide hormones from their precursors, or their specific degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2148192328,"We previously reconstituted the ATP-dependent inactivation of asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes (Medh, J. D., and Weigel, P. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8771-8778). Here we report that rat hepatic lectin 1 (RHL1) is the only ASGPR subunit that becomes radiolabeled when permeabilized washed hepatocytes are incubated at 4 degrees C in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP; RHL2 and RHL3 are not radiolabeled. Phosphorylation of RHL1 was rapid (t1/2 appoximately 4 min) and complete within 30 min. Inclusion of 20 mM EDTA inhibited phosphorylation of RHL1 completely. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified Tyr(P) as the predominant (> 90%) radiolabeled phosphoamino acid. Addition of vanadate enhanced phosphorylation of Tyr in RHL1 4-fold. Phosphorylation of RHL1 occurred to the same extent in hepatocytes permeabilized with either 0.006% (w/v) or 0.055% digitonin and in the presence or the absence of ligand (50 micrograms/ml asialo-orosomucoid; ASOR) and/or 10 mM CaCl2. Sequential purification of active ASGPRs (using ASOR-Sepharose) and inactive ASGPRs from the ASOR-Sepharose flow-through (using anti-ASGPR antibody-Sepharose) demonstrated that radiolabeled RHL1 was present almost exclusively in active ASGPR oligomers. When permeabilized hepatocytes radiolabeled with [gamma-32P]ATP at 4 degrees C were warmed to 37 degrees C, a temperature at which ATP-dependent ASGPR inactivation occurs, RHL1 was dephosphorylated rapidly (t1/2 approximately 4 min) and completely within approximately 30 min. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody showed that the steady-state level of endogenous Tyr(P) in RHL1 doubled as a result of ATP treatment at 4 degrees C and then decreased to undetectable levels upon warming to 37 degrees C. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin 51 inhibited phosphorylation of RHL1 at 4 degrees C and also prevented ATP-dependent ASGPR inactivation at 37 degrees C. We conclude that phosphorylation of Tyr in RHL1 of active ASGPRs is a prerequisite for ATP-dependent ASGPR inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1606435845,"TAP-1 (T-cell AP-1) is a previously identified DNA-binding activity that is rapidly induced in activated T cells in the absence of protein synthesis. This activity has been purified over 2,000-fold from the T-cell line MLA144. Purified TAP-1 is a multicomponent complex composed of 38-kDa and 43-kDa junD polypeptides in association with a separate factor(s), distinct from fos, that partly dissociate from the complex during affinity purification but is required for full TAP-1 DNA-binding activity. When reconstituted with TAP-1, this partly dissociated component strongly enhances the DNA-binding activity of the TAP-1 complex. UV-cross-linking analysis identifies the dissociable component of the TAP-1 complex as a separate class of low molecular mass (23-29-kDa) DNA-binding polypeptide(s). 23-29-kDa polypeptides have been partially purified from nuclear extracts derived from MLA144 that enhance TAP-1 DNA-binding activity over 100-fold and increase its contacts with flanking DNA sequence. These results define TAP-1 as a distinct AP-1.junD-containing complex in T cells whose DNA-binding activity is regulated by the interaction of distinct and separate cellular factor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2143291072,"The exact nature of how the insulin molecule interacts with the insulin receptor is obscure although chimeric receptors have shown that the ligand specificity of the insulin receptor and the IGF-I receptor (i.e. the sequences that discriminate between insulin and insulin-like growth factor I) reside in different regions of a common binding site and that the N-terminal 68 amino acids of the insulin receptor are involved in conferring specificity for insulin on this receptor (Kjeldsen, T., Andersen, A. S., Wiberg, F. C., Rasmussen, J. S., Schaffer, L., Balschmidt, P., Moller, K. B., and Moller, N. P. H. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 4404-4408). Using chimeric insulin/IGF-I receptors to elucidate how the insulin receptor interacts with the insulin molecule we identified phenylalanine 39 of the insulin receptor as a major contributor in determining the receptor specificity for insulin, increasing insulin affinity 15-fold when replacing the corresponding amino acid in the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. Furthermore, replacement of the insulin receptor amino acid phenylalanine 39 with the corresponding IGF-I receptor amino acid, serine 35, decreased insulin affinity 8-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1573529070,"Abstract Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays a key role in host protection at mucosal surfaces, yet little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that govern the expression of this isotype. The studies herein investigated mechanisms that control IgA secretion in response to stimulation with interleukin-4 and interleukin-5, cytokines which are known to regulate IgA responses, and to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Two mechanisms were shown to govern agonist induced IgA expression in a murine IgA expressing B cell line. In the initial period after stimulation, increased mRNA levels for the secreted form of alpha heavy chain (alpha s), and kappa light chain were paralleled by a transient increase in transcription rates of the corresponding genes. However, with prolonged agonist stimulation, gene transcription rates decreased to near control levels, and increased mRNA levels were associated with a coordinate increase in alpha s and kappa mRNA stability. In striking contrast, these agonists did not affect levels or stability of mRNA for the membrane form of alpha heavy chain (alpha m). Alpha s mRNAs contained multiple poly(A) addition sites located 13-32 nucleotides downstream of a single AAUAAA sequence. Nonetheless, the differential usage of these sites as a mechanism for controlling alpha s mRNA stability could be excluded, since the relative abundance of these different alpha s mRNAs did not differ significantly after agonist stimulation. These data, taken together, suggest that sequences within 107 nucleotides of the 3' end of alpha s mRNA, which are absent in alpha M mRNA, are required for the regulation of alpha s mRNA stability, possibly by acting as targets for regulated trans-acting cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W1581586194,"The heavy- and light-chain variable region genes of four different nucleic acid-binding antibodies (Jel 274 and Jel 72 (specific for duplex DNA), Jel 103 (specific for poly(rI)), and Jel 318 (specific for DNA triplexes)) were cloned. Single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) in which the heavy and light chains were joined by a linker were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. The linker of 21 amino acids also served as a tag since it consisted of a repeating heptapeptide that was recognized by a specific antipeptide antibody. scFv were expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. After purification and renaturation, a cross-linking assay was used to demonstrate that > 90% of scFv were in the form of monomers. The specificity of scFv was analyzed by both direct and competitive solid-phase radioimmunoassays. scFv.103 retained its specificity for poly(rI), whereas the other three scFv still bound the original antigen, but subtle changes in the overall specificity were noted. Thus, in some cases, the conformation of the binding site may be different in the context of an scFv compared with the original IgG."
https://openalex.org/W1595434083,"Abstract A current model for human beta-globin gene switching proposes that the stage-specific activation of embryonic and fetal globin genes requires the interaction of the beta-globin locus control region with proximal promoter elements. Subsequent repression in fetal and adult stages likely involves negative regulatory promoter elements and factors. To begin addressing these negative regulatory mechanisms, the regulation of human fetal G gamma-globin promoter fused to the SV40 T antigen gene was analyzed in transgenic mice. The results showed correct developmental expression in erythroid tissue, but lower levels of expression were also detected in non-erythroid tissue. Thus, the 5'-flanking G gamma-globin promoter sequence contains stage-specific erythroid elements but is lacking nonerythroid-specific negative elements. In contrast, the human embryonic epsilon-globin gene was only expressed in nonerythroid tissue of transgenic embryos, suggesting the presence of an erythroid-specific negative element(s). With the locus control region, complete repression of epsilon-globin RNA in fetal liver was observed in epsilon-globin genes without the previously characterized silencer, suggesting the presence of additional negative elements. Overall, this transgenic study suggests that distinct negative regulatory mechanisms function in the repression of embryonic and fetal globin genes."
