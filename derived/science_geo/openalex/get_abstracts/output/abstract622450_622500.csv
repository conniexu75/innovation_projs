https://openalex.org/W2898224116,"In eukaryotic cells, organelles and the cytoskeleton undergo highly dynamic yet organized interactions capable of orchestrating complex cellular functions. Visualizing these interactions requires noninvasive, long-duration imaging of the intracellular environment at high spatiotemporal resolution and low background. To achieve these normally opposing goals, we developed grazing incidence structured illumination microscopy (GI-SIM) that is capable of imaging dynamic events near the basal cell cortex at 97-nm resolution and 266 frames/s over thousands of time points. We employed multi-color GI-SIM to characterize the fast dynamic interactions of diverse organelles and the cytoskeleton, shedding new light on the complex behaviors of these structures. Precise measurements of microtubule growth or shrinkage events helped distinguish among models of microtubule dynamic instability. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions with other organelles or microtubules uncovered new ER remodeling mechanisms, such as hitchhiking of the ER on motile organelles. Finally, ER-mitochondria contact sites were found to promote both mitochondrial fission and fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2901214479,"We used a deeply sequenced dataset of 910 individuals, all of African descent, to construct a set of DNA sequences that is present in these individuals but missing from the reference human genome. We aligned 1.19 trillion reads from the 910 individuals to the reference genome (GRCh38), collected all reads that failed to align, and assembled these reads into contiguous sequences (contigs). We then compared all contigs to one another to identify a set of unique sequences representing regions of the African pan-genome missing from the reference genome. Our analysis revealed 296,485,284 bp in 125,715 distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains ~10% more DNA than the current human reference genome. Although the functional significance of nearly all of this sequence is unknown, 387 of the novel contigs fall within 315 distinct protein-coding genes, and the rest appear to be intergenic."
https://openalex.org/W2898404101,"Obesity is a major driver of cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevailing view is that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis or cirrhosis are required for HCC in obesity. Here, we report that NASH and fibrosis and HCC in obesity can be dissociated. We show that the oxidative hepatic environment in obesity inactivates the STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphatase T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) and increases STAT-1 and STAT-3 signaling. TCPTP deletion in hepatocytes promoted T cell recruitment and ensuing NASH and fibrosis as well as HCC in obese C57BL/6 mice that normally do not develop NASH and fibrosis or HCC. Attenuating the enhanced STAT-1 signaling prevented T cell recruitment and NASH and fibrosis but did not prevent HCC. By contrast, correcting STAT-3 signaling prevented HCC without affecting NASH and fibrosis. TCPTP-deletion in hepatocytes also markedly accelerated HCC in mice treated with a chemical carcinogen that promotes HCC without NASH and fibrosis. Our studies reveal how obesity-associated hepatic oxidative stress can independently contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2898544952,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) promotes transcriptional elongation through RNAPII pause release. We now report that CDK9 is also essential for maintaining gene silencing at heterochromatic loci. Through a live cell drug screen with genetic confirmation, we discovered that CDK9 inhibition reactivates epigenetically silenced genes in cancer, leading to restored tumor suppressor gene expression, cell differentiation, and activation of endogenous retrovirus genes. CDK9 inhibition dephosphorylates the SWI/SNF protein BRG1, which contributes to gene reactivation. By optimization through gene expression, we developed a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor (MC180295, IC50 = 5 nM) that has broad anti-cancer activity in vitro and is effective in in vivo cancer models. Additionally, CDK9 inhibition sensitizes to the immune checkpoint inhibitor α-PD-1 in vivo, making it an excellent target for epigenetic therapy of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2900795735,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart defect (population incidence, 1-2%)1-3 that frequently presents with ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA)4. BAV/AscAA shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and male predominance. Causative gene mutations (for example, NOTCH1, SMAD6) are known for ≤1% of nonsyndromic BAV cases with and without AscAA5-8, impeding mechanistic insight and development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we report the identification of variants in ROBO4 (which encodes a factor known to contribute to endothelial performance) that segregate with disease in two families. Targeted sequencing of ROBO4 showed enrichment for rare variants in BAV/AscAA probands compared with controls. Targeted silencing of ROBO4 or mutant ROBO4 expression in endothelial cell lines results in impaired barrier function and a synthetic repertoire suggestive of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This is consistent with BAV/AscAA-associated findings in patients and in animal models deficient for ROBO4. These data identify a novel endothelial etiology for this common human disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2900857819,"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to all blood lineages that support the entire lifespan of vertebrates1. After HSPCs emerge from endothelial cells within the developing dorsal aorta, homing allows the nascent cells to anchor in their niches for further expansion and differentiation2–5. Unique niche microenvironments, composed of various blood vessels as units of microcirculation and other niche components such as stromal cells, regulate this process6–9. However, the detailed architecture of the microenvironment and the mechanism for the regulation of HSPC homing remain unclear. Here, using advanced live imaging and a cell-labelling system, we perform high-resolution analyses of the HSPC homing in caudal haematopoietic tissue of zebrafish (equivalent to the fetal liver in mammals), and reveal the role of the vascular architecture in the regulation of HSPC retention. We identify a VCAM-1+ macrophage-like niche cell population that patrols the inner surface of the venous plexus, interacts with HSPCs in an ITGA4-dependent manner, and directs HSPC retention. These cells, named ‘usher cells’, together with caudal venous capillaries and plexus, define retention hotspots within the homing microenvironment. Thus, the study provides insights into the mechanism of HSPC homing and reveals the essential role of a VCAM-1+ macrophage population with patrolling behaviour in HSPC retention. In zebrafish embryogenesis, nascent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), homing to a vascular niche for retention, are ushered by patrolling and guiding macrophages through integrin-mediated cell-cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2901007321,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of glucosamine (GlcN) on septic lethality and sepsis-induced inflammation using animal models of mice and zebrafish. GlcN pretreatment improved survival in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model and attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic lung injury and systemic inflammation. GlcN suppressed LPS-induced M1-specific but not M2-specific gene expression. Furthermore, increased expressions of inflammatory genes in visceral tissue of LPS-injected zebrafish were suppressed by GlcN. GlcN suppressed LPS-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB in lung tissue. LPS triggered a reduction in O-GlcNAc levels in nucleocytoplasmic proteins of lung, liver, and spleen after 1 day, which returned to normal levels at day 3. GlcN inhibited LPS-induced O-GlcNAc down-regulation in mouse lung and visceral tissue of zebrafish. Furthermore, the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) level was increased by LPS, which were suppressed by GlcN in mouse and zebrafish. OGA inhibitors suppressed LPS-induced expression of inflammatory genes in RAW264.7 cells and the visceral tissue of zebrafish. Stable knockdown of Oga via short hairpin RNA led to increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in response to LPS with or without GlcN in RAW264.7 cells. Overall, our results demonstrate a protective effect of GlcN on sepsis potentially through modulation of O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2898292577,"Ribonuclease (RNase) P is a ubiquitous ribozyme that cleaves the 5' leader from precursor tRNAs. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human nuclear RNase P alone and in complex with tRNAVal. Human RNase P is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that contains 10 protein components and one catalytic RNA. The protein components form an interlocked clamp that stabilizes the RNA in a conformation optimal for substrate binding. Human RNase P recognizes the tRNA using a double-anchor mechanism through both protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions. Structural comparison of the apo and tRNA-bound human RNase P reveals that binding of tRNA induces a local conformational change in the catalytic center, transforming the ribozyme into an active state. Our results also provide an evolutionary model depicting how auxiliary RNA elements in bacterial RNase P, essential for substrate binding, and catalysis, were replaced by the much more complex and multifunctional protein components in higher organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2900680139,"The sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) is vital to insect development and reproduction. Intracellular JH receptors have recently been established as basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH)/PAS proteins in Drosophila melanogaster known as germ cell–expressed (Gce) and its duplicate paralog, methoprene-tolerant (Met). Upon binding JH, Gce/Met activates its target genes. Insects possess multiple native JH homologs whose molecular activities remain unexplored, and diverse synthetic compounds including insecticides exert JH-like effects. How the JH receptor recognizes its ligands is unknown. To determine which structural features define an active JH receptor agonist, we tested several native JHs and their nonnative geometric and optical isomers for the ability to bind the Drosophila JH receptor Gce, to induce Gce-dependent transcription, and to affect the development of the fly. Our results revealed high ligand stereoselectivity of the receptor. The geometry of the JH skeleton, dictated by two stereogenic double bonds, was the most critical feature followed by the presence of an epoxide moiety at a terminal position. The optical isomerism at carbon C11 proved less important even though Gce preferentially bound a natural JH enantiomer. The results of receptor-ligand–binding and cell-based gene activation assays tightly correlated with the ability of different geometric JH isomers to induce gene expression and morphogenetic effects in the developing insects. Molecular modeling supported the requirement for the proper double-bond geometry of JH, which appears to be its major selective mechanism. The strict stereoselectivity of Gce toward the natural hormone contrasts with the high potency of synthetic Gce agonists of disparate chemistries.

JH signaling clearly is vital to arthropods and important for our capacity to control insect pests and disease vectors by means of JH mimics. However, very little is known about how natural JHs or their synthetic agonists interact with the intracellular receptor and what decides which compound will or will not activate it. Diverse groups of arthropods synthesize different types of JH (15Goodman W.G. Cusson M. The juvenile hormones.in: Gilbert L.I. Insect Endocrinology. Elsevier, Amsterdam2012: 310-365Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Crustaceans use methyl farnesoate (MF), a nonepoxidated biosynthetic precursor of insect JH (27Cusson M. Yagi K.J. Ding Q.

The main insect JH homologs differ by the numbers and positions of carbons and epoxide groups (see Fig. 1). JH III prevails in most insect taxa. JH I, which is only encountered in the Lepidoptera (e.g. moths) differs from JH III by the presence of ethyl instead of methyl groups at the C7 and C11 carbons of the sesquiterpenoid backbone (see Fig. 1). Double-epoxidated JHs have been found in certain true bugs (Heteroptera) (28Kotaki T. Shinada T. Kaihara K. Ohfune Y. Numata H.

However, functional differences between the chemical variants of the native JHs remain unclear. JHs naturally synthesized by insect endocrine cells are 2E,6E geometric isomers (33Dahm K.H. Röller H.

Bioassays in beetle, moth, and heteropteran species generally concluded that the native spatial conformation of JH I was the most potent conformation and that the geometric isomerism had a great impact on the biological activity, whereas the chirality at C10 and C11 was less critical. These pharmacological data essentially corresponded to later studies on binding of the JH I and JH III stereoisomers to the hemolymph JH-binding proteins (hJHBPs) from several moth species (41Peterson R.C.

To this end, we have assessed diverse native JHs, their optical and geometric isomers, and two chemically unrelated JH mimics for their effects on the ligand–receptor interaction, transcriptional activation in a cell-based system and in vivo, and Drosophila development. Our findings reveal high ligand stereoselectivity of the JH receptor Gce, which contrasts with the disparate chemistry of highly potent synthetic JH mimics. JH III, its precursor MF, and JHB3 (Fig. 1) are all considered circulating hormones in D. melanogaster (29Richard D.S. Applebaum S.W. Sliter T.J. Baker F.C. Schooley D.A. Reuter C.C. Henrich V.C.

Using a Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell line, we have previously shown that MF and JH III (the commercial racemic mixture, hereafter referred to as R,S-JH III) induce a JH-responsive luciferase (JHRE-luc) reporter in a manner dependent on binding to the endogenous JH receptor Gce (6Jindra M. Uhlirova M. Charles J.-P. Smykal V. Hill R.J.

Here, we also tested a double-epoxidated JHB3 (Fig. 1 and supporting information). The effective concentration (EC50) values for inducing the JHRE-luc reporter were roughly in the 100–200 nm range for R,S-JH III and JHB3, whereas MF was about 20–40-fold less potent (Fig. 2A). RNAi-mediated knockdown of Gce revealed that, like MF and JH III (6Jindra M. Uhlirova M. Charles J.-P. Smykal V. Hill R.J.

To assess direct binding of the hormones to the Gce protein, we measured the inhibition constants (Ki) of the ligands in competition against R,S-[3H]JH III. Although unlabeled R,S-JH III and JHB3 were both similarly more effective than MF in activating JHRE-luc in the S2 cells (Fig. 2A), JHB3 bound Gce with a higher Ki (83.3 ± 40.8 nm) than did R,S-JH III (11.0 ± 2.2 nm) (Fig. 2B).

Here, we investigated T-cell responses to the two immunodominant and highly homologous HLA-DQ2.5–restricted gluten epitopes, DQ2.5-glia-α1a (PFPQPELPY) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 (PFPQPEQPF). Using HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a and HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramers and single-cell αβ T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we observed that despite similarity in biased variable-gene usage in the TCR repertoire responding to these nearly identical peptide–HLA-II complexes, most of the T cells are specific for either of the two epitopes. To understand the molecular basis of this exquisite fine specificity, we undertook Ala substitution assays revealing that the p7 residue (Leu/Gln) is critical for specific epitope recognition by both DQ2.5-glia-α1a– and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–reactive T-cell clones. We determined high-resolution binary crystal structures of HLA-DQ2.5 bound to DQ2.5-glia-α1a (2.0 Å) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 (2.6 Å). These structures disclosed that differences around the p7 residue subtly alter the neighboring substructure and electrostatic properties of the HLA-DQ2.5–peptide complex, providing the fine specificity underlying the responses against these two highly homologous gluten epitopes.

Three crystal structures of TRAV26-1/TRBV7-2-TCR–HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α2 complexes revealed that the TRBV7-2 bias is mostly attributed to the interactions mediated by the CDR3β loop and that the conserved non-germ line–encoded Arg in this loop serves as a lynchpin in the peptide–HLA-II interaction (10Petersen J.

These two crystal structures together with a crystal structures of a complex of TRAV8-3/TRBV6-1-TCR–HLA-DQ8–DQ8-α1-gliadin (11Petersen J. van Bergen J. Loh K.L. Kooy-Winkelaar Y. Beringer D.X.

However, it remains unclear whether highly homologous gluten epitopes would generate cross-reactive or highly specific T-cell responses. Here, we have studied the T-cell response toward the epitopes DQ2.5-glia-α1a (PFPQPELPY) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 (PFPQPEQPF). These immunodominant gluten epitopes in CeD are highly homologous, with only two amino acid differences in the 9-mer core region. Despite the epitope similarity, we found that the majority of patient-derived T cells, both isolated from blood or the celiac gut lesion, are specific for either of the two epitopes with limited cross-reactivity. This suggests that there are important differences in how T cells recognize these peptide–HLA-II complexes, because the immune systems of the patients are exposed simultaneously to both epitopes when they consume gluten-containing food. To explore the basis for specific recognition of the homologous epitopes, we performed T-cell proliferation assays with amino acid–substituted epitopes, undertook single-cell TCRαβ-gene sequencing, and solved the crystal structures of HLA-DQ2.5 complexed with either DQ2.5-glia-α1a or DQ2.5-glia-ω1. Despite biased usage of common V-genes, the majority of the T cells were specific to only one epitope. The p7 residue in both epitopes was critical for the specific TCR recognition by the discriminatory T-cell clones (TCCs). The crystal structures of the two peptide–HLA-DQ2.5 complexes, although similar, exhibited local structural perturbations around the p7 residue. Hence, this study demonstrates the ability of TCR to distinguish subtle differences in peptide–HLA-II topology. Consequently, in human T-cell–mediated diseases like CeD, discrete alterations in the peptide–HLA-II landscape can profoundly shape the disease-driven immune response. We identified distinct populations of CD4+ T cells that bound the HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a or HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramers in blood and gut of 12 CeD patients. (Fig. 1A). The relative ratio of CD4+ T cells positive to both DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramers with CD4+ T cells that are positive to either of the two tetramers in samples obtained from 11 CeD patients was 0.06 (mean). This suggests that the majority (∼95%) of these CD4+ T cells recognize either of the two tetramers (Fig. 1B and Table S1), indicating that despite only two amino acids difference in the 9-mer core region of the two gliadin peptides, most of the in vivo primed T cells in the blood and gut of CeD patients discriminate between the two epitopes. The HLA-DQ–gluten tetramers (including HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a and HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1) give staining of effector memory CD4+ T cells of CeD patients but not of healthy subjects (14Christophersen A.

We validated the specific staining of HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a versus HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramers with TCCs that were generated from tetramer-sorted cells by antigen-free expansion and cloning by limited dilution. On retesting of antigen specificity, all (nine) TCCs generated from the PBMCs of patient CD1383, stained with the tetramer used for sorting and showed a proliferative response toward the respective peptide (Fig. 1, C and D). One of the five TCCs generated from HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a tetramer binding CD4+ T cells and one of four of the TCCs generated from HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramer binding CD4+ T cells stained with both the tetramers and gave a response to both peptides in T-cell proliferation assays. The cross-reactive T-cell clones displayed a higher fluorescence intensity to the tetramer originally used for their isolation. None of the nine TCCs stained with the other HLA-DQ2.5–gluten tetramers (HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α2, HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω2, and CLIP2), indicating the antigen specificity of the tetramer staining (Fig. 1C). In addition, none of these TCCs showed response to any other gluten epitopes when tested in a T-cell proliferation assay against a panel of known gluten peptides at a high concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the results of the HLA-DQ–gluten tetramer staining of T cells in blood and gut, as well as the proliferation assay and HLA-DQ–gluten tetramer staining of established T-cell clones (the low number here prevents an exact estimate of cross-reactivity), strongly indicate that T cells of CeD patients generally discriminate between the two epitopes. To explore the differences in recognition of these two highly homologous epitopes, we measured the effect of single Ala substitutions at each position in the two epitopes (Table 1) in a T-cell proliferation assay. The sequences of the peptides used in these T-cell proliferation assays were identical to the epitope sequences that were part of the HLA-DQ–gluten tetramers. In this analysis TCCs that stained with the HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a or HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1 tetramers and that had reactivity with only one of the two epitopes, were tested (Table 2). Reactivity pattern of the DQ2.5-glia-α1a–specific and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs to the single Ala-substituted DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 peptides were normalized to the response to the WT peptide.Table 1Peptide-binding register of DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-ω1Peptide-binding registerEpitopes−3−2−112345678910DQ2.5-glia-α1aGlnLeuGlnProPheProGlnProGluLeuProTyrDQ2.5-glia-ω1ProGln———————Gln—PhePro Open table in a new tab Table 2TCR sequences of DQ2.5-glia-α1a– and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs used in the alanine-substitution assayTCCTRAVCDR3αTRAJTRBVCDR3βTRBJDQ2.5-glia-α1a–specific TCCs 442D.A.4529/DV5*01CAASEGDSGTYKYIF40*0119*01CASSINALVGEQFF2-1*01 1383P.A.312–2*01CAVKFASGTYKYIF40*017-3*01CASSPAFSTDTQYF2-3*01 1383P.A.414/DV4*03CAMREGWQAGNTLIF15*015-4*01CASSLDGLTNTEAFF1-1*01DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs 442D.A.28–3*02CAVVDASSKLIF12*0120-1*01CSATLGGDYGYTF1-2*01 442P.C.3/9/234*01CLVGGYNNNDMRF43*0120-1*02CSAQLAGGGGDTQYF2-3*01 1383P.A.65*01CAESRYSGYSTLTF11*0120-1*01CSAFPGGDTEAFF1-1*01 1383P.A.7/919*01CALSEYGNKLVF47*027-3*01CASSYVGGDTDTQYF2-3*01 Open table in a new tab Both DQ2.5-glia-α1a– (Fig. 2A) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific (Fig. 2B) TCCs lost reactivity on Ala substitution at p2 and p7. However, substitution at p9, a position that differs between the two epitopes, had no effect on the reactivity of the TCCs. This is in line with the observations from a previous study where p7 was critical, p9 was dispensable, and the p2 had variable effects on T-cell recognition of the DQ2.5-glia-α1a epitopes by the DQ2.5-glia-α1a–specific TCCs (10Petersen J. Montserrat V. Mujico J.R. Loh K.L. Beringer D.X. van L.M. Thompson A. Mearin M.L. Schweizer J. Kooy-Winkelaar Y. van B.J. Drijfhout J.W. Kan W.T. La Gruta N.L. Anderson R.P. Reid H.H. Koning F. Rossjohn J. T-cell receptor recognition of HLA-DQ2-gliadin complexes associated with celiac disease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Unique to all DQ2.5-glia-α1a–specific TCCs was the loss of reactivity on Ala substitution of residues p6 and p8. Two of the three TCCs lost reactivity on substitution at p3 and p4, whereas the third TCC was sensitive to substitution at p5. DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs exhibited varying responses to Ala substitutions at positions other than p2 and p7. Substitution at p3 and p8 resulted in loss of reactivity in three of four TCCs. In brief, the p2 and p7 amino acids were important for T-cell recognition of both the DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 epitopes. To further investigate the basis of TCR specificity, T-cell proliferative assays were used to analyze the reactivity of DQ2.5-glia-α1a– and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific (Fig. 2, C and D) TCCs against chimeric peptide with a single amino acid exchange at position p7 and p9 of DQ2.5-glia-α1a (α1_Qp7L, α1_Fp9Y) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 (ω1_Lp7Q, ω1_Yp9F) (Table 3). Because the 9-mer core sequences of the DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 differ only at p7 and p9, the pair of chimeras α1_Qp7L and ω1_Yp9F, as well as the pair of α1_Fp9Y and ω1_Lp7Q, will have identical 9-mer core sequence but different flanking sequences. We observed that the responses of DQ2.5-glia-α1a– or DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs toward these two pairs of chimeras with identical 9-mer core sequence were similar, suggesting that the flanking region is not contributing to the differential reactivity. We observed that both DQ2.5-glia-α1a–specific- (Fig. 2C) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs (Fig. 2D) recognized chimeric p9 peptides, suggesting that this residue is dispensable. The majority of specific TCCs lost their reactivity when the p7 residue was exchanged. However, these specific TCCs showed reactivity with chimeric peptides that had unchanged p7, i.e. DQ2.5-glia-α1a– and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCCs reacted with ω1_Lp7Q and α1_Qp7L, respectively. This observation highlights the importance of p7 in the specific T-cell recognition of DQ2.5-glia-α1a or DQ2.5-glia-ω1.Table 3Peptide sequencesPeptides−3−2−112345678910α1a-wtGlnLeuGlnProPheProGlnProGluLeuProTyrα1a_Qp7LGlnLeuGln——————Gln—Tyrα1a_Fp9YGlnLeuGln——————Leu—Pheω1-wtProGlnGln——————Gln—PheProω1_Lp7QProGlnGln——————Leu—PheProω1_Yp9FProGlnGln——————Gln—TyrPro Open table in a new tab To examine the CeD patient T-cell repertoire reactive to HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-α1a and HLA-DQ2.5–DQ2.5-glia-ω1, we isolated single CD4+ T cells directly from blood or gut biopsies of CeD patients using HLA-DQ2.5 tetramers and determined the sequences of rearranged TCRα and TCRβ gene pairs (Table 4). We looked at the overall usage of TRAV or TRBV gene segments. In cases of dual V-gene usage, each V-gene was given a half score. For DQ2.5-glia-α1a, 165 single T cells isolated from 11 CeD patients produced 116 unique clonotypes expressing 37 TRAV and 26 TRBV genes (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). Similar analysis of 113 DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific T cells isolated from 11 CeD patients produced 99 unique clonotypes expressing 35 TRAV and 30 TRBV genes (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). We then calculated the pair-wise Morisita–Horn index to analyze the similarity in TRAV and TRBV usage, where a higher index value indicates higher similarity. We found high similarity in both TRAV and TRBV usage (0.74 and 0.65, respectively) between DQ2.5-glia-α1a– and DQ2.5-glia-ω1–specific TCRs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2A).

Additionally, nonsynonymous SNPs in ATXN3 cause amino acid changes in ataxin-3, and one of these polymorphisms introduces a premature stop codon in one isoform. Here, we examined the effects of different ataxin-3 isoforms and of the premature stop codon on ataxin-3’s physiological function and on main disease mechanisms. At the physiological level, we show that alternative splicing and the premature stop codon alter ataxin-3 stability and that ataxin-3 isoforms differ in their enzymatic deubiquitination activity, subcellular distribution, and interaction with other proteins. At the pathological level, we found that the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat leads to a stabilization of ataxin-3 and that ataxin-3 isoforms differ in their aggregation properties. Interestingly, we observed a functional interaction between normal and polyglutamine-expanded ATXN3 allelic variants. We found that interactions between different ATXN3 allelic variants modify the physiological and pathophysiological properties of ataxin-3. Our findings indicate that alternative splicing and interactions between different ataxin-3 isoforms affect not only major aspects of ataxin-3 function but also MJD pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2901901034,"Acute pancreatitis is characterized by premature intracellular protease activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, into the organ. The lysosomal proteases cathepsin B, D, and L have been identified as regulators of early zymogen activation and thus modulators of the severity of pancreatitis. Cathepsin C (CTSC, syn. dipeptidly-peptidase I) is a widely expressed, exo-cystein-protease involved in the proteolytic processing of various other lysosomal enzymes. We have studied its role in pancreatitis. We used CTSC-deleted mice and their WT littermates in two experimental models of pancreatitis. The mild model involved eight hourly caerulein injections and the severe model partial duct ligation. Isolated pancreatic acini and spleen-derived leukocytes were used for ex vivo experiments. CTSC is expressed in the pancreas and in inflammatory cells. CTSC deletion reduced the severity of pancreatitis (more prominently in the milder model) without directly affecting intra-acinar cell trypsin activation in vitro. The absence of CTSC reduced infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes impaired their capacity for cleaving E-cadherin in adherens junctions between acinar cells and reduced the activity of neutrophil serine proteases polymorphonuclear (neutrophil) elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3, but not neutrophil motility. Macrophage invasion was not dependent on the presence of CTSC. CTSC is a regulator and activator of various lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin B, D, and L. Its loss mitigates the severity of pancreatitis not by reducing intra-acinar cell zymogen activation but by reducing infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes into the pancreas. In this context one of its key roles is that of an activator of neutrophil elastase."

Our study showed that EGFL6 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of breast cancer cells and increased cell migration and invasion in cell culture studies. We also found that EGFL6 reduced apoptotic signaling in cancer cells and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, expression of EGFL6 in cancer cells and tumor endothelial cells not only increased tumor angiogenesis but also promoted migration of cancer cells. Such dual engagement of cancer and stromal cells suggests crosstalk mediated by EGFL6 in the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of EGFL6 using our novel anti-EGFL6 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced cancer cell migration, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth in mouse xenograft tumor models. Silencing EGFL6 mRNA by shRNA transfection of cancer cells also significantly reduced cancer cell migration, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth in mouse xenograft tumor models. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that targeting EGFL6 is a unique strategy for inhibiting both cancer cell metastasis and tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2900587545,"Colonization of the gut by certain probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strains has been associated with reduced risk of inflammatory diseases and colorectal cancer. Previous studies pointed to a functional link between immunomodulation, histamine production, and folate metabolism, the central 1-carbon pathway for the transfer of methyl groups. Using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed folate metabolites of L. reuteri strain 6475 and discovered that the bacterium produces a 2-carbon-transporting folate in the form of 5,10-ethenyl-tetrahydrofolyl polyglutamate. Isotopic labeling permitted us to trace the source of the 2-carbon unit back to acetate of the culture medium. We show that the 2C folate cycle of L. reuteri is capable of transferring 2 carbon atoms to homocysteine to generate the unconventional amino acid ethionine, a known immunomodulator. When we treated monocytic THP-1 cells with ethionine, their transcription of TNF-α was inhibited and cell proliferation reduced. Mass spectrometry of THP-1 histones revealed incorporation of ethionine instead of methionine into proteins, a reduction of histone-methylation, and ethylation of histone lysine residues. Our findings suggest that the microbiome can expose the host to ethionine through a novel 2-carbon transporting variant of the folate cycle and modify human chromatin via ethylation.-Roth, D., Chiang, A. J., Hu, W., Gugiu, G. B., Morra, C. N., Versalovic, J., Kalkum, M. The two-carbon folate cycle of commensal Lactobacillus reuteri 6475 gives rise to immunomodulatory ethionine, a source for histone ethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2900934724,"Early vigour of seedlings is a beneficial trait of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) that contributes to weed control, water use efficiency and is likely to contribute to yield under certain environments. Although breeding is considered the most effective approach to improve early vigour of field pea, the absence of a robust and high-throughput phenotyping tool to dissect this complex trait is currently a major obstacle of genetic improvement programs to address this issue. To develop this tool, separate trials on 44 genetically diverse field pea genotypes were conducted in the automated plant phenotyping platform of Plant Phenomics Victoria, Horsham and in the field, respectively. High correlation between estimated plant parameters derived from the automated phenotyping platform and important early vigour traits such as shoot biomass, leaf area and plant height indicated that the derived plant parameters can be used to predict vigour traits in field pea seedlings. Plant growth analysis demonstrated that the “broken-stick” model fitted well with the growth pattern of all field pea genotypes and can be used to determine the linear growth phase. Further analysis suggested that the estimated plant parameters collected at the linear growth phase can effectively differentiate early vigour across field pea genotypes. High correlation between normalised difference vegetation indices captured from the field trial and estimated shoot biomass and top-view area confirmed the consistent performance of early vigour field pea genotypes under controlled and field environments. Overall, our results demonstrated that this robust screening tool is highly applicable and will enable breeding programs to rapidly identify early vigour traits and utilise germplasm to contribute to the genetic improvement of field peas."

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a component of the innate immune system that processes interleukin (IL)-1β into a mature cytokine. Elevated activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the progression of an array of inflammatory diseases. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from RORγ-null mice displayed reduced capacity to secrete IL-1β, and they also displayed a reduction in Nlrp3 and Il1b gene expression. Examination of the promoters of the Il1b and Nlrp3 genes revealed multiple putative ROR response elements (ROREs) that were occupied by RORγ. RORγ inverse agonists were effective inhibitors of the inflammasome. RORγ inverse agonists suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ATP-stimulated IL-1β secretion and expression of Il1b and Nlrp3 in BMDMs. Additionally, the ability of the RORγ inverse agonists to suppress IL-1β secretion was lost in Nlrp3-null macrophages. The potential for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo using RORγ inverse agonists was examined in two models: LPS-induced sepsis and fulminant hepatitis. Pharmacological inhibition of RORγ activity reduced plasma IL-1β as well as IL-1β production by peritoneal macrophages in a model of LPS-induced sepsis. Additionally, RORγ inverse agonists reduced mortality in an LPS/d-galactosamine–induced fulminant hepatitis mouse model. These results illustrate a major role for RORγ in regulation of innate immunity via modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity.

https://openalex.org/W2981730279,"Loss of functional β-cell mass caused by lipotoxicity is a key pathogenic factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have previously reported that sphingosine kinase (SK)1 is an endogenous protector of β-cells against lipotoxicity. The current study reports that SK2, another isoform of SK, is a crucial mediator of lipotoxicity in β-cells. Exposure of β-cells to palmitatic acid (PA), a saturated free fatty acid, resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in SK2 expression, which paralleled the induction of cell death in a similar dose- and time-dependent fashion. Silencing SK2 expression by its specific small interfering RNAs significantly inhibited PA-induced cell death and caspase-3 activation, whereas overexpression of SK2 promoted lipotoxicity in β-cells. Mechanistically, upon exposure to PA, endogenous SK2 was shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it interacted with B-cell lymphoma–extra-large (Bcl-xL), leading to mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation and cell death. By blocking SK2 translocation and its interaction with Bcl-xL, either the nuclear export signal mutant (L423A/L425A) or the BH3 domain mutant (L219A) of SK2 significantly attenuated β-cell lipotoxicity. Furthermore, SK2 deficiency in mice significantly prevented the loss of β-cell mass, preserved insulin production, and ameliorated the diabetic phenotype in an established T2DM model induced by feeding a high-fat diet accompanied by administration of streptozotocin. These findings provide the first evidence, in vitro and in vivo, of a critical role for SK2 in mediating β-cell lipotoxicity and the progression of diabetes.—Song, Z., Wang, W., Li, N., Yan, S., Rong, K., Lan, T., Xia, P.

Here, we defined the transport mechanism of the FNT from the amoebiasis parasite Entamoeba histolytica, EhFNT, and also show that BtFdhC from Bacillus thuringiensis is a functional formate transporter. Both FNTs carry a nonprotonatable amide amino acid, asparagine or glutamine, respectively, at the central histidine position. Despite having a nonprotonatable residue, EhFNT displayed the same substrate selectivity for larger monocarboxylates including l-lactate, a low substrate affinity as is typical for FNTs, and, strikingly, proton motive force–dependent transport as observed for PfFNT harboring a central histidine. These results argue against a proton relay mechanism, indicating that substrate protonation must occur outside of the central histidine region, most likely in the vestibules.

https://openalex.org/W2901317265,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive signaling pathway activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The effectors of the UPR are potent transcription activators; however, some genes are suppressed by ER stress at the mRNA level. The mechanisms underlying UPR-mediated gene suppression are less known. Exploration of the effect of UPR on NK cells ligand expression found that the transcription of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A/B (MICA/B) is suppressed by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway of the UPR. Deletion of IRE1 or XBP1 was sufficient to promote mRNA and surface levels of MICA. Accordingly, NKG2D played a greater role in the killing of IRE1/XBP1 knockout target cells. Analysis of effectors downstream to XBP1s identified E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) as linking UPR and MICA transcription. The inverse correlation between XBP1 and E2F1 or MICA expression was corroborated in RNA-Seq analysis of 470 primary melanoma tumors. While mechanisms that connect XBP1 to E2F1 are not fully understood, we implicate a few microRNA molecules that are modulated by ER stress and possess dual suppression of E2F1 and MICA. Because of the importance of E2F1 and MICA in cancer progression and recognition, these observations could be exploited for cancer therapy by manipulating the UPR in tumor cells.—Obiedat, A., Seidel, E., Mahameed, M., Berhani, O., Tsukerman, P., Voutetakis, K., Chatziioannou, A., McMahon, M., Avril, T., Chevet, E., Mandelboim, O., Tirosh, B.

https://openalex.org/W2900559525,"Recent studies highlight a growing concern over the limited adoption of climate smart agricultural (CSA) practices despite their potential benefits on adaptation, mitigation and productivity. Literature indicates several factors behind the lack of adoption including socio-demographic and economic conditions, agro-ecological scales and the nature of the practices. This paper examines to what extent and under which conditions such factors influence the adoption of CSA practices at farm, household and community level across three study sites in different continents: Vietnam, Nicaragua and Uganda. While cost benefit analysis (CBA) is employed to assess the farm-level profitability of CSA practices, the aggregate community impact disaggregated by different groups of farmer typologies with specific socio-economic features is derived from the adoption rate estimated by the relative advantage of practices and the income level of each group. Our main findings show great variation of farm-profitability of CSA practices across scales. Similar practices could generate different profitability depending on crop typologies, input access and prices, household types and local context. Regarding the aggregate profitability of CSA practices at regional scale, we found that under particular conditions, relevant factors of adoption matter to the adoption pattern and thereby affects the ranking. Such conditions include (i) high income inequality, (ii) large profitability gap of prioritized CSA practices, and (iii) large proportion of cost and benefit of the practices in the level of income. This study contributes to enhancing the prioritization process of CSA practices and provides practical guidance for research and policy to tailor the investment to appropriate end-users to assure the greatest impact for the community."

The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) is a screening test for assessing EFs although it has not been so far adapted and validated in Spain. We evaluated the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the FAB (FAB-E) in PD patients.Our study included 54 healthy subjects and 67 PD patients. Cognitive assessment of participants was conducted using the FAB-E, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail Making Test (TMT), Revised-Barcelona Test (RBT) and Executive Interview (EXIT-25). Internal consistency, intra- and test-retest reliabilities, concurrent and discriminant validity of the FAB-E were examined. To evaluate the influence of cognitive dysfunction in PD on the performance of the FAB-E, we also classified the PD patients into groups according to their cognitive status as measured by the MMSE using published criteria to identify cognitive deficits in PD.The FAB-E showed good internal consistency (α = 0.751). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ranging from 0.559 to 0.891) and Spearman correlations (from 0.494 to 0.864) of the FAB-E subtests indicated a good-strong reliability. The total and subtest scores generally showed a good concurrent validity, except for the prehension behaviour item of the FAB-E and the Interference and Go/no-go tasks of the EXIT-25 that presented low estimates. Excluding the prehension behaviour subtest, the performance of the FAB-E was higher in the control group than in PD patients. Cognitive dysfunction in PD patients also indicated significant poorer FAB-E scores excepting the motor and prehension behaviour subtests. Discriminant analysis determined a cut-off of 14.5 was optimal to differentiate healthy subjects from PD patients. Moreover, a cut-off <12.5 allocated satisfactorily those PD patients with cognitive impairment (MMSE<26) and scores <11.5 classified suitably those PD patients with dementia (MMSE<24).The FAB-E is an accurate tool for evaluating EFs in patients with PD and can provide useful information for distinguishing PD patients with and without cognitive dysfunction at a bedside assessment."

In the present study, we examined how ROS activates cluster of differentiation (CD)38, a mammalian prototype of ARC. CD38 exists in type II and III forms with opposing membrane orientation. This study showed the coexpression of type II and III CD38 in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The catalytic site of the constitutively active type II CD38 faces the outside of the cell or the inside of early endosomes (EEs), whereas the basally inactive type III CD38 faces the cytosol. Type III CD38 interacted with Nox4/phosphorylated-p22phox (p-p22phox) in EEs of LAK cells upon IL-8 treatment. H2O2 derived from Nox4 activated type III CD38 by forming a disulfide bond between Cys164 and Cys177, resulting in increased cADPR formation. Our study identified the mechanism by which type III CD38 is activated in an immune cell (LAK), in which H2O2 generated by Nox4 oxidizes and activates type III CD38 to generate cADPR.

We found that, unlike the EB1-binding mode of the CAP-Gly domain in the dynactin-associated protein p150Glued, which dually engages the EB1 C-terminal EEY motif as well as the EB homology domain and sterically occludes SXIP motif binding, the CLIP-170 CAP-Gly domains engage only the EEY motif, enabling the flanking SXIP and SXIP-like motifs to bind the EB homology domain.

In face of decreasing support measures for agricultural markets in the European Union, diversified crop portfolios could also offer a possibility to stabilize revenue at farm level (portfolio effect). We hypothesize that (i) diversity of crop portfolios changes along spatial gradients in the study area (Bavaria, Germany), (ii) the composition of portfolios depends on farm parameters, and (iii) more diverse portfolios on arable land provide higher revenue stability. We analysed agricultural census data comprising all farms (N = 105 314) in the study area and identified 26 typical crop portfolios. We show that portfolio composition is related to farm characteristics (whole farm revenue, farm type, farm size) and location. Currently, diversification of crop portfolios fails to promote stability of portfolio revenue in the study area, where policy still indirectly influences market prices of energy crops. We conclude that the portfolio effect as a natural insurance was less important in recent years due to high market prices for specific crops. This low need for natural insurances probably favoured simplified portfolios leading to decreased agricultural diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2901650223,"Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), shed from cell surfaces, is found in human circulation and has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. Its pathophysiological regulation and underlying mechanisms are scarcely understood. In endothelium-specific human RAGE transgenic mice, human sRAGE was detected in circulation, whereas its level was markedly increased after LPS treatment. That increase was preceded by a rapid rise in TNF-α level. Treatment with TNF-α also significantly increased serum sRAGE. In human microvascular endothelial cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells with RAGE overexpression, TNF-α markedly induced RAGE shedding, which was dependent on MMP9 and ADAM10. TNF-α-stimulated MMP9 expression was completely dependent on JNK activation, with its inhibition partially effective in suppressing TNF-α-induced RAGE shedding. In contrast, TNF-α transiently induced activation transcription factor (ATF)4, a major component in unfolded protein response (UPR), whereas knockdown of ATF4 abrogated TNF-α-stimulated RAGE shedding. Protein levels of the pro and activated forms of ADAM10 were also decreased by ATF4 knockdown, whereas inhibition of other components of UPR, including XBP1 and ATF6, failed to block TNF-α-stimulated RAGE shedding. Although the endoplasmic reticulum stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin induced markedly and sustained expression of ATF4 and XBP-1, they did not induce RAGE shedding to the same level as TNF-α, suggesting that ATF4 is necessary but not sufficient alone for TNF-α-mediated RAGE shedding. ATF4 inhibition did not affect TNF-α-stimulated MMP9 expression, whereas inhibition of JNK activity did not influence ADAM10 activation. Thus, inflammatory cascades including TNF-α induced RAGE shedding in endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro.

Chloride-pumping rhodopsin (ClR) exhibits a trend to hyperactivity induced by a change in the photoreaction rate because of a gradual decrease in temperature. Here, to track the structural changes that explain the differences in CIR activity resulting from these temperature changes, we used serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) with an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to determine the non-cryogenic structure of ClR at a resolution of 1.85 A, and compared this structure with a cryogenic ClR structure obtained with synchrotron X-ray crystallography. The XFEL-derived ClR structure revealed that the all-trans retinal (ATR) region and positions of two coordinated chloride ions slightly differed from those of the synchrotron-derived structure. Moreover, the XFEL structure enabled identification of one additional water molecule forming a hydrogen bond network with a chloride ion. Analysis of the channel cavity and a difference distance matrix plot (DDMP) clearly revealed additional structural differences. B-factor information obtained from the non-cryogenic structure supported a motility change on the residual main and side chains as well as of chloride and water molecules because of temperature effects. Our results indicate that non-cryogenic structures and time-resolved XFEL experiments could contribute to a better understanding of the chloride-pumping mechanism of ClR and other ion pumps."

Yet, mechanisms and regulation of intestinal phosphorus absorption have not been adequately studied and discrepancies in findings exist based on the absorption assessment technique used. In vitro techniques show rather consistent effects of dietary phosphorus intake level and age on intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate transport. But, the few studies that have used in vivo techniques conflict with these in vitro studies. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary phosphorus intake level on phosphorus absorption using the in situ ligated loop technique in three different aged rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 72), were studied at 10-, 20-, and 30-weeks-of-age on a low (0.1%), normal (0.6%), or high (1.2%) phosphorus diet in a 3x3 factorial design (n = 8/group). Rats were fed their assigned diet for 2-weeks prior to absorption testing by jejunal ligated loop as a non-survival procedure, utilizing 33P radioisotope. Metabolic cages were used for determination of calcium and phosphorus balance over the final four days prior to sacrifice, and blood was collected at the time of sacrifice for biochemistries. Our results show that phosphorus absorption was higher in 10-week-old rats compared with 20- and 30-week-olds and this corresponded to higher gene expression of the major phosphate transporter, NaPi-2b, as well as higher whole-body phosphorus balance and net phosphorus absorption. Dietary phosphorus intake level did not affect jejunal phosphorus absorption or NaPi-2b gene expression. Our results contrast with studies utilizing in vitro techniques, but corroborate results of other rodent studies utilizing in situ or in vivo methods. Thus, there is need for additional studies that employ more physiological methods of phosphorus absorption assessment."

In this study, we evaluated the results of pre-operative 1H-MRS to identify predictive factors for high-grade intracranial meningioma. Thirteen patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II-III meningioma (confirmed by pathology) were defined as high-grade; twenty-two patients with WHO grade I meningioma were defined as low-grade. All patients were evaluated by 1H-MRS before surgery. The relationships between the ratios of metabolites (N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine [Cr], and choline [Cho]) and the diagnosis of high-grade meningioma were analyzed. According to Mann-Whitney U test analysis, the Cho/NAA ratio in cases of high-grade meningioma was significantly higher than in cases of low-grade meningioma (6.34 ± 7.90 vs. 1.58 ± 0.77, p<0.05); however, there were no differences in age, Cho/Cr, or NAA/Cr. According to conditional inference tree analysis, the optimal cut-off point for the Cho/NAA ration between high-grade and low-grade meningioma was 2.409 (sensitivity = 61.54%; specificity = 86.36%). This analysis of pre-operative 1H-MRS metabolite ratio demonstrated that the Cho/NAA ratio may provide a simple and practical predictive value for high-grade intracranial meningiomas, and may aid neurosurgeons in efforts to design an appropriate surgical plan and treatment strategy before surgery."

Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2901663320,"Although transport and slaughter of cattle during the last 10% of the gestation period is prohibited in the European Union, such cattle are sometimes sent for slaughter. The late term pregnancy is usually not recognized by the authorities until the uterus is inspected after slaughter and a near term fetus is observed. Accurate post mortem determination of age of bovine fetuses is therefore of major importance as evidence for the subsequent prosecution of the owner. Fetometric measurements such as crown-rump length (CRL) have been used, but these existing estimators have often been established based on insufficiently described study populations or phenotypes that may have changed in the past decades. Morphological characteristics are also used, but few data are available on the correlation between fetal age and the development of these characteristics. The objectives of this study were to investigate the correlation between fetal age and morphological features of bovine Holstein fetuses and to evaluate the use of these features alone and in combination with fetometric measurements to predict fetal age. We collected fetuses from 274 pregnant Holstein cows with recorded insemination dates slaughtered at a Danish abattoir. Gender, teeth development, occurrence of pigmentation, coat, tactile hair and other morphological features were recorded along with CRL, head width, head length and body weight (BW). The gestational length was calculated based on recorded insemination and slaughter dates, and coefficients of variation (R2) were determined for all recorded variables. Notably, the highest R2 was recorded for head length (0.985) followed by CRL (0.979) and head width (0.974). The categorical (morphological) variables were less informative. When used in multivariable models, they did offer statistically significance, but for practical purposes, limited additional information. A multivariable model including the fetometric variables head length and width in combination with CRL resulted in R2 = 0.99 with predictions that were roughly within +/- 11–12 days in 95% of cases. We conclude that the model based on the fetometric variables only provided the most precise predictions, while combination with morphological features such as eruption of teeth, pigmentation and coat mostly increased the width of the prediction intervals."

The oligopeptide (Opp) transport system is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter responsible for the uptake of peptides, supplying pathogens with essential nutrients as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and amino acids. These bacterial importers are composed of five subunits. In Gram-negative bacteria, the substrate-binding protein (SBP) binds the substrate in the periplasm and shuttles it to the transporter. Transmembrane domains (TMDs) form a dimer to create the translocation channel through the membrane. Energized by ATP binding and hydrolysis, a dimer of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) is coupled to the TMDs to drive conformational changes to import the substrate into the cell. Additionally, nutrient acquisition through the Opp system influences many cellular processes, including internalization of quorum-sensing peptides, biofilm production, modifying the cell surface, and antibiotic resistance (4Gominet M.

OppA, the SBP of the Opp transport system, belongs to a group of structurally related SBPs involved in the uptake of a wide range of nutrients from nickel to peptides known as the Cluster C family.

One striking feature of the Cluster C family is that members play dual roles in nutrient uptake, importing their canonical substrates and heme. In E. coli, the Cluster C nickel SBP, NikA, binds heme in vivo and has been suggested to play a role as a heme chaperone in the periplasm (11Klepsch M.M. Kovermann M. Löw C. Balbach J. Permentier H.P. Fusetti F. de Gier J.W. Slotboom D.J. Berntsson R.P. Escherichia coli peptide binding protein OppA has a preference for positively charged peptides.J. Mol.

In addition to oppA, there are three other Cluster C family SBP genes encoded in the NTHi genome: hbpA (heme-binding protein, also known as GbpA) mediates import of GSH; sapA (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) provides antimicrobial peptide resistance; and NTHI0310 (19Vergauwen B.

The predicted topology and high sequence similarities to Cluster C SBPs led us to identify NTHI0310 as a member of this family (Table S1), but its canonical substrate specificity is unknown. In H. influenzae, HbpA is necessary to use heme as an iron source during growth, and SapA is essential for NTHi survival in heme-starved growth conditions (21Morton D.J. Madore L.L. Smith A.

These in vivo studies highlight the overlapping functionality of some Cluster C proteins and their roles in the heme uptake network for this heme auxotroph. Here, we probed peptide and heme substrate specificity of nthiOppA. We solved the structure of nthiOppA bound to a range of hydrophobic peptides and uncovered the peptide specificity of Gram-negative OppA extends beyond pentapeptides. In vivo studies have identified some Cluster C proteins are involved in the heme-uptake pathway, and we extended this study to compare the heme specificity and binding affinity of the NTHi Cluster C SBPs. In silico analysis of heme docking, coupled with substrate competition assays and individual domain analysis, allows us to propose how multisubstrate specificity may occur in nthiOppA. Our work highlights the multifunctional roles of Cluster C systems and the complexity of the heme transport network. We expressed nthiOppA without the periplasmic signal sequence in E. coli and natively purified the protein using a C-terminal His tag. Crystallized nthiOppA was co-purified with bound endogenous peptide, indicated by additional electron density in the substrate-binding pocket. SBPs are frequently co-purified with their substrates, and OppA homologs have demonstrated a broad specificity for peptides (23Silhavy T.J. Szmelcman S. Boos W. Schwartz M. On the significance of the retention of ligand by protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 1.85 Å with space group P21 21 21 and one monomer in the asymmetric unit. In general, SBPs have two structurally conserved globular domains consisting of a β-sheet that is flanked by α-helices (α/β-domains), and the five-strand sheet at the core of each domain is connected by two strands to the opposite α/β-domain. The substrate-binding pocket is formed at the interface of these domains. Specific to the Cluster C SBP family, domain I of nthiOppA is divided into two subdomains: domain IA is stitched together from residues 26 to 41, 210 to 290, and 510 to 541, and domain IB includes residues 42 to 209. Domain II spans residues 291 to 509 (Fig. 1A). The addition of domain IB makes Cluster C proteins larger than other SBPs in other clusters, and this allows for an expanded binding cavity to accommodate the larger substrates associated with this family of SBPs (25Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20412802): 2606-261710.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). When compared with open unbound ecOppA (RMSD = 4.42 Å), structural alignment of nthiOppA indicates a conformational change to the closed peptide-bound state (Fig. 1B). In the ligand-bound nthiOppA complex, domains I and II rotate toward the center of the protein to bury the peptide in the substrate-binding pocket. Interestingly, even though domains IA and IB are structurally independent, they rotate as a rigid domain in respect to domain II. The angle of rotation between the two domains is ∼35° from the open to the closed conformations. The co-purified peptide binds near the hinge region at the interface between the domains, and domain II provides a binding cleft with the majority of protein–peptide interactions for the bound peptide in the substrate-binding pocket. Using a range of peptides with varying physical properties, we tested the specificity of nthiOppA. Peptides identified as Gram-negative or Gram-positive OppA substrates as well as peptides with an increase in hydrophobicity and length were used in a thermal shift assay. Peptides that increased the stability of nthiOppA (melting temperature, Tm) were identified as binding candidates (Fig. S2). The following six binding candidates raised the Tm between 2.5 and 6 °C: P1 (KKK); P2 (MGG); P3 (LGG); P4 (GIINTL); P5Long (YLGANGRGGGS); and P6Brady (bradykinin, RPPGFSPFR). P1KKK was one of the initial peptides discovered to bind OppA, and peptides P1KKK and P6Brady were first crystallized bound to seOppA and llOppA, respectively (9Tame J.R. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J.

Additionally, ecOppA has also been shown to have a preference for positively charged peptides with approximately half of co-purified peptides having at least one arginine, histidine, or lysine (11Klepsch M.M. Kovermann M. Löw C. Balbach J. Permentier H.P. Fusetti F. de Gier J.W. Slotboom D.J. Berntsson R.P. Escherichia coli peptide binding protein OppA has a preference for positively charged peptides.J.

The identified binding candidates indicate peptide specificity of nthiOppA is not limited to 3–5 amino acids peptides. nthiOppA can bind positive and hydrophobic peptides as well as longer peptides similar to Gram-positive OppA homologs. The novel binding candidate peptides were co-crystallized with nthiOppA. Chemically denatured and refolded nthiOppA co-crystallized with P2MGG, P3LGG, and P4GIINTL in the same condition as natively purified nthiOppA with similar crystal morphology and diffraction quality. However, P5Long co-crystallization produced poorly formed and cracked crystals that reduced diffraction to 9 Å. For the endogenous peptide bound to the natively purified nthiOppA, a 4-residue peptide backbone was built and refined in the electron density. The observed electron density of the second residue of the co-purified peptide is large enough to fit a bulky side chain. However, the density for the side chains cannot be easily interpreted to confidently identify residue assignments, which is likely caused by a heterogeneous mixture of co-purified peptides bound to nthiOppA. Hydrophobic peptides P2MGG, P3LGG, and P4GIINTL have well-resolved electron density representing the bound peptides (Fig. S2). The overall structure of nthiOppA does not change dramatically between the different bound peptides with RMSD values from 0.07 to 0.33 Å compared with the co-purified peptide complex. While maintaining the protein–peptide interactions, the flexible binding cavity can accommodate longer peptides. Broad substrate specificity of OppA is mainly regulated through hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone, with few peptide side chain interactions (11Klepsch M.M. Kovermann M. Löw C. Balbach J. Permentier H.P. Fusetti F. de Gier J.W. Slotboom D.J. Berntsson R.P. Escherichia coli peptide binding protein OppA has a preference for positively charged peptides.J. Mol.

In all of the nthiOppA complexes, the N-terminal end of the bound peptide is secured by a salt bridge (Fig. 2). In addition to the salt bridge, four hydrogen bonds secure the first residue of peptides in the substrate-binding pocket (Tyr-130, two from His-441, and Asp-443). A second salt bridge also contributes to the binding of the C-terminal ends of the tripeptides. For P2MGG, P3LGG, and the co-purified peptide, hydrogen bonds to both amino and carboxyl groups of the remaining residues secure the substrate in the binding pocket. P4GIINTL has the most peptide–backbone hydrogen bonds involving an additional eight residues: Glu-52, Val-54, Asn-388, and Asn-392; two from Arg-437, and Gly-439 and Tyr-509 (Fig. 2D). The P4GIINTL complex shows nthiOppA–peptide interactions occur with at least the first six residues of a peptide, providing a platform for nthiOppA to bind longer peptides such as PLong and PBrady. Like the tripeptide complexes, the amino and carbonyl groups of the first three P4GIINTL residues form hydrogen bonds in the binding cavity, and only the carbonyl groups of the remaining peptide residues hydrogen bond with nthiOppA. With extensive peptide backbone interactions, a salt bridge is not required to stabilize the charged C-terminal end of the hexapeptide. In the ligand-bound closed conformation, several Gram-positive OppA homologs have flexible substrate-binding pockets that vary in size. The binding cavities efPrgZ, bsAppA, and llOppA range in volume even when bound to long peptides, 1600, 2500, and 4900 Å3, respectively (16Berntsson R.P. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dunny G.

Alignment of heptapeptide-bound efPrgZ with the P4GIINTL complex (RMSD = 1.30 Å) shows a conserved salt bridge and hydrogen bonds to the N-terminal residue of the peptide (Fig. S3). Similar to other Gram-positive OppA homologs, the P4GIINTL complex demonstrates the flexibility of the Gram-negative OppA-binding cavity by expanding to accommodate a larger substrate and maintaining the peptide interactions in the substrate-binding pocket. Comparing the P2MGG and the P4GIINTL complexes, rearrangement of backbone loops and side chains in the substrate-binding pocket widen the binding cavity to prevent steric clashes with the side chains of residues 4 and 5 of P4GIINTL. The side chains of Tyr-267 and His-441 adopt different rotamer conformations by rotating 89 and 88°, respectively, creating a larger binding pocket for the bound peptide (Fig. 3). The flexible binding cavity of nthiOppA and the established heme binding of other Cluster C SBPs led us to explore the ability of nthiOppA to bind heme. ABC transporters play a vital role in heme uptake in bacteria. To uncover how heme is shuttled to the inner membrane of this “heme-loving” pathogen, we looked at the conservation of heme ABC transport systems in NTHi. Homologs of other heme SBPs, including Yersinia enterocolitica HemT, Y. pestis HmuT, Shigella dysenteriae ShuT, Bordetella pertussis BhuT, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhuT, E. coli ChuT, and Vibrio cholerae HutB have not been identified in the H. influenzae genome. NTHi Cluster C proteins provide the vital link in the uptake pathway between the OM receptors scavenging heme from the host and the ABC importers delivering the nutrient to the cytoplasm. We surveyed all of the identified NTHi Cluster C proteins. Despite the low sequence identity between the Cluster C SBP proteins in the NTHi genome (nthiHbpA (24.9% identity), nthiSapA (22.2% identity), and NTHI0310 (26.8% identity) compared with nthiOppA), these proteins have high sequence similarity (Fig. S1) and are predicted to have a similar overall structural topology. Additional co-crystallization of nthiOppA with heme was attempted in the optimized crystallization condition and was screened for in a new crystallization condition, but no heme co-crystals were obtained. Therefore, we did in silico heme-binding studies of nthiOppA and two other solved Cluster C structures, Glaesserella (Haemophilus) parasuis HbpA and ecNikA. ROSIE ligand-docking program was used to predict the most likely interactions between the co-purified peptide-bound nthiOppA complex and heme (28Lyskov S. Chou F.C. Conchúir S.Ó. Der B.S. Drew K.

Representative top-ranked solutions for the SBPs show a similar location and ligand position of heme in each protein (Fig. 4). Based on the docking solutions, movement of backbone loops and side chains in the binding cavities of all three SBPs allows for the docking of heme near the canonical substrate-binding sites. The top-ranked solutions for nthiOppA indicate the substrate-binding pocket could be large enough to accommodate both heme and peptide (Fig. 4A). The docked heme demonstrates the substrate-binding pocket extends into domain I and is adjacent to the peptide-binding site (Fig. 6B). This suggests heme binding of nthiOppA does not conflict with peptide–protein interactions and the possibility of a heme-specific cleft in the substrate-binding pocket.Figure 6Heme-specific binding cleft is independent of bound peptide in the nthiOppA substrate-binding pocket. Cutaway surface representations of the top-scoring ROSIE docking nthiOppA model show the heme-specific binding cleft does not overlap with the bound peptide. A, co-purified peptide discovered in the nthiOppA structure is buried in the peptide-binding site formed by a majority of hydrogen bonds with domain II. B, flexible binding cavity allows for a heme-specific cleft adjacent to the peptide-binding site. C–E, models of P1KKK (C), P2MGG (D), and P5Long (E) aligned with the heme-docking model. A competitive SPR assay was used to measure the ability of heme to bind nthiOppA in the presence of P1KKK (F), P2MGG (G), or P5Long (H). The sensograms display the response of peptide binding to nthiOppA, the combined injection of heme and peptide, and the theoretical sum model of the individual heme and peptide injections in green, blue, and black lines, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have reported a wide range of heme equilibrium dissociation constants in the Cluster C SBPs.

Two other E. coli SBPs, DppA (dipeptide) and MppA (murein tripeptide), bind heme with estimated binding constants of 10 and 50 μm, respectively; a mutant strain lacking both of these SBPs was not able to use heme as an iron source during growth (30Létoffé S.

The pharmacogenetic data have been studied extensively due to their clinical importance in the appropriate drug prescription, but such data from the isolated populations are rather scarce. We analyzed the distribution of 95 polymorphisms in 31 core ADME genes in 20 populations worldwide and in newly genotyped samples from the Roma (Gypsy) population living in Croatia. Global distribution of ADME core gene loci differentiated three major clusters; (1) African, (2) East Asian, and (3) joint European, South Asian and South American cluster. The SLCO1B3 (rs4149117) and CYP3A4 (rs2242480) genes differentiated at the highest level the African group of populations, while NAT2 gene loci (rs1208, rs1801280, and rs1799929) and VKORC1 (rs9923231) differentiated East Asian populations. The VKORC1 rs9923231 was among the investigated loci the one with the largest global minor allele frequency (MAF) range; its MAF ranged from 0.027 in Nigeria to 0.924 in Han Chinese. The distribution of the investigated gene loci positions Roma population within the joined European and South Asian clusters, suggesting that their ADME gene pool is a combination of ancestral (Indian) and more recent (European) surrounding, as it was already implied by other genetic markers. However, when compared to the populations worldwide, the Croatian Roma have extreme MAF values in 10 out of the 95 investigated ADME core gene loci. Among loci which have extraordinary MAFs in Roma population two have strong proof of clinical importance: rs1799853 (CYP2C9) for warfarin dosage, and rs12248560 (CYP2C19) for clopidogrel dosage, efficacy and toxicity. This finding confirms the importance of taking the Roma as well as the other isolated populations`genetic profiles into account in pharmaco-therapeutic practice."

We conducted problem based learning (PBL) OR emergency scenarios for anesthesia residents, focused on emergencies in ‘Airway’, ‘Circulation’, ‘Central venous catheter’, and ‘Pain management complications’. Non-technical skills are an integral component of team-based OR emergency management. Methods Prior to integrated OR emergency clinical and non-technical skills PBL training, participating 35 anesthesia residents completed two 5-point scale surveys regarding frequency of emergency experiences in the operating room, and self-confidence for anesthesia-related crisis management. Repeat administration of the self-confidence survey was completed immediately following PBL training. Results Post-PBL resident clinical management self- confidence improved (P<0.05) in all scenarios on Circulation, Central venous catheter, and Pain treatment related complication topics. Impossible intubation, impossible oxygenation, and awake intubation did not show significant difference following PBL. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PBL for OR emergency management can improve resident self- confidence in anesthesia residents."
https://openalex.org/W2901640652,"Concerns have been raised about the loss of treatment continuity in unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder patients as continuity of care (COC) may be associated with patient outcomes. This study aimed to examine the relationship between COC and subsequent hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and suicide mortality in individuals with unipolar and bipolar disorder. Data were from the National Health Insurance (NHI) cohort, 2002 to 2013. Study participants included individuals first diagnosed with unipolar depressive disorder or bipolar affective disorder. The independent variable was COC for the first year of outpatient visits after diagnosis, measured using the usual provider of care (UPC) index. The dependent variables were hospitalization in the year after COC measurement, all-cause mortality, and suicide mortality. Analysis was conducted using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards survival regression. A total of 48,558 individuals were analyzed for hospitalization and 48,947 for all-cause and suicide mortality. Compared to the low COC group, the medium [odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) 0.19–0.47] and the high COC group (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.09–0.21) showed statistically significant decreased odds of hospitalization. Additionally, lower likelihoods of suicide death were found in the high (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16–0.74) compared to the low COC group. The results infer an association between COC after first diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depressive disorder and hospitalization and suicide mortality, suggesting the potential importance of treatment continuity in improving patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2900887581,"Prediction of lung cancer metastasis relies on post-resection assessment of tumor histology, which is a severe limitation since only a minority of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable disease. Therefore, characterization of metastasis-predicting biomarkers in pre-resection small biopsy specimens is urgently needed. Here we report a biomarker consisting of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on serine 249 combined with elevated p39 expression. This biomarker correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition traits in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC tumor microarrays showed that strong phospho-Rb S249 staining positively correlated with tumor grade specifically in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) subtype. Strong immunoreactivity for p39 positively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases, also in SCC. Linear regression analyses showed that the combined scoring for phospho-Rb S249, p39 and E-cadherin in SCC is even more accurate at predicting tumor staging, relative to each score individually. We propose that combined immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC samples for Rb phosphorylation on S249, p39, and E-cadherin protein expression could aid in the assessment of tumor staging and metastatic potential when tested in small primary tumor biopsies. The intense staining for phospho-Rb S249 that we observed in high grade SCC could also aid in the precise sub-classification of poorly differentiated SCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2901816107,"Quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), which inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory system by binding to the Qo site of Complex III in fungi, are widely used as pesticides with broad spectrum antifungal activity. However, excessive use of QoIs leads to pesticide resistance through mutation of amino acid residues in the Qo site. Recently, metyltetraprole, a novel QoI that is effective against wild-type and resistant mutant fungi, was developed. Interestingly, metyltetraprole has a very similar structure to other QoIs, azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, which do not act on resistant mutants. However, it is unknown how slight structural differences in these inhibitors alter their effectiveness towards fungi with amino acid mutations in the Qo site of Complex III. Therefore, we studied the features of interactions of inhibitors effective towards resistant mutants by quantitatively comparing the interaction profiles of three QoIs at the atomic level. First, we reproduced the binding affinity by the thermodynamic integration (TI) method, which treated explicitly environmental molecules and considered the pseudo-binding pathway. As such, a good correlation (R2 = 0.74) was observed between the binding free energy calculated using the TI method and experimentally observed pIC50 value in 12 inhibitor-target pairs, including wild-type and mutant Complex III in two fungal species, Zymoseptoria tritici and Pyrenophora teres. Trajectory analysis of this TI calculation revealed that the effectiveness against resistant mutant fungi strongly depended on the interaction of constituent parts of the inhibitor disposed near the active center of the target protein. Specifically, the key in the effectiveness against resistant mutant fungi is that the corresponding component part, tetrazolinone moiety of metyltetraprole, traded off Coulomb and van der Waals interactions in response to subtle changes in the binding pose."
https://openalex.org/W2900570207,"Although Blastocystis spp. infect probably more than 1 billion people worldwide, their clinical significance is still controversial and their pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In this study, we describe a protocol for an efficient and reproducible model of chronic infection in rats, laying the groundwork for future work to evaluate the pathogenic potential of this parasite. In our experimental conditions, we were unable to infect rats using vacuolar forms of an axenically cultivated ST4 isolate, but we successfully established chronic infections of 4 week-old rats after oral administration of both ST3 and ST4 purified cysts isolated from human stool samples. The infection protocol was also applied to 4 week-old C57BL/9, BALB/C and C3H mice, but any mouse was found to be infected by Blastocystis. Minimal cyst inoculum required for rat infection was higher with ST3 (105) than with ST4 (102). These results were confirmed by co-housing experiments highlighting a higher contagious potential of ST4 in rats compared to ST3. Finally, experiments mimicking fecal microbiota transfer from infected to healthy animals showed that Blastocystis spp. could easily infect a new host, even though its intestinal microbiota is not disturbed. In conclusion, our results provide a well-documented and robust rat model of Blastocystis chronic infection, reproducing ""natural"" infection. This model will be of great interest to study host parasite interactions and to better evaluate clinical significance of Blastocystis."
https://openalex.org/W2900968522,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is often complicated by graft versus host disease (GvHD), primarily mediated through allo-reactive donor T cells in the donor stem cell graft. Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase and a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, has been shown to play a role in GvHD pathology. Although not yet clear, one proposed mechanism is through selective tri-methylation of lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3) that marks the promoter region of multiple pro-apoptotic genes, leading to repression of these genes in allo-reactive T cells. We found that selective pharmacologic inhibition of H3K27me3 with EPZ6438 or GSK126 did not prevent murine GvHD. This suggests the GvHD mitigating properties of DZNep are independent from H3K27me3 inhibition. Furthermore, while pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 by DZNep has been shown to be effective in abrogating mouse GvHD, we found that DZNep was not effective in preventing GvHD in a human T cell xenograft mouse model. Although EZH2 is an attractive target to harness donor allo-reactive T cells in the post-transplant setting to modulate GvHD and the anti-leukemia effect, our results suggest that more selective and effective ways to inhibit EZH2 in human T cells are required."
https://openalex.org/W2901977076,"This study demonstrates that rumination is reflected in two behavioural signals that both play an important role in face-to-face interactions and provides evidence for the negative impact of rumination on social cognition. Sixty-one students were randomly assigned either to a condition in which rumination was induced or to a control condition. Their task was to play a speech-based word association game with an Embodied Conversational Agent during which their word associations, pitch imitation and eye movements were measured. Two questionnaires assessed their ruminative tendencies and mind wandering thoughts, respectively. Rumination predicted differences in task-related mind wandering, polarity of lexical associations, pitch imitation, and blinks while mind wandering predicted differences in saccades. This outcome may show that rumination has a negative impact on certain aspects of social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2901959052,"Background QuantiFERON Gold Plus (Plus) assay has two approved methods for blood collection: direct in-tube (Plus direct) or the transfer of blood from a lithium heparin tube (Plus transfer). Currently, there is little data comparing the results of Plus and the QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (Gold) based on blood collection. Methods In 2017, high risk healthcare workers undergoing annual tuberculosis infection screening at Houston Methodist Hospital, a private hospital in the Texas Medical Center (Houston, TX, U.S.A.) were consented and enrolled in a study comparing the Gold-in-tube (Gold), Plus direct in-tube, and Plus transfer assays. Blood was drawn concurrently for all 3 assays. Results Phlebotomy occurred on 300 consecutive, consented and enrolled participants in the study. The proportion of positive test results for the Gold, Plus direct and Plus transfer assays were 10% (29/300), 12% (35/299) and 17% (51/299), respectively. The agreement in the results of Gold versus Plus direct, Gold versus Plus transfer, and Plus direct versus Plus transfer was 91%, kappa (κ) = 0.56; 91%, κ = 0.59; and 85%, κ = 0.37, respectively. Conclusions Among high risk healthcare workers in a low prevalence tuberculosis setting, the Gold Plus assay had a higher proportion of positive results than the Gold in-tube assay. The agreement between the Gold, Plus direct and Plus transfer assays was unexpectedly low for simultaneously obtained samples. Blood transfer using lithium heparin offers individual clinics and public health programs greater ability to customize protocols, but variability of results still exists."
https://openalex.org/W2901927020,"Stellaria dichotoma var. lanceolata (SdLv), a member of the Caryophyllaceae, is a traditional herbal medicine that has been used to treat fever, night sweats, and malaria in East Asia. Inflammation plays an essential role in both host defense and pathogenesis during infection by diverse intracellular pathogens. Herein, we showed that an herbal extract from SdLv effectively attenuated inflammatory responses from infection of Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), but not Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). In primary murine macrophages, Mab infection resulted in the rapid activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as well as in the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6, which were all significantly inhibited by pretreatment with SdLv. However, herbal extracts from Bupleurum chinense DC. (Buch) or Bupleurum falcatum L. (Bufa) did not affect M. abs-induced activation of proinflammatory responses. Importantly, we demonstrated that generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which are important signaling intermediaries in the activation of NF-κB and the MAPK signaling pathway, was rapidly increased in Mab-infected macrophages, and this was effectively suppressed by pretreatment with SdLv, but not Buch and Bufa. We further found that the treatment of Buch and Bufa, but not SdLv, led to the activation of NF-κB and the MAPK signaling pathway and the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, oral administration of SdLv significantly reduced lethality in Mab-infected mice. Collectively, these results suggest the possible use of SdLv as an effective treatment for Mab infection."
https://openalex.org/W2901364359,"Since the early nineties, countless publications have been devoted to the study of possible uses of [60] fullerene (C60) and its derivatives in the fields of materials and nano-biomedical sciences. However, in spite of the importance of conformers notably from the pharmacological point of view, the cis/trans isomerization of C60 mono-adducts has been rarely seldom investigated. Here we present the results of DFT calculations of the structural, vibrational and NMR properties of both cis and trans isomers of fulleropyrrolidine mono-adduct obtained by photo-addition of glycine methyl ester to C60. Taken together, our results have shown that the cis isomer is more stable than the trans one. For the cis conformation, the simulated vibrational spectrum shows a more intense peak at 1298 cm-1. While 13C spectra revealed no significant differences between the two isomers as compared to experimental results, the calculated 1H chemical shifts show a significant difference between the two conformers in both the gas phase and in solution. The trans isomer presents a proton at 5.86 ppm, which is more deshielded than the proton of the cis conformer (5.24 ppm)."

https://openalex.org/W2901056774,"Climate change affects agriculture through a range of direct and indirect pathways. These include direct changes to impacts of pests and diseases on crops and indirect effects produced by interactions between organisms. It remains unclear whether the net effects of these biotic influences will be beneficial or detrimental to crop yield because few studies consider multiple interactions within communities and the net effects of these on community structure and yield. In this study, we created two experimental grapevine communities in field cages, and quantified direct and indirect effects of key pest and disease species under simulated climate change conditions (elevated temperature and reduced humidity). We found that the net impact of simulated climate change on total yield differed for the two communities, with increased yield in one community and no effect in the other. These effects, and the interactions between pests and pathogens, may also have been affected by the prevailing abiotic conditions, and we discuss how these may contribute to our findings. These results demonstrate that future research should consider more of the interactions between key organisms affecting crops under varying abiotic conditions to help generate future recommendations for adapting to the effects of climate change."
