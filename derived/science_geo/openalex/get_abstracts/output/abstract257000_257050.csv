https://openalex.org/W2108114952,"The complete inability to sense pain in an otherwise healthy individual is a very rare phenotype. In three consanguineous families from northern Pakistan, we mapped the condition as an autosomal-recessive trait to chromosome 2q24.3. This region contains the gene SCN9A, encoding the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na(v)1.7, which is strongly expressed in nociceptive neurons. Sequence analysis of SCN9A in affected individuals revealed three distinct homozygous nonsense mutations (S459X, I767X and W897X). We show that these mutations cause loss of function of Na(v)1.7 by co-expression of wild-type or mutant human Na(v)1.7 with sodium channel beta(1) and beta(2) subunits in HEK293 cells. In cells expressing mutant Na(v)1.7, the currents were no greater than background. Our data suggest that SCN9A is an essential and non-redundant requirement for nociception in humans. These findings should stimulate the search for novel analgesics that selectively target this sodium channel subunit."

Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting mitochondria, is poorly understood at present. Several recent reports suggest that mitophagy is a selective process that targets damaged mitochondria, whereas other studies imply a role for mitophagy in cell death processes. In a screen for protein phosphatase homologs that functionally interact with the autophagy-dedicated protein kinase Atg1p in yeast, we have identified Aup1p, encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisiae reading frame YCR079w. Aup1p is highly similar to a family of protein phosphatase homologs in animal cells that are predicted to localize to mitochondria based on sequence analysis. Interestingly, we found that Aup1p localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is required for efficient mitophagy in stationary phase cells. Viability studies demonstrate that Aup1p is required for efficient survival of cells in prolonged stationary phase cultures, implying a pro-survival role for mitophagy under our working conditions. Our data suggest that Aup1p may be part of a signal transduction mechanism that marks mitochondria for sequestration into autophagosomes.

Mitochondria perform numerous essential physiological functions in all eukaryotic cells. Apart from their role in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, they are also essential for biosynthesis of central building blocks such as amino acids and nucleotides. At the same time, mitochondria are a threat to cellular well-being. Mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species in cells. In addition, disruption of mitochondrial compartmentalization results in leakage of cytochrome c and other cytotoxic factors, and mitochondria with defective chemiosmotic coupling can cause an energy drain on the cell. Accumulation of mitochondrial genetic variation and mitochondrial damage are widely considered to underlie many age-related metabolic diseases and late-onset genetic disorders (1Loeb L.A. Wallace D.C. Martin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18769-18770Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). It is commonly postulated that in normal cells defective mitochondria are broken down in the lysosomal compartment through autophagy, and inability to clear defective mitochondria is thought to underlie numerous pathological conditions (3Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 4Kowald A. Kirkwood T.B. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 202: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Autophagy is a set of catabolic membrane trafficking mechanisms that allow import of cytosolic material into the vacuole/lysosome. The best understood form of autophagy is macroautophagy, in which intracellular membranes of undetermined origin engulf cytosolic material to form a double or multi-bilayer membrane bound intermediate called the autophagosome (reviewed in Refs. 3Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 5Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot.

This intermediate then goes on to fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing a single-bilayer bound vesicle called an autophagic body into the lumen of the lytic compartment where it is broken down, releasing the cytosol-derived material for further degradation to biosynthetic building blocks. Classical macroautophagy is induced under starvation conditions and is largely thought to be a non-specific process, although some central cellular structures are clearly off limits under normal conditions, and there have been reports of selective degradation of some proteins (9Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This type of starvation-induced autophagy is essential for surviving nutrient deprivation in all eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals. Microautophagy is a related process whereby the vacuolar/lysosomal membrane invaginates and pinches into the lumen, forming an autophagic body without first forming a free autophagosome. There are a number of selective autophagic pathways, which appear to target specific cellular components. The Cvt 2The abbreviations used are: Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; SLM, synthetic lactate medium; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; PP1K, protein phosphatase 1K; PAS, preautophagosomal structure. 2The abbreviations used are: Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; SLM, synthetic lactate medium; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; PP1K, protein phosphatase 1K; PAS, preautophagosomal structure. pathway, for example, is an autophagic pathway in yeast that is highly similar to macroautophagy yet functions in the biosynthetic routes of two known proteins, aminopeptidase I and Î±-mannosidase, without delivering any additional known cargo to the vacuolar lumen (10Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar, 11Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidase I, or Ape1p, is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as a 61-kDa precursor and is then specifically recruited to Cvt vesicles that are analogous to autophagosomes. Upon fusion of Cvt vesicles with the limiting membrane of the vacuole the protein is released into the vacuole lumen. Within the vacuole, prApe1 is proteolytically processed to yield the mature 50-kDa form in a Pep4p- and Prb1p-dependent fashion. Whereas most of the protein factors required for Cvt trafficking and for macroautophagy are identical, there exist Cvt pathway-specific factors that are dispensable for macroautophagy, and autophagy-specific factors that are not required in the Cvt pathway (3Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).An additional example of a selective autophagic pathway is pexophagy, or the degradation of peroxisomes. Like the Cvt pathway, pexphagy also occurs via a mechanism which shows mechanistic overlaps with classical macroautophagy, but is an inducible, not a constitutive phenomenon (13Tuttle D.L. Lewin A.S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies in yeast and in mammalian cells have uncovered experimental conditions in which mitochondria are degraded through mitophagy, in response to environmental insults. Specifically, it was shown that when cells are transferred from rich glucose-based medium into a nitrogen starvation medium with lactate as a carbon source, large scale mitophagy is observed. This response appears to depend on Uth1p, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that is also involved in cell longevity and bax-induced cell death (14Camougrand N. Kissova I. Velours G. Manon S. FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 5: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In addition, it was suggested that yeast cells with a temperature-sensitive mitochondrial proton ATPase undergo mitophagy under anaerobic conditions at restrictive temperature (16Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Finally, studies in rat hepatocytes suggest that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) regulates mitochondrial autophagy (17Elmore S.P. Qian T. Grissom S.F. Lemasters J.J. Faseb J. 2001; 15: 2286-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar).Intriguing links have recently surfaced between mitochondrial regulation and macroautophagy. Reggiori et al. (18Reggiori F. Shintani T. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported that Atg9p, an integral membrane protein required for autophagy, cycles between mitochondria and the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), which is thought to be an assembly point for autophagosomes (18Reggiori F. Shintani T. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a short isoform of the tumor suppressor p19 ARF was found to localize to mitochondria and induce macroautophagy (19Reef S. Zalckvar E. Shifman O. Bialik S. Sabanay H. Oren M. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Atg1p is a protein kinase required for both classical, starvation-induced macroautophagy as well as for the selective variants of autophagy such as the Cvt pathway and pexophagy. Atg1p was also shown to be required for the cycling of Atg9p between the PAS and the mitochondria (20Reggiori F. Tucker K.A. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We previously reported (21Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that truncation of the C-terminal 18 amino acids of Atg1p abrogates the Cvt pathway, yet still allows autophagic trafficking under nitrogen starvation conditions. In addition, the truncated version of Atg1p (Atg1Î880) is constitutively hypophosphorylated, whereas wild-type protein was phosphorylated in rich medium and dephosphorylated upon starvation. To better understand the regulation of Atg1p, we searched for protein phosphatase homologs that genetically interact with the Atg1p protein kinase, by searching for phosphatase homolog deletion mutants that would show a synthetic interaction with the atg1Î880 mutant. One phosphatase homolog identified in this fashion is encoded by the previously uncharacterized open reading frame YCR079w, which we have renamed AUP1. In this report, we present a functional characterization of Aup1p. Aup1p is a highly conserved protein that localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Surprisingly, while it is not absolutely required for classical starvation-induced macroautophagy, we find that it is required for effective mitophagy in stationary phase yeast cells. These data suggest that AUP1 may be part of a signal transduction mechanism that marks mitochondria for selective degradation through mitophagy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Culture ConditionsâThe strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown in synthetic dextrose medium (SD; 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as required) or synthetic lactate medium (SLM; 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) lactate, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as required). Nitrogen starvation was carried out in SD-N (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids and 2% (w/v) glucose). Yeast transformation was according to (23Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Methods in Enzymology. 194. 1991: 3-21Google Scholar). To generate strain HAY670, a PCR-amplified cassette was synthesized using plasmid pFA6â3HA-HIS3MX6 (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar) as template. This cassette carries the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 gene, and at its 5â²-end contains a coding region for 3 repetitions of the 9 amino acid influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope followed by a stop codon. The HA codons are fused in-frame to the C terminus of the AUP1 reading frame as encoded by the 5â² PCR primer overhang, while the 3â² PCR primer contains an overhang homologous to 3â²-untranslated region of the AUP1 gene (all primer sequences will be provided upon request). Integration of this cassette creates a chromosomal AUP1 gene fused to the HA epitope at its C terminus, as verified by PCR and Western blotting. To generate strain HAY695, strain HAY469 was transformed with a PCR cassette synthesized using pHAB102 (21Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as template, to create a truncation/fusion of the ATG1 reading frame with the protein A tag at amino acid 880. Strain HAY805 was created by transforming strain HAY75 with a PCR-amplified cassette carrying the monomeric RFP sequence fused inframe to the 40 3â²-nucleotides of the VPH1 reading frame and the kanamycin resistance gene, synthesized using plasmid pHAB152 as template (see below). Strain HAY809 was generated by integrating a PCR-amplified cassette carrying the S. pombe HIS5 gene flanked by short regions of homology to regions upstream and downstream of the AUP1 gene, to generate an aup1Î::HIS5 genotype, as verified by diagnostic PCR. Strain HAY831 was generated by transforming strain HAY75 first with a PCR-amplified cassette carrying the RFP open reading frame fused in-frame to the 40 3â²-nucleotides of the COX9 reading frame (generated using pHAB152 as template) and carrying the KanR selectable marker to create strain HAY829, which was then transformed with a second PCR-amplified cassette carrying the GFP open reading frame fused in-frame to the 3â²-40 nucleotides of the AUP1 reading frame and carrying the HIS5 selectable marker (generated using plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-HIS3MX6 (24Longtine M.S.

Anti-Sed5, ant-Kar2, and anti-Hxk1 antibodies were a gift of Dr. J. E. Gerst.Plasmids and Genetic ManipulationsâPlasmid pHAB152 was constructed by excising the PacI-AscI fragment of plasmid pFA6a-KanMX6 (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar), and ligating a PacI-AscI PCR amplicon of the mRFP reading frame (26Campbell R.E. Tour O.

The resulting insert contains the mRFP sequence preceded by 2 glycines as an optional linker. Plasmid pYX142, encoding a mitochondrial GFP marker (27Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Benedict Westermann.Cell Fractionation and Membrane Extraction Proceduresâ 30 A600 units (or as indicated in specific experiments) of exponentially growing cells were collected, washed, and spheroplasted for 30 min at 30 Â°C in SLM supplemented with 1 m sorbitol and 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 300 Î¼g/ml lyticase (ICN) for 30 min at 30 Â°C. All subsequent operations were at 4 Â°C. Spheroplasts were centrifuged at 2000 Ã g in a Hermle Z400K refrigerated centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor and resuspended at a concentration of 6 A600 units/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml antipain, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, 10 Î¼g/ml Î±2-macroglobulin, and 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7. Cells were ruptured by homogenization (15 strokes) in a 7-ml dounce homogenizer (Kimble-Kontes) using a tight fitting pestle. The crude homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 300 Ã g for 5 min using a fixed-angle rotor. Clarified lysate (S300) was centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 Ã g to generate P1500, and the supernatant was re-centrifuged 10 min at 12,500 Ã g to generate pellet (P13) and supernatant (S13) fractions. S300, P1500, P13, and S13 fractions were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with cold acetone, and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. From each fraction, 2 A600 unit equivalents of cell extract were loaded per lane, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.Purification of mitochondria on Nycodenz gradients was according to Glick and Pon (28Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid prior to immunoblot analysis.For membrane extraction experiments, P13 fractions generated as above were resuspended in 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11), in hypotonic buffer (80 mm sorbitol, 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7) or in standard fractionation lysis buffer (see above). Following a 30-min incubation, the different samples were collected by centrifugation at 12,500 Ã g for 10 min, divided into pellet and supernatant fractions, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by two washes with cold acetone. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Protease Protection Assaysâ50 A600 units of cells were spheroplasted, and P13 fractions were generated as above. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer or in hypotonic buffer (80 mm sorbitol, 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7) at a concentration of 0.3 A600 equivalents/Î¼l. Time 0 samples (12 A equivalents) were withdrawn and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteinase K was added to the main sample to a final concentration of 0.3 Î¼g/ml, and samples were taken at the indicated time points. Reactions were quenched by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by two washes in cold acetone. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as above.Fluorescence MicroscopyâTypically, culture samples were placed on standard microscope slides (3 Î¼l) and viewed using a Nikon E600 upright fluorescent microscope equipped with a Ã100 Plan Fluor objective, using a FITC fluorescent filter (for viewing GFP fluorescence) or a Cy3 filter (for viewing mRFP). To achieve statistically significant numbers of cells per viewing fielding in some pictures, high cell densities were achieved by sedimenting 1 ml of cells for 30 s at 500 Ã g and resuspending the pellet in 10 Î¼l of medium.Quantitative Western BlottingâTo follow protein levels over time with minimal bias, cultures were sampled (10 A600 unit equivalents per sample), and samples were precipitated with TCA followed by acetone washes. Cells were disrupted by a 5-min agitation with 100-Î¼l glass beads (425â600-Î¼m diameter) in 100 Î¼l of cracking buffer (6 m urea, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). An additional 100 Î¼l of cracking buffer was added, and the suspension was mixed and centrifuged 5 min at 14,000 Ã g. Clarified lysate was transferred to a new tube, and protein levels were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For typical immunoblot analysis 15 Î¼g of protein per sample were mixed with 4Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer and double distilled water to a final volume, loaded on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using a C.B.S. semi-dry protein blotting apparatus (C.B.S. Inc., Del Mar, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence reactions were done using the Supersignalâ¢ kit (Pierce). Visualization of all enhanced chemiluminescence reactions was conducted using a Syngene ChemiGeniusâ¢ imaging work station (Synoptics group, Cambridge, UK) to avoid film saturation artifacts.RESULTSAup1 Shows a Synthetic Interaction with the atg1Î880 Alleleâ Previous studies (18Reggiori F. Shintani T. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have shown that truncation of 18 amino acids from the C terminus of Atg1p results in abrogation of Cvt trafficking but has only a minor effect on autophagic trafficking of prApe1 (21Abeliovich H.

In mutants of this type, prApe1 accumulates in nutrient rich conditions, because of the disruption of the Cvt pathway. However, upon starvation one observes rapid maturation of the precursor and the appearance of the mature form of Ape1p, mApe1 because of proteolytic processing in the vacuolar lumen. This type of nutrient-induced shift in Ape1p trafficking can be used to assay mechanistic aspects of the induction of macroautophagy (29Budovskaya Y.V. Stephan J.S. Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J.

To identify protein phosphatases that potentially interact with the Atg1 protein kinase, we screened for mutants that, in the genetic background of the atg1Î880 allele, would cause a synthetic phenotype such that autophagic trafficking of prApe1 would be abolished. To this end we assayed 32 knockouts of protein phosphatase homologs from the yeast deletion library (33Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of these strains, 6 showed characteristic pink coloration because of loss of viability on starvation and were then further analyzed by integration of the atg1Î880 cassette into the ATG1 locus for analysis of Ape1p trafficking. One of these homologs, deleted for open reading frame YCR079w, showed a clear synthetic effect on prApe1 maturation: Whereas the phosphatase homolog deletion alone had no effect on prApe1 maturation, and the atg1Î880 mutant was able to mature prApe1 under nitrogen starvation, the double mutant was unable to mature Ape1p either in rich medium or nitrogen starvation conditions (Fig. 1). Because YCR079w was not previously characterized, we decided to name it Aup1p, for autophagy-related protein phosphatase.Aup1p Localizes to MitochondriaâSurprisingly, sequence analysis of Aup1p using the mitoprot II algorithm (35Claros M.G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 441-447PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a high propensity for mitochondrial localization of the protein. Indeed, an Aup1-GFP fusion strongly co-localizes with a red fluorescent protein fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa (Cox9-RFP), when cells are grown in 2% lactate medium (Fig. 2). However, upon long term (3â4 days) incubation, a clear shift in this co-localization was observed. Whereas the GFP fluorescence remained distributed in the cytoplasm, the RFP fluorescence appeared to concentrate at a central location which roughly coincided with the vacuole, although cytoplasmic puncta are still observed as well. This result suggested to us that mitochondria are being delivered to the vacuole under these conditions. Because there are no reports in the literature regarding massive mitophagy under these conditions, we chose to characterize this phenomenon in more detail. To determine whether the observation shown in Fig. 3 was limited to a specific marker protein or fluorophore combination, we used cells expressing a generic mitochondrial GFP marker and a vacuolar Vph1-RFP marker. In addition, we used this setup to characterize the time course of delivery"

A growing body of evidence suggests that many different types of post-translational histone modifications play key roles in regulating gene expression and that some modifications at least are functionally inter-related (1.Nightingale K.P. OâNeill L.P. Turner B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The linked deposition of distinct modifications can occur both on the same histone tail, e.g. H3S10 phosphorylation and H3K9 acetylation (2.Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or on different tails, e.g. H2A ubiquitination and H3 methylation (3.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), histone acetylation, and methylation (4.Annunziato A.T. Eason M.B. Perry C.A.

Multiprotein complexes have been identified that are capable of depositing, or removing, different modifications in a coordinated manner (e.g. histone demethylase and deacetylase activity in coREST) (6.Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Similarly, binding proteins are sensitive to combinations of modifications; for example, HP1 binding to the H3 tail requires histone H3K9 methylation but is blocked by H3S10 phosphorylation and H3K14 acetylation (Ref. 7.Mateescu B. England P. Halgand F. Yaniv M. Muchardt C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, although see Ref. 8.Fischle W. Tseng B.S. Dormann H.L. Ueberheide B.M.

This suggests that epigenetic marks are not deposited or recognized in isolation but comprise a complex and inter-related collection of modifications at adjacent residues. The correlation between different histone modifications is particularly clear for histone H3 acetylation and the methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me). Mass spectrometric analysis of the cellular pool of histones indicates that this methyl mark is associated with histone H3 molecules containing high levels of acetylation (9.Zhang K. Siino J.S. Jones P.R. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3765-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observed co-localization of these marks, which show related distribution patterns both at a chromosome-wide level during X inactivation (10.OâNeill L.P. Randall T.E.

For example, the SET domain of MLL1 has a preference for acetylated substrates (13.Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). A further layer of complexity is generated by the heterogeneity of methyl-lysine marks on histones; the lysine Îµ-amino group can be mono-, di-, or tri-methylated (designated H3K4me1/2/3, respectively). Recent data indicate that both the precise lysine residue modified and degree of methylation have differential effects on transcriptional regulation (17.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J.

Cell. 2005; 18: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that a combination of both parameters defines the epigenetic mark and its functional role. In the work described here, we use antibodies specific to the H3K4me epitope in its mono-, di-, and tri-methylated form to demonstrate that the link between histone acetylation and the degree of histone H3K4 methylation plays a major role in the epigenetic response to histone deacetylase inhibitors. A combination of in vivo knockdown approaches and in vitro biochemical analysis demonstrates that this arises due to the activities of two opposing enzyme activities, MLL4, a methyltransferase, and a novel, and as yet unidentified, H3K4me3 demethylase activity. Tissue Culture and ReagentsâHeLa and HL60 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and penicillin (Invitrogen). Histone hyperacetylation was induced by exposure of cells to sodium butyrate (10 mm final concentration), sodium valproate (5 mm), or Trichostatin A (165 nm) for 6 h. Histone Extraction, Gel Systems, and Western BlottingâHistones were extracted from tissue culture cells (1â2 Ã 107) by acid extraction. Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm sodium butyrate, and lysed in Triton extraction buffer, TEB (PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the nuclear pellet was washed again with TEB prior to the histones being extracted with 0.2N HCl on ice overnight. Histones were separated on 15% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (29:1) gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the appropriate antibody. Histone loading was normalized by the subsequent use of an antibody against the C-terminal tail of histone H3 (AbCam). Primary antibody binding was detected by fluorescently tagged anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LI-COR) and detected by scanner (Odessy system; LI-COR). AntibodiesâThe process of raising antibodies specific for mono-, di and tri-methyl H3K4 and for H4K8ac and the characterization of their specificity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been described previously (11.Schubeler D.

These were identified by siRNA Wizard (www.sirnawizard.com) and transfected into a commercial Block iT U6 RNA interference vector (Invitrogen). HeLa cells (â¼1 Ã 107) were transfected at 95% confluency with 40 Î¼g of vector/Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions and incubated for 48 h. Individual MLL knock downs were performed on paired cell samples and subsequently left untreated or treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate for 6 h prior to histone or RNA extraction. Control (non-transfected) cells were incubated with Lipofectamine alone. The extent of mRNA knock down was assessed by reverse transcription PCR, with RNA extraction (RNeasy; Qiagen) and cDNA preparation (Superscript II; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturersâ instructions. Specific PCR products were quantified by [32P]dCTP incorporation at 25, 30, and 35 cycles to ensure amplification was in the linear range, and normalized against a control actin product.

The resulting GST-MLL1 SET fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 22 Â°C.

Methylation AssaysâBiotinylated peptides corresponding to the first 21 amino acids of the human histone H3 N-terminal tail (50 Î¼l of a solution of 5 Î¼g/ml in PBS) were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Sigma) during 1 h at room temperature. After washing with water (three times), the wells were incubated with 200 Î¼l of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the wells were washed with PBS (three times) and incubated with 50 Î¼l of methylation reaction mixture (1 Î¼m methyltransferase, 0.5 mm S-adenosyl methionine (Fluka; purity â¥80%, stored in 10 mm H2SO4 at â20 Â°C), 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) or the control reaction (0.5 mm S-adenosyl methionine, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The plates were incubated for the indicated time intervals at 30 Â°C and washed with PBS (three times), and the enzymatically modified peptides were incubated with 50 Î¼lof anti-H3K4Me1, anti-H3K4Me2, or anti-H3K4Me3 antibody (diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed with PBST (PBS-0.5% Tween-20)/500 mm NaCl (two times), PBST (two times), PBS (three times) and incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing with PBST (three times) and with water (three times). After incubation with 100 Î¼l of horseradish peroxidase substrate (TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate; KPL) for 10 min, 50 Î¼l of 1 m H2SO4 were added and the absorbance at 450 nm measured on a SpectraMaxPlus reader (Molecular Devices). For each peptide substrate, the values obtained without enzyme were defined as background methylation and subtracted from those obtained for the enzymatic methylation. PeptidesâSynthetic peptides used in the methylation assays correspond to amino acids 1â21 of human histone H3 followed by a GG linker and biotinylated lysine (Upstate). Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Induce Both Histone Acetylation and H3 Lys-4 MethylationâStudies on a variety of primary tissues and tissue culture cells have shown that HDAC inhibitors induce rapid and substantial increases in the global levels of histone acetylation, consistent with the high rate of turnover associated with this histone modification (20.Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used a range of HDAC inhibitors on HL60 tissue culture cells to examine whether there is a link between levels of histone acetylation and the methylation of specific lysines. Logarithmically growing HL60 cultures incubated with 6 mm sodium valproate (Fig. 1, A and B) or other HDAC inhibitors (2.5 Î¼m SAHA, 10 mm butyrate; data not shown) show, as expected, a rapid and sustained increase in histone acetylation. The magnitude of the response varies with the acetyl isoform examined, from an â¼8-fold increase in H4K8ac to an â¼24-fold increase in H3K9/K18ac (Fig. 1, A and B), reflecting the abundance of these histone acetyl isoforms in untreated cells and the differing rates of acetyl turnover at different lysine residues (21.Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors also induce a concomitant increase in methylation at H3K4, the degree of enhancement depending on the specific methyl isoform; H3K4me3 increases â¼5-fold and H3K4me2 levels increase â¼3-fold, whereas H3K4me1 levels show only a small increase (1.5 to 2-fold, Fig. 1B). In contrast, none of the inhibitors enhanced levels of mono-, di-, or tri-methylation at H3K9 or H4K20, modifications associated with transcriptional repression (data not shown). HDAC inhibitors have induced the same specific increase in H3K4 methylation in all cell types tested so far, including HL60 cells, HeLa cells, mouse embryonic stem cells (data not shown), and primary blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (22.Bradbury C.A. Khanim F.L. Hayden R. Bunce C.M. White D.A. Drayson M.T. Craddock C. Turner B.M. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Histone H3 Acetylation Directly Impacts on the Degree of Methylation of H3K4âExperiments treating tissue culture cells with HDAC inhibitors show a correlation between the extent of histone acetylation in a cell and the abundance of histone tri- and di-methylation at H3K4. We next addressed whether the increased acetylation and H3K4 methylation induced by HDAC inhibitors occur on the same H3 molecules by examining histones on acid-urea gels that resolve the distinct histone H3 acetyl isoforms (Fig. 2). Untreated cells contain a mixture of non-acetylated, mono- and di-acetylated H4, whereas treated cells contain highly acetylated histone isoforms up to tetra-acetylated H4 (Fig. 2, right panel). Histones separated on acid-urea gels were then Western blotted and probed with antibodies specific to distinct H3K4 methyl isoforms (H3K4me1, 2, and 3). A central observation from this experiment is that in untreated cells the bulk of H3K4 methylation (labeled H3K4me1, 2, or 3 in Fig. 2) is associated with acetylated histones rather than non-acetylated histone H3, the isoform that predominates in these cells (Fig. 2, Silver stain). This suggests that at least one acetyl group is required on H3 for Lys-4 methylation to occur. A second observation is that in treated cells the different degrees of Lys-4 methylation are associated with different levels of H3 acetylation; H3K4me1 is primarily found on di- and tri-acetylated H3, H3K4me2 on di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated H3 and H3K4me3 on tri-, tetra-, and penta-acetylated H3. These observations are consistent with the distribution of marks revealed by mass spectrometry (9.Zhang K. Siino J.S. Jones P.R. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3765-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and suggest not only that H3 acetylation is required for H3K4 methylation to occur but that the degree of methylation induced by HDIs is determined by the acetylation level of distinct H3 molecules. This has a number of implications, which are discussed later. HDAC Inhibitors Induce Changes in the H3 Isoform DistributionâHistone H3 exists as three closely related isoforms in eukaryotic cells (H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3), distinguished by just a few highly conserved substitutions in the primary amino acid sequence. Recent studies indicate that H3.3 is associated with a distinct chromatin assembly complex (HIRA) (23.Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), is enriched in regions of actively transcribed chromatin, and is associated with âactivatingâ post-transcriptional modifications, including H3K4me3 (24.McKittrick E. Gafken P.R. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). It was therefore essential to examine whether the changes induced by HDAC inhibitors were associated with changes in either the abundance or modification levels of the distinct H3 isoforms. Resolution of histones from control and HDI-treated HL60 cells on two-dimensional TAU-SDS gels indicates that, whereas H3.1 and H3.2 represent the most abundant H3 isoforms, inhibitor treatment increases the proportion of H3.3 in chromatin, suggesting that either histone acetylation or the subsequent functional changes that occur in the nucleus encourage its deposition (Fig. 3A, arrows). This is a significant change, albeit from a very minor fraction of the H3 in untreated cells, as the bulk of the chromatin remains associated with H3.1 and H3.2 (Fig. 3A, + Butyrate). Two-dimensional gels resolving histones from control and inhibitor-treated cells were Western blotted and probed with antibodies against mono- and tri-methyl H3K4 to assess the distribution of these marks on the distinct histone H3 isoforms (Fig. 3B). This shows that in untreated cells the bulk of both H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are evenly distributed between H3.1 and H3.2, with little methylation associated with H3.3 (Fig. 3B, left panels). This is surprising, as it does not reflect the relative proportions of these isoforms in the histone pool where H3.1 is clearly predominant (Fig. 3A), and indicates that H3.2 is relatively enriched in these methyl marks. The H3 Lys-4 methyl marks are also unevenly distributed after inhibitor treatment, with the observed increase in H2K4me3 largely restricted to H3.1 and H3.2. In contrast, the newly deposited H3.3 is largely marked with H3K4me1 (Fig. 3B). This shows that the H3K4me2/3 marks induced by HDAC inhibitors are unlikely to reflect the de novo assembly of H3.3 into chromatin. Histone H3K4 Methyl Isoforms Are Subject to Rapid DemethylationâHistone methylation has been historically thought of as a long-lasting modification and until recently was thought to be removed largely by replacement of methylated with unmethylated histone (i.e. H3.3) (25.Mito Y. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)). Given our current results that indicate that histone H3K4 methylation is linked to the extent of histone acetylation, we wanted to examine the stability of this mark when histone acetylation levels fall. To generate these conditions, tissue culture cells were exposed to HDAC inhibitors to induce high levels of histone acetylation and H3K4me3/2; the inhibitor was subsequently removed, and the resultant changes in histone modifications were examined by Western analysis. Removal of the HDAC inhibitor induced a rapid and substantial decrease in histone acetylation (H4K8ac), consistent with the rapid turnover of this mark in chromatin (tÂ½ 16 min, Fig. 4A). Global histone deacetylation was accompanied by the removal of HDI-induced H3K4 methylation, with the extent of demethylation of specific methyl marks mirroring their original HDI-mediated stimulation (H3K4me3 >me2 >me1; Fig. 1A). Interestingly, demethylation is also rapid, with the removal of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at similar rates (H3K4me3 tÂ½ 53 min; H3K4me2 tÂ½ 57 min.), indicating these methyl marks are subject to moderate rates of turnover. Acid-urea gel analysis of the histones post-washout indicates H3 deacetylation and K4me3 demethylation act in parallel on the same histone molecules (Fig. 4B). However, a significant proportion of the H3K4me3 is associated with mono- and non-acetylated histone H3 at intermediate time points. This is significant as it indicates that the processes of deacetylation and demethylation are occurring on the same histone molecules; replacement of methylated histones with non-methylated H3.3 would not generate these âintermediateâ acetyl-methylated H3 isoforms. The observation that a significant proportion of trimethyl marks are observed on non-acetylated histone under these conditions is also notable as this isoform is not seen in untreated cells (Fig. 2). This suggests that the process of deacetylation acts faster than K4me3 demethylation on individual histone molecules, consistent with the changes observed in the global histone pool (Fig. 4A). MLL4 Is the Primary Mediator of H3 Acetylation-H3K4me Cross-talkâThe data presented indicate that HDIs induce a substantial increase in H3K4 methylation and that this increase is directly linked to the acetylation status of individual H3 molecules. However, the molecular basis of this âcross-talkâ is unclear, particularly given the complexity of the observed marks. H3K4 is a substrate for several methyltransferases, and the mechanism of their activity, beyond whether they generate mono-, di-, or tri-methylated products, is largely unexplored. However, given the observation that the activity of the SET domain of MLL1, a H3K4 methyltransferase, is stimulated by acetylated substrates (13.Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) we examined whether this activity or that of related enzymes was the basis of the observed cross-talk in response to HDIs. Initial experiments using reverse transcription PCR against unique regions of a range of H3K4-specific methyltransferases (supplemental Table S1) confirmed that HeLa cells contain broadly similar mRNA levels of individual members of the MLL family of methyltransferases (MLLs 1â5) and SET-7, a distinct H3K4 HMT that can only generate mono-methylated marks (19.Xiao B. Jing C. Wilson J.R. Walker P.A. Vasisht N. Kelly G. Howell S. Taylor I.A. Blackburn G.M. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We were unable to address the corresponding protein abundance as specific antibodies are unavailable. We then used a siRNA knockdown approach to identify the histone methyltransferase(s) responsible for the HDI-induced increase in H3K4 methylation. Plasmids expressing siRNAs for MLL 1â5 and SET-7 were transfected into HeLa cells. Cells were grown for 48 h to ensure efficient knock down and subsequently incubated with sodium butyrate. The inhibitor induced a substantial and equivalent increase in histone acetylation in both control (mock transfected) and all the âknockdownâ cells as assessed by AUT gels (data not shown). As expected, there was a significant increase in H3K4 methylation in the mock-transfected controls following butyrate treatment. Knock down of SET-7 and MLL1, 2, 3, and 5 did not prevent this butyrate-induced increase of H3K4me2/3 (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that these methyltransferases do not contribute to the global increase in H3 methylation. In contrast, knock down of MLL4 essentially abrogated the increase in H3K4me3/2 (Fig. 5, A and B). These knock downs have each been repeated three times with consistent results. In Vitro Methylation Assays Confirm That the MLL SET Domain Responds to Histone ModificationsâThe finding that MLL4 is the major activity responsible for the preferential addition of K4me3 to acetylated histone H3 raised a number of questions regarding the mechanism by which the distinct isoforms are generated in chromatin. The homologous HMT, MLL1, is known to generate tri-methylated marks (26.Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and the HMTase activity of its SET domain is known to be stimulated by acetylated substrates (13.Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Significantly, the SET domains of MLL1 and MLL4, which are the domains responsible for the methyltransferase activity of the proteins, are highly related (>85% sequence similarity, 75% sequence identity). As we were unable to express the SET domain of MLL4, we utilized in vitro methylation assays to assess whether an Escherichia coli-expressed SET domain from MLL-1 could reconstitute the distribution of H3 methyl isoforms observed in vivo. Initial experiments examined the HMTase activity of the SET domain from MLL1 and the activity of the mono-methyl HMT SET-7 on non-acetylated and di-acetylated (K9/K14ac) H3 peptide substrates. The levels of specific methyl isoforms generated were assayed with methyl-specific antibodies. Both enzymes showed a linear accumulation of methylated substrate over the experiment time course (Fig. 6, A and B), but the rate of MLL SET domain HMTase activity and the final absolute level of all three methyl marks (H3K4me1, 2, and 3) are substantially increased on acetylated substrates (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the data show that the rates of generating the individual methyl marks are different, with higher levels of H3K4me1 deposition and discernable âlag-phasesâ in the generation of the di- and tri-methyl marks (Fig. 6A), suggesting that MLL-induced methylation acts processively. In contrast, SET-7 mono-methyl transferase activity is not stimulated on the acetylated template (Fig. 6B), showing that not all SET domains are influenced by the acetylation status of their substrate. The observation that MLL SET domain HMTase activity is stimulated by the di-acetylation of the substrate prompted us to examine the effects of a number of modifications present on the H3 tail. Methylation assays were performed with a range of modified H3 substrates, namely mono-acetylated (H3K9ac and H3K14ac), di-acetylated (H3K9acK14ac), phosphorylated (H3S10ph), and phospho-acetylated (H3K9acS10phK14ac). These data are consistent with our observation that H3 acetylation stimulates SET domain HMTase activity, wit"

However, the signaling pathways leading to LPA4-mediated induction of cAMP and calcium levels have not been reported. Using epitope-tagged LPA4, pharmacological intervention, and G protein mini-genes, we provide independent confirmatory evidence that supports LPA4 as a fourth LPA receptor, including LPA concentration-dependent responses and specific membrane binding. Importantly, we further demonstrate new LPA-dependent activities of LPA4 that include the following: receptor internalization; G12/13- and Rho-mediated neurite retraction and stress fiber formation; Gq protein and pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium mobilization and activation of a nonselective cation conductance; and cAMP increases mediated by Gs. The receptor is broadly expressed in embryonic tissues, including brain, as determined by Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Adult tissues have increased expression in skin, heart, and to a lesser extent, thymus.

Here we confirm the finding that GPR23 is indeed a biologically relevant receptor for LPA and report several novel aspects of LPA4 signaling that extend its functional roles.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Stable TransfectionâB103 neuroblastoma cells and RH7777 hepatoma cells (23.Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (Invitrogen). LPA4-expressing stable cell lines were generated by transfecting B103 cells with linearized HA-tagged mouse LPA4-pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Stable transfectants were selected for by adding 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) to the culture media for 2 weeks.Production of LPA4 Retrovirus and G Protein MinigenesâHA-tagged mouse and human LPA4 cDNAs were amplified using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using the following primers: 5â²-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTATGGGTGACAGAAGATTTATTG-3â² (forward) and 5â²-CTAGAAGGTGGATTCCAGCATT-3â² (reverse). PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the cDNA insert was sequenced at the The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) sequencing core facility. The HA-tagged LPA4 cDNA was subsequently cloned into the NotI site of the LZRS-EGFP Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector. The Phoenix ecotropic packaging cell line (24.Pear W. Scott M. Nolan G. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Gene Therapy Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 41-57Google Scholar) was transfected with the retroviral construct using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Retrovirus expression vector (LZRS-EGFP) and Phoenix retrovirus packaging cell lines were provided by Dr. Garry P. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). At 48 h post-transfection, retroviral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-Î¼m filter and frozen in aliquots. Construction of Gq/11, Gs, G12, and G13 minigene retroviruses was described previously (22.Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol.

The sample was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was then spun at 15,000 rpm for 90 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant containing the membrane fraction was separated on a 4â12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) under reducing, denaturing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Woburn, MA). HA-tagged LPA4 receptor expression was detected using an anti-HA antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences).F-actin Detection and Receptor Internalization AssayâCells were grown overnight on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-mm glass coverslips. The following night, cells were switched to serum-free medium for 16â24 h. The next day, cells were incubated with LPA (1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; Avanti Polar-Lipids, Alabaster, AL) for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min and then blocked in 3% BSA/PBS for 30 min. F-actin was visualized by staining with 25 Î¼g/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma) in PBS/1% BSA for 40 min. Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope fitted with an AxioCam camera (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Receptor internalization was detected by treating serum-starved cells with BSA, LPA, or sphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids) for 15 min. Treated cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 plus 3% BSA in PBS. HA-tagged LPA4 localization was detected by staining with an anti-HA antibody and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) using confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).[3H]LPA Binding to Isolated MembranesâThe LPA-binding assay has been described previously by Fukushima et al. (23.Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were isolated from transfected RH7777 cells harvested in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 Â°C. 40 Î¼g of membrane fraction was incubated with [3H]LPA (1-oleoyl-[9,10-3H]LPA, 47 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in LPA-binding buffer containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) and 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 30 min at room temperature. The [3H]LPA membrane fraction mixture was collected onto a Unifilter 96-GF/B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filter was washed 10 times with binding buffer containing 1% BSA and dried for 30 min at 50 Â°C. Thirty microliters of MicroScint-O was added to each well of the filter, and radioactivity was measured using a microplate liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total and nonspecific binding were evaluated in the absence and presence of 10 Î¼m unlabeled LPA, respectively.G Proteins and Rho Inhibition in Cultured CellsâTo investigate G protein coupling with LPA4, stable LPA4-expressing B103 cells were infected with several G protein minigenes and tested 2 days later or treated with PTX (200 ng/ml; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) for 12 h. To inhibit the Rho pathway, LPA4-expressing cells were treated with either the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase (10 Î¼g/ml; Cytoskeleton Denver, CO) for 24 h or the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 Î¼m; Calbiochem) for 45 min. Rounded cells were counted following treatment with 1 Î¼m LPA for 30 min in serum-free conditions.cAMP MeasurementsâBoth acutely infected and stable transfectants expressing LPA4 were used in these experiments. LPA4-expressing and control B103 cells were serum-starved overnight in 24-well plates with or without PTX (200 ng/ml; List Biological Laboratories). Following treatment with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min, cells were exposed to LPA (0, 1, 10, and 100 nm and 1 Î¼m) for 30 min with or without forskolin (5 Î¼m). Cells were then lysed in 0.1 n HCl, and cellular cAMP levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based detection kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturerâs directions.Determination of Intracellular Calcium MobilizationâB103 cells stably expressing HA-tagged LPA4 were infected with G protein minigenes 2 days prior to testing and/or exposed to PTX overnight, and control cells were plated on glass coverslips and loaded with Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura2-AM) (2.5 Î¼m) for ratiometric calcium imaging studies. Cells lacking LPA4 expression served as controls. Cells were incubated for 30â60 min at 37 Â°C in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing Fura2-AM (2.5 Î¼m) and 1.5 Î¼m of pluronic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then briefly washed with Opti-MEM. Coverslips were perfused with Opti-MEM in a laminar flow perfusion chamber (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). LPA (1 Î¼m) was bath-applied by gravity perfusion when indicated. Images of Fura-2-loaded cells with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm were captured with a cooled CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). The ratio of fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths was calculated after subtraction of background fluorescence. Ratio levels were determined from groups of 20â40 individual cells and analyzed using MetaFluor (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA).ElectrophysiologyâThe whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record and measure LPA-induced effects on whole cell currents of B103 cells stably expressing LPA4 receptor. The involvement of Gq in the modulations of cellular conductance was determined with stable LPA4-B103 cells after infection with virus expressing the Gq minigene or empty vector that served as the control for minigene infection. Some LPA4-B103 cells were treated overnight with PTX as described above. The extracellular solution (pH 7.4 with NaOH) contained the following: NaCl 145 mm, KCl 2.5 mm, CaCl2 1.5 mm, MgSO4 1.5 mm, HEPES 10 mm, dextrose 10 mm. LPA and vehicle were added to the bath by gravity perfusion at room temperature. Recording electrodes were fabricated and coated with dental periphery wax as described previously (22.Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Intracellular solution (pH 7.4) contained potassium gluconate 100 mm, KCl 25 mm, MgCl2 3 mm, CaCl2 0.483 mm, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetraacetic acid-K4 1.0 mm, hemi-Na-HEPES 10 mm. The resistive whole cell configuration and data acquisition were achieved as described in Ref. 22.Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol.

Cells were chosen for study if depolarization-activated peak inward current density was less than â30 pA/pF. During application of LPA (1 Î¼m) or washout, cells were held at â50 mV, and the Vm value was stepped to â120 mV for 60 ms and ramped to +120 mV (at a rate of 1 mV/ms) every 2 s. All data are expressed in terms of the Cm value during stimulus application (current density).Reverse Transcription-PCRâTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract RNA from cultured cells or tissues as described by the manufacturer. Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). An equal quantity of cDNA was used to amplify LPA4 and Î²-actin transcripts using the following conditions: 94 Â°C for 30 s, 60 Â°C for 45 s, and 72 Â°C for 45 s for a total of 30â35 cycles. The primers were used as follows: LPA4, 5â²-AGGCATGAGCACATTCTCTC-3â² (forward) and 5â²-CAACCTGGGTCTGAGACTTG-3â² (reverse); Î²-actin, 5â²-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3â² (forward) and 5â²-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3â² (reverse). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel.Northern Blot AnalysisâA Northern blot (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) containing 2 Î¼g/lane of adult mouse poly(A)+ RNA from several mouse tissues was probed with a random primed full-length 32P-labeled mouse LPA4 and human Î²-actin cDNA. DNA labeling was performed with the high prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), and unincorporated nucleotides were separated out by passing the reaction mixture over a Sephadex G-50 quick spin column (Roche Applied Science). The Northern blot was then probed overnight in ULTRAhyb hybridization solution (Origen), washed several times, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager detection system.Statistical Analysis of DataâEach data point was calculated from triplicate samples unless otherwise indicated. The data are presented Â±S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance and Dunnettâs method, or Studentâs t test.RESULTSMouse LPA4 cDNA was epitope-tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the 5â²-end of the extracellular domain, and the construct was introduced into a murine leukemia, replication-deficient, bicistronic retroviral vector (Fig. 1A). This construct co-expresses tagged LPA4 and EGFP, thus allowing for the identification of receptor expression in living and fixed cells by fluorescence microscopy.To demonstrate cell surface receptor gene expression, LPA4-infected B103 cells were labeled with an anti-HA primary antibody, and receptor was visualized using Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis with an anti-HA antibody showed that the tagged receptor was of the expected size (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the LPA4 receptor was indeed capable of binding to LPA, membranes were prepared from LPA4-expressing cells and incubated with [3H]LPA in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼m cold LPA. Membranes prepared from LPA4-expressing cells revealed statistically significant specific [3H]LPA binding compared with membranes isolated from control cells (Fig. 1E).G protein-coupled receptors typically undergo internalization during prolonged agonist exposure (28.Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if GPR23 is a physiologically relevant receptor for LPA but not other lysophospholipids, then LPA exposure would likely produce agonist-induced receptor internalization, whereas other ligands would not. We performed a standard internalization assay using B103 cells expressing HA-tagged LPA4 and visualized LPA4 localization with anti-HA immunolabeling and confocal microscopy. We found that receptor internalization occurred following LPA treatment but not with another lysophospholipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (Fig. 1D). We noticed that during exposure to LPA the cells retracted their processes, a response observed for activation of heterologously expressed LPA1,2,5 in B103 cells (see below). LPA4 internalization was not a consequence of cell rounding because sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced retraction did not cause LPA4 internalization.We next sought to determine the signaling pathways mediating LPA4-induced morphological changes in LPA4-expressing B103 cells. A strong cell rounding response occurred within 30 min of LPA treatment (Fig. 2A). However, control vector-infected cells were unresponsive to LPA (data not shown). F-actin staining with rhodamine-phalloidin demonstrated stress fiber formation in LPA4-expressing RH7777 cells (Fig. 2B) but not control cells. In B103 cells expressing LPA4, LPA produced a concentration-dependent increase in the proportion of rounded cells (Fig. 2C), with â¼70% of LPA4-infected cells rounding after exposure to 1 Î¼m LPA.FIGURE 2LPA4-mediated neurite retraction of B103 cells and stress fiber formation in RH7777 cells. A, serum-starved LPA4-expressing B103 cells were treated with fatty-acid free BSA (0.1%) or LPA (1 Î¼m) for 30 min and then fixed and mounted on glass slides. B, empty vector- or LPA4-expressing RH7777 cells were stimulated with 1 Î¼m LPA for 30 min after overnight serum starvation. The cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to detect actin stress fibers. C, quantification of LPA-induced neurite retraction for LPA4-expressing B103 cells. The data are mean Â± S.D.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Using G12 and G13 minigenes to inhibit G12/13 signaling, LPA-induced cell rounding was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). Recently, Gq/11 has also been shown to activate a Rho-dependent pathway in G12/13-deficient cells (33.Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, blocking this pathway using a pan-Gq/11 minigene did not inhibit cell rounding in response to LPA (Fig. 3A). Blocking Gi signaling with PTX pretreatment (Fig. 3A) or Gs signaling using a Gs minigene (data not shown) also failed to inhibit LPA-induced cell rounding.FIGURE 3G12, G13, and Rho signaling is involved in LPA4-mediated neurite retraction of B103 cells. A, LPA4-expressing B103 cells were pretreated with PTX (200 ng/ml) overnight or infected with a G protein minigene 2 days prior to testing. Cells were fixed after treatment with 1 Î¼m LPA for 30 min. B, LPA4-expressing B103 cells were pretreated with C3 (10 Î¼g/ml) for 24 h or pretreated with Y27632 (10 Î¼m) for 45 min and then stimulated with 1 Î¼m LPA for 30 min. Data are the mean Â± S.D.

Similar to LPA1- and LPA2-induced Rho signaling-dependent cell rounding in infected cells (26.Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the cell rounding response in LPA4-expressing B103 cells was inhibited by both C3 and Y27632 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, LPA4-mediated stress fiber formation in RH7777 cells was completely blocked by C3 and Y27632 treatment (data not shown).Because all known lysophospholipid GPCRs can influence cAMP levels (14.Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), we analyzed cAMP levels in LPA4-expressing B103 cells after LPA exposure. LPA increased intracellular cAMP levels in LPA4-expressing cells either in the absence or presence of forskolin (5 Î¼m) (Fig. 4, A and B). Because intracellular cAMP levels are regulated by Gs Î± subunit as well as G protein Î²Î³ subunits, (34.Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 35.Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), we tested whether Gs was responsible for LPA4-mediated cAMP induction using a Gs minigene (Fig. 4C). LPA4-mediated cAMP accumulation was completely blocked by a Gs minigene (Fig. 4C). Thus, the LPA4 receptor coupling to Gs activates adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular cAMP levels.FIGURE 4LPA-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation.

C, cAMP accumulation in stably transfected LPA4-expressing B103 cells infected with control or Gs minigene retrovirus after treatment with 1 Î¼m LPA under forskolin-free conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2107260976,"Cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are pivotal regulators of cellular signaling. They are also important drug targets. Besides catalytic activity and substrate specificity, their subcellular localization and interaction with other cell components are also functionally important. In contrast to the mammalian PDEs, the significance of PDEs in protozoal pathogens remains mostly unknown. The genome of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, codes for five different PDEs. Two of these, TbrPDEB1 and TbrPDEB2, are closely similar, cAMP-specific PDEs containing two GAF-domains in their N-terminal regions. Despite their similarity, these two PDEs exhibit different subcellular localizations. TbrPDEB1 is located in the flagellum, whereas TbrPDEB2 is distributed between flagellum and cytoplasm. RNAi against the two mRNAs revealed that the two enzymes can complement each other but that a simultaneous ablation of both leads to cell death in bloodstream form trypanosomes. RNAi against TbrPDEB1 and TbrPDEB2 also functions in vivo where it completely prevents infection and eliminates ongoing infections. Our data demonstrate that TbrPDEB1 and TbrPDEB2 are essential for virulence, making them valuable potential targets for new PDE-inhibitor based trypanocidal drugs. Furthermore, they are compatible with the notion that the flagellum of T. brucei is an important site of cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066939817,"Mutations in the NIPA1(SPG6) gene, named for ânonimprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelmanâ has been implicated in one form of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. However, the function of NIPA1 is unknown. Here, we show that reduced magnesium concentration enhances expression of NIPA1 suggesting a role in cellular magnesium metabolism. Indeed NIPA1 mediates Mg2+ uptake that is electrogenic, voltage-dependent, and saturable with a Michaelis constant of 0.69 Â± 0.21 mm when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Subcellular localization with immunofluorescence showed that endogenous NIPA1 protein associates with early endosomes and the cell surface in a variety of neuronal and epithelial cells. As expected of a magnesium-responsive gene, we find that altered magnesium concentration leads to a redistribution between the endosomal compartment and the plasma membrane; high magnesium results in diminished cell surface NIPA1 whereas low magnesium leads to accumulation in early endosomes and recruitment to the plasma membrane. The mouse NIPA1 mutants, T39R and G100R, corresponding to the respective human mutants showed a loss-of-function when expressed in oocytes and altered trafficking in transfected COS7 cells. We conclude that NIPA1 normally encodes a Mg2+ transporter and the loss-of function of NIPA1(SPG6) due to abnormal trafficking of the mutated protein provides the basis of the HSP phenotype.

However, NIPA1 has also been implicated in another distinct disorder termed autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) 4The abbreviations used are: HSP, hereditary spastic paraplegia; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCT, mouse distal convoluted tubule; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMD, transmembrane domain. 4The abbreviations used are: HSP, hereditary spastic paraplegia; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCT, mouse distal convoluted tubule; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMD, transmembrane domain. (OMIM 608145 and 600363). HSP comprises more than 30 genetic disorders whose predominant feature is a spastic gait (6Fink J.K. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutations in at least six genes have been associated with autosomal dominant HSP including NIPA1(SPG6). This heterogenous group presents with progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. In the absence of other clinical features these disorders are referred to as pure or uncomplicated HSP (6Fink J.K. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fink et al. (7Fink J.K. Sharp G.B. Lange B.M. Wu C.B. Haley T. Otterud B. Peacock M. Leppert M. Neurology. 1995; 45: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Fink J.K. Wu C.T. Jones S.M.

Additional studies by this group identified a nucleotide substitution at position 134 of the NIPA1 cDNA that resulted in an amino acid substitution at position 45 of the NIPA1 protein (T45R) in SPG6-linked HSP kindred and in an unrelated kindred that was too small for linkage analysis (9Rainer S.

More recently, three different research groups have identified a missense substitution in NIPA1, G106R, in a number of large unrelated families (10Reed J.A. Wilkinson P.A. Patel H.

Liang Y. St George-Hyslop P.H. Rogaeva E. Mov. Disord. 2006; 21: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The functional role of NIPA1 in Prader-Willi or HSP syndromes has not been determined. Magnesium is the second most abundant cation within the cell and plays an important role in many intracellular biochemical functions (13Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1180-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance and importance of magnesium, little is known about how eukaryotic cells regulate their magnesium content. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentration is in the order of 0.5 mm, which is 1â2% of the total cellular magnesium (13Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1180-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Accordingly, intracellular Mg2+ is maintained below the concentration predicted from the transmembrane electrochemical potential. Intracellular Mg2+ concentration is finely regulated likely by precise controls of Mg2+ entry, Mg2+ efflux, and intracellular storage compartments (14Dai L-J. Ritchie G. Kerstan D. Kang H.S. Cole D.E.C. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 51-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have shown that Mg2+ entry is through specific and regulated magnesium pathways that are regulated by intrinsic mechanisms so that the culture of cells in media containing low magnesium results in up-regulation of Mg2+ uptake into the cells. This adaptive increase in Mg2+ entry was shown to be dependent on de novo transcription since prior treatment of the epithelial cells with actinomycin D prevented the adaptation to low extracellular magnesium (15Dai L-J. Quamme G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The data suggest that epithelial cells can sense the environmental magnesium and through transcription- and translation-dependent processes alter Mg2+ transport and maintain magnesium balance. In an attempt to identify genes underlying cellular changes resulting from adaptation to low extracellular magnesium, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to screen for magnesium-regulated transcripts in epithelial cells (16Goytain A. Quamme G.A. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One transcript, NIPA2, was significantly up-regulated by extracellular magnesium suggesting that the synthesis was regulated by changes in cell magnesium. 5A. Goytain, R. M. Hines, A. El-Husseini, and G. A. Quamme, unpublished observations. 5A. Goytain, R. M. Hines, A. El-Husseini, and G. A. Quamme, unpublished observations. We showed that NIPA2 mediated Mg2+ transport when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. An in silico search demonstrated a second member of this family of proteins, NIPA1. The goal of the present study was to see if NIPA1 mediates Mg2+ transport using electrophysiological and fluorescence studies. Furthermore, cellular distribution and subcellular localization was determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Redistribution of NIPA1 protein was evaluated in response to changes in cellular magnesium. Finally, the NIPA1-T39R and G100R mutants, associated with HSP, were created and tested. Our data indicate that NIPA1 protein mediates Mg2+ transport and is regulated by magnesium indicating that it may play a role in control of cellular magnesium homeostasis. The T39R and G100R mutations resulted in altered intracellular trafficking of NIPA1 protein and diminished Mg2+ transport suggesting a role in the HSP phenotype. Construction of Expression Vectors Encoding NIPA1âA mouse NIPA1 cDNA clone was purchased from RIKEN, catalog number B430207K20. The human NIPA1 cDNA is longer than the mouse sequence due an N-terminal AAAAAA extension. Subclones were sequenced to confirm sequence integrity. The resultant construct, pFLCI-mNIPA1, contained the entire coding region of the mNIPA1 cDNA flanked by 20 bp of untranslated 5â²-nucleotide sequence and 929 bp of untranslated 3â²-sequence. Two mouse mutant constructs, pFLCI-mNIPA1-T39R and pFLCI-mNIPA1-G100R, in which Thr39 (ACG) was replaced with Arg39 (AGG) and Gly100 (GGG) was replaced with Arg100 (AGG), respectively, were produced from pFLCI-mNIPA1 using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A C-terminal HA tag was added to NIPA1 cDNA by PCR with an oligonucleotide (5N1Sac1: 5â²-GGCGGCGAGCTCGGCATGGGGACTG-3â², 3N1HA: 5â²-TTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGTCTGTTTTCATATTGG-3â²) containing the full HA. NIPA1-HA was then subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector replacing the EGFP tag with HA resulting in the plasmid HA-N1-NIPA1. COS7 cells were cultured as given below and transiently transfected with HA-N1-NIPA1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Expression of Mouse NIPA1 Constructs in Xenopus Oocytes and Characterization of Mg2+ TransportâFor Xenopus oocyte expression, cRNA was synthesized from mNIPA1, mNIPA1-T39R, and mNIPA1-G100R cDNA constructs, linearized, and then transcribed with T7 polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG cap using the mMESSAGE MACHINEâ¢ T7 KIT (Ambion) transcription system. Preparation of oocytes, injection with cRNA, and two-electrode voltage clamp were as described previously and performed at 21 Â°C (16Goytain A. Quamme G.A. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Oocytes were studied 3â5 days following injection. Permeability ratios were calculated using the Nernstian relation and apparent Km and Vmax values with non-linear regression analysis (16Goytain A. Quamme G.A. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Epifluorescence microscopy was used to measure Mg2+ flux into single oocytes using the Mg2+-responsive mag-fura-2 fluorescence dye (16Goytain A. Quamme G.A. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 Î¼m mag-fura-2 acid (Molecular Probes), 20 min prior to experimentation. The chamber (0.5 ml) was mounted on an inverted Nikon Diaphot-TMD microscope, with a Fluor Ã10 objective, and an I-V association determined. Subsequently, they were clamped at -70 mV for fluorescence measurements for the indicated times. Fluorescence was continuously recorded using a dual-excitation wavelength spectrofluorometer (Delta-scan, Photon Technologies) with excitation for mag-fura-2 at 340 and 385 nm (chopper speed set at 100 Hz) and emission at 505 nm. Results are presented as the 340/385 ratio, which reflects the intracellular Mg2+ concentration. Animal Preparation and Cell CultureâMale mice were maintained for 5 days on a low magnesium diet (ICN diet number 902205, Nutritional Biochemicals) supplemented with 0.05% MgSO4 that is comparable with commercial mouse chow (17Shafik I.M. Quamme G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F974-F977PubMed Google Scholar). COS7, mouse distal convoluted tubule (MDCT), HEK293, and primary hippocampal neuronal cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate (110 mg/liter), 5 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin in a humidified environment of 5% CO2-95% air at 37 Â°C. Primary neurons were isolated from rat brains and cultured using methods similar to that described previously (18Levinson J.N. Chery N. Huang K. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Kang R. Prange O. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17312-17319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Where indicated, subconfluent cells were cultured in nominally Mg2+-free, normal Mg2+, 0.08 mm, or high Mg2+, 5.0 mm, medium (Stem Cell Technologies) for either 3 or 16 h prior to harvest or processing for immunochemistry as reported previously (16Goytain A. Quamme G.A. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Other constituents of the Mg2+-free culture medium were similar to the complete medium. Quantitative Analysis of NIPA1 Transcripts by Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCRâPCR products were quantified continuously with AB7000â¢ (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Greenâ¢ fluorescence according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The primer set of mouse NIPA1 was: 5â²-CTGGTGGACTTCTTGGGCAT-3â² (forward) and 5â²-TCCAATGCCTGTTCCTCAA-3â² (reverse). The relative amounts of NIPA1 RNA were normalized to the mouse Î²-actin transcripts. Genomic Sequence AnalysisâThe NIPA1 cDNA sequence was determined by standard methods. The full-length NIPA1 amino acid sequence is in the GenBankâ¢ data base (accession numbers: NP_653200 (human) and NP_705806 (mouse)). Protein motifs were identified using BLASTP and the Swiss-Prot data base. Membrane topology was predicted by the SOSUI program based on Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). Western Blot AnalysisâA rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-NIPA1, was raised against the third extracellular loop of the final cleaved human NIPA1 protein using a synthetic peptide, NH2-AQDILHNNPSSQRALC-COOH (amino acid residues 207â222). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-human NIPA1 antibody was diluted in PBS (Tris-buffered saline, 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.5% BSA at a final concentration about 0.7 Î¼l/ml. Western analysis was performed by incubating the blots with anti-NIPA1 antibody overnight at 4 Â°C followed by three washes with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 min each. The blots were then incubated with 1/10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary (Sigma) antibody for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS/Tween 20, 10 min each, the blots were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Immunofluorescence Confocal MicroscopyâCoverslips of cultured cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) before each antibody incubation. The following primary antibodies were used: NIPA1, GM130 (a cis-Golgi matrix protein), EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1), Rab5 and Rab8 (GTP-binding proteins) that were raised in mouse (BD Transduction Laboratories). Alexa 350-, Alexa 488-, and Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes. All antibody reactions were performed in blocking solution composed of 2% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h room temperature. Alexa 350- and 568-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) were used to stain for actin in the indicated experiments to aid in delimiting peripheral membrane ruffles. Following staining, coverslips were then mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G glycerol-based mounting medium (Southern Biotechnology). Oocytes were mounted in OCT cryostat medium and flash-frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Ten-Î¼m-thick sections were cut through frozen oocytes and mounted directly onto superfrost plus slides (Fisher). Sections were fixed in -20 Â°C methanol and processed for immunohistochemistry using the NIPA1 primary antibody and anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody. All images were taken using a 63Ã water lens affixed to a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope and AxioVision (epifluorescent) or LSM 510 Meta (confocal) software. Cells were selected from 10â12 fields of view and used for assessment of co-localization of antibody staining. NIPA1 cDNA Is a Magnesium-responsive GeneâWith the knowledge that differential gene expression is involved with selective control of epithelial cell magnesium conservation, our strategy was to use microarray analysis to identify cDNAs that were up-regulated with low magnesium (15Dai L-J. Quamme G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As our objective was to identify novel transport proteins, we prioritized these candidates according to structural properties reported for hypothetical transporters. One of the selected cDNA fragments identified by an increase in transcript was NIPA2 (Mus musculus hypothetical protein MNCb-2146, renamed Nipa2). A BLAST search of the GenBankâ¢ data base was performed and another member of this family, NIPA1, was identified. As NIPA1 was not on the mouse Affymetrix MG U74 Bv2 and MG U74 Cv2 arrays (Affymetrix) used at the time of our initial microarray analysis, we first showed that the NIPA1 transcript, like NIPA2 mRNA, is regulated by magnesium using real-time RT-PCR. NIPA1 mRNA increased 3.2-fold in immortalized distal convoluted tubule, MDCT, epithelial cells, n = 3 independent preparations, cultured in low magnesium compared with normal cells confirming that NIPA1 is differentially regulated by magnesium. Amino Acid Sequence of NIPA1âThe human and mouse genomes each contain four members of the NIPA family, designated NIPA1-NIPA4. NIPA1 is the least similar member of the family even though it is located in tandem with NIPA2 on chromosome 15q. The human and mouse NIPA1 proteins were found to be 98% identical in amino acid sequence. They differ by a short run of alanines on the N-terminal end. The human NIPA1 and mouse NIPA1 exhibited between 36 and 43% identity to the other three respective human and mouse NIPA forms. Genes encoding close homologues (83â91% amino acid sequence identity) are present in the chicken, orangutan, and chimpanzee genomes, indicating that divergence of the NIPA1 from NIPA2, NIPA3, and NIPA4 forms was an early event in vertebrate evolution (Fig. 1A). Hydrophobicity profiles using the SOSUI program predicted a secondary structure with nine predicted transmembrane domains, TMDs (Fig. 1B). Also illustrated are the mouse T39R and G100R mutation sites that correspond to the respective human T45R and G106R mutation sites located in the predicted TMD1 and TMD3, respectively (Fig. 1B). NIPA1 Mediates Mg2+ Transport in Expressing Xenopus OocytesâTo determine whether NIPA1 encodes a functional Mg2+ transporter as does NIPA2,5 we prepared mouse NIPA1 cRNA, injected it into Xenopus oocytes and measured Mg2+-evoked currents using two-microelectrode voltage clamp analysis and Mg2+ flux using mag-fura-2 fluorescence methodologies. The electrophysiological data gave evidence for a rheogenic process with inward currents in NIPA1 cRNA-injected oocytes, whereas there were no appreciable currents in control H2O- or total poly(A)+ RNA-injected cells from the same batch of oocytes. Fig. 1C shows mean current-voltage (I-V) plots. There was a mean +28-mV shift in reversal potential with a decade increase in magnesium concentration, which approximated the theoretical value predicted by the Nernstian relationship. Among the inherent properties of all transporters is the property of substrate saturation. The Mg2+-evoked currents, measured at a fixed time point, were saturable (Fig. 1D) demonstrating a Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.69 Â± 0.21 mm (Fig. 1D inset) that was independent of the larger negative clamping voltages (data not shown). Mag-fura-2 fluorescence determinations confirmed that the observed currents were due to Mg2+ influx (Fig. 1E). External magnesium increased the emission ratio of 340/385 excitation following voltage clamp at -70 mV. Ca2+ was not transported at rates necessary to change the fluorescence intensity of the dye and not at rates required to account for the concurrently measured currents. Immunofluorescence using a specific anti-NIPA1 antibody shows predominantly surface localization of NIPA1 protein in NIPA1-expressing oocytes, whereas there was no staining in control, water-injected oocytes (Fig. 1F). The second property of most transporters is substrate selectivity. Accordingly, a variety of extracellular divalent cations were used to determine the selectivity of the expressed NIPA1 channel. NIPA1 was relatively selective for Mg2+ (supplemental Fig. S1). The reversal potential ratio of Sr2+-evoked currents was notably less than Mg2+ and the ratio of other divalent cations tested, Ca2+, Ni2+, Zn2+ Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+, were small compared with those evoked by Mg2+.Inthe experiments shown, currents were corrected for changes in membrane resistance caused by the respective divalent cation using values from H2O-injected oocytes (supplemental Fig. S1A). Accordingly, NIPA1-mediated cation transport was relatively selective for Mg2+. Finally, a general property of transporters is the ability to be inhibited by related but not transported substrates. We tested if the cations that were not transported by NIPA1 would inhibit Mg2+-evoked currents. Relatively large concentrations of 0.1 mm Mn2+ and 5.0 mm Ca2+ were tested in the presence of 2.0 mm MgCl2 (Fig. S1B). Mn2+ completely inhibited Mg2+ currents, whereas Ca2+ did not inhibit transport as reflected by the change in reversal potential for Mg2+. On balance, these data indicate that NIPA1-mediated transport demonstrates saturation, selectivity, and the ability to be differentially inhibited by other divalent cations. Tissue Distribution of Endogenous NIPA1 Protein ExpressionâUsing real-time RT-PCR, we show that NIPA1 transcripts are widely expressed among the mouse tissues tested. Western blot analysis was then carried out to determine the endogenous NIPA1 protein expression in the various mouse tissues (Fig. 2, left). For detection of NIPA1 protein, a specific antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits. There was an evident band at the expected molecular mass of 34 kDa in heart, kidney, liver, and colon, a faint band of 34 kDa in the brain, and no signal in the small intestine. A doublet was evident in the heart and kidney tissues that may suggest posttranslational modification in these cells. Additionally, there were faint bands in the heart and kidney tissues at about 68 kDa and a very strong band in brain that may represent the dimer of the protein. The latter was consistent for three separate tissue preparations. As the NIPA1 mRNA is responsive to magnesium, we then determined NIPA1 protein expression in cells cultured in low magnesium media relative to normal magnesium. Using the mouse kidney cell line, MDCT, as a prototypic epithelial cell, Western blot analysis revealed about a 2-fold increase in protein density in cells grown in low magnesium (Fig. 2, right). Interestingly, the predominant increase was in the 68-kDa band with smaller increases in the 34-kDa signal. The larger band, perhaps a multimer of the NIPA1 protein, may be the active transporter. Subcellular Localization of Endogenous NIPA1 ProteinâTo investigate the subcellular localization of NIPA1 protein, we performed immunofluorescence using the specific anti-NIPA1 antibody in kidney COS7 cells. NIPA1 extensively co-localized with EEA1 and Rab5 that are early endosome proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, the punctate peripheral staining pattern of NIPA1 is consistent with the presence of NIPA1 in early endosomes. To conclusively demonstrate the localization of NIPA1 to early endosomes, a constitutively active form of Rab5, Rab5Q79L, was used. NIPA1 co-localized with the expressed Rab5Q79L in enlarged endosomes (Fig. 3B). In addition to the endosomal localization, NIPA1 staining was widely dispersed across the cell surface at the membrane ruffles as evidenced by phaloidin staining of actin (Fig. 3C). Omission of the primary antibody resulted in the complete absence of immunostaining (data not shown). As endogenous NIPA1 was detected with the antibody, this pattern of distribution was not the inefficient targeting of overexpressed protein resulting from heterologous expression. This pattern of distribution is consistent with the notion that NIPA1 translocates through the early (and likely also recycling) endosomes and the plasma membrane. Results from the COS7 cells are presented here because the intracellular organelle compartmentalization was easier to discern with confocal microscopy; however, similar patterns of distribution were observed with kidney HEK293 and MDCT cells (data not shown) and primary hippocampal neuronal cells (supplemental Fig. S2). NIPA1 was evident in a punctate pattern in the soma and dendrites of the cultured neurons and was absent from synaptic sites (supplemental Fig. S2). The suggestion that endogenous NIPA1 is present at the surface membrane is in keeping with the functional studies performed with heterologous-expressing oocytes. Changes in Extracellular Magnesium Lead to Subcellular Redistribution of NIPA1 ProteinâIf NIPA1 is involved with cellular magnesium homeostasis, we would expect that there may be subcellular redistribution of protein in response to changes in external magnesium concentration. COS7 cells were cultured in relatively high magnesium, 5.0 mm MgCl2, for 3 or 12 h or in nominally magnesium-free medium for 3 or 12 h, and subcellular localization was determined with immunofluorescence as given above. The most evident changes in NIPA1 subcellular distribution occurred within the surface membrane and the early endosomes (Fig. 4A). NIPA1was modestly reduced in the peripheral membrane following culture in high Mg2+. Relative to those cells grown in normal culture media containing 0.5 mm magnesium, NIPA1 protein was reduced at the surface membrane and increased in the early endosomes (Fig. 4B). This apparent trafficking from the surface to the early endosome compartment was noticeable at 3 h and marked at 12 h following the change to high magnesium medium. The accumulation of NIPA1 protein was large enough to appear as âaggregationâ of protein in the early endosomes (supplemental Fig. S3A). Placing the cells in low magnesium for 3 and 12 h led to an increase in NIPA1 protein in the early endosome pool but not aggregation rather it was more punctate within the enlarged endosomes compared with that observed with normal magnesium (supplemental Fig. S3A). Moreover, there was a marked recruitment of NIPA1 protein to the surface membrane that was apparent at 3 h and marked at 12 h after removal of magnesium. Indeed, the surface labeling with NIPA1 was so extensive that the cell outline was evident suggesting that it was localizing in the plasma membrane (indicated in Fig. 4B). Loss-of-function Mutations of NIPA1 ProteinâRainer et al. (9Rainer S. Chai J-H. Tokarz D. Nicholls R.D. Fink J.K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 3: 967-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar) identified a nucleotide substitution at position 134 of the NIPA1 cDNA that resulted in an amino acid substitution at position 45 of the NIPA1 protein (T45R) in a HSP kindred. This site corresponds to position Thr39 of the mouse NIPA1. The T39R mutation occurs at a conserved residue at the interface of the first transmembrane domain (TMD1) and the first putative loop (Fig. 1B). This would be expected to extend the first TMD by three amino acids that may alter protein trafficking or transport function. To test this, we replaced Thr39 (ACG) with Arg39 (AGG) and injected the associated cRNA into oocytes and performed voltage clamp and fluorescence analysis. The T39R mutation led to diminished Mg2+ transport by about 30% compared with the wild-type NIPA1 as determined by both electrophysiology (Fig. 5A) and mag-fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 5B). This result could be caused by either a failure of transporters to correctly traffic to the plasma membrane or by transporters that traffic normally but are non-functional. To distinguish between these possibilities, the wild-type NIPA1 and the mutant NIPA1T39R were fused with HA s"
https://openalex.org/W2034089885,"Friedreich ataxia (FA), the most common form of hereditary ataxia, is caused by a deficit in the mitochondrial protein frataxin. While several hypotheses have been suggested, frataxin function is not well understood. Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of FA, but this view has been recently questioned, and its link to frataxin is unclear. Here, we report the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the Drosophila frataxin gene (fh) expression. This model system parallels the situation in FA patients, namely a moderate systemic reduction of frataxin levels compatible with normal embryonic development. Under these conditions, fh-RNAi flies showed a shortened life span, reduced climbing abilities, and enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. Under hyperoxia, fh-RNAi flies also showed a dramatic reduction of aconitase activity that seriously impairs the mitochondrial respiration while the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, respiratory complex I and II, and indirectly complex III and IV are normal. Remarkably, frataxin overexpression also induced the oxidative-mediated inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the essential function of frataxin in protecting aconitase from oxidative stress-dependent inactivation in a multicellular organism. Moreover our data support an important role of oxidative stress in the progression of FA and suggest a tissue-dependent sensitivity to frataxin imbalance. We propose that in FA, the oxidative mediated inactivation of aconitase, which occurs normally during the aging process, is enhanced due to the lack of frataxin."
https://openalex.org/W2138664804,"Oxidative stress is central to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in this process is uncertain. In ER signaling, PERK-Nrf2 and Ire-CHOP are two pathways that determine cell fate under stress. PERK-Nrf2 up-regulates antioxidant enzyme expression whereas Ire-CHOP promotes apoptosis. We have identified a novel pathway in ER stress-induced apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion in vitro involving translational suppression of the survival kinase PKB/Akt (Akt), and elucidated an alternative protective role of antioxidants in the regulation of Akt activity. Using human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, we found that sustained activation of ER stress by tunicamycin or thapsigargin exacerbated apoptosis in oxygen-glucose-deprived cells during reoxygenation. This was mediated via a reduction in phosphorylated Akt secondary to down-regulation of protein translation rather than suppression of phosphorylation. Transient overexpression of wild-type Akt, but not kinase-dead Akt, in JEG-3 cells diminished tunicamycin-OGD reoxygenation-induced apoptosis. The antioxidants Trolox and Edaravone reduced apoptosis, but the protective effect of Trolox was abrogated by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. We speculate that sustained ER stress may contribute to the placental dysfunction seen in human pregnancy complications."
https://openalex.org/W1973182554,"Whereas other organisms utilize type I or type II synthases to make fatty acids, trypanosomatid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei are unique in their use of a microsomal elongase pathway (ELO) for de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). Because of the unusual lipid metabolism of the trypanosome, it was important to study a second FAS pathway predicted by the genome to be a type II synthase. We localized this pathway to the mitochondrion, and RNA interference (RNAi) or genomic deletion of acyl carrier protein (ACP) and Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase indicated that this pathway is likely essential for bloodstream and procyclic life cycle stages of the parasite. In vitro assays show that the largest major fatty acid product of the pathway is C16, whereas the ELO pathway, utilizing ELOs 1, 2, and 3, synthesizes up to C18. To demonstrate mitochondrial FAS in vivo, we radio-labeled fatty acids in cultured procyclic parasites with [14C]pyruvate or [14C]threonine, either of which is catabolized to [14C]acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. Although some of the [14C]acetyl-CoA may be utilized by the ELO pathway, a striking reduction in radiolabeled fatty acids following ACP RNAi confirmed that it is also consumed by mitochondrial FAS. ACP depletion by RNAi or gene knockout also reduces lipoic acid levels and drastically decreases protein lipoylation. Thus, octanoate (C8), the precursor for lipoic acid synthesis, must also be a product of mitochondrial FAS. Trypanosomes employ two FAS systems: the unconventional ELO pathway that synthesizes bulk fatty acids and a mitochondrial pathway that synthesizes specialized fatty acids that are likely utilized intramitochondrially.

Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite that causes nagana in cattle and African sleeping sickness in humans, is transmitted from the tsetse fly to its mammalian host. Two of its life cycle stages are easily cultured in the laboratory: the procyclic form (PCF), 2The abbreviations used are: PCF, procyclic form; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ELO, elongase; LA, lipoic acid; BSF, bloodstream form; KAS, Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase; KAR, Î²-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; ENR, enoyl-ACP reductase; TAP, tandem affinity purification; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PUR, puromycin resistance; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; RNAi, RNA interference; BSR, blasticidin; ACPec, ectopic copy of the ACP gene; DAPI, 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.2The abbreviations used are: PCF, procyclic form; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ELO, elongase; LA, lipoic acid; BSF, bloodstream form; KAS, Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase; KAR, Î²-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; ENR, enoyl-ACP reductase; TAP, tandem affinity purification; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PUR, puromycin resistance; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; RNAi, RNA interference; BSR, blasticidin; ACPec, ectopic copy of the ACP gene; DAPI, 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. which normally resides in the insect midgut, and the bloodstream form (BSF), which dwells in the mammalian host. These two stages inhabit markedly different environments explaining their distinct metabolism. PCF trypanosomes metabolize both sugars and amino acids, depending on what is available in the vector midgut (1.Lamour N. Riviere L. Coustou V. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11902-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2.Bringaud F. Riviere L. Coustou V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), whereas BSF trypanosomes use blood glucose as their primary energy source (3.Bowman I. Flynn I. Lumsden W. Evans D. Biology of the Kinetoplastida. Academic Press, New York1976: 435-476Google Scholar). Each parasite cell has a single mitochondrion that differs morphologically and metabolically in the two life cycle stages. The PCF mitochondrion is a highly branched tubular network rich in cristae; its inner membrane has a complete respiratory chain (4.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). BSFs, on the other hand, have a less developed mitochondrion with fewer branches extending through the cell. This atrophied organelle utilizes respiratory components that do not generate a proton gradient across the inner membrane. Instead, the BSF mitochondrion relies on reverse action of the ATP synthase to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential (5.Brown S.V. Hosking P. Li J. Williams N. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6.Schnaufer A. Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). BSFs excrete pyruvate as the end product of glycolysis and therefore have a diminished need for mitochondrial metabolism (4.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast, PCFs use a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase to decarboxylate pyruvate and form acetyl-CoA. PCFs then utilize the acetate:succinate CoA transferase cycle to convert acetyl-CoA to acetate, which they secrete as the primary metabolic end product (7.Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8.Durieux P.O. Schutz P. Brun R. Kohler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Until recently, very little was known about fatty acid metabolism in either stage of the trypanosome. In fact, for many years it was thought that BSFs could not make fatty acids at all (9.Dixon H. Ginger C.D. Williamson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1971; 39: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). More recently, however, our laboratory reported robust in vitro fatty acid synthesis (FAS) activity using BSF membranes as the source of enzymes (10.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this life cycle stage, the product of this pathway is predominantly myristate (C14), which can be incorporated into the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein (11.Ferguson M.A. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3011-3015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, for PCFs, the predominant fatty acid produced in vitro is stearate (C18) (10.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A recent objective of our laboratory has been to identify the enzymatic machinery used for trypanosome FAS. In other organisms, there are two types of FAS, which catalyze similar reactions but differ in structure. Type I synthases, found in the cytosol of eukaryotes, have each enzymatic activity on a separate domain of one or two giant polypeptides (12.Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Type II synthases, in contrast, are found in bacteria and in eukaryotic organelles of bacterial origin and have similar enzymatic activities residing on separate polypeptides (13.Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In both systems the growing acyl chain, linked to acyl carrier protein (ACP) or an ACP-like domain, is condensed with malonyl-ACP by Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS). The Î²-ketoacyl-ACP product is then reduced by Î²-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KAR), dehydrated by Î²-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase, and reduced again by trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR). The reducing agent in both reduction steps is NADH or NADPH, and the product after each round of synthesis is a saturated acyl chain extended in length by two carbon atoms. The trypanosome genome encodes only a type II system, so we initially assumed that it was responsible for the observed in vitro FAS activity. Instead we found that trypanosome FAS is unconventional and that they make most of their fatty acids using a set of microsomal elongases (14.Lee S.H. Stephens J.L. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Cell. 2006; 126: 691-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In other eukaryotes, including mammals, elongases extend pre-existing long chain fatty acids such as palmitate (C16) (15.Moon Y.A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Remarkably, trypanosomes have adapted this system for de novo synthesis. The chemistry of the elongase reactions is the same as that for type I and II systems except that malonic acid and the growing acyl chains are esterified to coenzyme A (CoA) instead of ACP. The trypanosome elongase activity in vitro utilizes butyryl-CoA as the primer, malonyl-CoA as the two-carbon donor, and NADPH as the reducing agent (10.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14.Lee S.H. Stephens J.L. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Cell. 2006; 126: 691-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There are three elongases (ELO1â3) responsible for the stepwise synthesis of saturated fatty acids. Although they have somewhat overlapping specificities, ELO1 elongates C4 to C10, ELO2 converts C10 to C14, and then ELO3 extends C14 to C18. Additionally, they are regulated throughout the life cycle of the trypanosome. For example, down-regulation of ELO3 in BSFs allows the production of myristate (14.Lee S.H. Stephens J.L. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Cell. 2006; 126: 691-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). If the ELO system makes most of the fatty acids needed by trypanosomes, what is the function of the type II synthase? To address this question, we searched the genome to identify candidate genes and localized their gene products to the mitochondrion. We then showed that C8 (the precursor for lipoic acid synthesis) and C16 are products of the pathway. Finally, we genetically modified the trypanosomes and found that the mitochondrial type II pathway is likely essential in both life cycle stages. This finding indicates a greater role for mitochondrial metabolism, especially in BSF trypanosomes. TrypanosomesâT. brucei brucei PCF trypanosomes, strains 927, 29-13 (16.Wirtz E. Clayton C.

To favor refolding of the protein, the column was washed with 10 ml of a reverse gradient of 6 m to 1 m urea in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The recombinant ACP was then eluted with two column volumes of 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The purification yielded roughly 10 mg of recombinant ACP from 1 liter of culture, and SDS-PAGE of the product (Fig. 1A) revealed a near homogeneous polypeptide of the predicted size for the full-length protein (17 kDa). To generate antibodies, recombinant ACP was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, excised, and submitted for commercial antibody production in rats (Cocalico Biologicals). For immunofluorescence, the resulting antibody was diluted 1:50 and used to stain trypanosomes following fixation as previously described (21.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody (diluted 1:250), and the resulting fluorescence was viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase was visualized using an antibody provided by Dr. Luise Krauth-Siegel (University of Heidelberg) as previously described (22.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A.

After transfection into PCF (29-13) trypanosomes that express T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor, production of the Myc- or GFP-tagged proteins were induced using tetracycline (5 Î¼g/ml for KAS-Myc and 0.2â2 Î¼g/ml for GFP fusions). To visualize KAS-Myc, cells were harvested 4â6 days after tetracycline induction, fixed as previously described (21.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and examined by immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:100 and AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, diluted 1:500) as the secondary antibody (21.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For KAR and mENR-GFP fusion proteins, â¼1 Ã 107 cells were harvested after 1â2 days of expression, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and imaged live using fluorescence microscopy as described (25.Motyka S.A.

Following transfection into PCF (29-13) trypanosomes, the cells were cloned by limiting dilution in the appropriate medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. For ACP knock-out construction in BSF trypanosomes, â¼500 bp each of the 5â² and 3â² untranslated regions from the ACP genomic sequence was inserted into pKO (27.Lamb J.R. Fu V. Wirtz E.

The first ACP allele was replaced with pKOBSR in the BSF single marker line (expresses T7 polymerase and tetracycline repressor maintained by a single G418 resistance marker). Attempts to replace the second allele were unsuccessful unless we first introduced an ectopic copy of the gene (ACPec). For ACPec construction, the entire ACP gene (including a stop codon between the gene and the TAP tag) was inserted into the pLEW-TAP vector as above for KAS-Myc expression. ACPec was transfected into pKOBSR trypanosomes, and expression was maintained by including 1 Î¼g/ml tetracycline in the growth medium. ACPec expression allowed replacement of the second Acp allele with pKOPUR. Fatty Acid Synthesis in Isolated MitochondriaâPCF trypanosomes (1 Ã 1010 cells in log phase growth) were lysed hypotonically in 20 ml of 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and mitochondria were purified on a 20â35% renografin gradient (28.Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fraction was washed and resuspended in a FAS buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors (Complete, 1 tablet/100 ml, Roche Applied Science)). Mitochondrial integrity was assessed (in a similar experiment) using 50 Î¼g/ml DAPI, which stains mitochondrial DNA, and by determining the enrichment of HSP70, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme (detected by Western blot using a polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:4000) generated against Crithidia fasiculata mitochondrial HSP70 (29.Effron P.N.

Isolated mitochondria (150 Î¼g of protein, 1 Ã 109 cell equivalents) in 30 Î¼l of FAS buffer were either immediately assayed for 30 min at 37 Â°C in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 50 Î¼m [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, 55 mCi/mmol) or preincubated to assess heat lability of FAS activity. Preincubation was for 10â30 min at 37 Â°C (without ATP and malonyl-CoA). This was followed by an additional 30 min at 37 Â°C (with ATP and malonyl-CoA). Some reactions contained 50 Î¼m butyryl-CoA as a potential primer. Lipids were then extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) and converted to methyl esters for chain-length analysis by fractionation on reversed-phase TLC (10.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S.

In addition, the membrane-washing steps used previously were omitted; instead, total lysates were used. Assays were conducted (with in 2 h of cell lysis) in 30 Î¼lof50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, with 2 mm NADH, 2 mm NADPH, 1 mm ATP, 100 Î¼m CoA, 50 Î¼m [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, 55 mCi/mmol), and protease inhibitors (Complete, 1 tablet/100 ml, Roche Applied Science). Substrates and cofactors (NAD(P)H, ATP, CoA, and malonyl-CoA) were left out during preincubation (as done for isolated mitochondria). Some reactions contained 50 Î¼m butyryl-CoA as a primer. After 30 min at 37 Â°C, lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (10: 10:3) and used for chain-length analysis and quantitated as described earlier in this section. In Vivo Labeling of ACP RNAi Cell LinesâACP RNAi was induced with 1 Î¼g/ml tetracycline. After 4 days, cells (induced and uninduced controls) were centrifuged and resuspended at 2 Ã 108 cells/ml in SDM-79 medium with the appropriate drugs. This cell suspension (500 Î¼l) was transferred to a screw-cap tube with either 1.2 Î¼Ci of [2-14C]pyruvate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 16.4 mCi/mmol) or 3 Î¼Ci [U-14C]threonine (Sigma, 155 mCi/mmol) for 4 h at 27 Â°C under 5% CO2 (with cap loosened). Radiolabeled cells were centrifuged, and medium was saved for scintillation counting. The pellet was then washed in PBS, and fatty acids were extracted and analyzed by normal-phase TLC (10.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T.

Phosphorimaging quantitation was performed as above, but values were normalized using scintillation counts from labeling medium. Lipoic Acid BioassaysâThe E. coli lipoate synthase null mutant, KER176 (provided by Dr. Sean Prigge, Johns Hopkins University), was plated on Luria Broth with kanamycin (50 Î¼g/ml) and a single colony was selected. The cloned cells were cultured at 37 Â°C in medium E (31.Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 1 mg/ml acid hydrolyzed vitamin-free casein (Difco), 7 Î¼g/ml iron sulfate, 2 Î¼g/ml thiamine hydrochloride, and 10 ng/ml LA (complete medium E). Prior to the assay, cells were washed in 0.9% NaCl and resuspended in 10 ml of complete medium E without LA and grown overnight at 37 Â°C. Cells were then harvested and washed twice in 0.9% NaCl before resuspension to an A660 of 0.2 for inoculation. Trypanosomes (3 Ã 108 cells) either uninduced or induced for ACP RNAi (PCFs) or knock-out (BSFs) for 4 days were harvested and resuspended in 0.3 ml of 6 m HCl containing 3 mg of bovine serum albumin in a screw-cap tube. A control tube contained no trypanosomes. Samples were saturated with nitrogen gas for 20 min and then heated in an autoclave (120 Â°C for 20 min (32.Hayden M.A. Huang I. Bussiere D.E. Ashley G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9512-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The resulting hydrolysates were dried under nitrogen gas and redissolved in 0.3 ml of 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Hydrolysate (1 Ã 108 cell equivalents) was added to 3 ml of complete medium E (without LA) containing kanamycin and 100 Î¼l of KER176 inoculum. After 18 h at 37 Â°C, cell growth was determined by measurement of A660. A standard curve, generated by adding LA to the culture instead of trypanosome hydrolysate, was linear up to 3 ng of LA. Northern Blots and Western BlotsâNorthern blots were performed as previously described (26.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

For anti-ACP Western blots, 2 Ã 107 cells (unless otherwise noted) were harvested per day and stored at â80 Â°C until fractionated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with rat anti-recombinant ACP (1:500) followed by donkey anti-rat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:4000), and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W2075061087,"The cytokine receptor CD137 is a member of the TNF receptor family and a potent T cell costimulatory molecule. Its ligand is expressed on antigen presenting cells as a transmembrane protein and it too can deliver signals into the cells it is expressed on (reverse signaling). In monocytes, immobilized CD137 protein induces activation, prolongation of survival and proliferation. Here we show that recombinant immobilized CD137 protein enhances migration of monocytes in vitro. Further, CD137 expression on spheroids leads to a significantly enhanced infiltration by monocytes. The migration-inducing activity of CD137 could be confirmed in vivo. Matrigel, which was coated with recombinant CD137 protein and was inserted into the flanks of mice attracted large numbers of monocytes and was heavily infiltrated by these cells. In vivo, expression of CD137 by blood vessel walls at sites of inflammation was detectable by immunohistochemistry. CD137 expression is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells, suggesting that a physiological function of CD137 may be the facilitation of monocyte extravasation in inflammatory tissues."

In this study we show that Hsp60 mediates immune stimulation by different mechanisms, dependent and independent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have demonstrated earlier that both, Hsp60 and LPS, increase antigen-specific interferon (IFN) Î³ release in T cells. Here we show that in contrast to LPS Hsp60 induces IFNÎ± production in professional APC. Neutralization of IFNÎ± as well as the absence of functional IFNÎ±Î² receptor on APC and T cells interfered with Hsp60-mediated IFNÎ³ secretion in antigen-dependent T cell activation, strongly suggesting that IFNÎ± represents one factor contributing to Hsp60-specific immune stimulation. On the other hand, we show that Hsp60 bound to the cell surface of APC colocalizes with the LPS co-receptor CD14 and LPS binding sites. Hsp60 specifically binds bacterial LPS and both molecules synergistically enhanced IL-12p40 production in APC and IFNÎ³ release in antigen-dependent T cell activation. This effect was Hsp60-specific and dependent on LPS-binding by Hsp60. Furthermore, we show that Hsp60 exclusively binds to macrophages and DC but not to T or B lymphocytes and that both, T cell stimulation by Hsp60 as well as Hsp60/LPS complexes, strictly depends on the presence of professional APC and is not mediated by B cells. Taken together, our data support an extension of the concept of Hsp60 as an endogenous danger signal: besides its function as a classical danger signal indicating unplanned tissue destruction to the innate immune system, in the incident of bacterial infection extracellular Hsp60 may bind LPS and facilitate microbe recognition by lowering the threshold of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detection and enhancing Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.

The receptor complex consisting of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14 co-receptor and the TLR4 signaling receptor is known to mediate LPS signaling (25.Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K.

The Hsp60 preparations, however, that have been used in earlier studies were expressed in Escherichia coli and, therefore, were likely to be contaminated with bacterial endotoxins. For this reason, it could not be excluded that the observed effects were due to contaminating bacterial structures, especially LPS, rather than the Hsp60 protein itself, although controls like heat sensitivity and polymyxine B insensitivity of Hsp60 versus LPS were included (8.Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Employing eukaryotic cell lines expressing the murine Hsp60 as a membrane-bound cell surface protein we have shown that Hsp60 enhances IFNÎ³ production in antigen-dependent T cell activation in an endotoxin-free environment, clearly demonstrating that Hsp60 possesses an intrinsic immunostimulatory potential (6.Osterloh A.

On the other hand, this endotoxin-free Hsp60 did not induce TNFÎ± production in APC, an effect that was described to be mediated by contaminating LPS in the recombinant E. coli-expressed Hsp60 preparations used in earlier studies (29.Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Gao B. Tsan M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, also Hsp70-mediated cytokine secretion in APC has been ascribed to contaminating bacterial endotoxins (31.Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and it was suggested that HSP such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 bind bacterial LPS and modulate LPS signaling (25.Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 33.Byrd C.A. Bornmann W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pavletich N. Rosen N.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Recently, the stress protein gp96 was shown to bind different TLR agonists including LPS, thereby enhancing the biological effect of the associated PAMP (35.Warger T. Hilf N. Rechtsteiner G. Haselmayer P. Carrick D.M. Jonuleit H. van Landenberg P. Rammensee H.-G. Nicchitta C.V. Radsak M.P. Schild H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, also Hsp60 has been shown to bind LPS and to enhance LPS-induced TNFÎ± production in a macrophage cell line (36.Habich C. Kempe K. van der Zee R. Rumenapf R. Akiyama H. Kolb H. Burkart V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) indicating that Hsp60 may influence LPS signaling. Therefore, the present study was performed to dissect the immunological functions of Hsp60, LPS, and Hsp60/LPS complexes. We show that Hsp60 exclusively binds to professional APC but not to T- or B-lymphocytes. Thereby, Hsp60 colocalizes with the CD14 receptor as well as LPS binding sites. Furthermore, we confirm that Hsp60 specifically binds bacterial LPS and show that both molecules synergistically stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses indicated by enhanced IL-12p40 production in APC and IFNÎ³ release in antigen-dependent T cell activation. On the other hand, we observe that Hsp60 stimulates IFNÎ± production in APC, an effect that is not induced by LPS and not further enhanced by Hsp60-LPS complexes. Furthermore, we show that IFNÎ± release as well as expression of functional IFNÎ±Î² receptor on APC and T cells is important in Hsp60- but not LPS-mediated stimulation of T cell activation. Thus, Hsp60 and LPS differentially stimulate leukocyte functions. Taken together, our results reveal different mechanisms by which Hsp60 can modulate immune responses in the absence or presence of LPS: (i) Hsp60 enhances antigen-dependent T cell activation in an endotoxin-free environment (6.Osterloh A. Meier-Stiegen F. Veit A. Fleischer B. Von Bonin A. Breloer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47906-47911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) whereby IFNÎ±, which is released by APC upon Hsp60 stimulation, is one mediator. (ii) Hsp60 functions as a LPS carrier protein that enhances LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in APC and as a consequence augments LPS-mediated T cell activation.

IFNÎ±Î²R-/- and IFNÎ²-/- mice were bred at the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany, and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany. T cells from DO11.10 mice (DO11.10 T cells termed hereafter), C57BL/6 and IFNÎ±Î²R-/-, MHC II+ cells, and B cells from BALB/c mice were purified from spleens by magnetic cell sorting using the Pan T cell isolation kit, the MHC II depletion kit, and the Pan B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), HEPES, and 10 mm l-glutamine. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were induced by intraperitoneal injection of 500 Î¼l of thioglycolate into BALB/c mice and isolated by peritoneal lavage after 5 days. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmDC) were obtained from purified BALB/c bone marrow cells that were cultured in RPMI1640/10% FCS supplemented with 20 ng/ml granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor and harvested after 9 days of culture. Transfection of COS1âEukaryotic COS1 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.

Cell culture medium was replaced by 2 ml of RPMI1640, 10% FCS and the transfection mixture was added for 24 h. Expression of cell surface Hsp60 was monitored by FACS staining as described earlier (6.Osterloh A. Meier-Stiegen F. Veit A. Fleischer B. Von Bonin A. Breloer M. J. Biol.

ReagentsâLow-endotoxin recombinant human Hsp60 (named hHsp60 hereafter) was obtained from Loke Diagnostics APs (Denmark; batch number B02-141205) and contained <2 endotoxic units of LPS/mg of protein as determined by limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker). For binding studies hHsp60 and BSA control protein (Sigma) were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Alexa 647 using the protein labeling kits from Molecular Probes. Proteins were labeled according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Unlabeled E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (strain 055:B5) and Alexa 488-labeled LPS of the same strain were purchased from Sigma (Germany). 3H-LPS (E. coli strain K12 LCD25) was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Canada). OVA323â339 peptide was synthesized by JPT (Germany). AntibodiesâHsp60-specific antibody clones LK-1 and 4B9 were obtained from Stressgen (number SPA806) and Dianova (number MA3-012) as was mouse IgG2a isotype antibody. Rat anti-mouse CD14 was purchased from BD Pharmingen and TRITC- or PE-labeled goat anti-mouse as well as FITC-labeled goat anti-rat secondary antibodies and PE- or FITC-labeled antibodies against CD11c, CD11b, B220, CD4, and CD8 were purchased from Dianova. Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit anti-FITC antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes and DAPI was purchased from Sigma. Neutralizing polyclonal rabbit anti-IFNÎ± (number 32100-1) and anti-IFNÎ² serum (number 32400-1) as well as rabbit IgG control serum were obtained from R&D Systems (Germany). Binding StudiesâTo analyze whether LPS binds to Hsp60, 3 Ã 104 pFM92-mHsp60-transfected COS1 cells expressing the murine Hsp60 protein as a cell surface molecule or mock transfected COS1 cells that obtained the pFM92 control vector were incubated on ice with 500 ng/ml 3H-LPS in 200 Î¼l of culture medium in a 96-well plate for 45 min. To test for specificity the binding of 3H-LPS was blocked by addition of either 15 Î¼g/ml anti-Hsp60 antibody (clone 4B9) or 5 Î¼g/ml unlabeled LPS for 45 min on ice before addition of 3H-LPS. Afterward cells were harvested and cell-bound radioactivity was detected. For binding of Hsp60 to PEC and bmDC, 1 Ã 106 BALB/c-derived PEC or bmDC were incubated on ice with either 30 Î¼g/ml FITC-labeled or unlabeled hHsp60. Afterward, cells that obtained unlabeled hHsp60 were treated with 30 Î¼l of Cohn II fraction (Sigma) and stained with Hsp60-specific antibody (clone LK-1, 1:100 in PBS), TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:400 in PBS) and DAPI (1:1000 in PBS). After staining cells were fixed in PBS/1% paraformaldehyde (PFA), centrifuged onto glass slides, and covered with anti-FADE solution (BiomedDia, Germany). In addition, BALB/c PEC that had been incubated with 15 Î¼g/ml of hHsp60 were centrifuged onto glass slides before staining. After overnight drying cells were fixed with acetone for 5 min and dried again for 1 h. After Fc block with 50 Î¼l of Cohn II fraction cells were stained with mouse anti-Hsp60 antibody (LK-1, 1:100), rat anti-CD14 antibody (1:100), TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse (1:400), and FITC-labeled goat anti-rat (1:200) secondary antibodies. FITC staining of CD14 was further enhanced by addition of Alexa 488-labeled anti-FITC (1:200). In addition, cells were stained with DAPI (1:1000) and finally covered with anti-FADE solution. Furthermore, BALB/c-derived PEC were incubated in chamber slides (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). After adherence overnight at 37 Â°C dead cells were washed out and cells were incubated alone or with 15 Î¼g/ml hHsp60 for 45 min at 37 Â°C. Afterward cells were washed and fixed in ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1) at -20 Â°C for 10 min. After drying, cells were blocked by addition of 200 Î¼l of Cohn II fraction with PBS, 1% BSA (1:1) for 20 min. Alexa 488-conjugated LPS (1:100) was added for 30 min and cells were stained with DAPI, anti-Hsp60 (clone LK-1) and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody as described before. Dose-dependent binding of Hsp60 to BALB/c spleen cells was analyzed by incubating 2 Ã 106 cells with 0.4, 2, 10, 40, or 200 Î¼g/ml hHsp60-Alexa 647 for 30 min on ice in 50 Î¼l of culture medium. To identify cell populations in spleen that bind Hsp60, 2 Ã 106 BALB/c spleen cells were incubated 30 min on ice either alone, with 10 Î¼g/ml BSA-Alexa 647 or 10 Î¼g/ml hHsp60/Alexa 647 in 100 Î¼l of culture medium. Binding of Hsp60 was competed by incubating cells with 20, 200, or 400 Î¼g/ml unlabeled hHsp60 30 min prior to addition of hHsp60-Alexa 647. For further stainings, Fc receptors were blocked by addition of 30 Î¼l of Cohn II fraction for 20 min and PE- or FITC-labeled CD11c-, CD11b-, B220-, CD4-, or CD8-specific antibodies (1:200) were added for 30 min. Cells were analyzed by FACS whereby two different gates were used: gate R1 that mainly contains CD4+, CD8+, and B220+ lymphocytes, and gate R2 that contains the majority of CD11c+ and CD11b+ cells (data not shown). 6 Ã 105 cells were detected. Cellular AssaysâAll assays were performed in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, HEPES, and l-glutamine. For stimulation of APC, 1 Ã 105 BALB/c-derived PEC or bmDC were incubated in 96-well round-bottom plates either alone or with the indicated amounts of hHsp60 or LPS. In addition, cells were treated with a combination of LPS, hHsp60, or BSA or a combination of the same amounts of these proteins that had been preincubated with LPS for 2 h at 37 Â°Cto allow complexation. For T cell stimulation, 1 Ã 105 purified T cells from DO11.10 mice were co-cultured with 5 Ã 104 BALB/c-derived PEC or purified BALB/c B cells and activated with 0.5â1 Î¼g/ml OVA323â339 peptide. In parallel experiments complexation of hHsp60 and LPS was inhibited by addition of 2 Î¼g/ml anti-Hsp60 antibody (clone 4B9) during the preincubation period. As a control 2 Î¼g/ml of isotype antibody (mouse IgG2a) was used. IFNÎ± and IFNÎ² were neutralized by the addition of 2.3 kilounits of polyclonal rabbit anti-IFNÎ± or anti-IFNÎ² serum. Control cultures received 2 Î¼g/ml isotype antibodies or serum. Alternatively, instead of soluble recombinant hHsp60, 2 Ã 103 or 1 Ã 104 of transfected COS1 cells expressing cell surface Hsp60 were used. Thereby, the indicated amounts of COS1 cells were added alone or preincubated with LPS for 2 h at 37 Â°C before addition of 1 Ã 105 of DO11.10 T cells, 5 Ã 104 of PEC, and OVA peptide. Cytokine QuantificationâCytokines were detected after 24 or 48 h of culture. IL-12p40 was quantified by standard sandwich ELISA. 96-Well Maxisorb plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 2 Î¼g/ml anti-IL-12p40/70 (clone C15.6) at 4 Â°C for 24 h. Plates were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 h at 37 Â°C and washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Culture supernatants and a standard of recombinant IL-12 were added to the coated plates and incubated at 4 Â°C for 24 h. After 6 washes, 1 Î¼g/ml biotinylated anti-IL-12p40/70 (clone C17.8) was added as detection antibody and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following 6 washes, a 1:10000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidine (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS/0.1% BSA was added for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed 6 times and developed with 300 Î¼g/ml tetramethylbenzidine, diluted in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, pH 5.5, containing 0.003% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 Î¼l of 2 m H2SO4, and OD at 450 nm was measured immediately. All antibodies and recombinant cytokine standards were obtained from BD Pharmingen. IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ± content in the supernatants were determined employing the IFNÎ³ DuoSet ELISA development system and the mouse IFNÎ± ELISA kit from R&D Systems according to the manufacturerâs protocols. Hsp60 Binds to Macrophages and DC but Not to B and T LymphocytesâIt has been shown that Hsp60 modulates APC as well as T and B cell activation (4.Breloer M. Dorner B. More S.H. Roderian T.

To mediate a stimulatory effect it has to be assumed that Hsp60 binds to the cells via specific receptors. Therefore, we identified cell populations that bind Hsp60 to elucidate which cells might be able to respond to Hsp60 in a direct way. For this purpose BALB/c spleen cells were incubated with Alexa 647-labeled human Hsp60 (hHsp60-Alexa 647) or BSA (BSA-Alexa 647) as a control. Cells were subsequently stained against different cellular marker molecules and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS). Fig. 1A shows that Hsp60 binds to subpopulations of CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells. About 35% of the CD11c+ cells and 21% of the CD11b+ cells were positive for hHsp60-Alexa 647, whereas the control protein BSA-Alexa 647 did not bind to these cells. Furthermore, Fig. 1 shows that hHsp60 does not bind to CD4+ or CD8+ T and B220+ B lymphocytes. Similar binding studies were also performed using unlabeled hHsp60 whereby bound hHsp60 was detected with Hsp60-specific antibody leading to the same results (data not shown). Binding of hHsp60-Alexa 647 could be inhibited by preincubation of spleen cells with unlabeled hHsp60. The addition of 20 Î¼g/ml hHsp60, a 2-fold excess, already reduced the amount of hHsp60-Alexa 647 binding spleen cells from 18 to 7% and binding could be further inhibited using higher concentrations (20- and 40-fold excess) of unlabeled hHsp60 (Fig. 1B, left and middle). As shown before, the subpopulation of 18% of Hsp60-binding spleen cells can already be detected with 10 Î¼g/ml Hsp60-Alexa 647 (Fig. 1B, left) and does not increase using higher concentrations of labeled Hsp60 (data not shown). However, the mean fluorescence intensity of this Hsp60-binding spleen cell fraction reaches a plateau when using more than 40 Î¼g/ml hHsp60-Alexa 647 (Fig. 1B, right). These results show that binding of Hsp60 to spleen cells is saturable and specific. In addition, we analyzed binding of Hsp60 to PEC and bmDC by FACS (data not shown) and fluorescent microscopic analysis of cytospins. Fig. 2 shows that hHsp60 binds to the cell surface of bmDC as well as PEC (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, Hsp60 appears to concentrate in distinct membrane regions that cannot be ascribed to antibody-in"

https://openalex.org/W2069853592,"The hepatitis C virus encodes a single polyprotein that is processed by host and viral proteases to yield at least 10 mature viral proteins. The nonstructural (NS) protein 5A is a phosphoprotein, and experimental data indicate that the phosphorylation state of NS5A is important for the outcome of viral RNA replication. We were able to identify kinase inhibitors that specifically inhibit the formation of the hyperphosphorylated form of NS5A (p58) in cells. These kinase inhibitors were used for inhibitor affinity chromatography in order to identify the cellular targets of these compounds. The kinases casein kinase I (CKI), p38 MAPK, CIT (Citron Rho-interacting kinase), GAK, JNK2, PKA, RSK1/2, and RIPK2 were identified in the high affinity binding fractions of two NS5A hyperphosphorylation inhibitors (NS5A-p58-i). Even though these kinases are targets of the NS5A-p58-i, the only kinase showing an effect on NS5A hyperphosphorylation was confirmed to be CKI-Î±. Although this finding does not exclude the possibility that other kinase(s) might be involved in basal or regulatory phosphorylation of NS5A, we show here that NS5A is a direct substrate of CKI-Î±. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of NS5A by CKI-Î± resulted for the first time in the production of basal and hyperphosphorylated forms resembling those produced in cells. In vitro kinase reactions performed with NS5A peptides show that Ser-2204 is a preferred substrate residue for CKI-Î± after pre-phosphorylation of Ser-2201.

The kinases casein kinase I (CKI), p38 MAPK, CIT (Citron Rho-interacting kinase), GAK, JNK2, PKA, RSK1/2, and RIPK2 were identified in the high affinity binding fractions of two NS5A hyperphosphorylation inhibitors (NS5A-p58-i). Even though these kinases are targets of the NS5A-p58-i, the only kinase showing an effect on NS5A hyperphosphorylation was confirmed to be CKI-Î±. Although this finding does not exclude the possibility that other kinase(s) might be involved in basal or regulatory phosphorylation of NS5A, we show here that NS5A is a direct substrate of CKI-Î±. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of NS5A by CKI-Î± resulted for the first time in the production of basal and hyperphosphorylated forms resembling those produced in cells. In vitro kinase reactions performed with NS5A peptides show that Ser-2204 is a preferred substrate residue for CKI-Î± after pre-phosphorylation of Ser-2201.

Intensive studies since the discovery of the virus in 1989 have improved therapeutic options, but they are still inadequate for the majority of patients. The 9.6-kb RNA genome of HCV is translated into a single polyprotein, which is then co- and post-translationally processed by host and viral proteases to yield at least 10 mature viral proteins (C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B) (1Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We focused our interest on the nonstructural protein NS5A. NS5A, together with all other nonstructural proteins, is associated with membranous structures thought to be the scaffold for the formation of the viral replication complex (2Egger D. Wolk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 3Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, although NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, and NS5B are tightly associated with membranes because of the presence of membrane-anchoring or transmembrane domains (4Appel N. Schaller T. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9833-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), NS5A associates with the endoplasmic reticulum by an amphipathic Î±-helix (5Brass V. Bieck E. Montserret R. Wolk B. Hellings J.A. Blum H.E. Penin F. Moradpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8130-8139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This might result in a less tight interaction with membranes, and dissociation of NS5A from the replication complex might be facilitated. In support of this hypothesis are recent publications that demonstrate that mutations within NS5A can be trans-complemented, whereas trans-complementation for all other nonstructural proteins failed (6Appel N. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Tong X. Malcolm B.A. Virus Res. 2006; 115: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This flexibility might facilitate the multiple functions attributed to NS5A. NS5A has been described to influence many different cellular pathways (8Macdonald A. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, direct interaction with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (9Shimakami T. Hijikata M. Luo H. Ma Y.Y. Kaneko S. Shimotohno K. Murakami S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2738-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as well as with RNA (10Huang L. Hwang J. Sharma S.D. Hargittai M.R. Chen Y. Arnold J.J. Raney K.D. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36417-36428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) support the fact that NS5A also plays an important role in viral replication. Considering the numerous functions ascribed to this single protein, it is not surprising that post-translational events play a crucial role for the regulation of functions of NS5A. It has been demonstrated by several groups that NS5A is a target of different cellular proteases (11Kalamvoki M. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13449-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Hidajat R. Nagano-Fujii M. Deng L. Hotta H. Kobe J. Med. Sci. 2004; 50: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar), and it is easy to imagine that different cleavage products might exert different cellular functions. However, the most studied post-translational modification of NS5A identified to date is phosphorylation. NS5A is expressed as a basally phosphorylated (p56) and a hyperphosphorylated (p58) form (13Kaneko T. Tanji Y. Satoh S. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the production of the latter form requires the presence of other HCV nonstructural proteins (14Neddermann P. Clementi A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9984-9991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Asabe S.I. Tanji Y. Satoh S. Kaneko T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 790-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements for NS5A hyperphosphorylation are in remarkable agreement with two other previous observations as follows: trans-complementation could be obtained only when NS5A was expressed in the context of an intact polyprotein coding from NS3 to NS5A (6Appel N. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and wild type NS5A exerted a trans-dominant negative effect on adapted subgenomic replicons only when expressed in the same context (17Graziani R. Paonessa G. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus it seems that the presence of the NS3, NS4A, and NS4B proteins are required for the production of a correctly folded, functional NS5A protein. Whether NS5A hyperphosphorylation is the cause or the consequence of correct folding in this context is still to be established. Besides the presence of other nonstructural proteins, NS5A hyperphosphorylation requires the presence of three serine residues (18Tanji Y. Kaneko T. Satoh S. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are situated in a region between the first and the second N-terminal domains of NS5A (19Tellinghuisen T.L. Marcotrigiano J. Gorbalenya A.E. Rice C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48576-48587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Even though the functional relevance of the different phosphorylated forms is still unknown, it has become more and more evident that a tight regulation of NS5A phosphorylation is important for the outcome of HCV RNA replication. The Con1 wild type sequence is able to replicate in cells only after acquisition of adaptive mutations, which in most cases reduce NS5A hyperphosphorylation (20Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), or after reduction of hyperphosphorylated NS5A upon incubation with NS5A hyperphosphorylation-specific kinase inhibitors (21Neddermann P. Quintavalle M. Di Pietro C. Clementi A. Cerretani M. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13306-13314Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this case, the alteration of NS5A phosphorylation increases replication efficiency. There are, however, other examples that indicate that alterations of a functional ratio between NS5A-p56 and p58 negatively influence the outcome of productive replication/infection. An actively replicating HCV subgenome expressing a reduced level of NS5A-p58 is completely inhibited if hyperphosphorylation is further decreased either by introduction of a second adaptive mutation (22Lohmann V. Hoffmann S. Herian U. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) or by the addition of the NS5A hyperphosphorylation inhibitors (21Neddermann P. Quintavalle M. Di Pietro C. Clementi A. Cerretani M. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13306-13314Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, introduction of a mutation that reduces NS5A hyperphosphorylation into an infective clone abrogates infection in the chimpanzee model (23Bukh J. Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Krieger N. Faulk K. Engle R.E. Govindarajan S. Shapiro M. Claire M. St Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The latter example, in particular, underlines the importance of NS5A-p58 for replication/infection and points to the fact that the cellular kinase responsible for NS5A hyperphosphorylation might be a good alternative antiviral target besides the viral enzymatic targets. We aimed to identify this/these cellular kinase(s) using the specific NS5A hyperphosphorylation inhibitors (NS5A-p58-i). Upon screening of a panel of cellular kinases in vitro, we identified the family of casein kinase I (CKI) as a target of the compounds, and using genetic tools we confirmed that the Î±-isoform of CKI is important for the formation of NS5A-p58 (24Quintavalle M. Sambucini S. Di Pietro C. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11305-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although this strategy helped us to identify CKI-Î±, it has several shortcomings because only a small subset of the cellular kinases could be tested (60 out of >500). Because of this limitation, we cannot exclude the possibility that other cellular kinases not present in the previous screen are a target of the NS5A hyperphosphorylation inhibitors and might participate on the same pathway finally resulting in NS5A hyperphosphorylation. We therefore adopted an alternative methodology, the inhibitor affinity chromatography, to confirm CKI-Î± as a target of the compounds in a more physiological context in the presence of ATP-binding proteins and competing cellular kinases and to eventually identify additional kinases that might contribute to NS5A hyperphosphorylation. Antibodies, Plasmids, Enzymes, and PeptidesâThe antibodies against CKI-Î±, CKI-Î´, CKI-É, and JNK2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and against p38 MAPK, RSK, and PKA from Cell Signaling Technology. The NS5A-specific antibodies have been described previously (21Neddermann P. Quintavalle M. Di Pietro C. Clementi A. Cerretani M. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13306-13314Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All NS5A peptides were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis Inc. CKI-Î´ and its substrate peptide were purchased from New England Biolabs. CKII, p38 MAPK, PKA, JNK1, JNK2, RSK2, and their respective substrates were obtained from Upstate. The plasmids pcD-BLA-wt and pET26Ub-His-Î32 have been described previously (21Neddermann P. Quintavalle M. Di Pietro C. Clementi A. Cerretani M. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. De Francesco R. J.

Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET14-R30-SR-K4 contains the coding region of Con1-NS5A with the following modifications. The first 29 amino acids were deleted, and the NS5A coding region starts with Arg-30. Ser-232 was mutated to arginine (amino acid of the HCV polyprotein S2204R), and four lysine residues were added to the C terminus to increase solubility of the protein. The DNA plasmid pHCVNeo-SR is identical to pHCVNeo17.wt, as described previously (26Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S. Narjes F. Muraglia E. Paonessa G. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but contains the mutation S2204R in NS5A. Plasmid pBAC-FLAG-CKI-Î± contains the CKI-Î± coding region with an N-terminal FLAG tag. The coding region of CKI-Î± with the N-terminal FLAG tag was taken from plasmid pCD-FLAG-CKI-Î±, as described previously (24Quintavalle M. Sambucini S. Di Pietro C. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11305-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and cloned into the BamHI/NotI cloning sites of pBAC-1 (Novagen). All modifications were performed using standard recombinant DNA technology. Compounds were synthesized as described previously (27De Francesco, R., and Neddermann, P. (March 2, 2006) WO 2006/021449 A1Google Scholar). Immobilization of H479 and A852-mâ2 ml of drained epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (GE Healthcare) were equilibrated with coupling buffer (50% dimethylformamide, 0.1 m Na2CO3), and 4 ml of 10 mm H479 or 5 mm of A852-m, dissolved in coupling buffer, were incubated overnight at 37 Â°C in the dark with the resin. After the incubation the resin was washed with coupling buffer, and the remaining reactive groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine in coupling buffer for 5 h at 37 Â°C. Subsequent washing steps were performed according to the manufacturerâs instructions. To generate the control matrix, epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B was directly reacted with 1 m ethanolamine in coupling buffer and equally treated as described above. The matrices were stored at 4 Â°C in the dark. Extract Preparation and Inhibitor Affinity Chromatographyâ10A-IFN cells (26Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S.

For protein binding in batch, lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation and equilibrated to 1 m NaCl. Cell lysate (2 mg of total protein) was incubated with 100 Î¼l of drained inhibitor-matrix for 2 h at 4 Â°C with or without 2 mm of compound as indicated in the figure legends. Unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation, and resin was washed extensively first with TL buffer, 1 m NaCl and then with TL buffer, 20 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were directly denatured by addition of 1 volume of 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the corresponding antibodies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used, and enzymatic reactions were developed using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). For preparative binding experiments, protein extract was prepared from 9 Ã 107 10A-IFN cells as described above, equilibrated to 1 m NaCl, and loaded directly onto an inhibitor-matrix containing chromatographic column. After binding, the column was washed with 30 volumes of TL buffer, 1 m NaCl and 30 volumes of TL buffer, 20 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were first eluted with 3 volumes TL buffer, 20 mm NaCl containing 100 mm Mg-ATP and subsequently with 3 volumes of TL buffer, 20 mm NaCl containing 100 mm Mg-ATP plus 1 mm compound. Mass SpectrometryâEluted proteins (400 Î¼l) were concentrated with the clean-up kit (GE Healthcare), separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The bands of interest were excised and digested with trypsin for mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Briefly, the gel pieces were incubated with 20 Î¼l of 12.5 ng/Î¼l trypsin sequencing grade (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 4 Â°C. Trypsin was then replaced with 50 mm NH4HCO3, and the gel pieces were left overnight at 37 Â°C. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel pieces by incubation in 50 Î¼lof20% formic acid in water (15 min) and pooled together with the supernatants. The tryptic peptides were dried down in a Speed-Vac concentrator, resuspended in 0.5% acetic acid, and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ion trap tandem mass spectrometry or subjected to ZipTip Î¼-C18 (Millipore) desalting prior to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. For liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ion trap tandem mass spectrometry experiments, an LCQ Deca XP-Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San JosÃ©;, CA) equipped with an in-house built micro-electrospray source connected to an in-house packed C18 column (100 mm Ã 0.10 mm, 5 Î¼m particle size) was used. Protein identification from collision-induced dissociation data was done with TurboSequest software provided by the manufacturer. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry experiments, a Voyager-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used, which operated in positive reflectron mode using Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in water/acetonitrile 3:7, 1% trifluoroacetic acid) as matrix. Internal calibration was used. MASCOT software package (Matrix Science, London, UK) was used to identify proteins from independent nonredundant sequence data bases. Protein Expression and Metabolic Labeling of ProteinsâProtein expression using the vaccinia T7 infection/transfection system was performed as described (14Neddermann P. Clementi A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9984-9991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3.5 Ã 105 10A-IFN cells/35-mm diameter dish were plated the day before the experiment. 2 Î¼g of total plasmid DNA was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as transfection reagent. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described. Inhibitors were added during the starvation reaction and were present during metabolic labeling of the cells. RNA InterferenceâsiRNAs were transfected by electroporation (21Neddermann P. Quintavalle M. Di Pietro C. Clementi A. Cerretani M. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13306-13314Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 Î¼m siRNA were electroporated in 1 Ã 106 10A-IFN cells in a volume of 0.1 ml. After electroporation, 4.5 Ã 105 cells were plated in a 35-mm diameter dish and incubated for 2 days. After 2 days, HCV proteins were expressed with the vaccinia T7 infection/transfection system as described above.

All probes contain the 6-carboxyfluorescein dye at the 5â²-end and the 6-carboxy-N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetramethylrhodamineTAMRA quencher at its 3â²-end. As endogenous standard we used the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe, containing the VIC dye at its 5â²-end (Applied Biosystems). Reactions are conducted in three stages under the following conditions: stage 1, 30 min at 48 Â°C; stage 2, 10 min at 95 Â°C; stage 3, 15 s at 95 Â°C and 1 min at 60 Â°C, 40 cycles. The total volume of the reaction is 50 Î¼l. In Vitro Kinase AssaysâAll protein kinase activities were linear with respect to time in each incubation. If not mentioned differently, all reactions were performed in the presence of 125 Î¼m cold ATP, 0.2 Î¼lof[Î³-33P]ATP (2 Î¼Ci/point), and 18 mm MgCl2 in reaction buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mm Î²-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 50 Î¼l for 30 min at room temperature. For the calculation of IC50 values, compounds were added in a range between 0.1 nm and 1 mm resulting in a final Me2SO concentration of 5%. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP and stopped by the addition of 10 Î¼l of 3% phosphoric acid, and 20 Î¼l of the reaction were spotted onto P30 Filtermat (Wallac). The filter was washed three times for 5 min with 75 mm phosphoric acid and once with methanol. Radioactivity was counted in 5 ml of Ready Protein scintillation mixture (Beckman Coulter).

Cell extract was prepared in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 40% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation and glycerol concentration was diluted to 20% before incubation with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 Â°C. The anti-FLAG-agarose was washed extensively with lysis buffer without glycerol. Elution of the FLAG-tagged proteins was performed with 3 volumes of elution buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 100 Î¼g/ml of FLAG-peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Eluted proteins were stored at -20 Â°C. Design of Inhibitor Affinity ChromatographyâWe have previously identified specific inhibitors of the NS5A hyperphosphorylation (21Neddermann P.

The chemical structure of two of these compounds, H479 and A852, is shown in Fig. 1. The compounds belong to the class of 2, 4, 5-trisubstituted imidazoles, which are known to bind to the active site of kinases and are competitive with ATP. To purify the kinases targeted by these compounds, we generated affinity resins by immobilizing the kinase inhibitors to a solid matrix. The choice of the inhibitor orientation with respect to the matrix is important to ensure a correct interaction of the target protein with the inhibitor. In general, a co-crystal structure of the inhibitor with the target protein indicates the area of the inhibitor that can be attached to the matrix. In our case this information is not available, and we had to utilize alternative sources of information. Godl et al. (29Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H.

In this study we have cloned a novel endo-type Î²-agarase gene, agaB, from marine Pseudoalteromonas sp. CY24. The novel agarase encoded by agaB gene has no significant sequence similarity with any known proteins including all glycoside hydrolases. It degrades agarose to generate neoagarooctaose and neoagarodecaose as the main end products. Based on the analyses of enzymatic kinetics and degradation patterns of different oligosaccharides, the agarase AgaB appears to have a large substrate binding cleft that accommodates 12 sugar units, with 8 sugar units toward the reducing end spanning subsites +1 to +8 and 4 sugar units toward the non-reducing end spanning subsites -4 to -1, and enzymatic cleavage taking place between subsites -1 and +1. In addition, 1H NMR analysis shows that this enzyme hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond with inversion of anomeric configuration, in contrast to other known agarases that are retaining. Altogether, AgaB is structurally and functionally different from other known agarases and appears to represent a new family of glycoside hydrolase.

Altogether, AgaB is structurally and functionally different from other known agarases and appears to represent a new family of glycoside hydrolase. Agar, usually obtained from the species of marine red algae, Gelidium and Gracilaria, is composed of agarose and agaropectin (1Rochas C. Lahaye M. Yaphe W. Phan Viet M.T. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 148: 199-207Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Agarose is a linear polymer of alternatively arranged 3-O-linked Î²-d-galactopyranose and 4-O-linked 3,6-anhydro-Î±-l-galactopyranose. Agaropectin has the same basic framework but contains substituent groups such as sulfate, pyruvate, and methoxyl (2Percival, E., and McDowell, R. H. (1967) Academic press, London, 88â98, 127-137Google Scholar). In agarose, the Î±(1â4)-linked units exhibit 3,6-anhydro bridges upon the disorder-order conformational transition that stabilize the molecules into double helices, leading to the formation of pseudocrystalline fibers made of aggregates of double-stranded agarose chains (3Arnott S. Fulmer A. Scott W.E. Dea I.C. Moorhouse R. Rees D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 90: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Carrageenans, the other category of red algal gel-forming polysaccharides from Gigartinales and Solieriales, differ from agars in the d-configuration of the (1â4)-linked galactose residues and in the density of ester-sulfate substituents per digalactose repeating unit (one in Îº-carrageenan, two in Î¹-carrageenan and three in Î»-carrageenan). Agarases are glycoside hydrolases (GHs) 2The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; kbp, kilobase pair(s); DP, degree of polymerization. that hydrolyze agarose. They are grouped into Î± and Î² types that hydrolyze Î±-1,3 linkages and Î²-1,4 linkages, respectively (4Duckworth M. Turvey J.R. Biochem.

Agarases have potential applications in the food, cosmetic, and medical industries for the production of oligosaccharides from agar or agarose (24Kobayashi R. Takisada M. Suzuki T. Kirimura K. Usami S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 162-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Yoshizawa Y. Ametani A. Tsunehiro J. Nomura K. Itoh M. Fukui F. Kaminogawa S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, agarases can be used to degrade the cell walls of marine algae for the preparation of protoplasts and for the extraction of labile substances with biological activities (26Araki T. Lu Z. Morishita T. J. Mar. Biotechnol. 1998; 6: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases are a widespread group of enzymes displaying a great variety of protein folds and substrate specificities. They function via general acid/base catalysis mediated by two major mechanisms, either an overall retention or an inversion of anomeric configuration (27Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). âRetainingâ enzymes utilize a double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, whereas âinvertingâ enzymes utilize a single-displacement reaction. In 1991 a classification of glycoside hydrolase was proposed on the basis of similarities in sequence (28Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). A sequence-based family contains glycoside hydrolases folding in the same pattern and functioning with the identical mechanism. Furthermore, the evolutionarily, structurally, and mechanistically related families were grouped together in higher hierarchical level termed âclansâ (29Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Currently, more than 100 families and 14 clans have been reported with details available at CAZy website. The known Î²-agarases are grouped into glycoside hydrolase families 16, 50, and 86, and family GH 16 is the most abundant with the Î²-agarases. Members of families GH 50 and 86 in clan GH-A share the same structure of (Î²/Î±)8 barrel in which the acid/base and the nucleophilic residues are located at the COOH-terminal end of strands Î²4 and Î²7, respectively (30Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 31Zverlov V.V. Liebl W. Bachleitner M. Schwarz W.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar). Members of family GH 16 in clan GH-B display the general Î²-jelly roll topology with two predominantly parallel or antiparallel Î²-sheets forming a long open substrate binding cleft, and two catalytic residues are located in the cleft (11Allouch J.

We reported here the cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of a novel Î²-agarase AgaB from Pseudoalteromonas sp. CY24. We determined also the relationship between the structure of Î²-agarase AgaB and its enzymatic activity by analyzing the enzymatic kinetics and the degradation products of different unlabeled and labeled oligosaccharide substrates. Altogether, AgaB is structurally and functionally different from other known agarases and appears as the first representative of a novel family of glycoside hydrolases. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher. Enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China). All DNA manipulations and Escherichia coli transformations were performed using standard procedures as described previously (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.53-1.86Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture ConditionsâE. coli DH5Î± harboring pBluescript II KS(+) was cultured at 37 Â°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing pET-24a(+)-agaB was incubated at 37 Â°C in LB medium supplemented with 30 Î¼g/ml kanamycin. The agarase-producing bacterial strain was cultured using an optimal medium consisting of 2.5% NaCl, 0.25% casein, 0.5% MgSO4Â·7H2O, 0.1% KCl, 0.02% CaCl2, 0.06% NaH2PO4, 0.002% FeSO4Â·7H2O, and 1.5% agar (or 0.1% for liquid medium). Isolation and Identification of Strain CY24âStrain CY24 was isolated from seawater collected from the coastal sea areas of Qingdao, China. Diluted seawater was plated on solid medium containing agar as the sole carbon source as described above and incubated at 25 Â°C for 48 h. Pit or clear zone-forming colonies were picked out and purified under the same conditions. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics and 16 S rRNA phylogenetic analysis were used to identify the isolated strain to genus (33Oliver J.D. Deep-Sea Res. 1982; 29: 794-795Google Scholar, 34Polz M.F. Cavanaugh C.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity AssayingâThe activity of agarase was assayed using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (35Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22353) Google Scholar). An appropriately diluted enzyme solution was incubated at 40 Â°C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 ml of 0.25% (w/v) agarose. Ten minutes later 750 Î¼l of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid was added, and reaction mixture was boiled for 10 min before adding 5 ml of H2O. The absorbance of reducing sugar was measured at 520 nm and compared with the standard curve of d-galactose. One unit of enzyme was defined as a 1-Î¼mol increment/min in the reducing end. Cloning of the agaB GeneâGenomic DNA of strain CY24 was isolated using Wizardâ¢ Genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonuclease PstI and fractionated through 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments ranging from 5.0 to 12.0 kbp in length were retrieved using Qiagen gel extraction kit, ligated into pBluescript II KS(+), and transferred into E. coli DH5Î±, forming a genomic DNA library. Clones expressing agarase activity were screened out when they functioned to generate clear zones after incubation at 25 Â°C for 48â72 h. Six agarase-producing clones were identified in about 8000 transformants that were named pBA1âpBA6. The inserts of positive clones were subjected to single and double digestion with various restriction endonucleases with their physical maps constructed after agarose gel electrophoresis. The inserts of positive clones ranged from 6.7 to 10.3 kbp in length and shared a common PstI fragment of 6.7 kbp. To localize the boundary of agarase-encoding gene, the 6.7-kbp PstI insert of pBA1 was sequenced and submitted to double digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes resulting in four independent subclones, namely pBAS1âpBAS4. Subclone pBAS4 with a 3.2-kbp BamHI-KpnI DNA fragment was found to possess agarase activity and contain a complete open reading frame. Sequence Analysis and Classification of agaB GeneâSequence analysis of agaB gene was performed using PredictProtein software, ExPASy Server, and SignalP 3.0 Server. Representative sequences of each glycoside hydrolase family were extracted from the Swiss-Prot or GenBankâ¢ sequence data banks or entered manually from the literature. Some of these sequences were edited to separate their multiple constitutive catalytic domains. Sequence comparisons were conducted with BLAST program and the hydrophobic cluster analysis. Expression of Recombinant AgaBâThe agaB gene, including its signal sequence, was PCR-amplified from subclone pBAS4 using the sense primer 5â²-GGAATTCCATATGTTAAAGCGCCACCAAGC-3â² and the antisense primer 5â²-CCGCTCGAGCTATTGGCAAGTATAACCT-3â² containing NdeI and XhoI sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was purified and digested by NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the pET-24a(+) expression vector linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting pET-24a-agaB was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells. The E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the agarase gene (pET-24a-agaB) were grown at 37 Â°C in LB medium containing 30 Î¼g/ml kanamycin sulfate until the cell density reached 0.5 A600. At this point a final concentration of 0.1 mm isopropylthio-Î²-galactopyranoside was added. The cultivation was continued further at 25 Â°C and 250 rpm for 18â24 h. E. coli BL21 (DE3) bearing pET-24a(+) was used as the negative control. Purification of Recombinant AgaBâThe purification of recombinant AgaB was carried out at temperatures below 4 Â°C. Cell and medium were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min. The supernatant was brought to 60% (w/v) saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and centrifuged again. The protein in pellet was dissolved at 4 Â°C overnight, ultra-filtrated, and desalted. The protein was purified further by loading on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and washing with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and eluting with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The elution fractions with agarase activity were then subjected to purification through a phenyl-Sepharose high performance column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 m NaCl. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, and the protein was eluted using 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) directly. Finally, the fractions with agarase activity were loaded on a Superdex75 column (30 Ã 1 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated ahead of use, and the enzyme was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). SDS-PAGE was performed to detect the purified enzyme as described by Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Biochemical Characterization of AgaBâThe optimum temperature of AgaB was determined by monitoring enzymatic activity at temperatures ranging from 10 to 60 Â°C and pH 6.0 for 10 min. The thermostability of AgaB was evaluated by measuring the residual activity of the enzyme after incubation at different temperature for 1 h. The pH dependence of AgaB was assayed at 40 Â°C in a pH range from 5.7 to 7.0. The effect of pH on AgaB stability was determined by measuring its residual activity after incubation at 4 Â°C and various pH values (4.0â10.6) for 1 h. The effects of various metal ions and chelators on AgaB activity were examined by determining the activity in the presence of 1 mm of various ions or chelators. In addition, the substrate speciality of AgaB was detected at 40 Â°C using 0.25% agar, agarose, Îº-carrageenan, Î¹-carrageenan, Î»-carrageenan, alginate, and chitosan as the substrates. Hydrolysis Products Analysis of AgaBâThe dynamics of hydrolysis of agarose (0.25%) with AgaB (0.01 Î¼m) at 40 Â°Cwas traced for up to 24 h. An aliquot of hydrolysis product was taken out at different times and analyzed using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) (37Yu G. Guan H. Ioanoviciu A.S. Sikkander S.A. Thanawiroon C. Tobacman J.K. Toida T. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To identify the structure of final hydrolysis products, oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization (DP) were purified from a hydrolytic mixture of agarose by AgaB. Agarose was fully hydrolyzed, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The concentrated mixture was loaded on a Bio-Gel P6 column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated ahead of use, and eluted with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. The collected fractions were rotary-evaporated repeatedly to eliminate NH4HCO3 and dried under a vacuum. For 13C NMR analysis the purified neoagarooctaose (DP8), neoagarodecaose (DP10), neoagarododecaose (DP12), and neoagarotetradecaose (DP14) (10 mg each) were dissolved in 1 ml of 99.9% D2O and lyophilized. Such operation was repeated three times to replace all exchangeable protons. The spectra were recoded by a JNM-ECP600 (JEOL) spectrometer, with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid as the internal standard. A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum was performed on BiflexIII (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA) operating in positive-ion mode with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoicacid as a matrix. All detected oligosaccharide ions were observed as pseudomolecular ions [M+Na]+ and [M+K]+. Substrate Binding Subsites of AgaBâThe kinetic parameters for oligosaccharides were determined at 25 Â°C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Substrate concentration was varied in the range 5â40 mg/ml, and the reaction products were quantified by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex) as described previously (11Allouch J. Jam M. Helbert W. Barbeyron T. Kloareg B. Henrissat B. Czjzek M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47171-47180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Weinberger F. Richard C. Kloareg B. Kashman Y. Hoppe H.-G. Friedlander M. J. Phycol. 2001; 37: 418-426Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All values were determined in triplicate. The Michaelis constant (Km) and the turnover number (Kcat) were determined by a nonlinear regression program. To determine the smallest substrate of AgaB and the number of substrate binding subsites in its catalytic cleft, a hydrolysis reaction was carried out using 10 mg/ml different oligosaccharides in 10 Î¼l of reaction mixture (pH 6.0). According to the different DP of oligosaccharides, the reaction mixture was adjusted with different concentrations of AgaB and incubated at 25 Â°C for different times. Hydrolysis product was then analyzed using FACE. To determine the direction and location of the substrate in the active site of AgaB, the reducing end of DPs 14, 12, 10, and 8 were fluorescently labeled using monopotassium 7-amino-1,3-naphthalenedisulfonic acid and sodium cyanoborohydride reagents. The labeled products were purified by Sephadex G10 column and then degraded by AgaB. The degradation product was subjected to gradient (18â25%) discontinuous PAGE using a vertical slab gel electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences). 1H NMR Spectroscopy AnalysisâFor 1H NMR spectroscopy analyses, agarose powder (0.5 g) was melted in 50 ml of D2O (containing 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid) and allowed to cool down to 40 Â°C. After recording the spectrum of the substrate, AgaB was added at a final concentration of 2.4 nm. Aliquots were taken out every 10 min for 2 h, then at 18 h after the addition of the enzyme (i.e. when enzymic hydrolysis was complete and the mutarotation equilibrium had been reached) and directly recorded at 60 Â°C with a JNM-ECP600 spectrometer. NMR signals were assigned according to Jam et al. (39Jam M. Flament D. Allouch J. Potin P. Thion L. Kloareg B. Czjzek M. Helbert W. Michel G. Barbeyron T. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and Lahaye (40Lahaye, M. (1986) Agar from Gracilaria sp. Ph.D. thesis, McGill UniversityGoogle Scholar) and based on a COSY (correlation spectroscopy) spectrum of neoagarooligosaccharides. Isolation and Identification of Strain CY24âBased on sole carbon source culture and clearing zone screening on agar plates, 50 agarase-producing bacterial strains were obtained from seawater. Of them, the one (CY24) showing the highest activity was selected for the isolation of agarase-encoding gene. This strain was assigned to the genus Pseudoalteromonas based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics and its 16 S rRNA gene sequence (data not shown) and named as Pseudoalteromonas sp. CY24. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of agaB GeneâAs described under âExperimental Procedures,â the agarase-positive subclone pBAS4 was obtained which contained a single open reading frame, 1437 bp in length. This open reading frame was named agaB gene and deposited in the GenBankâ¢ under accession number AY293310. A putative promoter sequence, 5â²-TTGGCA-3â² for the -35 region and 5â²-TATAGT-3â² for the -10 region, is present 150 bp upstream from the initiation codon with 15-bp spacing. The putative ribosome-binding site, 5â²-AAGGAG-3â², is located 9 bp upstream from the initiation codon ATG. A typical stem loop sequence downstream the stop codon TAG was found as a Ï-independent transcriptional termination site. The predicted product of agaB gene is a protein of 478 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 50.9 kDa. The amino acid residue composition of AgaB is not average. The four amino acids (Ala, Asn, Ser, and Val) account for 41.4%, and the other three (Cys, Met, and Trp) account for only 0.8% of the total. As PredictProtein software predicted, AgaB is a globular protein and has strong solvent accessibility composition. Hydrophobic cluster analysis suggested that a strong helical transmembrane motif located at the region of amino acid 20â38. Using SignalP 3.0 Server predicted that the most probable cleavage site of signal peptide was between Ala38 and Ala39. ExPASy server calculated the molecular mass and isoelectric point of the mature enzyme deduced from its amino acid sequence were 47.2 kDa and 4.83 respectively. Sequence Comparison and Classification of agaB Geneâ BLAST results indicated that the similarity of the deduced amino acid sequence of agaB gene with the existed proteins was very low (E > 0.1). The sequence was further compared by hydrophobic cluster analysis plots because of its established effectiveness in the comparison of widely divergent proteins. However, the hydrophobic cluster analysis result showed that AgaB has no similarity at all with glycoside hydrolases or with carbohydrate binding modules. To test the reliability of our analysis and to possibly detect other agarase sequences sharing similarity with the protein, the signature motifs of families GH 16, 50, and 86 were undertaken, but no consensus signature was found in AgaB. All these findings confirmed that AgaB is not obviously similar to any previously defined glycoside hydrolases. Expression and Purification of AgaBâSubclone pBAS4 carrying agaB gene showed very low extracellular agarase activity. To obtain a sufficient amount of the enzyme, the agaB gene was expressed in the pET24a(+)/E. coli BL21 (DE3) system. The recombinant AgaB was secreted into medium under the control of its own signal peptide. The maximal extracellular production of AgaB was induced by 0.1 mm isopropylthio-Î²-galactopyranoside at 25 Â°C for 18â24 h. The recombinant AgaB was purified 476-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, weak anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The specific activity of 5000 units mg-1 and a final yield of 21.2% were achieved. Approximately 3.4 mg of recombinant enzyme was obtained per liter of culture supernatant. The purified enzyme gave a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 50.4 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This value is in good agreement with the value estimated from the deduced amino acid sequence of mature enzyme. General Properties of AgaBâAgaB was a true agarase. The pure AgaB hydrolyzed agarose but not Îº-carrageenan, Î¹-carrageenan, Î»-carrageenan, alginate, and chitosan. The optimal temperature was found to be 40 Â°C. The activity of AgaB was stable at low temperature and retained more than 90% activity until 35 Â°C. Its optimum pH was 6.0. AgaB was very stable at pH 5.7â10.6, retaining more than 95% activity. AgaB activity was inhibited completely by Hg2+ and slightly by Cu2+, Mn2+, and EDTA. In contrast, Ca2+ and Ba2+ slightly increased the activity. Hydrolysis Product Analysis of Agarose by AgaBâThe hydrolysis of agarose by AgaB was accompanied by a rapid fall in specific viscosity and a marked increase in reducing power. As shown in Fig. 1, in the initial stage the enzyme hydrolyzed agarose to generate oligosaccharides with various DPs. This hydrolysis pattern indicates that this enzyme is an endo-type agarase. After hydrolysis for 24 h, the main products were DPs 8 and 10 with lesser amounts of neoagarotetraose (DP4) and neoagarohexaose (DP6) as identified by FACE. Because of the lack of suitable standards, the main products were purified and identified by mass spectrometry (data not shown) and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The 13C NMR spectra of these hydrolysis products showed the typical pattern of neoagarooligosaccharide. There were evident resonances at about 97 and 93 ppm that are characteristic for the Î² and Î± anomeric forms, respectively, of galactose residues at the reducing end of the neoagarooligosaccharides. There was no evidence of a signal at 90.72 ppm, a finding that could be attributed to hydrolyzed Î±-(1,3) linkages (22Vera J. Alvarez R. Murano E. Slebe J.C. Leon O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4378-4383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lahaye M. Yaphe W. Phan Viet M.T. Rochas C. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 190: 249-265Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All these evidenced that AgaB was a Î²-agarase.FIGURE 2The 13C NMR spectrum of the neoagarooctaose (DP8) purified from the hydrolyzed products of agarose by AgaB.

The kinetic parameters of AgaB on different oligosaccharides were shown in Table 1. DP10 was a very poor substrate with by far the lowest Kcat and considerable Km of all the substrates tested. The Kcat increased with increasing chain length of the substrate, while Km values appeared to be relatively independent of DP. Catalytic efficiency factor Kcat/Km increased sharply (about 26 times) as the DP increased from 10 to 12, whereas it was si"
https://openalex.org/W1983474146,"Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are blue light-activated serine/threonine protein kinases that elicit a variety of photoresponses in plants. Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by two flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding domains, designated LOV1 and LOV2, located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Exposure to light results in the formation of a covalent adduct between the FMN chromophore and a conserved cysteine residue within the LOV domain. LOV2 photoexcitation is essential for phot1 function in Arabidopsis and is necessary to activate phot1 kinase activity through light-induced structural changes within a conserved Î±-helix situated C-terminal to LOV2. Here we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify further amino acid residues that are important for phot1 activation by light. Mutagenesis of bacterially expressed LOV2 and full-length phot1 expressed in insect cells indicates that perturbation of the conserved salt bridge on the surface of LOV2 does not play a role in receptor activation. However, mutation of a conserved glutamine residue (Gln575) within LOV2, reported previously to be required to propagate structural changes at the LOV2 surface, attenuates light-induced autophosphorylation of phot1 expressed in insect cells without compromising FMN binding. These findings, in combination with double mutant analyses, indicate that Gln575 plays an important role in coupling light-driven cysteinyl adduct formation from within LOV2 to structural changes at the LOV2 surface that lead to activation of the C-terminal kinase domain.

Light is critical in shaping the growth and development of plants. The effect of light on plant morphogenesis is mediated through a variety of photoreceptors with specific spectral properties. Genetic analysis using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that the effects of blue (390â500 nm) and UV-A light (320â390 nm) are mediated by at least two classes of blue light receptors, cryptochromes and phototropins (1Christie J.M.

Phototropins function to regulate a range of photoresponses, including phototropism, stomatal opening, and chloroplast movement, all of which serve to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of plants (2Briggs W.R. Christie J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Phototropin activity has also been implicated in regulating extension-growth responses in Arabidopsis such as cotyledon expansion (5Ohgishi M. Saji K. Okada K. Sakai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2223-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), leaf expansion (6Sakamoto K. Briggs W.R.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Phot1 and phot2 are flavoprotein photoreceptors whose protein structure can be divided into two segments as follows: a photosensory domain at the N terminus and a serine/threonine kinase domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal photosensory domain of the phototropins contains a repeated motif of â¼110 amino acids called LOV1 and LOV2, respectively (8Huala E. Oeller P.W. Liscum E. Han I.-S. Larsen E.

Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LOV domains are more closely related to a subset of proteins within the PAS domain superfamily that are regulated by external signals such as light, oxygen, or voltage, hence the acronym LOV (8Huala E. Oeller P.W. Liscum E. Han I.-S. Larsen E. Briggs W.R. Science. 1997; 278: 2121-2123Crossref Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Purification of sufficient quantities of LOV domain-containing proteins expressed in Escherichia coli has greatly facilitated the spectral and structural analysis of these light-sensing motifs. Both LOV1 and LOV2 serve as noncovalent binding sites for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and form a spectral species in darkness, designated LOV447, which absorbs maximally at 447 nm (12Christie J.M.

In each case, irradiation of the domain induces a unique mode of photochemistry that involves the formation of a covalent adduct between the C(4a) carbon of the flavin chromophore and a conserved cysteine residue within the LOV domain (13Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Light-driven FMN-cysteinyl adduct formation occurs in the order of microseconds producing a spectral species (LOV390) that absorbs maximally at 390 nm (13Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U.

Formation of LOV390 is fully reversible in darkness, returning the LOV domain back to its initial ground state (LOV447) within the order of ten to hundreds of seconds (13Salomon M. Christie J.M.

Although both LOV1 and LOV2 exhibit the above-mentioned photochemistry, structure-function studies have demonstrated that LOV2 photoreactivity is essential for phototropin function, whereas LOV1 photoreactivity is not (16Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Kagawa T. Kasahara M. Abe T. Yoshida S. Wada M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, the photochemical reactivity of LOV2 is required for the activation of the C-terminal kinase domain, which results in receptor autophosphorylation (16Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of LOV1 is unclear at present, although size exclusion chromatography (18Salomon M. Lempert U. RÃ¼diger W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in addition to small angle x-ray scattering analysis (19Nakasako M. Iwata T. Matsuoka D. Tokutomi S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14881-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) of purified LOV1 suggests that this domain may play a role in receptor dimerization. Recent structural studies indicate that the predominant role of LOV2 in regulating phototropin kinase activity may stem from its position within the phototropin molecule. Solution NMR spectroscopy has identified a conserved Î±-helix (designated JÎ±), situated C-terminal to LOV2 (Fig. 1A), that functions as a helical connector coupling LOV2 photoexcitation to kinase activation (20Harper S.M. Neil L.C. Gardner K.H. Science. 2003; 301: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). JÎ± docks onto the surface of the LOV2-core in darkness and becomes disordered upon light-induced formation of LOV2390. Moreover, artificial disruption of the LOV2-JÎ± interaction through site-directed mutagenesis results in an activation of phot1 kinase activity in the absence of light (21Harper S.M. Christie J.M. Gardner K.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16184-16192Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), demonstrating that unfolding of JÎ± results in activation of the C-terminal kinase domain. Disruption of the LOV2-JÎ± interaction most likely arises from light-induced protein changes occurring at the surface of the LOV2-core. Crystal structures of two LOV domains from independent phototropin proteins reveal that the LOV domain adopts a typical PAS domain structure comprising five antiparallel Î²-sheets interconnected by two Î±-helices, in which the FMN chromophore is bound within a central hydrophobic pocket (22Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Crosson S. Moffat K.

J. 2003; 84: 2474-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, structural knowledge has provided little information on how the signal generated upon formation of LOV2390 is transmitted to the surface of the domain in order to bring about a disorganization of JÎ± that leads to an activation of phototropin kinase activity. To date, two mechanisms of LOV2 signal transmission have been proposed. First, x-ray crystallography has revealed the presence of a conserved salt bridge at the surface of the LOV domain (22Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Crosson S. Moffat K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Light-driven destabilization of this surface salt bridge has been hypothesized to play a role in coupling LOV domain photoexcitation to phototropin kinase activation (25Crosson S. Rajagopal S. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves a conserved glutamine residue within the LOV domain that interacts with the FMN chromophore via hydrogen bonding (22Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This glutamine has recently been shown to be involved in propagating light-induced protein conformational changes associated with LOV2 protein fragments (26Nozaki D. Iwata T. Ishikawa T. Todo T. Tokutomi S. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8373-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Iwata T. Tokutomi S. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 124: 11840-11841Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that this residue may serve to transmit modifications from within the chromophore-binding pocket to protein changes at the LOV domain surface. In this study, we have employed a mutagenesis approach to clarify the role of the aforementioned regions associated with the LOV2 domain of Arabidopsis phot1 in regulating photoreceptor kinase activation. Here, we show that disruption of the conserved salt bridge does not play a role in LOV2 signal transmission. Rather the conserved surface salt bridge appears to be important for locally stabilizing the tertiary structure of LOV2. By contrast, mutation of the conserved glutamine residue within LOV2 attenuates light-dependent autophosphorylation activity of phot1 expressed in insect cells, indicating that this residue is involved in LOV2 signal transmission. This conclusion is supported by double mutant analyses demonstrating that the conserved glutamine acts between LOV2390 formation and displacement of the JÎ±-helix in the reaction mechanism associated with phot1 receptor activation. Expression and Purification of LOV2 Fusion ProteinsâA DNA fragment encoding the LOV2 domain of Arabidopsis phot1 (residues 448â600) was PCR-amplified using the Arabidopsis PHOT1 cDNA and cloned into the pCAL-n-EK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) via EcoRI and NcoI to create an N-terminal calmodulin-binding peptide fusion. LOV2 protein was expressed and purified by calmodulin affinity chromatography as described previously (12Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Site-directed MutagenesisâSingle amino acid substitutions were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in accordance with the instructions of the supplier. A second round of mutagenesis was performed to generate template sequences containing two amino acid changes. All amino acid changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Spectral AnalysisâFluorescence emission and excitation spectra were recorded using an LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded by monitoring the emission at 520 nm. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained by using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Absorption spectra were measured using a Lambda 45 UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Wild-type and mutant LOV2 proteins were analyzed in the far-UV region in a quartz cuvette of 0.02 cm path length. The average of 8 spectra was collected for each protein at 50 nm/min using a response time of 0.5 s and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Spectra were corrected following subtraction of a buffer blank spectrum, and data were expressed in units of mean residue weight ellipticity, Î¸ (degrees cm2 dmol-1) (28Kelly S.M. Jess T.J.

Phototropin Expression in Insect CellsâThe coding sequence of Arabidopsis PHOT1 was cloned into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHLT-A (BD Biosciences). Recombinant baculovirus encoding either wild-type Arabidopsis PHOT1 or PHOT1 carrying specific amino acid substitutions was generated using the BaculoGoldâ¢ transfection kit (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the instructions of the supplier. Recombinant baculovirus was titered by end point dilution and used to infect Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells. Expression of recombinant phot1 was carried out as described previously (29Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G. Bernasconi P. Reibekas A.A. Liscum E. Briggs W.R.

Phototropin Autophosphorylation and Western Blot AnalysisâSoluble protein extracts were prepared from insect cells as described previously (29Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G. Bernasconi P.

The extent of phot1 autophosphorylation was quantified with a Fujifilm FLA-5000 PhosphorImager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Western blot analysis of soluble protein extracts from insect cells (10 Î¼g) was performed as described (30Sakai T. Kagawa T. Kasahara M. Swartz T.E. Christie J.M. Briggs W.R. Wada M. Okada K. Proc.

Monoclonal anti-His antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution, whereas the purified polyclonal anti-phot1 antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Flavin Release MeasurementsâAll manipulations were carried out under a dim red safe light. For whole insect cells, dark-grown transfected Sf9 cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2HPO4) and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For individual LOV2 domains, purified proteins were incubated overnight in darkness at 4 Â°C to ensure photorecovery of the domain back to its ground state. The FMN chromophore was released from full-length phot1 proteins in insect cells by boiling samples in the presence of phosphorylation buffer (37.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5.3 mm MgSO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 5 min. FMN was released from purified LOV2 domains by boiling in the presence of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol). Boiled samples were then chilled on ice for 5 min and microcentrifuged for an additional 5 min. The supernatant obtained containing released flavin was cleared using a PCR purification column (Qiagen) to remove further protein contaminants. Flavin fluorescence present in the purified supernatant was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Salt Bridge Disruption Results in a Loss of FMN Binding in Isolated LOV2âLOV1 and LOV2 domains of higher plant phototropins contain a conserved salt bridge at the surface of the LOV-core between the Î±B-helix and Î²C-Î²D loop. This ionic interaction exists between amino acid residues Glu506 and Lys547 in the LOV2 domain of Arabidopsis phot1 (Fig. 1B). The crystal structure of the LOV2 domain from the novel red/blue light receptor neochrome (formerly known as phy3) from the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris has revealed that the conserved surface salt bridge is located at the end of a series of conserved amino acids extending from the internal cavity where the primary events of LOV domain photodetection take place (25Crosson S. Rajagopal S. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Light-induced formation of LOV390 within the FMN cavity may therefore be communicated to the surface of the LOV-core through this conserved region of amino acids resulting in destabilization of the salt bridge. Consequently, salt bridge disruption has been proposed to serve as a signal to bring about further conformational changes within the phototropin molecule required to induce receptor autophosphorylation (25Crosson S.

However, there is no evidence available to date that disruption of the salt bridge plays a role in LOV domain signaling associated with phototropin autophosphorylation. Therefore, we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of the conserved salt bridge in regulating phot1 activity. Individual LOV domains expressed and purified from E. coli provide a rapid means to monitor the effects of point mutations on the spectral characteristics and flavin binding properties of the photosensory region. Initially, we examined the effect of disrupting the salt bridge interaction by incorporating the point mutation E506K into the LOV2 domain of Arabidopsis phot1. Incorporation of the E506K mutation into LOV2 was found to result in lower protein yields relative to wild type (data not shown) but produced sufficient quantities upon purification suitable for spectral characterization (Fig. 2A). The native LOV2 domain binds the chromophore FMN showing typical absorbance in both the blue and UV-A regions of the spectrum (Fig. 2A). Mutation of Glu506 to lysine results in a loss of these spectral properties indicating that disruption of the surface salt bridge in isolated LOV2 leads to a loss of chromophore binding. This was further confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2B, the E506K variant of LOV2 exhibits a dramatic loss in fluorescence (>90%) relative to wild type. Mutation of Glu506 to either glutamine or alanine produced similar effects on FMN binding (supplemental Fig. S1). It was important to establish whether loss of flavin binding upon disruption of the surface salt bridge in LOV2 compromised the overall secondary structural integrity of the protein. CD spectroscopy was used to compare the spectrum of the E506K variant with that of wild-type LOV2. No differences in the far-UV CD spectra were observed (Fig. 2C) indicating that replacement of Glu506 with lysine does not affect the overall secondary structure of the protein. Taken together, the above findings suggest that the surface salt bridge located in LOV2 most likely plays an important role in tertiary structural conformation. Consequently, disruption of this ionic interaction, at least in the isolated LOV domain, results in a loss of chromophore binding. E506K Mutation Does Not Affect Phot1 Kinase Activityâ Phototropins are light receptor protein kinases that undergo autophosphorylation in response to blue light excitation (2Briggs W.R.

Photobiol. 2005; 81: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although our attempts to express active phot1 in E. coli have been unsuccessful to date, full-length phot1 can be expressed in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus (16Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 29Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G. Bernasconi P. Reibekas A.A. Liscum E. Briggs W.R.

A. 2001; 98: 6969-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We therefore used the insect cell expression system to examine the effect of the E506K mutation on the autophosphorylation activity of Arabidopsis phot1. Insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, encoding the PHOT1 cDNA from Arabidopsis, were grown in complete darkness and harvested under dim red light. Total protein extracts were isolated and used for in vitro phosphorylation analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, phot1 exhibits basal levels of autophosphorylation activity under dark conditions. Phot1 kinase activity is increased following a brief irradiation with saturating intensities of white light. Replacement of Glu506 in LOV2 with lysine had no effect on light-induced kinase activity of phot1 expressed in insect cells (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding is surprising, given that the photochemical reactivity of LOV2 is necessary for light-induced autophosphorylation of phot1 (16Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and that the equivalent salt bridge mutation in the isolated LOV2 domain results in a substantial loss of chromophore binding (Fig. 2). The lack of an effect of the E506K mutation on phot1 autophosphorylation in insect cells suggests that disruption of the Glu-Lys salt bridge in LOV2 might produce different consequences in the full-length receptor protein versus the isolated LOV domain. We therefore estimated the levels of flavin bound to either wild-type phot1 or the E506K variant expressed in insect cells. Baculovirus-mediated expression of phot1 in insect cells gives rise to high levels of protein (Fig. 3C), but much of the protein produced is insoluble and inactive (29Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G. Bernasconi P. Reibekas A.A. Liscum E. Briggs W.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in accordance with previous findings (29Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G. Bernasconi P. Reibekas A.A. Liscum E. Briggs W.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), insoluble protein extracts from insect cells expressing phot1 are highly fluorescent when viewed under UV light and retain FMN binding as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy relative to control samples not expressing phot1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Indeed, the level of flavin fluorescence released from insect cells infected with wild-type baculovirus is negligible compared with that released from insect cells expressing phot1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, flavin release measurements from whole insect cells provide a rapid and convenient method to assess the effect of the E506K mutation on flavin binding within the full-length photoreceptor context. Insect cells were grown in complete darkness and harvested under dim red light to avoid light-driven LOV390 formation that would result in covalent attachment of the flavin chromophore to the LOV domain of the photoreceptor protein. Flavin levels released from whole cells expressing wild-type phot1 or the E506K mutant were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in contrast to our mutational analysis of the individual LOV2 domain (Fig. 2), substitution of Glu506 to lysine in full-length phot1 resulted in only a marginal reduction (â¼10%) of flavin fluorescence released from whole cell extracts relative to the wild-type control (Fig. 3C). Thus, incorporation of the E506K mutation into full-length phot1 does not appear to alter flavin binding to an extent that impairs the autophosphorylation activity of phot1. These findings also indicate that the E506K mutation can elicit different consequences on flavin binding depending on whether it was examined in the context of full-length phot1 or the individual LOV2 domain. Mutation of Gln575 Alters the Chromophore Environment in Isolated LOV2âThe above findings indicate that the conserved surface salt bridge is not involved in the LOV2 signal transmission pathway that leads to activation of the C-terminal kinase domain.

https://openalex.org/W2107855916,"Egg production is responsible for life cycle progression and host immunopathology during schistosomiasis, with the associated parasite molecules being investigated as potential novel chemotherapeutic targets. Here, we characterize two Schistosoma mansoni products, tyrosinase 1 and tyrosinase 2 (SmTYR1/SmTYR2) and show that their diphenol oxidase enzyme activities are critical for eggshell formation and production. The genes encoding these bifunctional enzymes (monophenol and diphenol oxidases) result from a duplication event that likely occurred before speciation and exist in the parasite's genome as multiple copies, which are linked and localized to chromosomes 4 and W. SmTYR1/SmTYR2 transcription and diphenol oxidase action are developmentally regulated with most enzyme activity localized to the eggshell-producing cells contained within the vitellaria of adult female worms. Importantly, kojic-acid mediated inhibition (IC50=0.5 microM) of SmTYR1/SmTYR2's diphenol oxidase activity during in vitro culture of sexually mature adult worms resulted in a significant decrease in the production of phenotypically normal eggs. Therefore our data suggest that SmTYR1/2 inhibition represents a novel and potentially effective strategy for combating schistosomiasis and furthermore, it may point to new methods for combinatorial control of immunopathology and egg transmission during platyhelminth infection."
https://openalex.org/W2030028916,"We describe an experimental setup using submerged cultures of Arabidopsis seedlings in 96-well microtiter plates that permits chemical intervention of rapid elicitor-mediated immune responses. Screening of a chemical library comprising 120 small molecules with known biological activities revealed four compounds reducing cellulysin- or flg22-activated gene expression of the early pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-responsive ATL2 gene. One chemical, oxytriazine, was found to induce ATL2 gene expression in the absence of PAMP. By monitoring additional flg22-triggered immediate early plant responses, we present evidence that two compounds, triclosan and fluazinam, interfere with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and internalization of the activated plasma membrane resident FLS2 immune receptor. Using triclosan structure types and enzyme activity inhibition assays, Arabidopsis MOD1 enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, a subunit of the fatty-acid synthase type II (FAS II) complex, was identified as a likely cellular target of triclosan. Inhibition of all tested elicitor-triggered early immune responses by triclosan indicates a potential role for signaling lipids in flg22-triggered immunity.

In plants and animals, the first active defense response against microbial invasion is initiated upon the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; FAS II, fatty-acid synthase type II; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; GUS, Î²-glucuronidase. These patterns, also referred to as elicitors, include components of fungal cell walls such as chitin (N-acetyl-chito-oligosaccharide oligomers), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, flagellin, and EF-Tu (1NÃ¼rnberger T.

Genetic and biochemical evidence points to an intimate link between PAMP-triggered immunity and the production of reactive oxygen species, ligand-induced endocytosis of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), protein phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and transcriptional activation of the early response gene (1NÃ¼rnberger T.

ATL2 is a member of the Arabidopsis ATL gene family and has been characterized as an early and transiently activated PAMP-responsive gene (8Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Gutierrez R.A. Ewing R.M. Cherry J.M. Green P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several members of the ATL gene family, each encoding RING-H2 finger domain-containing proteins, are induced by components of fungal cell walls (10Serrano M. Parra S. Alcaraz L.D. Guzman P. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as by bacterium-derived flagellin (4Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Navarro L. Oakeley E.J. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T.

Additionally, a tobacco cell culture expressing the tomato resistance gene Cf9, a member of the ATL tobacco family, designated ACRE-132, was rapidly induced within 30 min upon addition of the Cladosporium fulvum-derived fungal effector Avr9 in the presence of cycloheximide (12Durrant W.E. Rowland O. Piedras P. Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This suggests that ACRE-132 gene activation occurs independent of de novo protein biosynthesis, a typical feature of early PAMP-responsive genes. A mutational approach aimed at the identification of genetic components directing Arabidopsis ATL2 elicitor-responsive gene induction revealed several mutants showing constitutive expression of ATL2 (eca, expression constitutiva de ATL2) but failed to recover nonresponsive mutant plants (13Serrano M. Guzman P. Genetics. 2004; 167: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Traditional forward genetic approaches have been widely used to identify and assign genes from various model organisms to specific biological processes. Major limitations of such mutational approaches are lethal mutations because of essential gene functions, pleiotropic effects caused by multifunctionality of a gene product, and redundant gene functions. Small molecules with inducing or inhibitory activities have the potential to complement mutational approaches for the dissection of biological processes because chemical intervention can be performed in a conditional, dose-dependent, and reversible manner (14Smukste I. Stockwell B.R. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A model organism for plant biology, Arabidopsis thaliana, provides the potential to probe small molecule libraries for compounds acting on cellular targets that are inaccessible to conventional mutational analysis (15Blackwell H.E. Zhao Y. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Few studies have systematically explored the potential of small molecules to interfere with plant-specific processes (16Zhao Y. Dai X. Blackwell H.E. Schreiber S.L. Chory J. Science. 2003; 301: 1107-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Armstrong J.I. Yuan S. Dale J.M. Tanner V.N. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we describe an experimental system that permits chemical manipulation of early PAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis seedlings. By taking advantage of several transgenic lines each carrying a fusion between an early PAMP-responsive promoter and the Î²-glucuronidase reporter gene, we screened a chemical library comprising 120 small molecules with known biological activities. Submerged cultures of Arabidopsis seedlings enabled uniform contact with and controlled exposure of the plants to the elicitors cellulysin or flg22 as well as to the tested compounds. By monitoring Î²-glucuronidase reporter activity histochemically and/or in quantitative fluorimetric assays, we identified compounds that either inhibit or induce early PAMP-responsive genes. The candidate compounds were subsequently tested for their ability to interfere with elicitor-induced reactive oxygen species production and PRR endocytosis. The likely cellular target of one of the inhibitory compounds, enoyl-ACP reductase, was validated by the use of structure variants and enoyl-ACP reductase activity assays. Our results indicate a possible role for signaling lipids in PAMP-triggered immune responses and provide the basis for future screening of natural compound libraries. Plant MaterialâIn this study we used Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying fusions of the following 5â²-regulatory gene sequences to the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene: ATL2 (8Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), WRKY22, WRKY29, and 4CL1 (described below). ATL2p::GUS is expressed in a C-24 background, WRKY22p::GUS and WRKY29p::GUS in Col-0, and 4CL1p::GUS in a Landsberg erecta background. The transgenic Ws-0/FLS2-GFP line used for monitoring FLS2 endocytosis is described by Robatzek et al. (6Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). GUS Reporter Constructsâ1.8 and 1.9 kb of the 5â² upstream region (relative to the ATG start codon) of the AtWRKY22 (At4g01250) and AtWRKY29 (At4g23550) locus, respectively, were PCR-amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using Gateway suitable primers, 5â²-TTACCTACATGTGCTTTGCTGTTGC-3â² and 5â²-ATCGTCGGCCATTGAATTTGGTTAC-3â² (AtWRKY22) and 5â²-TACTCACAGAAGTCAATAAGCGCG-3â² and 5â²-CGACTATTGCTTCTAGGTCTCCTTC-3â² (AtWRKY29), and cloned into the binary pJAWOHL11-GW-GUS vector resulting in a translational fusion with the uidA gene. 1 kb of the 5â² upstream region of the At4CL1 (At1g51680) locus (19Ehlting J. BÃ¼ttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from genomic Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using the following primers: B11F, 5â²-ATTAACTGCAGACACTTTTAGCCCATAACTTTC-3â², and B11R, 5â²-CTTGTGGCGCCATGGTAAATAGTAAATATTGTG-3â². Primer B11F contained a 5â² PstI restriction sequence, and primer B11R, spanning the ATG codon of the 4CL1 gene, contained one mismatch to the sequence of the At4CL1 gene to generate an NcoI restriction site. For fusion to the uidA gene, the PCR product was digested with PstI and NcoI and ligated with PstI/NcoI-digested vector pBT10-TATA-GUS (20Sprenger-Haussels M. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 2000; 22: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from which the promoter::GUS cassette was excised with the restriction enzymes ClaI and SacI and inserted into the binary vector pGPTV-Kan (21Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 20: 1195-1197Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Transformations were performed by the dip floral method (22Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected by kanamycin resistance. Growth Conditions and Compound Screening ProcedureâThe small molecule library was provided by SYNGENTA Corp. Surface-sterilized seeds were stratified for 4 days at 4 Â°C. Seedlings were grown for 7 days in 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC) containing â¼2-4 seeds per well in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium and 0.25% sucrose. The microtiter plates were incubated at 24 Â°C with continuous shaking at 100 rpm in a growth chamber (Percival AR-75L) under 16/8 light/dark conditions. After 7 days, the medium was removed by a multichannel pipette (Matrix) and replaced by MS medium containing 10 ppm of each compound dissolved in Me2SO and incubated for 120 min. At the end of the preincubation time, seedlings were treated for 120 min using MS medium or MS medium containing 100 mg/ml cellulysin (Calbiochem) as described previously (8Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FLS2-dependent immune responses were induced using MS medium containing 1 Î¼m flg22 peptide. GUS Expression AssayâHistochemical and fluorometric assays were performed as described (23Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). Samples were mounted on microscope slides using 50% glycerol and inspected with a Leica MZFLIII stereomicroscope. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Oxidative Burst AssayâProduction of reactive oxygen species was assayed by H2O2-dependent luminescence of luminol (24Keppler L.D. Baker C.J. Atkinson M.M. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 974-978Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, Arabidopsis leaf pieces (â¼1 mm) were floated overnight in water, incubated in a solution containing 1% Me2SO and 10 ppm compound for 30 min in the presence of luminol and peroxidase, and elicited with 1 Î¼m flg22. Luminescence emission was measured in a luminometer (top count NXT; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). flg22-induced Endocytosis AssayâWe analyzed flg22-induced endocytosis as described previously (6Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Briefly, detached leaves of Ws-0/FLS2-GFP transgenic seedlings grown under sterile conditions were preincubated in a solution containing 1% Me2SO for 30 min. After adding the tested compounds at 10 ppm for 30 min, endocytosis was triggered by supplying the solution with 10 Î¼m flg22 for 30 min. Microscopy was performed using the confocal laser microscope Leica TCS SP2 with a Ã63 oil objective and Ã4 zoom. Enoyl-ACP Reductase Activity AssayâEnoyl-ACP reductase activity was measured as described previously (25Slabas A.R. Sidebottom C.M. Hellyer A. Kessell R.M.J. Tombs M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 271-280Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted from ground seedlings using 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 9.0) and 1 mm dithioerythritol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). 50 Î¼g of protein was dissolved in the reaction buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.2) and 140 Î¼m NADH). Enoyl-ACP reductase activity was monitored by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm because of oxidation of NADH at room temperature (22 Â°C). 120 Î¼m crotonoyl-CoA (Sigma) was used as substrate, whereas the endogenous NADH oxidation was measured in the absence of crotonoyl-CoA. The reaction was initiated after addition of substrate and was continuously monitored for 15 min. Structurally Diverse Small Molecules Interfere with Early PAMP-responsive Gene ExpressionâWe used a chemical library comprising 120 small molecules with known biological activities (supplemental Table 1) to identify candidate compounds that modified elicitor-responsive gene expression. We established a compound screening procedure using 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in submerged culture in 96-well microtiter plates to monitor transcriptional activation of early PAMP-responsive genes (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Such genes typically encode transcripts, which transiently increase in abundance within minutes upon PAMP treatment (11Navarro L. Zipfel C. Rowland O. Keller I. Robatzek S. Boller T. Jones J.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We used a transgenic line carrying a fusion of the early PAMP-response gene ATL2 promoter to the Î²-glucuronidase reporter gene (ATL2p::GUS; see Ref. 13Serrano M. Guzman P. Genetics. 2004; 167: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although constitutive ATL2 gene expression is mainly confined to leaf primordia and the leaf vasculature, treatment with the fungus-derived proteinaceous cellulysin elicitor (8Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) resulted in visible GUS expression within 2 h disseminating throughout the seedlings, which corresponds to an â¼4-fold GUS activity increase in total seedling extracts (Fig. 1A). Only 1 of the 120 compounds tested, oxytriazine, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, was capable of simulating cellulysin-mediated reporter gene expression (Fig. 1, A and B), which might be because of an agonist-like oxytriazine activity, spurious ATL2 reporter gene activation via a PAMP-independent signaling pathway, or inhibition of a repressor blocking constitutive ATL2 induction in the authentic cellulysin-triggered signaling pathway. Simultaneous treatment of the seedlings with oxytriazine and cellulysin did not increase GUS reporter gene expression above the level seen with either compound alone. In time course experiments, a more rapid reporter gene activation was detected upon treatment with the cellulysin elicitor than with oxytriazine (induction detectable within 30 and 120 min, respectively; see supplemental Fig. 1). Together this is consistent with the idea that oxytriazine either inhibits a repressor or induces a component of the authentic PAMP-triggered signaling pathway (Fig. 1, A and B). We identified four compounds that inhibited cellulysin-triggered GUS reporter activity either strongly (â¼70%; triclosan) or more moderately (â¼50%; fluazinam, cantharidin, and fenpiclonil) (Fig. 1, A and B). Exposure of the seedlings to varying concentrations of these small molecules revealed a dose-dependent mode of action between 0.1 and 20 ppm (supplemental Fig. 2). Because histochemically detectable GUS reporter activities in leaf primordia were essentially indistinguishable in the absence or presence of each of these four compounds (Fig. 1A), their effect is likely to reflect inhibition of GUS reporter gene activation rather than constitutive GUS reporter gene transcription or GUS enzyme activity modification. Consistent with this, reverse transcription-PCR experiments using seedling-derived RNA revealed a significant reduction of cellulysin-stimulated ATL2 endogene expression upon treatment with each of the compounds (supplemental Fig. 3). Time course experiments showed different inhibition tendency suggesting a more complex mode of action (supplemental Fig. 1). Although a 2-h preincubation period of the seedlings with triclosan and the subsequent addition of cellulysin resulted in maximal and sustained inhibition of reporter gene activity within 30 min, both cantharidin and fenpiclonil permitted additional slight increases of reporter gene activity even 120 min after elicitor addition. Moreover, in the presence of triclosan, fluazinam, or fenpiclonil, basal GUS reporter activity remained unaffected within the 2-h preincubation period, and cantharidin significantly stimulated reporter activity in the absence of cellulysin (120-min time point; supplemental Fig. 1). This might indicate the existence of multiple cellular cantharadin targets exerting opposite effects on constitutive and PAMP-induced ATL2 gene expression, respectively. Taken together, of the four candidate inhibitors identified, only triclosan, fluazinam, and fenpiclonil appeared to specifically interfere with cellulysin-triggered ATL2 gene expression. When the ATL2p::GUS-expressing seedlings were treated with flg22, a 22-mer peptide derived from the bacterial motor protein (26Gomez-Gomez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), we observed a similar 4-fold reporter gene induction in comparison with cellulysin treatment (Fig. 1B). Each of the five compounds affecting cellulysin-stimulated ATL2 reporter gene activity also interfered with flg22-induced reporter gene activation in an essentially identical manner (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these small molecules alter the activity of common PAMP-triggered signaling events shared between the two sequence-unrelated elicitors. To determine whether the identified five compounds affect the induction of early PAMP-responsive genes other than ATL2, we tested additional GUS reporter lines. The triclosan and fluazinam inhibitors of cellulysin-stimulated ATL2p::GUS reporter activity affected in a comparable manner reporter gene activation in WRKY22p::GUS and WRKY29p::GUS transgenic lines (â¼60 and 80%, respectively; Fig. 1C). However, fenpiclonil and cantharidin did not significantly reduce reporter gene expression in WRKY22p::GUS and WRKY29p::GUS lines, respectively (Fig. 1C). The WRKY22 and WRKY29 promoters are derived from genes encoding pathogen-responsive WRKY transcription factors (27Eulgem T. Rushton P.J. Robatzek S. Somssich I.E. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 199-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 28Ulker B. Somssich I.E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Oxytriazine failed to induce the reporter gene in both WRKY22p::GUS and WRKY29p:: GUS transgenic lines (Fig. 1C). In 4CL1p::GUS containing transgenic lines only, fenpiclonil significantly suppressed cellulysin-induced reporter gene activity (Fig. 1D). Thus, elicitor-triggered 4CL1p::GUS expression might occur independently of triclosan, fluazinam, and cantharidin targets. Interestingly, oxytriazine treatment also induces 4CL1p::GUS induction (Fig. 1D), suggesting that its target(s) is shared between 4CL1 and ATL2. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for the existence of both common and distinct components that are recruited for early PAMP-responsive gene activation at different promoters. Chemical Intervention of flg22-dependent Oxidative BurstâThe production of reactive oxygen species (âoxidative burstâ) is a typical early response of plant cells to elicitor treatment (29Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). We assayed the well characterized flg22-induced FLS2-dependent oxidative burst (26Gomez-Gomez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) in leaf tissue in the presence and absence of the identified small molecules to gain further insights in their potential mode of action on immediate early elicitor responses (luminescence assay; see âExperimental Proceduresâ). None of the five compounds, including the inducer oxytriazine, provoked an oxidative burst in the absence of flg22 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the flg22-triggered transient oxidative burst was enhanced in the presence of oxytriazine. Thus, oxytriazine can itself induce early PAMP-responsive gene expression but cannot trigger the production of reactive oxygen species. In addition, although its effect leads to a further increase of the elicitor-induced oxidative burst, this is not the case for early PAMP-responsive gene expression (compare Figs. 1B and 2). Triclosan, the most potent inhibitor of early PAMP-responsive gene expression, also inhibited the flg22-dependent oxidative burst most strongly (about 90% inhibition; Fig. 2). Tested triclosan structure types exerted similar effects (see below and supplemental Fig. 4). Likewise, fluazinam strongly inhibited the production of flg22-stimulated reactive oxygen species, but in the presence of fenpiclonil, the oxidative burst was hardly affected. Interestingly, cantharidin, which appears to exert opposite effects on constitutive and PAMP-induced ATL2 gene expression, mediated a sustained rather than transient production of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2). These complex cantharidin-mediated changes on both the flg22-dependent oxidative burst and PAMP-responsive gene expression are consistent with the presumed multiple cellular targets for this known phosphatase inhibitor and indicate that phosphatase function may be necessary for the transient behavior of the flg22-triggered oxidative burst. Inhibition of flg22-mediated FLS2 EndocytosisâRecently, flg22-induced endocytosis of its cognate receptor kinase FLS2 has been reported (6Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We addressed potential effects of the identified small molecules on PAMP receptors by monitoring FLS2 expression, subcellular localization, and flg22-triggered FLS2 activation. The latter can be assayed indirectly by flg22-dependent receptor internalization via endocytosis. Arabidopsis Ws-0 leaves, stably expressing the FLS2-GFP fusion protein (6Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), were elicited with flg22 after preincubation with the compounds, and FLS2-GFP endocytosis was observed by confocal microscopy. In the absence of flg22, none of the chemicals, including the inducer oxytriazine, led to changes in FLS2-GFP expression levels or subcellular localization within a pretreatment period of 30 min (Fig. 3). Thus, neither induction by oxytriazine nor chemical suppression of flg22-responsive gene expression by triclosan, fluazinam, cantharidin, and fenpiclonil is because of mis-localization, mis-expression, or degradation of the FLS2 receptor. Interestingly, the inducer oxytriazine was not capable of triggering FLS2 endocytosis. This suggests that oxytriazine bypasses PAMP receptor activation to elicit PAMP-responsive gene expression (see âDiscussionâ). Consistent with this, flg22-mediated endocytosis of FLS2-GFP was retained in the presence of oxytriazine (Fig. 3). In contrast, flg22-mediated FLS2 endocytosis was clearly affected in the presence of the inhibitors triclosan, fluazinam, and cantharidin (Fig. 3, lower panel). FLS2 endocytosis was retained in the presence of fenpiclonil (Fig. 3, lower panel) but was significantly affected upon longer preincubation times (1.5 h; data not shown). Although the appearance of FLS2-GFP-containing âbudsâ at the cell membrane was still detectable in the presence of all the compounds, subsequent steps of endocytosis, such as vesicle âpinching offâ and mobile FLS2-GFP vesicle trafficking, were severely reduced (Fig. 3). Chemical Interference of FAS II Leads to Inhibition of Early PAMP-responsive Gene ExpressionâFatty acid biosynthesis is an essential metabolic pathway and involves mainly two enzyme complexes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, and the fatty-acid synthase complex (FAS), catalyzing de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids using malonyl-CoA as the elongator by sequential addition of 2-carbon units to the growing acyl chain (30Poghosyan Z.P. Giannoulia K. Katinakis P. Murphy D.J. Hatzopoulos P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In plants, the fatty-acid synthase complex is termed FAS II and consists of eight dissociable polypeptides, each with separate enzymatic activities (Fig. 4A). In Escherichia coli, triclosan targets the fabI gene product, a rate-limiting subunit of the FAS II complex, the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase catalyzing the final reduction of the chain elongation cycle (31McMurry L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S.B. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Plant enoyl-ACP reductase can functionally replace its counterpart within the bacterial complex as shown by genetic complementation (32Kater M.M. Koningstein G.M. Nijkamp H.J. Stuitje A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis enoyl-ACP reductase is encoded by MOD1 and a point mutation in mod1-1 was shown to lead to decreased enzymatic activity, growth, and developmental aberrations as well as spontaneous cell death (33Mou Z. He Y. Dai Y. Liu X. Li J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if MOD1 is the target of triclosan in Arabidopsis, then other known inhibitors of FAS II or the ACCase complex should exert similar effects on PAMP-triggered ATL2p::GUS reporter gene expression. However, we failed to inhibit ACCase activity in planta using the well characterized inhibitors dichlorofopmethyl, fluazifop acid, or tralkoxidim (Fig. 4B). This might be explained by the selectivity of these inhibitors against the homomeric ACCase form present in monocotyledonous plants, whereas Arabidopsis contains a heteromeric ACCase complex (34Sasaki Y. Nagano Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Unlike this, when we targeted FAS II complex components other than enoyl-ACP reductase"

We combined gene context, similarity of enzymatic mechanisms, and molecular weight comparisons with known proteins to select candidate genes for these three orphan proteins. We used a wastewater metagenomic collection of sequences to find and characterize the missing genes of the lysine fermentation pathway. After recombinant protein production and purification following cloning in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that these genes (named kdd, kce, and kal) encode a l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, a 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme, and a 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase, respectively. Because all of the genes of the pathway are now identified, we used this breakthrough to detect lysine-fermenting bacteria in sequenced genomes. We identified twelve bacteria that possess these genes and thus are expected to ferment lysine, and their gene organization is discussed.

Because all of the genes of the pathway are now identified, we used this breakthrough to detect lysine-fermenting bacteria in sequenced genomes. We identified twelve bacteria that possess these genes and thus are expected to ferment lysine, and their gene organization is discussed. In the early 1950s, it was demonstrated that lysine was decomposed to acetate, butyrate, and ammonia by Clostridium sticklandii (1Stadtman T. White F. J. Bacteriol. 1954; 67: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by two strains of Escherichia coli, which ferment lysine together when both are incubated with the substrate (2Dohner P.M. Cardon B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1954; 67: 608-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This catabolic pathway comprises ten distinctive reactions (see Fig. 1). The first two steps are catalyzed by lysine-2,3-aminomutase and Î²-lysine-5,6-aminomutase. Both enzymes have been biochemically characterized (3Stadtman T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1973; 38: 413-448Google Scholar), and their corresponding genes have been identified (4Ruzicka F.J. Lieder K.W. Frey P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Chang C.H. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The second intermediate in the fermentation pathway, l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate, undergoes an oxidative deamination leading to 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate (KAH) 4The abbreviations used are: KAH, 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate; DAH, dl-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate; CoA, coenzyme A. (see Fig. 2, reaction 1). Baker et al. (6Baker J.J. Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7724-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have purified and characterized a NAD-dependent l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.11) from extracts of Clostridium SB4. Two years later, Baker and van der Drift (7Baker J.J. van der Drift C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) identified the 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase in C. sticklandii. This dehydrogenase has also been characterized from Brevibacterium L5, an obligate aerobe (8Hong S.L. Barker H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 231-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hong S.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 41-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (10Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this enzyme has been characterized from several different bacteria, no gene has been assigned to the protein. The 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate is further converted into 3-aminobutyryl-CoA and acetoacetate in the presence of acetyl-CoA (see Fig. 2, reaction 2). This reaction presents a new type of Î²-ketoacid cleavage and acetoacetate synthesis by a yet unknown mechanism. This type of Î²-ketoacid-degrading enzyme, named 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme, has been characterized from Clostridium SB4 (11Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and F. nucleatum (10Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two obligate anaerobes, and from Brevibacterium L5 (9Hong S.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 41-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three enzymes are quite similar but not identical in terms of substrate specificity, inhibitors, and activation. Again, no gene coding for this protein has been determined. In the next step, 3-aminobutyryl-CoA is deaminated to crotonyl-CoA (see Fig. 2, reaction 3). The ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.14), which catalyzes the reaction, has been purified from Clostridium SB4, and some of its properties have been determined (13Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6578-6584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for the ammonia lyase has not been identified so far. Crotonyl-CoA is then reduced to butyryl-CoA, which reacts with acetoacetate to form butyrate and acetoacetyl-CoA. The latter compound is converted to acetate via acetyl-CoA and acetyl phosphate. All of the genes involved in these steps are known. In recently sequenced bacterial genomes (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, Symbiobacterium thermophilum, and F. nucleatum), the two aminomutases characteristic of the lysine fermentation pathway have been identified (accession numbers in UniProt are Q7MVJ1, Q7MVI8, Q7MVI7, Q8RBT6, Q8RBT3, Q8RBT2, Q67TH3, Q67TH1, Q67TH0, Q8RHX4, Q8RHX7, and Q8RHX8). Of these bacteria, only F. nucleatum has been described to ferment lysine under anaerobic conditions (10Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Loesche W.J. Gibbons R.J. Arch. Oral. Biol. 1968; 13: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in all of these genomes but one, S. thermophilum, genes encoding the proteins known to be involved in lysine fermentation (the two aminomutases and the butyrate:acetoacetate CoA-transferase in Fig. 1) appear in a cluster along with a series of other co-localizing genes. Some are annotated as putative or hypothetical proteins. We therefore examined the possibility that some of these genes could correspond to the missing ones coding for the 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, the 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme, and the 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase, named Kdd, Kce, and Kal, respectively. In this paper, we have described the method of identification of these three genes, the expression of the corresponding proteins, and the biochemical characterization of the enzyme activities. ChemicalsâAll chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Reagents for molecularbiology were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were from Sigma Genosys. Proteinase inhibitor Pefabloc SC was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. dl-Erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate (DAH) was synthesized by Orga-Link. The purity of the product was checked by 1H-NMR in Me2SO-d6. KAH was prepared by enzymatic conversion of DAH. KAH was produced using 50 Î¼g of Kdd, 22 mm DAH, and 4 mm NADP+ in 1 ml of activity buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) according to Fig. 2, reaction 1. Once equilibrium was reached (as indicated by NADP+ reduction kinetics), the reaction was stopped. As KAH concentration could not be determined directly, it was estimated by assaying both NADPH and NH4+, assuming that KAH was not altered by trifluoroacetic acid treatment (no degradation was observed with oxaloacetate, another Î²-ketoacid). Construction of the Expression VectorsâThe coding sequences of kdd, kce, and kal were amplified by PCR with the following primers: kdd, forward, 5â²-CACCATGcatcatcaccatcaccatAAGCAATTATGGCTCGATA-3â² and reverse, 5â²-CTAGGGTAATTGATGCCTTACATA-3â²; kce, forward, 5â²-ATGcatcatcaccatcaccatGAACCCTTAATTTTAACTGCTGC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-TTATTTATTTAATGCCAAAATCTCTCTTGC-3â²; and kal, forward, 5â²-ATGcatcatcaccatcaccatGAACTATCGGGTGATGTC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-TCAAACCTCCTTCCGGACG-3â². The forward primers introduced a hexahistidine sequence in the proteins after the initial methionine for purification purposes. The amplified sequence of kdd was inserted into the Invitrogen pET101/D-TOPO vector by directional cloning according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified sequences of kce and kal were inserted into Invitrogen pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector. The sequences of the resulting plasmids, named pET101-kdd, pCRT7-kce and pCRT7-kal, respectively, were verified. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant ProteinsâThe same expression/purification protocol was set up for the three proteins. For each construction, the modified pET101 or pCRT7 was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown in 0.5 liter of Terrific Broth medium containing 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm betaine, and 100 Î¼g/ml carbenicillin at 37 Â°C until reaching an A600 of 2. Isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 500 Î¼m to induce protein production, and the cells were further grown at 20 Â°C overnight. After centrifugation, the cells were washed and suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 1 mm Pefabloc SC and 22 Î¼l of Lysonaseâ¢ bioprocessing reagent (Novagen) and sonicated using an Ultrasonic processor. After centrifugation, to clarify the cell extract, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences) using an Ãkta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences). After sample loading, the column was washed with lysis buffer and the protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Removal of imidazole and buffer exchange was carried out using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and a mobile phase composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was further purified by ion exchange using a MonoQ 5/50 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1 m over 100 column volumes. Finally, the protein was submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was stored at â80 Â°C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Invitrogen NuPAGE system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analytical MethodsâNADH and NADPH were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 mâ1 cmâ1. Acetoacetate was determined according to Williamson et al. (15Williamson D.H. Mellanby J. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1962; 82: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA was quantified according to Moriyama and Srere (16Moriyama T. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3217-3223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NH4+ was estimated with glutamate dehydrogenase at pH 8.1 in the presence of 10 mm 2-ketoglutarate and 100 Î¼m ADP (17Bailey J. Bell E.T. Bell J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5579-5583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic reactions were stopped by trifluoroacetic acid and neutralized by K2CO3 5 m. Enzyme Assaysâdl-Erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase activity was assayed in the presence of DAH and NAD+ or NADP+ as co-factors by monitoring the formation of the resulting reduced pyridine nucleotide. Reactions were usually performed in 100 Î¼l of activity buffer containing co-factor. The reaction was initiated by the addition of DAH. Experiments assaying the stoichiometry of the Kdd reaction were conducted in 700 Î¼l of activity buffer containing 36 Î¼g of Kdd, 22 mm DAH, and 1 mm NAD+. After 20 min of incubation, the A340 was recorded. The enzymatic reaction was stopped and NH4+ assayed. 3-Keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme activity was determined in activity buffer by assaying acetoacetate formation. Various amounts of Kce were incubated in the KAH solution along with 300 Î¼m acetyl-CoA. In each experiment, Kce was allowed to react for 0, 5, and 10 min. Acetoacetate formation rate was linear with time up to 10 min. 3-Aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase activity was assayed according to Jeng and Barker (13Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6578-6584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity was monitored for the reverse reaction using crotonyl-CoA as the substrate. The assay was based on the decrease in A263 upon crotonyl-CoA amination. Enzyme activity was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6700 mâ1 cmâ1. Standard reactions were performed in 100 Î¼l of activity buffer containing 0.5 m NH4Cl, 100 Î¼m crotonyl-CoA, and 11 ng of Kal. The monitoring of the coupled assay involving Kdd, Kce, and Kal was conducted using 15 Î¼g of Kdd, 60 Î¼g of Kce, 30 Î¼g of Kal, 2.2 mm DAH, and 300 Î¼m acetyl-CoA in 1 ml of activity buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 300 Î¼m NADP+. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined at equilibrium. NADPH, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetate, and NH4+ were quantified. All enzymatic reactions were performed at 25 Â°C in a Safas UV mc2 or a Lambda 650 PerkinElmer Life Sciences double beam spectrophotometer. Sequence AnalysisâThe genome sequence of F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum American Type Culture Collection 25586 and the corresponding annotations were extracted from the NCBI data bank (NC_003454). The F. nucleatum genes were compared with the complete sequenced genomes (NCBI, RefSeq section, 354 genomes) and those available as a draft (NCBI, WGS section, 263 genomes) using the BLAST2 algorithm (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Putative orthologous relationships between the two genomes were defined as gene couples satisfying the bidirectional best hit criterion and an alignment threshold of 30% sequence identity on 80% of the length of the smallest protein. Proteins present in E. coli K12 were detected using the same rules. Synteny groups, i.e. conservation of the chromosomal co-localization between pairs of orthologous genes from different genomes, were computed as previously described (19Vallenet D. Labarre L. Rouy Z. Barbe V. Bocs S. Cruveiller S. Lajus A. Pascal G. Scarpelli C. Medigue C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The data (i.e. syntactic and functional annotations and results of comparative analysis) were stored in a relational data base and explored by using the graphical interface of our microbial genome annotation system, MaGe (19Vallenet D. Labarre L. Rouy Z. Barbe V. Bocs S. Cruveiller S. Lajus A. Pascal G. Scarpelli C. Medigue C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This data base is publicly available. The phylogenetic profile method was used to find gene candidates. This method, combined with the integration of synteny results, allows one to detect co-evolution of gene groups that have a similar chromosomal organization. For gene cluster organization analysis, the F. nucleatum genes were compared with the complete sequenced genomes and those available as a draft using the Smith and Waterman algorithm (20Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7200) Google Scholar). Only alignments sharing >40% identity over 80% of the length of the shortest sequence were retained. On some occasions, proteins were retained with a lower percentage of identity when the gene context was conserved. Searching for Candidate GenesâThe 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase characterized from different bacteria has been described to possess a molecular weight of â¼37 kDa/subunit and catalyzes the reaction using NAD+ as a co-factor (6Baker J.J. Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7724-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the 29 dehydrogenases found in the genome of F. nucleatum, six had a molecular weight in the expected range. Interestingly, one (FN1867) is located next to the lysine-2,3-aminomutase. This co-localization is also found in three sequenced bacterial genomes that are potential lysine fermenters (P. gingivalis, T. tengcongensis, and S. thermophilum). Therefore, FN1867 appeared as the most promising candidate. The molecular weight of the subunit of the 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme was described to be â¼30 kDa (12Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the enzyme reacts with acetyl-CoA, but the mechanism is unknown. Thus, one can suppose that the enzyme is annotated as a hypothetical protein. As a strategy to find a candidate gene, we searched for proteins present in F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, T. tengcongensis, and S. thermophilum but absent in the non-lysine-fermenting strain E. coli K12. Of the resulting 37 candidates, only FN1868 was annotated as a hypothetical protein and had the expected molecular weight. Strikingly, the corresponding gene is located next to the gene of the hypothetical 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase in F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. tengcongensis. These facts supported FN1868 as a candidate. The next step in the lysine fermentation pathway is catalyzed by a 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase. Considering our preliminary results, it seems likely that the genes of lysine fermentation are co-localized in F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. tengcongensis. Therefore, FN1869, annotated as a hypothetical protein and located upstream from the gene encoding the hypothetical ketoacid cleavage enzyme, might be a candidate for the 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase. We hypothesize that the mechanism of this reaction is similar to that of the Î²-alanyl-CoA ammonia lyase (21Herrmann G. Selmer T. Jessen H.J. Gokarn R.R. Selifonova O. Gort S.J. Buckel W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of FN1869 and the protein Acl1 encoding the Î²-alanyl-CoA ammonia lyase showed 44.6% identity. Therefore, FN1869 was chosen as the best candidate for encoding enzymatic activity. The aim of this work was not only to identify and characterize the unknown genes in this pathway but also to check the feasibility of such a project on a metagenomic gene resource. By comparing the amino acid sequences of the three candidate genes found in F. nucleatum to our collection of end clone sequences from the anaerobic digester of a municipal wastewater treatment station (22Chouari R. Le Paslier D. Dauga C. Daegelen P. Weissenbach J. Sghir A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 2145-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we detected homologs for each of the three genes. These homologs share 53.3, 50.4, and 65.4% amino acid identity with FN1867, FN1868, and FN1869, respectively, over the whole length of the protein sequence. These homologs were the sequences actually used for the experimental work described here, and named kdd for the 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase gene, kce for the 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme gene, and kal for the 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase gene, respectively. Expression and Purification of the Enzymes Involved in Lysine FermentationâSorbitol and betaine were added in the culture medium to improve the yield of soluble and properly folded recombinant protein. The resulting osmotic stress caused by sorbitol facilitates the uptake of the âcompatible soluteâ glycyl betaine (23Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, up to 40 mg of pure protein could be obtained per liter of culture. The molecular masses of the purified proteins, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were â¼40 kDa for Kdd, 30 kDa for Kce, and 17 kDa for Kal (not shown). These masses were consistent with the calculated molecular weights of 39,102, 31,044, and 15,647 Da, respectively. According to gel filtration experiments, Kdd, Kce, and Kal are functional as a homodimer, a homotetramer, and a homohexamer, respectively. Enzymatic Characterization of Kdd ActivityâKdd was tested as the putative candidate for the oxidative deamination of DAH. First, the kinetic constant of Kdd for two pyridine nucleotides (NAD+ and NADP+) was evaluated. The assays were performed by varying NAD+ or NADP+ concentration at a saturating concentration of DAH and determining the initial rates of reaction for each co-factor. In a second set of experiments, the kinetic constant of Kdd for DAH was determined in the presence of NAD+ or NADP+. The co-factor concentrations were kept constant while varying the DAH concentration. The kinetic parameters were obtained from duplicate experiments by non-linear analysis of initial rates using SigmaPlot version 9.0 (Systat Software, Inc.). Results are presented in Table 1. The calculated Km values are probably apparent ones, because the DAH used in this study is estimated to be only 75% pure. The remaining â¼25% are in threo conformation, which is known to inhibit l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase (9Hong S.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 41-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baker J.J. Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7724-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, d-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate has been described to be a non-competitive inhibitor of the reaction in Clostridium SB4 (6Baker J.J. Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7724-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a competitive inhibitor in C. sticklandii (7Baker J.J. van der Drift C.

The DAH concentrations reported in this study were corrected for the threo contribution.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of DL-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, and 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyaseEnzymeSubstrateVmaxKmVmax/KmnmolÂ·min-1Â·Î¼g-1m-1Â·nmolÂ·min-1Â·Î¼g-1NAD+aDAH concentration was 15 mm.5.4 Â± 0.216.5 Â± 0.9 (mm)327 Â± 32NADP+bDAH concentration was 0.75 mm.4.3 Â± 0.159.3 Â± 7.5 (Î¼m)7.3 Â± 1.2 104KddDAHcNAD+ concentration was 30 mm.4.1 Â± 0.23.2 Â± 0.4 (mm)1.3 Â± 0.3 103DAHdNADP+ concentration was 1 mm.4.5 Â± 0.1197.8 Â± 13.1 (Î¼m)2.3 Â± 0.2 104KalCrotonyl-CoA150.9 Â± 8.455.2 Â± 7.8 (Î¼m)2.7 Â± 0.6 106a DAH concentration was 15 mm.b DAH concentration was 0.75 mm.c NAD+ concentration was 30 mm.d NADP+ concentration was 1 mm. Open table in a new tab Results show that Kdd has dl-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase activity with both NAD+ and NADP+ (Table 1). Although the enzymes from Clostridium SB4 and Brevibacterium L5 are rather NAD+-specific (9Hong S.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 41-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rimerman E.A. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6151-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Kdd is 223 times more efficient (as indicated by the ratios between Vmax/Km NADP+ and Vmax/Km NAD+) with NADP+. This difference is mainly explained by the far lower value of the Km. Results also show that the nature of the co-factor affects the Km of the enzyme for its substrate. In the presence of NADP+, the Km value for DAH is lowered 16-fold compared with that obtained with NAD+. Experiments performed in the presence of NAD+ were linear with a time up to 20 min, whereas those conducted in the presence of NADP+ were only linear up to 90 s. This lack of linearity could be easily explained by a strong product inhibition (NADPH). Control experiments indicated that the initial rate of the reaction was 65% inhibited by the addition of 100 Î¼m NADPH (data not shown). A quantitative estimation of substrate utilization and product formation by purified Kdd was conducted to further confirm the nature of the enzymatic reaction observed. Results in Table 2 (experiment I) show that for 1 mol of NADH formed, 1 mol of NH4+ is liberated, thus confirming that Kdd catalyzes the oxidative deamination of DAH.TABLE 2Stoichiometry of product formationExperimentEnzymesConcentration changeNAD(P)HaNADH in experiment I, NADPH in experiment II.Acetyl-CoAAcetoacetateNH4+Î¼mIKdd225 Â± 5238 Â± 9IIKdd + Kce + Kal209 Â± 2237 Â± 6.5210 Â± 7411 Â± 13a NADH in experiment I, NADPH in experiment II. Open table in a new tab Enzymatic Characterization of Kce ActivityâKce was assayed for the cleavage of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate in 3-aminobutyryl-CoA and acetoacetate in the presence of acetyl-CoA (11Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KAH was first enzymatically produced, and its concentration was estimated to 1.50 mm. As expected, in control experiments devoid of Kce or acetyl-CoA, no acetoacetate formation could be observed (not shown), whereas in the presence of Kce, the rate of acetoacetate formation was proportional to the amount of the enzyme during the course of experiment, 432.7 Â± 54.3 pmol/min/Î¼g Kce (estimated from two replicate assays conducted with 0.65, 1.30, and 2.60 Î¼g of Kce). These results are thus consistent with a Kce-dependent cleavage of KAH in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Enzymatic Characterization of Kal ActivityâIn vitro amination of crotonyl-CoA was shown to be Kal-dependent, and the rate of amination was strictly proportional to the amount of the recombinant enzyme (not shown). The kinetic constant of Kal for crotonyl-CoA was estimated at 55 Î¼m (Table 1). This value is very close to the one determined for the Clostridium SB4 enzyme (45 Î¼m, (13Jeng I. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6578-6584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Production of Crotonyl-CoA from DAH Using the Tri-coupled Enzymatic AssayâBecause each of the putative candidates catalyzes the expected enzymatic reaction, we wanted to test whether crotonyl-CoA could be directly generated from DAH in the presence of acetyl-CoA in a single tri-coupled enzymatic assay containing Kdd, Kce, and Kal. The reactions catalyzed by the combined assay could be monitored by assaying NADPH, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetate, and NH4+. Results reported in Table 2 (experiment II) are consistent with those expected from the global reaction described by Fig. 2, reactions 1â3 together. For each mol of reduced pyridine nucleotide, 1 mol of acetyl-CoA was consumed, while 1 mol of acetoacetate and 2 mol of NH4+ were formed. Although not all products could be analyzed, it is unlikely that the observed products result from other uncharacterized and unexpected activities, because the reactions were monitored using pure proteins expressed after cloning in E. coli B, which does not ferment lysine. Furthermore, no homologs of Kdd, Kce, and Kal were identified in this strain. Gene Cluster Organization in Putative Lysine-fermenting BacteriaâIn the sequenced genomes of F. nucleatum, T. tengcongensis, and P. gingivalis, these genes are clustered with all the genes known to be involved in lysine fermentation (Fig. 3, Table 3, and supplemental data).TABLE 3Proposed annotation for the genes in the lysine fermentation pathway of F. nucleatumF. nucleatum proteinsProtein names in Fig. 3Proposed annotationEC numberFN1869Kal3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase4.3.1.14FN1868Kce3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzymeFN1867Kdd3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase1.4.1.11FN1866KamALysine-2,3-aminomutase5.4.3.2FN1865HPHypothetical proteinFN1864MutSMutS family proteinFN1863KamDÎ²-lysine-5,6-aminomutase (Î± subunit)5.4.3.4FN1862KamEÎ²-lysine-5,6-aminomutase (Î² subunit)5.4.3.4FN1856AtoAAcetoacetate:butyrate CoA-transferase (Î² subunit)2.8.3.9FN1857AtoDAcetoacetate:butyrate CoA-transferase (Î± subunit)2.8.3.9 Open table in a new tab As mentioned above, the genes of the lysine fermentation pathway are clustered in the genomes of putative lysine-fermenting bacteria. Our initial hypothesis, i.e. the putative and hypothetical genes of these clusters might be the promising candidate genes, is now firmly established. Even though three formerly unknown genes of the cluster are now correctly annotated, there is still another hypothetical protein (Fig. 3, in gray color). This protein might be linked to the fermentation of lysine, but its function still remains unknown. In addition, a MutS family protein is co-localized with this hypothetical protein. To our present knowledge, a relationship between lysine fermentation and the MutS protein has never been described. Considering that eight genes involved in lysine fermentation are now known (kamA, kamD, kamE, kdd, kce, kal, atoA, and atoD), we used these sequences from F. nucleatum to detect, in all the sequenced genomes (and those available as a draft), the bacteria potentially able to ferment lysine. This analysis revealed 11 bacterial genomes containing the eight genes and one with six (in S. thermophilum, atoA/atoD were not found). The fact that the acetoacetate:butyrate CoA-transferase (AtoA/AtoD) was not found in S. thermophilum may be explained by the presence of another protein having the same activity. Alternatively, the last steps of lysine fermentation may be catalyzed differently. These 12 bacteria could therefore be considered as potential lysine-fermenting microorganisms. In some bacteria, only KamA and AtoA/AtoD could be identified. However, these bacteria are not supposed to ferment lysine. The existence of KamA might be explained by horizontal gene transfer. AtoA/AtoD belong to the 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase family. Members of this family are involved in several metabolic pathways (25Corthesy-Theulaz I.E. Bergonzelli G.E. Henry H. Bachmann D. Schorderet D.F. Blum A.L. Ornston L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cluster organization of the genes involved in lysine fermentation (observed in F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. tengcongensis) is conserved to a certain extent in nine other organisms (Fig. 3 and Table 3). In addition, the co-localization of the hypothetical protein and the MutS family protein previously observed in F. nucleatum is retrieved in five genomes. Two main organizational structures of the cluster are observed. In six organisms, the genes encoding Kdd, KamA, the hypothetical protein, the MutS family protein, KamD, and KamE are grouped together. Another configuration is detected in three other bacterial genomes for the genes encoding Kal, KamE, KamD, and Kdd. In this study, we identified the three missing genes of the lysine fermentation pathway. DNA sequence analyses and comparative genomics enabled us to propose a candidate gene for each of the reactions. The purified gene products confirmed their anticipated enzymatic activities. Altogether, these data represent overwhelming evidence that 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme, and 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase are encoded by these genes. Of these three reactions, the second one is of special interest, because it presents an unknown mechanism for Î²-ketoacid cleavage and acetoacetate synthesis."

Here, we explore the mechanism by which a specific ATS-1 mutation (V302M) alters channel function. Val-302 is located in the G-loop, a structure that is believed to form a flexible barrier for potassium permeation at the apex of the cytoplasmic pore. Consistent with a role in stabilizing the G-loop in an open conformation, we found the V302M mutation specifically renders the channel unable to conduct potassium without altering subunit assembly or attenuating cell surface expression. As predicted by the position of the Val-302 side chain in the crystal structure, amino acid substitution analysis revealed that channel activity and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) sensitivity are profoundly sensitive to alterations in the size, shape, and hydrophobicity of side chains at the Val-302 position. The observations establish that the Val-302 side chain is a critical determinant of potassium conduction through the G-loop. Based on our functional studies and the cytoplasmic domain crystal structure, we suggest that Val-302 may influence PIP2 gating indirectly by translating PIP2 binding to conformational changes in the G-loop pore.

The Kir2.1 channel normally sets the resting membrane potential and controls the duration of the action potential in many different types of excitable cells (4Nichols C.G. Makhina E.N. Pearson W.L. Sha Q. Lopatin A.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In ventricular myocytes Kir2.1 is a major component of IK1, a steep inwardly rectifying potassium current that is responsible for the terminal, phase 3 repolarization of the action potential (5Zaritsky J.J. Redell J.B. Tempel B.L. Schwarz T.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 697-710Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Consequently, loss of the Kir2.1 repolarizing current lengthens the ventricular action potential, modestly prolongs the QT interval (6Zhang L. Benson D.W. Tristani-Firouzi M. Ptacek L.J. Tawil R.

Multiple missense mutations in Kir2.1 have been identified in patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome, affecting channel function by all mechanisms imaginable.

However, the recently resolved atomic resolution structure of the Kir2.1 cytoplasmic domain (12Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) provides reason to seriously reconsider this idea and rigorously test whether Val-302 might actually play a specific role in potassium conduction and channel gating. As observed in related channels, Kir3.1 (13Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and the bacterial KirBac1.1 (14Kuo A.

Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), the highly conserved cytoplasmic N and C termini of Kir2.1, form a long water-filled cytoplasmic pore that extends â¼30 AÃ¥ from the canonical transmembrane potassium conduction pathway (12Pegan S.

Charged and hydrophobic residues line the inner cavity of the cytoplasmic pore, creating a favorable site for polyamines (15Fujiwara Y. Kubo Y. J. Gen.

For example, a cluster of basic and polar residues at the surface form a binding site for PIP2 (8Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E.

Like most other inwardly rectifying channels, opening of the Kir2.1 channel requires PIP2 binding to these residues. The Val-302 residue is located near the apex of the cytoplasmic structure where the four cytoplasmic loops from each subunit in the tetrameric channel form a girdle around the central pore. This structure, called the G-loop, is believed to create a flexible diffusion barrier in the potassium conduction pathway between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane pore (12Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of the Kir2.1 cytoplasmic domain, the Val-302 side chain points away from the pore between a salt bridge (Arg-218:Thr-309) (21Pegan S. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8599-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) near the putative PIP2 binding site at the cytoplasmic surface. These observations raise the possibility that Val-302 plays an important role in the conformation of the G-loop. In this study, we begin to explore this idea by elucidating the mechanism by which the Andersen-Tawil syndrome mutation, V302M, alters channel function. Molecular BiologyâAll studies were performed with the modified mouse Kir2.1 channel, containing an external hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag as described before (22Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based strategy with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange, Stratagene). All constructs for studies in Xenopus oocytes were subcloned between the 5â²- and 3â²-untranslated region of the Xenopus Î²-globin gene in the modified pSD64 vector as before (23Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) was used to express the cloned channel genes in the COS7 and HEK293 cells. pEGFP-C1 was used to express the N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged channels in HEK293 and rat neonatal heart cells. All sequences were confirmed by dye termination DNA sequencing (University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core). pcDNA-CD8 expressing vector was generously provided by Dr. Min Li from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Neonatal Rat Ventricular Cardiomyocyte CultureâIsolation and handling of rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes was performed as previously described (24Gigena M.S. Ito A. Nojima H. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, hearts were removed from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The ventricles were separated from the atria and then digested in a buffer (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 15 Î¼m phenol red, pH 7.35) containing collagenase type II (75 units/ml; Worthington Biochemical) and pancreatin (0.6 mg/ml; Sigma). Samples were digested 30 min at 37 Â°C, then pelleted and resuspended in heat-inactivated horse serum and plated onto 25-mm coverslips precoated with fibronectin at a density of 350-500 cells/mm2. Cells were incubated at 37 Â°C in humidified air with 5% CO2 (4:1 mixture of Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium-M199 to which 5% fetal calf serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 1 mm 5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine, and 2% penicillinstreptomycin was added). After 24 h the cultures were irradiated with Î³ irradiation (2500 rads) to eliminate fibroblast growth. Transfection of HEK293 Cells and Rat Neonatal Heart Cells for Patch Clamp AnalysisâHEK293 cells were plated onto 25-mm No.1 coverslips 1 day before transfection at 10-20% confluence. A 1.5-Î¼g DNA mixture containing channel plasmid DNA and the CD8 gene in 1:6 ratio were used to transfect HEK293 cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). After transfection, the cells were cultured at 37 Â°C for another 24-36 h. To select transfected cells for patch clamp analysis, cells were incubated with anti-CD8-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) for 30 min. The unbound beads were removed with gentle PBS washes. Only CD8 bead-decorated cells were used for electrophysiological recording. Three days after plating rat neonatal heart cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). 3 Î¼g of channel plasmid and 0.5 Î¼g of CD8 plasmid were mixed for each transfection. The lipid DNA complexes were removed on the second day after transfection. Transfected cells for electrical recording were identified with CD8 beads and green fluorescence as above. Oocyte Isolation and InjectionâOocytes from Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Homosassa, Fl) were isolated and maintained using the standard procedures as previously described (25Yoo D. Fang L. Mason A. Kim B.Y. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35281-35289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Healthy-looking Dumont stage V-VI oocytes were pneumatically injected with 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonatetreated water containing 0.75 ng of cRNA (unless noted otherwise) and then stored in OR-3 medium at 19 Â°C. cRNA SynthesisâComplementary RNA was transcribed in vitro in the presence of capping analogue G(5â²)ppp(5â²) from linearized plasmids containing the cDNA of interest using SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage Machine, Ambion Inc.). cRNA was purified by spin column chromatography (MEGAclear, Ambion Inc.). Yield was quantified spectrophotometrically and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. ElectrophysiologyâStandard methods were used for whole cell voltage clamp studies in HEK cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes. The pipettes were made from thin wall glass (TW150F-3, WPI, Sarasota, FL) and had resistances of 2-3 megohms. The currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier at 5 kHz and digitized using an ITC-16 analog- to-digital, digital-to-analogue interface (Instrutech, Greatneck, NY). Data acquisition was controlled with Pulse (HEKA) software. After establishing the whole-cell configuration, the cell capacitance was cancelled, and the series resistance was (â¼70%) compensated. Currents were elicited by 100-ms pulses applied in 10-mV increments to potentials ranging from -120 to 50 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV. Current density was calculated by dividing the whole cell current by the cell capacitance. The pipette solution contained 35 mm KCl, 85 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5.3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 4 mm EDTA, and 2 mm KATP (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). Tyrode solution was used as the bath medium (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and d-glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The rapidly (IKr) and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) were blocked by using E4031 (N-[4-[[1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]carbonyl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide dihydrochloride) and chromanol 293B, respectively. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22-25 Â°C) within 24-36 h of transfection. The recording chamber was 300 Î¼lin volume and was constantly perfused using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 1.2 ml min-1 (26Tang X.D. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nat. Struct Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Whole cell potassium currents in Xenopus oocytes were monitored using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described previously (23Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were bathed in a 45 mm K+ solution (45 mm KCl, 45 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or a 90 mm KCl solution (90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5-1.5 megohms when backfilled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of -40 mV, and currents were recorded during 500-ms voltage steps ranging from -100 mV to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. For assessment of cation selectivity (PK/PNa) reversal potentials were measured as before (27Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar) in 5 mm potassium and 5 mm sodium (85 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Data were collected using an ITC16 interface (Instrutech Corp.), filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized on line at 2 kHz using Pulse software (HEKA Electronik). Kir2.1 currents are taken as the barium-sensitive inward current (2 mm barium acetate) as we have done before (23Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Values reported in the text are the barium-sensitive inward currents at -100 mV. Immunofluorescent Microscopyâ36 h after plasmid transfection, intact COS-7 cells or rat neonatal heart cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in 1Ã PBS buffer, and then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature to specifically label exposed HA-channel epitopes on the cell surface membrane. After incubation, the unbound antibodies were removed with PBS washes. The intracellular recombinant channels were subsequently labeled with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody for 1 h at room temperature after 0.1% Triton X-100 permeabilization. The two channel populations (intracellular and extracellular) were labeled differentially with secondary antibodies (Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody). After extensive washing with 1Ã PBS buffer, the coverslips were mounted on the glass slide with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The labeled cells were visualized under Zeiss 410 confocal microscopy. Quantitative Chemiluminescence Detection of Surface ProteinsâChannel surface expression in oocytes was quantified by chemiluminescence as described previously (25Yoo D. Fang L. Mason A. Kim B.Y. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35281-35289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To quantify the cell surface expression in mammalian cells, COS7 or HEK293 cells were plated on 6-well tissue culture dishes and transfected with 1 Î¼g of plasmid DNA using FuGENE6 reagent at a 50-60% cell confluence. After 36 h, transfected cells were incubated on ice with blocking buffer (5% fetal bovine serum in 1Ã PBS, 30 min), incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Covance) (in blocking buffer, 1 h), washed (with blocking buffer, 3 times for 5 min), incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Jackson) (in blocking buffer, 20 min), and extensively washed (1Ã PBS for 5 min/time for 4 times in total). The cells were scraped from the plates and resuspended into 500 Î¼l 1Ã PBS. 10 Î¼l of cell suspension was incubated with 100 Î¼l of mixed Supersignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto solution, and then chemiluminescence was measured as above after 3 min of incubation. Reported values represent the average of triplicate transfections. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisâStandard molecular biology protocols were followed for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as before (28Yoo D. Flagg T.P. Olsen O. Raghuram V. Foskett J.K. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6863-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA was obtained from Covance. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc and mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. For quantification of subunit immunoprecipitation, densitometry was performed using NIH image. For comparison of multiple blots, the density of immunoprecipitated bands was first normalized to the density of the corresponding input for each blot. To begin to clarify the mechanisms by which the V302M mutation in Kir2.1 causes channel malfunction in ATS-1, we evaluated the functional properties and surface expression of external epitope-tagged channels bearing the mutation. The HA epitope tag was incorporated into an external site that does not perturb channel activity (22Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) for quantitative measurements of plasmalemma expression. Biophysical properties of the channels were assessed in HEK cells under whole-cell patch clamp (Fig. 1). For electrophysiological experiments, cells were co-transfected with CD8 and Kir2.1 channels (WT or V302M) and then selected for analysis on CD8 antibody-coated beads. The CD8 selection procedure provides a highly efficient method for detecting Kir2.1-transfected cells; nearly all CD8-selected cells contain immunodetectable Kir2.1 (98.7%) or Kir2.1 V302M (100%) (Fig. 1B). Cells transfected with the wild-type channel exhibited robust potassium-selective, barium-sensitive inward-rectifying currents, typical of Kir2.1 (29Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). By contrast, barium-sensitive potassium currents were not detected above background in cells transfected with Kir2.1 V302M (Fig. 1, A and C). As measured by HA antibody binding and analytical luminometry, the V302M mutation had no inhibitory effects on surface expression. In fact, the Kir2.1 V302M channels exhibited a somewhat higher level of expression at the plasmalemma than the wild-type channels. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the V302M mutation directly alters potassium conduction and/or gating rather than disrupting protein stability or preventing plasma membrane trafficking. These observations are supported by immunocytochemical analysis of external HA-tagged Kir2.1 channels in COS cells. As shown in Fig. 2, HA-antibodies readily label non-permeabilized COS cells expressing either wild-type Kir2.1 or Kir2.1 V302M channels, indicating that the mutation does not disrupt cell surface expression (Fig. 2A). As a negative control, Kir2.1 mutant channels, lacking an endoplasmic reticulum export signal (ÎFCYENE) (22Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot be detected in intact cells by cell surface antibody binding. Independent assessment of plasma membrane expression by luminometry provided a quantitative corroboration of the immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2B). Again, more Kir2.1 V302M could be detected at the plasmalemma than the wild-type Kir2.1. Protein expression of wild-type and mutant channels, as detected in HA immunoblots, were comparable. To test whether the mutation affects subunit assembly, immunoprecipitation studies were performed with differently tagged Kir2.1 subunits. In these studies, COS-7 cells were either co-transfected with Myc-tagged Kir2.1 (WT) and HA-tagged Kir2.1 (WT or V302M) at a 1:1 ratio or transfected with HA-tagged Kir2.1 alone. Recovered immunoprecipitates on anti-Myc-bound beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the extent of HA-tagged channel subunit interaction was assessed using anti-HA antibodies in immunoblots. As shown in the representative experiment (Fig. 3), both the wild-type HA-Kir2.1 and the mutant V302M co-immunoprecipitated with the Myc-tagged subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged subunits with Myc antibodies required co-transfection of the Myc-tagged subunit, verifying specificity. As quantified by densitometry, equal amounts of HA epitope-tagged and wild-type and mutant channel co-purified with wild-type Myc-tagged Kir2.1, indicating the mutation does not alter subunitsubunit interaction (Fig. 3B). In addition, immunocytochemical analysis of co-transfected cells (Fig. 3C) reveal that the Myc-tagged WT Kir2.1 and HA-tagged V302M Kir2.1 subunits are highly co-localized, offering further support that the mutant channel is capable of assembling with the wild-type channel in cells. As a functional test of subunit assembly, we explored the possibility that the Kir2.1 V302M mutant exhibits a negative effect on the wild-type Kir2.1 channel. In these studies, whole cell potassium currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes co-injected with a constant amount of wild-type Kir2.1 and varying amounts of Kir2.1 V302M cRNA. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of Kir2.1 V302M suppressed wild-type Kir2.1 channel activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that V302M subunits can assemble with wild-type subunits, and this diminishes channel function. The effect is specific. In fact, we found that co-injection of a dominant negative Kir1.1 (renal outer medullary potassium) channel, which bears a disrupting alanine substitution mutation within the pore âGYGâ sequence (Kir1.1AAA) and does not assemble with Kir2.1, had no suppressive effect on Kir2.1. Likewise, co-injection of cRNA encoding a non-channel membrane protein, CD4, had no effect on Kir2.1 activity. Thus, the general effects of translational interference cannot explain the decrease in current by V302M cRNA. We also examined whether V302M channels exhibit negative effects on the native IK1 current, encoded by Kir2.1/2.2, in neonatal cardiomyocytes (30Zobel C. Cho H.C. Nguyen T.T. Pekhletski R. Diaz R.J. Wilson G.J. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 365-372Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Preisig-Muller R. Schlichthorl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Bruggemann A. Rajan S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7774-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In these studies, cardiomyocytes were transfected with CD8 and either the wild-type Kir2.1 or the V302M Kir2.1 channel (both EGFP-tagged) and then compared with cells transfected with CD8 alone. Cells expressing either channel were selected with a high level of confidence for whole-cell patch clamp analysis using EGFP fluorescence and anti-CD8-coated beads (Fig. 5, A and B); nearly all CD8-selected cells contain EGFP-positive Kir2.1 (96%) or Kir2.1 V302M (96%). As summarized in Fig. 5, C and D, expression of the Kir2.1 V302M mutant channel completely suppressed the endogenous IK1 current. The effect appears to be specific as expression of the mutant channel had no effects on the endogenous sodium current (not shown). Furthermore, wild-type Kir2.1-transfected cells carried inward potassium currents that were â¼19-fold greater than the endogenous IK1. The specific negative effects of the mutant Kir2.1 on the wild-type Kir2.1 channel in oocytes and IK1 activity in cardiomyocytes strongly suggest that V302M mutant channels are appropriately synthesized, are folded correctly, and are capable of assembly. Such behavior is also consistent with the dominant pattern of inheritance in ATS-1. Together the observations above indicate that the V302M mutation impairs channel function by altering potassium conduction and/or gating rather than disrupting cell surface expression or subunit assembly. Visualization of the recently solved Kir2.1 cytoplasmic domain structure (12Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reveals a possible mechanism. As shown in Fig. 6, the hydrophobic side chain of Val-302 projects away from the cytoplasmic pore between residues (Arg-218:Thr-309) that are believed to form a salt bridge and hold the G loop cytoplasmic pore in an open conformation (21Pegan S. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8599-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent position of Val-302 relative to the salt bridge, we hypothesized that channel activity would be sensitive to alterations in the size, shape, and hydrophobicity of side chains at the Val-302 position. To test this idea, macroscopic channel activity and cell surface expression were measured in a panel of Kir2.1 mutants, bearing different hydrophobic amino acids at position 302 (methionine, alanine, leucine, or isoleucine).

https://openalex.org/W2042392104,"Transcriptional suppression of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX)-1 (15-LOX-1) helps enable human colorectal cancer cells escape apoptosis, a critical mechanism for colonic tumorigenesis. GATA-6 is strongly expressed in vitro in cancer cells; its down-regulation by pharmaceuticals is associated with reversal of 15-LOX-1 transcriptional suppression. The mechanistic contribution of GATA-6 overexpression to colonic tumorigenesis, especially concerning 15-LOX-1 transcriptional suppression, remains unknown. We tested whether GATA-6 is differentially overexpressed in human colorectal cancers and whether reversing GATA-6 overexpression in colon cancer cells is sufficient to restore 15-LOX-1 expression and influence cell proliferation or apoptosis. The expression of GATA-6 RNA and protein was measured in paired human colorectal cancer and normal tissues from two separate patient groups. We used GATA-6 small interfering RNA transfection to down-regulate GATA-6 expression and examine the effects of this down-regulation on 15-LOX-1 expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in Caco-2 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells with and without the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NS-398 or the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate. GATA-6 mRNA and protein expressions were higher in cancer than normal epithelia of the colon. GATA-6 knockdown was insufficient by itself but contributed significantly to restoring 15-LOX-1 expression and inducing apoptosis by NS-398 or sodium butyrate. Maintaining 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing in cancer cells is a multifactorial process involving GATA-6 overexpression and other regulatory events."
https://openalex.org/W2122582811,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that binds Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) and has a central role in the regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. Most GPCRs are endocytosed following binding to the agonist and receptor desensitization. Other GPCRs are internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane constitutively, in the absence of the agonist. In unstimulated neuroblastoma cells and immortalized hypothalamic neurons, epitopetagged MC4R was localized both at the plasma membrane and in an intracellular compartment.

In the absence of Î±-MSH, a fraction of cell surface MC4R localized together with transferrin receptor and to clathrin-coated pits. Constitutive MC4R internalization was impaired by expression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant. Thus, MC4R is internalized together with transferrin receptor by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Cell exposure toÎ±-MSH reduced the amount of MC4R at the plasma membrane by blocking recycling of a fraction of internalized receptor, rather than by increasing its rate of endocytosis.

In support of this, it has been reported that inactivation of MC4R in mice leads to obesity syndrome with hyperphagia, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia (3.Huszar D. Lynch C.A.

The importance of MC4R in food intake regulation is highlighted by the recent discovery that most of the known monogenetic causes of obesity are because of mutations in the MC4R (5.Lubrano-Berthelier C.

Binding of Î±-MSH to MC4R induces stabilization of the active conformation of the receptor. The activated receptor binds to Gs, and this leads to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and increased intracellular concentration of cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (10.Hadley M.E. Haskell-Luevano C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Active protein kinase A initiates transcription of new genes by phosphorylating and activating cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GPCRs leads to the formation of high affinity binding sites to which Î²-arrestins bind (11.Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 12.Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 13.von Zastrow M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the classical pathway, binding of Î²-arrestins to GPCRs leads to uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins with consequent termination of the signal and Î²-arrestin-dependent recruitment of the clathrin adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2). AP-2 binds to clathrin, and this leads to the formation of coated pits that includes GPCR. Nascent clathrin-coated vesicles containing GPCR are then pinched off by a process that requires association of a small GTPase, dynamin, at the neck of the pit (14.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In agreement with this classical model of GPCR desensitization and internalization, it was found that exposure to Î±-MSH induces rapid internalization of GFP-tagged MC4R to endosomes in the human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) (15.Gao Z.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant negative forms of dynamin1 and Î²-arrestin1 in these cells inhibited agonist-induced internalization of the MC4R (16.Shinyama H. Masuzaki H. Fang H. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Exposure to agents that block clathrin-mediated endocytosis also inhibited agonist-induced internalization of MC4R (15.Gao Z. Lei D. Welch J. Le K. Lin J. Leng S. Duhl D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data indicate that, in the HEK 293 cells, MC4R is internalized by a clathrin-dependent mechanism initiated by receptor binding to the agonist.

We observed that both in unstimulated N2A and GT1-7 cells, a pool of GFP-tagged MC4R had an intracellular localization. This prompted us to determine whether MC4R is constitutively internalized and recycled in these cells.

Enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector pEGFP-N2 was from Clontech. pCB expression vector containing human dynamin 1 cDNA (DynWT-pCB) or the K44A mutant of human dynamin 1 (DynK44A-pCB) were a kind gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid, the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. The plasmid pCDTR with human TR cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Timothy McGraw, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York. ConstructsâHuman MC4R cDNA in the pCMV-XL4 vector was obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD). The HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA)-tagged MC4R was generated by PCR amplification using Pfu-Turbo polymerase (Invitrogen) using MC4R-pCMV-XL4 plasmid as template. The forward primer, 5â²-CTC AAG CTT CGA ATT CTG GCC ACC ATG TAT CCT TAT GAT GTG CCT GAT TAT GCC GTG AAC TCC ACC CAC CGT GGG-3â², was designed with a HindIII site at the N terminus (underlined) and the HA epitope (in boldface) after the starting ATG codon. The reverse primer, 5â²-CGG TGG ATCCCG GGC ATA TCT GCT AGA CAA GTC ACA-3â², had a BamHI site (underlined) at the C terminus and the MC4R stop codon (TAA) removed. Purified PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and then ligated into pEGFP-N2 cut with HindIII-BamHI to generate a plasmid, HA-MC4R-GFP, that contains the HA-MC4R sequence upstream of, and in-frame with, the GFP coding sequence to express HA-MC4R-GFP. To generate HA-MC4R without GFP, PCR amplification was done by using the MC4R-pCMV-XL4 template, the same forward primer as above, and as reverse primer, CGGTGGATCCCGGGCTTAATATCTGCTAGACAAGTCA, where the MC4R stop codon (boldface) was maintained. The purified PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated to HindIII-BamHI-digested pEGFP-N2. The ATG codon of GFP was mutated by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA for transfections into mammalian cells was isolated using the DNA purification system from Promega. Cell Culture, Transfection, and SilencingâN2A and N2A expressing BonT/E (G14) cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Hypothalamic GT1-7 cells were a kind gift of Dr. R. I. Weiner (University of California, San Francisco). GT1-7 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 50:50 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and penicillin/streptomycin. N2A, G14, and GT1-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 and following the manufacturerâs instructions. N2A cells stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP were selected by growth with 1.2 mg/ml G 418. For SNAP-23 silencing in N2A and G14 cells, cells were transfected either with 200 nm SNAP-23 siRNA or with 200 nm nontargeting siRNA pool using Lipofectamine 2000. Tf and MC4R recycling was measured 48 h after the siRNA transfection. Prior to all experiments, cells were washed twice with DMEM without serum and incubated for 16 h in the same medium. Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingâSeparation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting with the indicated primary antibodies, and secondary POD-conjugated antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence detection, densitometry, and protein determination were performed as described (27.Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence MicroscopyâTo visualize the distribution of HA-MC4R-GFP, N2A cells transiently transfected with HA-MC4R-EGFP were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Images were captured using CARV spinning confocal imaging system attached to an Olympus X-71 fluorescence microscope. Images were collected by using a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera controlled by IP lab software (Scanalytics, Inc, Fairfax, VA). To visualize the distribution of MC4R and TR at the cell surface, N2A cells transiently co-expressing HA-MC4R and exogenous human TR were washed three times with DMEM, incubated in the same medium for 1 h at 37 Â°C, transferred in ice, and incubated with DMEM containing TMR-Tf (5 Î¼g/ml) and anti-HA antibodies for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed as above, and incubated with PBS containing 100 Î¼g/ml ovalbumin and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG without addition of detergents. Cells were visualized by total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy by using an Olympus 1X71 inverted microscope equipped with argon laser (488 nm) and helium/neon laser (543 nm). Images were collected by using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To study the localization of MC4R in respect to internalized TR, N2A cells transiently expressing HA-MC4R-GFP and treated as above were incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml TMR-Tf at 37 Â°C for 1 h. Cells were washed and fixed, and images were captured with the confocal microscope as described above. Antibody-feeding experiments were done with N2A and GT1-7 cells transiently expressing HA-MC4R-GFP incubated for 1 h either at 4 Â°C or at 37 Â°C in DMEM with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibodies (clone 12CA5). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with formaldehyde, and further processed for secondary antibody staining as described (28.Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in PBS containing 100 Î¼g/ml ovalbumin without (nonpermeabilized cells) or with (permeabilized cells) 0.2% Triton X-100. To observe the localization of internalized MC4R and TR, N2A cells transiently expressing HA-MC4R and human TR were incubated with anti-HA antibodies and 5 Î¼g/ml TMR-Tf in DMEM at 37 Â°C for 1 h to endocytose TMR-Tf/TR and mouse anti-HAÂ·HA-MC4R complexes. Cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-mouse FITC antibodies. Images were captured by confocal microscopy as above. Immunoelectron MicroscopyâFor pre-embedding immunomicroscopy, broken agarose-embedded N2A cells expressing high levels of HA-MC4R-GFP were prepared as described before (28.Baldini G. Wang G.

For post-embedding immunomicroscopy, the N2A cells expressing HA-MC4R-GFP grown on coverslips were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cell monolayers were sequentially dehydrated in ascending alcohols and infiltrated for 4 h at room temperature with three changes of LR white acrylic resin, hard (Sigma). Coverslips were covered with a cylindrical capsule filled with fresh LR white resin and polymerized at 60 Â°C for 24 h. Thin sections were collected on 400-mesh nickel grids, incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBS blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 225 mm NaCl, 1% BSA) containing 5% normal goat serum, and then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with rabbit anti-GFP antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against clathrin heavy chain (clone TD.1, Pharmingen). After 10 min of washing in TBS blocking buffer, samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 20 nm diameter gold particles and with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10 nm diameter gold particles. Control grids were also included in which the primary antibody was omitted. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Quantification of HA-MC4R-GFP by Enzyme-linked ImmunoassaysâTo quantify HA-MC4R-GFP expression at the cell surface, N2A cells either transiently or stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min and then with the same medium containing POD-conjugated anti-HA antibodies (50 milliunits/ml) for 1 h. Mock-transfected cells were used as a control. Cells were washed with PBS three times, and POD activity was measured by incubating cells for 1 h at 37 Â°C with a water-soluble POD substrate (ABTS, 1 mg/ml) following the manufacturerâs instructions. The oxidized product was detected by reading its absorbance at 405 nm using a mQuant universal microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc). To detect endogenous MC4R in murine N2A cells, and to estimate the amount of total MC4R in N2A cells stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP (human receptor), an immunoassay was performed using an antibody against the extracellular N-terminal domain of mouse MC4R (amino acid 21-33 corresponding to YGLHSNASESLGK). The sequence of the human MC4R differs from that of the mouse by one amino acid substitution (Gly to Arg) at position 22. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature. Cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA followed by incubation with the anti-MC4R antibody (400 ng/ml) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS six times and incubated with POD-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were washed six times with PBS and incubated with ABTS substrate for 1 h at 37 Â°C. The oxidized product was detected as described above. To study the effect of Î±-MSH on the amount of MC4R at the cell surface, N2A cells stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP were preincubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C with DMEM containing 100 Î¼m cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. The cells were then incubated in the continuous presence of cycloheximide with or without 100 nm Î±-MSH for different time points. Cells were fixed, and the cell surface MC4R was measured as described above. For the BFA experiments, cycloheximide-treated N2A cells stably transfected with HA-MC4R-GFP were incubated for 2 h at 37 Â°C with and without 10 Î¼g/ml BFA in the continuous presence of cycloheximide. Cells were washed and fixed, and surface HA-MC4R-GFP was measured as above. For the antibody-feeding experiments, cycloheximide-treated N2A cells either transiently or stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP were incubated for 30 min at 4 Â°C in DMEM with 50 milliunits/ml POD-conjugated anti-HA antibodies in the presence of cycloheximide. Cells were then further incubated at 4 or 37Â°C for 1 h in the continuous presence of the anti-HA antibodies and cycloheximide. Cells were transferred in ice, washed three times with PBS, fixed with formaldehyde, and washed twice with PBS. To measure total and cell surface HA-MC4R-GFP, POD activity was assayed by preincubating cells for 30 min at room temperature in PBS with (permeabilized cells) and without (unpermeabilized cells) 0.2% Triton X-100, respectively, prior to addition of the ABTS substrate. For some antibody-feeding experiments, anti-HA antibodies bound to cell surface HA-MC4R-GFP were stripped off by incubation for 5 min at 4 Â°C in DMEM adjusted to pH 2.0 prior to washing with PBS and fixation with formaldehyde. For these experiments, antibody-labeled HA-MC4R-GFP was measured after incubation with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min to permeabilize cells prior to addition of the POD substrate. To study the rate of MC4R internalization, N2A cells stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP were incubated with POD-conjugated anti-HA antibody at 4 Â°C to label the cell surface receptor. Cells were washed with DMEM and transferred at 37 Â°C to allow endocytosis of the receptor. At different time points cells were washed with PBS and fixed with formaldehyde. The amount of total and cell surface HA-MC4R-GFP was measured as described above. To study the effect of overexpression of wild-type and mutated dynamin1 on the rate of internalization, N2A cells were transfected with HA-MC4R-GFP and co-transfected either with empty vector (pCB) or with wild-type dynamin 1 (Dyn-pCB) or with mutant dynamin (DynK44E-pCB). Twenty four hours after transfection, the internalization rate of MC4R was measured as above. To measure the effect of Î±-MSH on the rate of HA-MC4R-GFP endocytosis, cells were incubated with or without 100 nm Î±-MSH for 30 min at 4 Â°C. POD-conjugated anti-HA antibodies were added to the medium, and cells were further incubated at 4 Â°C to label HA-MC4R-GFP at the cell surface. Cells were washed, transferred at 37 Â°C in the absence and in the presence of Î±-MSH, and analysis of internalized HA-MC4R-GFP was carried out as described above. To study the rate of MC4R exocytosis, cycloheximide-treated N2A cells stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP and GT1-7 cells transiently expressing the tagged receptor were incubated at 4 Â°C for 1 h with POD-conjugated anti-HA antibody in the continuous presence of cycloheximide. Cells were transferred to 37 Â°C, incubated for the different time points, washed, and fixed with formaldehyde. Surface and total HA-MC4R-GFP was measured as described above. Measurement of Tf Uptake and ReleaseâCells plated in 35-mm dishes were washed with DMEM and incubated with DMEM for 1 h and further incubated with 8 Î¼g/ml POD-Tf in DMEM for 1 h. Under these conditions, cells were maximally loaded with Tf. Cells were then washed with sodium citrate buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0) and PBS to remove unbound Tf-POD as described by others (30.Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F.

Cells were scraped with 0.8 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 Â°C for 20 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. POD activity in lysates (20 Î¼l) was measured using the ABTS substrate. Assay of cAMPâCells were washed and incubated with Opti-MEM I containing 0.5 mm IBMX for 10 min and then stimulated with 100 nm Î±-MSH or with 10 Î¼m forskolin for 15 min at 37 Â°C. The medium was aspirated, and cells were lysed in 0.1 n HCl. Intracellular cAMP was measured following the manufacturerâs instructions using the direct immunoassay kit from Biovision Research Products (Mountain View, CA). Statistical Analysis and Curve FittingâAll experiments were done at least twice with triplicate samples. Data are expressed as mean Â± S.D. of triplicate samples from a single experiment unless noted otherwise. For some experiments, data were compared by using the Studentâs t test. Rate constants and plateaus of receptor internalization, externalization, and recycling were derived by fitting nonlinear regression models to the data, using the GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The one-phase exponential decay model and the one-phase exponential association model for the internalization and externalization/recycling data, respectively, gave an R2 > 0.95. When N2A and GT1-7 cells were exposed to 100 nm Î±-MSH for 15 min, intracellular cAMP increased by â¼10-fold (Fig. 1A), consistent with reports that both cell lines express endogenous MC4R. It has been found that attachment of an HA and a GFP tag to the N terminus and the C terminus of MC4R, respectively, does not change the receptor ability to bind to Î±-MSH or to respond to Î±-MSH stimulation by increasing intracellular cAMP levels (15.Gao Z.

In the N2A cells transiently transfected with the HA-MC4R-GFP plasmid, GFP fluorescence appeared at the plasma membrane and at an intracellular compartment (Fig. 1B). To detect HA-MC4R-GFP at the cell surface, we used an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Transiently transfected N2A cells were incubated at 4 Â°C with POD-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA antibodies as described by others (16.Shinyama H. Masuzaki H. Fang H. Flier J.S.

https://openalex.org/W1980815362,"Alpha-synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that has been linked to both normal synaptic function and neurodegeneration--in particular, Parkinson's disease (PD). Uncovering mechanisms that control alpha-synuclein transcription is therefore critical for PD pathogenesis and synaptic function. We previously reported that in PC12 cells and primary neurons, alpha-synuclein is transcriptionally up-regulated after application of growth factors. In the current work we have characterized the pathway involved in this regulation in PC12 cells. The MAP/ERK pathway, and in particular Ras, is both sufficient and necessary for the NGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) -mediated response. Significantly, response elements for this pathway, including a putative occult promoter, lie within intron 1, a hitherto unappreciated regulatory region of the gene that may be utilized in this or other settings. The PI3 kinase pathway is also involved in alpha-synuclein regulation, but response elements for this pathway appear to lie primarily outside of intron 1. These findings indicate that NGF- and bFGF-mediated signal transduction via the MAP/ERK and PI3 kinase pathways, and in part via regulatory regions within intron 1, may be involved in alpha-synuclein transcriptional regulation. Targeting of these pathways may serve to modulate alpha-synuclein so that it achieves desirable levels within neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072835730,"In the early secretory pathway, opportunistic cleavage of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase I targets misfolded glycoproteins for dislocation into the cytosol and destruction by 26 S proteasomes. The low basal concentration of the glycosidase is believed to coordinate the glycan cleavage with prolonged conformation-based ER retention, ensuring that terminally misfolded glycoproteins are preferentially targeted for destruction. Herein the intracellular fate of human ER mannosidase I was monitored to determine whether a post-translational process might contribute to the regulation of its intracellular concentration. The transiently expressed recombinant human glycosidase was subject to rapid intracellular turnover in mouse hepatoma cells, as was the endogenous mouse ortholog. Incubation with either chloroquine or leupeptin, but not lactacystin, led to intracellular stabilization, implicating the involvement of lysosomal acid hydrolases. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide led to intracellular depletion of the glycosidase and concomitant ablation of asparagine-linked glycoprotein degradation, confirming the physiologic relevance of the destabilization process. Metabolic incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate, detection by anti-phosphoserine antiserum, and the stabilizing effect of general serine kinase inhibition implied that ER mannosidase I is subjected to regulated proteolysis. Stabilization in response to genetically engineered removal of the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a postulated regulatory domain, and colocalization of green fluorescent protein fusion proteins with Lamp1 provided two additional lines of evidence to support the hypothesis. A model is proposed in which proteolytically driven checkpoint control of ER mannosidase I contributes to the establishment of an equitable glycoprotein quality control standard by which the efficiency of asparagine-linked glycoprotein conformational maturation is measured.

Arguably, this dual intention is best exemplified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERManI, endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GERAD, glycoprotein ERAD; GFP, green fluorescent protein; h, human; WT, wild type; NT, tail-less. into which nascent secretory and membrane proteins are translocated. The adoption of native protein structure, facilitated by transient physical engagement with one or more molecular chaperones, precedes productive export from the ER (3.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Rather than clogging the secretory pathway, molecules incapable of structural maturation are eliminated by a process coined âER-associated degradationâ (ERAD).

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) implicated ER mannosidase I as a key component in glycoprotein ERAD (GERAD). Intracellular degradation of terminally misfolded Î±1-antitrypsin is accelerated in response to an experimentally elevated concentration of the recombinant glycosidase (18.Wu Y. Swulius M.T.

Its contribution toward a stochastically based substrate discrimination process was strengthened by destabilization of newly synthesized wild type Î±1-antitrypsin and transferrin under these conditions (18.Wu Y.

A luminal bipartite signal consisting of the cleaved glycans and nonnative protein structure is suspected to function as the initial degradation signal. The very low basal concentration of ER mannosidase I (18.Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) is proposed to preferentially target terminally misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD by coordinating the glycan modification with prolonged conformation-based ER retention. The subsequent trajectory of tagged molecules toward the ER dislocon is suspected to result from downstream machinery capable of recognizing the bipartite signal anatomy (Fig. 1). The complementary nature by which the opposing systems of glycoprotein folding and quality control operate might function as a post-translational checkpoint in eukaryotic genome expression. Despite the fundamental role in which the overall process contributes to normal cell biology and possible involvement in numerous conformational diseases (15.Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22.Sifers R.N. Nat. Struct Biol. 1995; 2: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a clear mechanistic understanding of how this branch point operates has not yet emerged. For example, very little is understood about the mechanism by which the intracellular concentration of human ER mannosidase I is regulated, except that no transcriptional control has thus far been detected (23.Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Weissman J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 345-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24.Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of ER mannosidase I likely contributes to the establishment of an equitable quality control standard by which the efficiency of glycoprotein conformational maturation can be measured. Therefore, the intracellular fate of the recombinant protein was monitored following biosynthesis. Herein, metabolic pulse-chase radiolabeling demonstrated that the newly synthesized molecules are targeted for lysosomal destruction by a mechanism that involves the aminoterminal cytoplasmic tail. A model is proposed in which proteolysis-driven checkpoint control of ER mannosidase I contributes to the decentralized surveillance of eukaryotic genome expression.

Metabolic radiolabeling with [35S]methionine (0.150 mCi/100-mm dish; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was performed with methioninefree medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or with medium containing inhibitors (lactacystin, 0.025 mm; kifunensine, 0.1-0.2 mm; leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml; chloroquine, 0.2 mm; brefeldin A, 0.005 mg/ml; staurosporine, 100 nm; or genistein, 0.050 mm) for 10 min, followed by a chase in serum-free Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2 mm unlabeled methionine with or without inhibitor, as appropriate. Metabolic incorporation and detection of radiolabeled phosphate into cellular proteins, plus digestion with potato acid phosphatase (Sigma), was performed as previously described.

Deletion of the hERManI Amino-terminal Cytoplasmic TailâPrograms TMpred from the ExPASy website (us.expasy.org/tools) were used for the identification of amino acids that comprise the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of hERManI (accession number NM_007230). PCR was used to modify the hERManI cDNA (accession number NM_007230) to encode a recombinant protein in which the entire amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail was deleted. Priming from nucleotides 234 to 251 was performed with primer HindIIIÎT. (5â²-CGAAGCTTCAGCGGAATATGATTCTC) that contained a HindIII site at the 5â² end. Primer ERMITAGRI (5â²-GGAATTCTCCACCCTAGGCAGGGGTCC) was used for priming from nucleotides 2106 to 2087 and contained an EcoRI site at the 3â²-end. The 1.9-kb PCR fragment was purified and subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) for sequence confirmation and then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) to generate phERManI(NT)/pCDNA3.1Zeo(+). The methionine residue originally located at position 49 in wild type hER-ManI (accession number NM_007230) was used as the new start codon for expression of the recombinant âno tailâ protein, hERManI(NT). Positive bacterial transformants were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. Expression of the encoded protein in mammalian cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of the mammalian cell extracts following transfection (14.Cabral C.M. Choudhury P.

Design of Fluorescent Fusion ProteinsâFor the expression of fluorescent fusion proteins that contain the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and a significant portion of the lumenal stem of hERManI (accession number NM_007230), a 500-bp EcoRI (5â²-end)-BamHI (nucleotide 569) fragment was purified from DNA construct hERManI/pCDNA3.1Zeo(+) (18.Wu Y.

To specifically eliminate the cytoplasmic tail, a 350-bp HindIII-BamHI fragment purified from plasmid hERManI/pCDNA3.1Zeo(+) (18.Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Positive bacterial transformants were identified by restriction enzyme digestion, and the encoded recombinant proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against GFP, RFP (red fluorescent protein) (Invitrogen), and hERManI after transfection into mammalian cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopyâ24 h-post transfection, the cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates for an additional 24 h, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, air-dried at room temperature, and fixed in methanol for 5 min. For indirect immunofluorescent staining, fixed cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 detergent at room temperature for 1 h and then subjected to the primary antibody reactions at 4 Â°C overnight using a goat polyclonal antibody against lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) (1:200 dilution) and the appropriate rabbit polyclonal ERManI antibody (1:200 dilution). Secondary antibody reactions were performed at room temperature, for 1 h, using anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red. For high resolution studies, after mounting in GEL/MOUNT TM (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope system and then analyzed with LSM 510 software and Adobe Photoshop v7. Rapid Intracellular Turnover of Transfected Recombinant Human ER Mannosidase IâModification of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by ER mannosidase I is the rate-limiting step for GERAD in H1A cells (14.Cabral C.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, its experimentally elevated concentration can inappropriately target newly synthesized wild type glycoproteins into GERAD (18.Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our immediate objective was to test the prediction that the human homolog is subject to tight intracellular regulation. According to ECL Western blotting of cell lysates, the transiently expressed recombinant human ER mannosidase I was absent from mock transfected cells but detected as a single immunoreactive 79-kDa band following transient expression (Fig. 2A). A combination of metabolic pulse-chase radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation allowed us to monitor the fate of the protein following a 10-min pulse with [35S]methionine. The entire radiolabeled cohort rapidly disappeared from cells (TÂ½ = 20 min) and was absent from the medium (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that its loss was not caused by secretion. Involvement of Lysosomal HydrolasesâBecause immunoreactive recombinant human ER mannosidase I was not detected in the insoluble fraction of the Nonidet P-40 cell lysates (data not shown), we concluded that intracellular degradation, rather than insolubility, was responsible for our observation. In mammalian cells, 26 S proteasomes and lysosomes are the two major systems by which proteins are degraded (29.Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To determine whether either might be responsible for the rapid turnover of transfected human recombinant ER mannosidase I, metabolic pulse-chase radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation were repeated in cells that had been incubated with specific inhibitors of either system. Incubation with lactacystin (0.025-0.1 mm), an irreversible inhibitor of multicatalytic proteasomes (30.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), had only a minor effect on the disappearance of radiolabeled human ER mannosidase I (Fig. 3A, Lct) as compared with control (Fig. 3A, Co) during a 120-min chase. Elevated concentrations of the inhibitor did not prove to be more effective (data not shown). In contrast, the entire cohort was detectable following the same period in which the medium was supplemented with chloroquine (Fig. 3A, Clq), a lysosomotrophic amine capable of raising the pH of acidic intracellular compartments. To verify this observation, the cells were incubated in medium containing ammonium chloride, another lysosomotrophic amine (31.Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although the treatment exerted a stabilizing effect (data not shown), the apparent cytotoxicity precluded any accurate interpretation of the results. Therefore, incubation with medium supplemented with the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin (32.Gordon S.R. DeMoss J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was performed as an alternative method to test our hypothesis. Under these conditions, intracellular turnover of pulse-radiolabeled recombinant human ER mannosidase I was substantially inhibited (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the observations reflected a cellular response to the elevation of total ER mannosidase I activity, the fate of the recombinant protein was monitored in transfected cells incubated with kifunensine, a general membrane-permeable inhibitor of Î±-mannosidase activity (33.Weng S. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the manipulation exerted no apparent stabilizing effect (Fig. 3A, Kif). Furthermore, enzymatic inactivation of recombinant human ER mannosidase I in response to the addition of a Myc tag to the carboxyl terminus, as previously reported (18.Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), did not hinder the rate of intracellular turnover (data not shown), negating the notion that the glycosidase instability reflected a cellular response to the elevated mannosidase activity. Lysosome-mediated Destabilization of Endogenous Mouse ER Mannosidase IâWe asked whether the endogenous mouse ER mannosidase I is subject to rapid intracellular turnover, because this would be predicted if instability of the human homolog reflected a physiologically relevant process. For this, a peptide-specific antiserum was generated to monitor the fate of newly synthesized endogenous mouse ER mannosidase I in mock transfected H1A cells (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). A slight cross-reaction with the human homolog (not shown) was not problematic because the analyses were performed in nontransfected cells. As previously observed for the recombinant human homolog, the entire cohort of newly synthesized endogenous mouse ER mannosidase I was rapidly depleted from Nonidet P-40 cell lysates following a 10-min pulse without detection in the chase medium (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, the rate of disappearance (Fig. 4B) and pattern of stabilization with cell-permeable inhibitors (Fig. 4C) was comparable with that of the transfected human homolog (Fig. 3A). Physiologic Relevance of ER Mannosidase I DestabilizationâBecause short-lived proteins undergo intracellular depletion in response to the inhibition of protein synthesis, the intracellular concentration of endogenous mouse ER mannosidase I was examined following a 1-h incubation in regular growth medium supplemented with cycloheximide. ECL Western blotting of Nonidet P-40 lysates demonstrated that the inhibition of translation resulted in a reduction in the level of the endogenous mouse homolog (Fig. 5, compare A and B). The absence of any demonstrable change in the intracellular concentration of the long-lived ER resident molecular chaperone grp78/BiP (34.Wooden S.K. Li L.J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as compared with control (Fig. 5A, lower panel), provided confirmatory evidence for the short intracellular half-life of ER mannosidase I under normal conditions. The data were then exploited to investigate the effect of cycloheximide treatment on the intracellular fate of a terminally misfolded genetic variant of Î±1-antitrypsin, designated null(Hong Kong), which is a well established substrate for glycoprotein ERAD (14.Cabral C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2091118116,"The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is one of the tightest blood-tissue barriers in mammals. As such, it poses a challenge to deliver any drugs to the seminiferous epithelium of the testis, such as a nonhormonal male contraceptive. To circumvent this problem, a genetically engineered follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) mutant protein was produced in Spodoptera furgiperda (Sf)-9 insect cells to serve as a testis-specific carrier. Subsequently, a 22-amino acid peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of occludin, which was known to disrupt BTB integrity in vivo, was inserted to the FSH mutant by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as chemical cross-linking. This molecule was found to have negligible hormonal activity but was still capable of binding to FSH receptors, which are restricted to Sertoli cells in mammals. When this FSH mutant-occludin peptide conjugate was administered to adult rats at 40 microg/adult rat (approximately 300 gm b.w.) via intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection, it induced transient and reversible disruption of the BTB, while at 150 microg/rat, it induced partial germ cell loss from the testis, particularly elongating/elongate spermatids. Most importantly, this effect was limited to the BTB without compromising the TJ-barrier integrity or cell adhesion in epithelia of other organs, such as kidney, liver, and small intestine. In summary, the use of an FSH mutant-occludin peptide conjugate is a feasible nanodevice to transiently compromise the BTB."
https://openalex.org/W2084180123,"The tetraspanin superfamily proteins play important roles in organizing membrane protein complexes, modulating integrin function, and controlling T cell adhesion. Tetraspanins such as CD82 contain two extracellular loops with its N terminus, C terminus, and inner loop exposed to the cytoplasm. The matrix (MA) domain of human T cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), Gag interacts with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and is concentrated at tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. To understand the basis of this association, we generated site-directed mutations in the various domains of CD82 and used coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization approaches to examine interactions with HTLV-1 MA. The large extracellular loop of CD82, which is important for interactions with integrins, was not required for the association with HTLV-1 MA. The cytoplasmic N terminus and C terminus of CD82 were also dispensable for CD82-MA interactions. In contrast, mutations of conserved amino acids in the inner loop of CD82 or of palmitoylated cysteines that flank the inner loop diminished CD82 association with MA. HTLV-1 MA also interacted with the inner loop of CD81. Thus, association of HTLV-1 Gag with tetraspanin-enriched microdomains is mediated by the inner loops of CD81 and CD82.

In contrast, mutations of conserved amino acids in the inner loop of CD82 or of palmitoylated cysteines that flank the inner loop diminished CD82 association with MA. HTLV-1 MA also interacted with the inner loop of CD81. Thus, association of HTLV-1 Gag with tetraspanin-enriched microdomains is mediated by the inner loops of CD81 and CD82. The tetraspanins are a large family of four transmembrane domain-containing proteins that are widely expressed in many cell types and tissues. The proteins of this family interact laterally with each other and with other transmembrane proteins to form tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains (TEMs), 2The abbreviations used are: TEM, tetraspanin-enriched microdomain; LEL, large extracellular loop; TM, transmembrane domain; IL, inner loop; MA, matrix protein; HTLV-1, human T cell leukemia virus, type 1; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; coIP, coimmunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. also referred to as the tetraspanin web (1Hemler M.E.

Tetraspanins modulate the activities of molecules that are organized within the web and alter their function. They help to provide a scaffold of adhesion proteins associated with signaling complexes that link cell surface molecules to the cytoskeleton. The molecular partners for various tetraspanins include integrins, growth factor receptors, major histocompatibility complex molecules, CD4, CD8, Ig-like protein EWI-2, EWI-F, uroplakins, rhodopsin, and others (5Boucheix C.

Cells of the human immune system express specific tetraspanins, such as CD82, CD81, CD53, CD63, and CD231, which play important roles in cell spreading, adhesion, motility, synapse formation, BCR and TCR signaling, and antigen presentation (2Levy S.

Tetraspanins contain four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, a small inner cytoplasmic loop, and intracellular N and C termini (Fig. 1) (7Levy S. Shoham T.

The large extracellular loop (LEL) shows the greatest sequence diversity among tetraspanin domains and is responsible for lateral interactions with specific membrane partners such as integrins. The LEL has between two and four intramolecular disulfide bonds, depending on the tetraspanin, that are essential for the structure required for specific protein-protein interactions. Less is known about the small extracellular loop except that it is believed to be required for optimal function of the LEL (10Wright M.D. Moseley G.W. van Spriel A.B. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM4) stabilize individual tetraspanins during biosynthesis and also contain polar residues that promote associations within and between tetraspanins and other transmembrane molecules. Tetraspanins are palmitoylated on highly conserved cysteine residues located on the cytoplasmic side of each transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). Palmitoylation of tetraspanins is important for their proper function and associations with integrins and other tetraspanins (13Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. Sawada S. Gilbert E. J. Biol.

Tetraspanins also associate with cytosolic proteins such as phosphoinositide 4-kinase and protein kinase CÎ±, and these associations appear to be mediated by the N or C termini of tetraspanins (18Berditchevski F.

Some tetraspanins have a tyrosine-based internalization motif in the C terminus that is involved in protein trafficking between plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments (Fig. 1) (21Rous B.A. Reaves B.J.

Specific functions or interactions of the inner loop have not been demonstrated. Human T cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), is a deltaretrovirus, etiologically associated with adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (22Manns A. Hisada M. La Grenade L. Lancet. 1999; 353: 1951-1958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 23Uchiyama T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 15-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The virus infects both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo and appears to spread by cell-cell contact. The viral Gag protein is necessary and sufficient to direct virion assembly and release at the plasma membrane (24Heidecker G. Lloyd P.A. Fox K. Nagashima K. Derse D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6636-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that HTLV-1 Gag assembly and release are targeted to TEMs (25Mazurov D. Heidecker G. Derse D. Virology. 2006; 346: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In particular, we showed that the MA domain of HTLV-1 Gag interacts with CD82-containing regions of the plasma membrane, because antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD82 on the cell surface caused intracellular Gag to concentrate at the patches of CD82. Also, Gag trafficked with CD82 to the site of immune synapse formation, suggesting that this association may facilitate HTLV-1 transmission. Finally, CD82 and HTLV-1 MA were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts under Brij97 detergent lysis conditions, which preserve the tetraspanin web. It has been reported that HIV-1 assembly and release also occur at tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains (26Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether these are the same TEMs that are targeted by HTLV-1 Gag. The mechanisms by which retroviral Gag proteins are targeted to and associate with TEMs are not known. In this study, we have analyzed the interaction of HTLV-1 Gag with TEMs by determining whether HTLV-1 Gag associates directly with CD82 or indirectly with a molecular partner of CD82. By mutating various domains of CD82, we show that the inner loop of CD82 is important for mediating the interaction with HTLV-1 Gag. Cell CultureâJurkat E6-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml. Human 293T cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml, nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen). Antibodies and ReagentsâAnti-human tetraspanin antibodies were anti-CD82 clone B-L2 (Serotec, UK) and clone MC8D12 (gift from Filatov A.V., Institute of Immunology, Moscow, Russia). Monoclonal anti-FLAG clone M2 was purchased from Sigma. Anti-HTLV-1 p19 (MA) monoclonal antibody 46/6.11.1.3 was from Zeptometrix (Buffalo, NY), and rabbit polyclonal anti-HTLV-1 p19(MA) SP-61 was a gift from S. Oroszlan (Frederick, MD). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 350, 488, and 546 (all from Molecular Probes), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse TrueBlotâ¢ horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (eBioscience). Wheat germ agglutinin Alexa 350 and concanavalin A tetramethylrhodamine conjugates were purchased from Molecular Probes. Plasmids and TransfectionsâThe CD82 cDNA expression plasmid pCMV-CD82 was generated from poly(A)+ RNA from the HTLV-1-infected cell line MS9 by reverse transcription-PCR using standard protocols (25Mazurov D. Heidecker G. Derse D. Virology. 2006; 346: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The plasmid pOTB7, encoding human CD81 cDNA, was purchased from Open Biosystems. The CD81 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pCMVPA. Either enhanced YFP or FLAG were fused to the N terminus of CD82 and CD81 through a Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Ser linker. Gene fusions and site-directed mutations of CD82 and CD81 were performed by standard PCR methods, and all clones were verified by nucleotide sequencing. HTLV-1 expression plasmids were pCMV-HT1, which expresses the full-length genome under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and pCMVHTÎEnv, which has a deletion in the env gene (28Derse D. Hill S.A. Lloyd P.A. Chung H.K. Morse B.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Derse D. Mikovits J. Polianova M. Felber B.K. Ruscetti F. J.

Retrovirol. 1996; 12: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation. HeLa cells were transiently transfected overnight using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Jurkat cells (5 Ã 106 cells) were electroporated with 5 Î¼g of DNA using Cell Line Nucleofectorâ¢ kit V and Nucleofectorâ¢ I apparatus (Amaxa Biosystems) (program S-18) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingâHuman 293T cells were collected 30 h after transfection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracted in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Brij97 (Sigma), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and protein inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). After 1 h of extraction at 4 Â°C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 10 min, and lysates were precleared at 4 Â°C with a mixture of normal mouse and rabbit IgG-loaded protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and again with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 Â°C with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads that had been preloaded with specific antibodies. After rinsing four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, immune complexes were eluted by heating at 80 Â°C in SDS sample loading buffer (without reducing agent), resolved by 4â12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.02% Tween (Sigma) (PBST), probed with primary antibodies, washed with PBST, and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) for direct immunoblots or with TrueBlotâ¢ horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (eBioscience) for immunoprecipitates; the latter recognizes only native mouse IgG after immunoprecipitation. Blots were washed again and immunoreactive bands were detected with ChemiGlowÂ® reagent on an AlphaImager (Alpha Innotec). The Spot Denso analysis tool in FluorChem SP software was used to measure the chemiluminescent intensity of bands on immunoblots. Because mutations often affected expression or immunoprecipitation of CD82, we expressed the amount of p19 (MA dimer) that coprecipitated with CD82 as a relative coIP value. The relative coIP is defined as the ratio of the immunoprecipitated p19 (MA dimer) relative to the amount of wild type or mutated CD82 that was immunoprecipitated. This value was normalized to the level of p19 detected by immunoblotting of each cell extract. The relative coIP values were normalized to the value determined with wild type CD82, which was set at 1. In experiments where CD82 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, the integrated density of both mature and immature proteins was used. [3H]Palmitate Labelingâ25â30 h after transfection, 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated in 10 ml of DMEM for 3 h (starvation). Cells were then metabolically labeled in 4 ml of DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, containing 0.2 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA with inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) and immunoprecipitated with antibodies as described above. Samples were resolved by 4â12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was fixed in isopropyl alcohol: water:acetic acid (25:65:10) for 1 h, soaked in Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, and dried under vacuum at 80 Â°C for 2 h. Kodak-MR film was directly exposed to the gel at -70 Â°C for 2â4 weeks. Immunofluorescent MicroscopyâSixteen hours after transfection, live Jurkat cells were isolated by gradient centrifugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (ICN) and washed with PBS. Cells were adhered to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips in PBS for 30 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min, washed, and permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) containing 1% normal goat serum in PBS. HTLV-1 matrix protein was stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-HTLV-1 p19 antibody, and CD82 was stained with mouse anti-FLAG antibody; antibodies were added directly to permeabilization solution for 30 min and washed once with permeabilization solution and twice with PBS. Secondary donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody and goat anti-mouse Alexa 546 antibody were added in permeabilizing solution in the presence of 1% normal donkey serum for another 30 min. After washing, coverslips were transferred to slides and maintained in the ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Slides were analyzed on a Delta Vision RT deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, LLC). Image data were analyzed with the SoftWoRx Imaging Work station. Colocalization of HTLV-1 p19 with CD82 was estimated through all Z-stacks of individual cells as the Pearson Coefficient of Correlation (full colocalization is 1.0). We previously showed that HTLV-1 Gag localizes to tetraspanin-enriched microdomains in the plasma membrane and that a dimer of HTLV-1 MA coimmunoprecipitates with CD82 from cell extracts prepared in extraction buffers containing Brij97 detergent (25Mazurov D. Heidecker G. Derse D. Virology. 2006; 346: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). If HTLV-1 Gag associates directly with CD82, it is likely to interact with a region of the protein exposed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, top), because Gag is an intracellular protein, anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by myristate modification and specific amino acids in the MA domain (31Le Blanc I. Blot V. Bouchaert I. Salamero J. Goud B. Rosenberg A.R. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Le Blanc I. Rosenberg A.R. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Gag may interact with transmembrane proteins that are laterally associated with CD82, such as the integrins. These lateral interactions are largely mediated by the LEL of CD82. We have tested these possibilities by examining the association of Gag with CD82 proteins that contain mutations in the LEL or in the cytoplasmic domains. Mutation of the Large Extracellular Loop of CD82 Does Not Alter Gag-CD82 AssociationâThe LEL of CD82 contains four cysteines, which form two disulfide bonds that are invariant among tetraspanins and are essential for forming the tertiary structure of this domain. Mutation of either pair of cysteines results in dramatic structural changes of the LEL and abolishes interaction of the tetraspanin protein with its partners, as was shown for the lateral association of CD151 with Î±3Î²1-integrin (33Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted disulfide bonds for CD82 are Cys149âCys216 and Cys150âCys176 (11Bienstock R.J. Barrett J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 32: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mutated CD82 protein designated as SSG was altered such that cysteines at positions 149 and 150 were replaced with serines (Fig. 2A). Human 293T cells were cotransfected with an HTLV-1 Gag expression vector in combination with either wild type or SSG CD82 expression plasmids in which a FLAG epitope tag was appended to the N terminus of CD82. The MC8D12 antibody recognizes a structural epitope on CD82 LEL and does not recognize the reduced form of CD82 on immunoblots (25Mazurov D. Heidecker G. Derse D. Virology. 2006; 346: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the MC8D12 antibody did not recognize SSG CD82 on immunoblots, indicating that the SSG mutation altered the structure of the LEL. Immunoprecipitation of CD82 with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HTLV-1 p19(MA) antibody revealed that the MA dimer coimmunoprecipitated with both wild type and SSG CD82 (Fig. 2A). When expressed as the ratio of MA to CD82 in immunoprecipitates (in order to account for differences in expression and immunoprecipitation of wild type and mutated CD82 proteins), there was no significant difference in the amounts of MA coprecipitated with wild type and SSG CD82 proteins (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). These data suggest that the LEL, or cellular proteins that associate with the LEL, are not involved in the interaction between CD82 and HTLV-1 Gag. This result was somewhat surprising because SSG CD82 showed drastic changes in cellular localization compared with wild type CD82 when the YFP-tagged versions of the two proteins were expressed in HeLa or Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast to wild type CD82-YFP, which localized to the plasma membrane, the SSG-YFP protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Retention of the SSG protein in the ER and accumulation of immature (unglycosylated) protein in the cell (Fig. 2A) likely result from misfolding of the LEL (34Cannon K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Cytoplasmic Termini of CD82 Are Not Required for Association with HTLV-1 GagâTo determine whether the N-terminal or C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of CD82 are involved in the association with HTLV-1 Gag, we generated three mutated versions of CD82 shown at the top of Fig. 3. At the C terminus, a premature stop codon in C-tr CD82 deletes the last 13 amino acids of the protein. We also mutated the YXXÃ internalization motif (where Ã is a large hydrophobic amino acid) in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD82; the YSKV sequence was mutated to LSKR (Fig. 3, top). In addition, we constructed a deletion mutant at the N terminus of CD82, designated as N-tr, which lacks the first 9 amino acids of CD82. The wild type and mutated CD82 expression plasmids were cotransfected into 293T cells with the HTLV-1 Gag expression vector. Proteins were examined by immunoblotting the cell extracts or the proteins recovered after immunoprecipitation with anti-CD82 antibody (Fig. 3). HTLV-1 MA was detected in immunoprecipitates of cell extracts containing wild type CD82 (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Although the overall expression of N-tr CD82 was higher than wild type, the amount of this mutated protein in immunoprecipitates was much lower than wild type CD82. When the ratio of HTLV-1 MA to mutated CD82 protein in immunoprecipitates is expressed relative to the fraction calculated for wild type CD82 (set at 1), it is clear that the mutations in the N or C termini of CD82 (C-tr or LSKR) did not significantly affect association with MA (Fig. 3, histogram). We also expressed the wild type and mutated CD82 plasmids in HeLa cells and did not observe any differences in membrane distribution or intracellular localization (data not shown). These data indicate that the N terminus and C terminus of CD82 are not required for association with HTLV-1 MA. Palmitoylation of CD82 Is Required for Association with HTLV-1 Gagâ Tetraspanins have highly conserved juxtamembrane Cys residues (Fig. 1), and in the few tetraspanins that have been studied, these cysteines are palmitoylated (14Charrin S. Manie S. Oualid M. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CD82 is palmitoylated on Cys residues at positions 5, 74, 83, 251, and 253 (17Zhou B. Liu L. Reddivari M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7455-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We constructed a mutated CD82, designated as Palm-, in which all five cysteines were replaced by serines (Fig. 4). We also generated mutated CD82 plasmids designated as P1, P2, and P3. In P1, the Cys at position 5 is replaced by Ser; P2 has Ser in place of Cys at positions 74 and 83, flanking the cytoplasmic loop; and P3 has Ser in place of Cys at positions 251 and 253 in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. We confirmed that Palm- CD82 was not palmitoylated (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5The mutated CD82 protein designated Palm- is not palmitoylated and does not colocalize with HTLV-1 Gag in transfected cells. A, human 293T cells were transfected with wild type (wt) CD82, Palm- CD82, or CD81 expression plasmids and metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-CD82 or anti-CD81 antibodies, resolved by 4â12% SDS-PAGE, and exposed to film for 3 weeks. Wild type CD82 and CD81 but not Palm- CD82 incorporated [3H]palmitic acid. B, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding enhanced YFP-tagged CD82 or Palm- CD82. Representative images of the cells with optical section adjacent to the plastic substrate are shown. C, Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged versions of wild type CD82 (upper panels), Palm- CD82 (middle panels), or ILC CD82 (lower panel) in combination with the HTLV-1 expression plasmid pCMV-HT1. Cells were fixed and stained 16 h after transfection with anti-HTLV-1 p19 (MA) antibody and anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Representative images with optical slice through the middle of the cells are shown. Colocalization of p19 and CD82 was quantified for eight individual cells from each sample, as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The Pearson coefficient of correlation was 0.71 Â± 0.13 for wild type CD82, 0.21 Â± 0.08 for Palm- CD82, and 0.29 Â± 0.13 for ILC CD82, indicating that neither of these mutated CD82 proteins was significantly colocalized with HTLV-1 Gag.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 293T cells were cotransfected with the HTLV-1 Gag expression vector in combination with wild type or mutated CD82 plasmids. Association between HTLV-1 Gag and mutated versions of CD82 was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-CD82 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-HTLV-1 p19 (MA) antibody. Palm- CD82 was expressed at higher levels than wild type CD82, but roughly equal amounts of the two proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (Fig. 4). The amount of MA, relative to CD82, which coprecipitated with Palm- CD82 was only about 2% of the amount of MA that precipitated with wild type CD82 (Fig. 4). The mutation of the Cys in the N terminus of CD82 (P1) resulted in a decreased association with HTLV-1 MA to about 37% of the wild type. Mutations of the Cys residues flanking the cytoplasmic loop (P2) or in the C terminus (P3) of CD82 resulted in reductions in MA coprecipitation to values less than 20% compared with wild type CD82 (Fig. 4, histogram). Thus, palmitoylation has a cumulative effect on the ability of CD82 to interact with HTLV-1 MA. This is consistent with other reports showing the importance of palmitoylation on the functional activity and lateral interactions of tetraspanins with other membrane proteins (17Zhou B. Liu L. Reddivari M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7455-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also examined the intracellular localization of Palm- CD82 in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B) and its colocalization with HTLV-1 Gag in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 5C). The Palm- CD82-YFP fusion protein was expressed at higher levels than the wild type CD82-YFP in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B), consistent with relative levels of the two proteins detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). There was no discernable difference in the localization of the two fusion proteins, and both proteins localized to the microvilli of adherent cells (Fig. 5B). Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the HTLV-1 Gag expression vector and vectors expressing FLAG-tagged versions of wild type or Palm- CD82. In Jurkat cells, both wild type and Palm- CD82 were detected in the complex Golgi (round shape"

Several chemicals were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit this enzyme, and a series of estradiol derivatives bearing a lactone on the D-ring were found to inhibit its activity efficiently. The crystal structure of the type 5 enzyme in complex with NADP and such a novel inhibitor, EM1404, was determined to a resolution of 1.30AÃ¥. Significantly more hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were defined between EM1404 and the enzyme than in the substrate ternary complex. The lactone ring of EM1404 accounts for important interactions with the enzyme, whereas the amide group at the opposite end of the inhibitor contributes to the stability of three protein loops involved in the construction of the substrate binding site. EM1404 has a strong competitive inhibition, with a Ki of 6.9 Â± 1.4 nm, demonstrating 40 times higher affinity than that of the best inhibitor previously reported. This is observed despite the fact that the inhibitor occupies only part of the binding cavity. Attempts to soak the inhibitor into crystals of the binary complex with NADP were unsuccessful, yielding a structure with a polyethylene glycol fragment occupying the substrate binding site. The relative crystal packing is discussed. Combined studies of small molecule inhibitor synthesis, x-ray crystallography, enzyme inhibition, and molecular modeling make it possible to analyze the plasticity of the substrate binding site of the enzyme, which is essential for developing more potent and specific inhibitors for hormone-dependent cancer therapy.

According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor, excluding skin cancers, in American men. It is estimated that â¼232,090 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the US during 2005 with 30,350 deaths (www.cancer.org). The growth and function of the prostate is dependent on androgens, which play important roles in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (1Lopez-Otin C. Diamandis E.P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Androgen withdrawal triggers the programmed cell apoptosis in both normal prostate glandular epithelia and androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells do not initiate the programmed cell death pathway upon androgen withdrawal; however, they do retain the cellular machinery necessary to activate the apoptotic cascade when sufficiently damaged by exogenous agents (2Denmeade S.R. Lin X.S. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1996; 28: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer, the balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death is lost, thus more cell proliferation results in net cell growth. An important finding in prostate cancer research is that â¼50% of dihydrotestosterone, the most potent natural androgen, remains in the prostatic tissue of patients who have undergone surgical or chemical castration (3Labrie F. Dupont A. Belanger A. Giguere M. Lacoursiere Y. Emond J. Monfette G. Bergeron V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In fact, prostatic tissue is able to efficiently transform the inactive adrenal steroid precursor dehydroepiandrosterone, into the active androgen dihydrotestosterone, in a new androgen biosynthetic pathway in which human type 5 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Î²-HSD5) 4The abbreviations used are: 17Î²-HSD5, 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5; AKR, aldoketo reductase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; EM1404, 3-carboxamido-1,3,5-(10)-estratrien-17(R)-spiro-2â²-(5â²,5â²-dimethyl-6â²-oxo)tetrahydropyran, C25H30O3N; E2, estradiol. 4The abbreviations used are: 17Î²-HSD5, 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5; AKR, aldoketo reductase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; EM1404, 3-carboxamido-1,3,5-(10)-estratrien-17(R)-spiro-2â²-(5â²,5â²-dimethyl-6â²-oxo)tetrahydropyran, C25H30O3N; E2, estradiol. is involved (4Pelletier G.

In practice, hormonal therapy with combined androgen blockade could lead to even longer term control of localized prostate cancer (8Labrie F. Dupont A. Belanger A. Cusan L. Lacourciere Y. Monfette G.

It has been proven that this enzyme has a relatively high 17Î²-HSD activity that transforms Î4-androstene-3,17-dione (4-dione, a weak androgen) to testosterone (a potent androgen). This enzyme has been immunocytochemically localized in human prostate tissues, and it has been proposed to contribute to local androgen formation in prostate (4Pelletier G. Luu-The V. Tetu B.

Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The enzyme conformational change during 4-dione to testosterone conversion was demonstrated by the first crystal structures of 17Î²-HSD5 in complex with either 4-dione or testosterone (18Qiu W. X-ray Crystallographic Studies on Human Estrogenic Type 1 and Androgenic Type 5 17beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases, Ph.D. dissertation, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. 2002; Google Scholar, 19Qiu W. Zhou M. Labrie F. Lin S-X. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 11-ketoreductase activity of this enzyme has also been studied in association with prostaglandin D2 and some inhibitors (20Komoto J. Yamada T. Watanabe K. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Lovering A.L. Ride J.P. Bunce C.M. Desmond J.C. Cummings S.M. White S.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Blockade of this enzyme could lead to the activation of a nuclear receptor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³), which induces cell differentiation, and results in apoptosis in many cell types and cancers (22Wick M. Hurteau G. Dessev C. Chan D. Geraci M.W. Winn R.A. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Desmond J.C. Mountford J.C.

The gene that encodes 17Î²-HSD5 was assigned to human chromosome bands 10p15 and p14 (24Rheault P. Dufort I. Soucy P. Luu-The V. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 241-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 17Î²-HSD5 mRNA was also reported to be expressed in prostate cancer tissues (25Koh E. Noda T. Kanaya J. Namiki M. Prostate. 2002; 53: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In a recent study, 17Î²-HSD5 immunoreactivity was detected in 77% of carcinoma cells from prostate cancer tissues and was positively associated with the clinical stage of the disease (17Nakamura Y. Suzuki T. Nakabayashi M. Endoh M. Sakamoto K. Mikami Y. Moriya T. Ito A. Takahashi S. Yamada S. Arai Y. Sasano H. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This provides some evidence that 17Î²-HSD5 may possibly be involved in the increase of the local concentration of testosterone. Both reductive and oxidative 17Î²-HSD activities are present in prostate tissue (26Bartsch W. Greeve J. Voigt K.D. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1987; 28: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Martel C. Rheaume E. Takahashi M. Trudel C. Couet J. Luu-The V. Simard J. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), assumed by different members of the 17Î²-HSD family members. Using the androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line as a cell model to study the progression of prostate cancer, it has been reported that substantial changes in androgen and estrogen metabolism occur in the cells during this process. A remarkable decrease in the oxidative 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was seen, whereas the reductive activity (including 17Î²-HSD5 and 17Î²-HSD7) seemed to increase (28Soronen P. Laiti M. Torn S. Harkonen P. Patrikainen L. Li Y. Pulkka A. Kurkela R. Herrala A. Kaija H. Isomaa V. Vihko P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 92: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that 17Î²-HSD5 mRNA expression was significantly higher in breast tumor specimens than in normal tissue after analysis of 794 breast carcinoma specimens by tissue microarray and normal histologic sections (29Oduwole O.O. Li Y. Isomaa V.V. Mantyniemi A. Pulkka A.E. Soini Y. Vihko P.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7604-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This suggests that the ability of 17Î²-HSD5 to regulate estrogen metabolism may play an important role in breast cancer development. It is also interesting to point out that 17Î²-HSD5 plays an important site-specific role in androgen generation in adipose tissue in women with simple obesity (30Quinkler M. Sinha B. Tomlinson J.W. Bujalska I.J. Stewart P.M. Arlt W. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 183: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of this enzyme, not only in prostate cancer research but also in other hormone-related diseases, the design of an inhibitor targeting this key enzyme has been widely pursued (31Krazeisen A. Breitling R. Moller G. Adamski J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 505: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Lin H.K. Ma H. Moore M. Ratnam K.

Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of 17Î²-HSD5 is a necessary prerequisite for structure-based drug design. The enzyme was first crystallized in our laboratory (36Zhou M. Qiu W. Chang H.J. Gangloff A. Lin S.X. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and structures in complex with testosterone or 4-dione were determined (18Qiu W. X-ray Crystallographic Studies on Human Estrogenic Type 1 and Androgenic Type 5 17beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases, Ph.D. dissertation, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. 2002; Google Scholar, 19Qiu W. Zhou M. Labrie F. Lin S-X. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To date, eight crystal structures of AKR1C3 in different complexes have been published (18Qiu W. X-ray Crystallographic Studies on Human Estrogenic Type 1 and Androgenic Type 5 17beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases, Ph.D. dissertation, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. 2002; Google Scholar, 20Komoto J. Yamada T. Watanabe K. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Lovering A.L. Ride J.P. Bunce C.M. Desmond J.C. Cummings S.M. White S.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The plasticity of its substrate binding site in accommodating different ligands and its importance in hormone-related diseases led us to investigate further the structure-function relationships of this enzyme. The functional plasticity of the AKR1C3 as well as 1C1 and 1C2 enzymes has been discussed by Penning and colleagues previously (37Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.F. Lin H.K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Being aware that any subtle difference at the active site could be important for structure-based inhibitor design, we have studied the active site of the enzyme in detail by comparing the different docking properties of various inhibitors and ligands in the crystallographic structures. In this study, we report the crystal structure of 17Î²-HSD5 in complex with a potent inhibitor EM1404 and another structure with a segment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) made from 6 ethylene glycol units (C12H25O6) bound in the active site. Enzyme inhibition by EM1404 was also studied, and the comparison with other inhibitors has been discussed. Furthermore, we intended to explore the interactions between this potent inhibitor and its target enzyme, 17Î²-HSD5, and to provide suggestions for the improvement of inhibitor design based on the crystal structure. Purification and CrystallizationâHuman 17Î²-HSD5-glutathione S-transferase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione S-transferase affinity column and a Blue Sepharose column as described previously (36Zhou M. Qiu W. Chang H.J. Gangloff A. Lin S.X. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After purification the protein was kept in potassium phosphate stock buffer of pH 7.5, in the presence of 10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% decylmaltoside, 1.2 mm NADP. The glutathione S-transferase tag was cleaved by overnight incubation at 4 Â°C with Thrombin protease. EM1404 was co-crystallized with 17Î²-HSD5 and NADP. Due to the low solubility of EM1404, it was first dissolved in 100% Me2SO to a concentration of 25 mm and then diluted in 100% ethanol to a final concentration of 2.5 mm as a stock solution. It was added to protein-NADP complex solution (â¼2 Î¼l of this stock solution into 2 ml of total mixture volume) to reach a final concentration of 2.5 Î¼m. The mixture was then concentrated 10-20 times before being diluted to â¼2 ml by adding the same stock buffer mentioned above. Additional EM1404 was added once more, which could be then dissolved (see âDiscussionâ). The same concentration-dilution procedure was repeated to saturate the enzyme substrate binding site by the inhibitor. The protein was finally concentrated to â¼10-15 mg/ml. The co-crystallization condition of the EM1404 ternary complex has been refined from the former conditions crystallizing testosterone and 4-dione complexes (36Zhou M. Qiu W. Chang H.J. Gangloff A. Lin S.X. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reservoir solution contained 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.24 m ammonium acetate, and 30% PEG 4000. Human 17Î²-HSD5Â·NADP crystals were obtained at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein and a reservoir solution of 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.24 m ammonium acetate. During our first attempts, 17Î²-HSD5Â·NADP (final enzyme concentration 330 Î¼m in the crystallization drop after equilibrium) binary complex crystals were soaked with repeated additions of EM1404 (final inhibitor concentration 560 Î¼m), and similar crystal space groups were obtained (Table 1)TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics of crystal structures of 17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP and 17Î²-HSD5Â·PEGÂ·NADP17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP17Î²-HSD5Â·PEGÂ·NADPData processing statisticsPDB code1ZQ52FGBSpace groupP212121P212121Unit cell (AÃ¥)a = 55.35, b = 62.78, c = 95.97a = 55.52, b = 61.65, c = 95.12Resolution range (AÃ¥)29.8-1.3047.6-1.35Highest shell range (AÃ¥)1.37-1.301.38-1.35Total reflections251,431 (23,897)aStatistics of the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.220,439 (7,354)aStatistics of the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.Unique reflections79,292 (10,401)68,648 (3,474)Mosaicity (Â°)0.320.38Multiplicity3.2 (2.3)3.2 (2.1)Completeness (%)95.9 (87.0)94.4 (65.2)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = âhklâj|Ij(hkl) - [I(hkl) ]|âhklâj|Ij(hkl)|, where Ij(hkl) and [I(hkl) ] are the intensity of measurement j and the mean intensity for the reflection with indices hkl, respectively.5.4 (42.4)6.5 (47.5)Mean(I)/Ï(I)11.9 (2.1)9.6 (2.0)Refinement statisticsReflections75,29368,644Resolution range (AÃ¥)29.8-1.3047.6-1.35Highest shell range (AÃ¥)1.33-1.301.38-1.35Rcryst (%)cRcryst and Rfree = âhkl||Fcalc(hkl)| - |Fobs(hkl)||/âhkl|Fobs|, where the crystallographic and free R-factors are calculated, including and excluding refined reflections, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Data Collection and ProcessingâBoth datasets of 17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP and 17Î²-HSD5Â·PEG fragmentÂ·NADP were collected at the X-8C beamline in National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Datasets were processed using the Mosflm (39Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; (No. 26)Google Scholar) and HKL packages (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The processing statistics data are given in Table 1. Structure Solution and RefinementâThe initial phases of 17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP was obtained from a molecular replacement method using the EPMR program (41Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A data set from 15 to 4 AÃ¥ resolution was used in molecular replacement. The coordinates of the protein structure from the 17Î²-HSD5-testosterone-NADP complex in the P21 space group were used as the starting model. A correlation coefficient factor of 0.568 and an R-factor of 41.9% were obtained before any refinement. The initial phases of 17Î²-HSD5Â·PEGÂ·NADP were obtained using a similar method. Starting from the molecular replacement model, the programs Resolve (42Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and Refmac from the CCP4 package (43Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) were used to improve phases using a statistical density modification method. Rigid body refinement was done with data from 29 to 3.0 AÃ¥ resolution. Automatic model rebuilding was carried out based on a prime-and-switch composite omit map to reduce any model bias due to refinement. Multiple refinement cycles were carried out using the program Refmac, and model building was done by the Coot program (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) based on sigma-A weighted 2Fo - Fc electron density maps. The last refinement steps were done with data from 29 to 1.30 AÃ¥ resolution. The inhibitor position was very clear in the substrate binding site from the electron density maps. An acetate molecule was also identified near the substrate and cofactor binding sites and was induced during the co-crystallization (see above). The program Coot was also used to add water into the model. In the final model, 356 water molecules were included with good hydrogen bonding geometry. Both structures have been deposited in the PDB, the ID for 17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP structure is 1ZQ5, while that for 17Î²-HSD5Â·PEG fragmentÂ·NADP is 2FGB. Inhibition StudyâA radioactive assay was used for the enzyme kinetics in the presence of EM1404 at different concentrations for its Ki determination. Purified 17Î²-HSD5, freshly frozen at -80 Â°C in small aliquots until use, has demonstrated very good reproduction of steady-state kinetics. The reactions were carried out in the presence of an excess of NADP (200 Î¼m) at pH 7.5 and 37 Â± 0.5 Â°C. The Km for testosterone oxidation in the absence of EM-1404, and four apparent Km values in the presence of 1, 3, 10, and 25 nm EM-1404, were determined. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme sample to a final concentration of 200 nm in the reaction mixture, aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken, and the reaction was stopped at different time intervals by extracting the steroids with 2.5Ã vol. of diethyl ether. The steroids were extracted, separated by TLC migration in 80% toluene and 20% acetone for a 10-cm distance, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Initial velocities were measured with <5% substrate consumption. The experiments were repeated with different concentrations of testosterone ranging from 0.8 to 10 Î¼m. To obtain an optimal signal, larger reaction mixture volumes were used for low substrate concentrations (i.e. 3-ml reaction mixtures for 0.8 Î¼m testosterone, 2 ml for 1.8 Î¼m, 1 ml for 4 Î¼m, and 0.5 ml for 10 Î¼m). All experiments were performed in duplicate. IC50 values indicated the inhibitor concentration leading to 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity under the experimental conditions described in Ref. 34Labrie F. Belanger A. Gauthier S. Luu-The V.

The values were calculate using Equation 1, 1/v=Km/Vmaxâ(1+[f]JK1)â1/[S]+1/VmaxEq. 1 where v is the initial velocity in the presence of different substrate concentrations, Vmax is the maximum velocity, and [S] and [I] are the substrate and inhibitor concentrations (48Segel L.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 57: 23-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The respective apparent Km values in the presence of different inhibitor concentrations were then plotted versus these concentrations as shown by the inset of Fig. 5, the slope of which defines Km/Ki (48Segel L.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 57: 23-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), based on the linear regression of Equation 2. Kmapp=Km(1+[f]/Ki)Eq. 2 Molecular Dynamics SimulationâThe simulations were based on the crystal structure for the complex EM1404 and the docked structure for the complex with the newly proposed inhibitor (Fig. 8C). MD simulations were performed with the program GROMACS (www.gromacs.org) version 3.3.1 (details are in the supplemental material). The GROMACS forcefield parameters were employed for the simulations. Overall StructureâThe inhibitor EM1404 (3-carboxamido-1,3,5-(10Lin H.K. Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Peehl D.M. Pachter J.A. Penning T.M. Mol.

The strong affinity of EM1404 is further proven in the inhibition mechanism study below. The ternary complex structure of 17Î²-HSD5Â·EM1404Â·NADP was determined by molecular replacement using a searching model obtained from the 17Î²-HSD5Â·testosteroneÂ·NADP complex (18Qiu W.

Here we show that nuclear receptor for oxysterols LXRÎ² prevents accumulation of cholesteryl esters in mouse myometrium by controlling expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux and storage (abca1 and abcg1). Upon treatment with an LXR agonist that mimics activation by oxysterols, expression of these target genes was increased in wild-type mice, whereas under basal conditions, lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice exhibited a marked decrease in abcg1 accumulation. This change resulted in a phenotype of cholesteryl ester accumulation. Besides, a defect of contractile activity induced by oxytocin or PGF2Î± was observed in mice lacking LXRÎ². These results imply that LXRÎ² provides a safety valve to limit cholesteryl ester levels as a basal protective mechanism in the uterus against cholesterol accumulation and is necessary for a correct induction of contractions.

These results imply that LXRÎ² provides a safety valve to limit cholesteryl ester levels as a basal protective mechanism in the uterus against cholesterol accumulation and is necessary for a correct induction of contractions. The uterus is schematically divided into two distinct zones: endometrium and myometrium. The endometrium, located in the inner part of the organ, is the site of blastocyst implantation, and its epithelium undergoes cyclic radical changes under the control of ovarian sex steroid hormones (1.Dockery P. Rogers A.W. Baillieres Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 1989; 3: 227-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); estrogens are responsible for epithelial cell hyperplasia, whereas progesterone blocks cell proliferation and induces differentiation. The myometrium (2.Berto A.G. Sampaio L.O. Franco C.R. Cesar Jr., R.M. Michelacci Y.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in the outer part of the uterus, accounts for more than 60% of the whole organ (3.McCormack S.A. Glasser S.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 1634-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and has a primordial role in uterine function. Whereas muscle quiescence due to high progesterone levels is essential during most of the pregnancy (4.Di Renzo G.C. Mattei A. Gojnic M. Gerli S. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 2005; 17: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), efficient myometrium contractility is fundamental for a normal labor (for a review, see Ref. 5.Huszar G. Roberts J.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1982; 142: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This switch results from a modification in the plasma ratio of estrogens to progesterone signal that acts as primary event of the parturition. These hormonal changes also induce an increase in the level of endometrial prostaglandins, which play a role in the initiation and maintenance of labor, acting via specific relaxatory or contractile receptors on myometrium initiating contractions (6.Myatt L. Lye S.J. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has also been demonstrated that increased production of surfactant protein A by the fetal lung near term causes activation and migration of fetal amniotic fluid macrophages to the maternal uterus, where increased production of interleukin-1Î² activates NF-ÎºB, leading to labor (7.Condon J.C. Jeyasuria P. Faust J.M. Mendelson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8.Mendelson C. Condon J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 93: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inversion of the estradiol/progesterone ratio induces the expression of OXTR (oxytocin receptor). When activated by oxytocin, a neuropeptide produced by the pituitary, this receptor has a primordial contractile activity on the myometrium during labor. Besides, lipid distribution in myometrium is modified during pregnancy in humans. Although no change in total phospholipids occurs during pregnancy (9.Pulkkinen M.O. Nyman S. Hamalainen M.M. Mattinen J. Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 1998; 46: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), modifications in membrane fluidity take place. Hence, transfers of omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential for normal fetal growth and development, from the mother to the fetus have been suggested (10.Holman R.T. Johnson S.B. Ogburn P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4835-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Likewise, an increase in local and circulating cholesterol concentrations is observed (11.Potter J. Nestel P.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1978; 87: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although the role of this plasma cholesterol increase is not clear, apart from the anabolic support for the fetus (12.Brizzi P. Tonolo G. Esposito F. Puddu L. Dessole S. Maioli M. Milia S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 181: 430-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it has been clearly established that this molecule is essential to modulate membrane receptor activity and stability, especially those of OXTR. Indeed, Gimpl and Fahrenholz (13.Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2483-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) observed an enrichment of oxytocin receptors in cholesterol-rich plasma membranes in HEK 293 fibroblast stably expressing the human oxytocin receptor. In addition, cholesterol stabilizes the receptor in a high affinity state for agonists and protects it from thermal denaturation (for a review, see Ref. 14.Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Smith et al. (15.Smith R.D. Babiychuk E.B. Noble K. Draeger A. Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C982-C988Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that an abnormal increase in the cholesterol content of uterine smooth muscle cells reduces the amplitude of contractions induced by oxytocin in rat. Moreover, cholesterol depletion with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin could increase the contractions of myometrium strips isolated from rat (15.Smith R.D. Babiychuk E.B. Noble K. Draeger A. Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C982-C988Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or guinea pig (16.Buxton I.L. Vittori J.C. Proc. West Pharmacol. Soc. 2005; 48: 126-128PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol and its derivatives are vital nutrients that may also have a major impact on gene expression, and thus their intracellular quantities must be tightly regulated. Among the various transcription factors involved in these regulations, liver X receptor Î± (LXRÎ±, NR1H3) and Î² (LXRÎ², NR1H2) play a central role (for a review, see Ref. 17.Beaven S.W. Tontonoz P. Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). They belong to a subclass of nuclear receptors that form obligate heterodimers with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors and are bound to and activated by a class of naturally occurring oxysterols (18.Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 19.Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the retinoid X receptor/LXR heterodimer is constitutively linked to specific DNA target sequences and interacts with corepressors, thus blocking transcription initiation (20.Hu X. Li S. Wu J. Xia C. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21.Wagner B.L. Valledor A.F. Shao G. Daige C.L. Bischoff E.D. Petrowski M. Jepsen K.

The use of LXR-deficient mice (lxr-/-) has also helped to elucidate the role of these nuclear receptors in various physiologic functions (17.Beaven S.W. Tontonoz P. Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and many target genes have been described, such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (22.Venkateswaran A.

In this paper, we demonstrate that LXRÎ² functions in the uterus as a sensor to prevent accumulation of cholesteryl esters by coordinately regulating expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol efflux (ABCA1 and ABCG1). Hence, mice lacking LXRÎ² present an abnormal and specific accumulation of cholesteryl esters in uterine myocytes. Besides, these animals show defects in induced contractile activity in uterus. Animalsâlxr knock-out mice (lxrÎ±-/-, lxrÎ²-/-, and lxrÎ±; Î²-/-) and their wild-type controls were maintained on a mixed strain background (C57BL/6:129Sv) and housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle (27.Cummins C.L.

For all studies shown, mice were fed ad libitum with water and Global-dietÂ® 2016S from Harlan (Gannat, France) containing 16% protein, 4% fat, and 60% carbohydrates. For all experiments, except for contractile activity assays and the mice used for experiments shown in Fig. 6, animals were treated with a superovulation protocol (intraperitoneal injection of 7 IU of pregnant mareâs serum gonadotropin on day 1, 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin on day 3) and sacrificed on day 5 at the end of metaestrus. For real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) 4The abbreviations used are: qPCR, real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; T1317, LXR agonist T0901317. experiments, mice were gavaged with 45 mg/kg T0901317 (T1317) (Cayman Chemical, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) or vehicle (methyl-cellulose) as previously described (28.Volle D.H.

For contractile activity assays and the mice used for experiments shown in Fig. 6, estrus was induced with a single injection of 10 Î¼g of estradiol benzoate (Sigma) 18 h before sacrifice. To reduce the effect of stress, the elapsed time between the capture of a mouse and its sacrifice was under 30 s. In some experiments, uteri were longitudinally cut, and the mucosa were gently scraped, as previously described for the intestine (29.Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.M.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K.

Both mucosa and muscular parts were stored in liquid N2 for RNA extraction. All aspects of animal care were approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (authorization CE1-04). Anatomy and Pathology AnalysesâUteri from 3-month-old mice were collected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin, and 5-Î¼m-thick sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin/eosin/safran. Lipid staining of each organ collected was performed on 8-Î¼m-thick cryosections with 1,2-propanediol (Sigma) for 1 min and in oil red O (Sigma) for 4 min as described (30.Frenoux J.-M. Vernet P.

Cross-sectional areas of the various parts of the uteri (circular and longitudinal muscular layers and endometrium) were quantified using Axiovision 4.2 software (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH, Le Pecq, France). For semithin sections, chemicals were from Sigma and Agar Scientific (Saclay, France). Uteri were fixed in 1.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde buffered in 0.07 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.4 containing 0.05% (w/v) ruthenium red for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were postfixed with 1% (v/v) osmium tetroxide in the same buffer devoid of ruthenium red for 1 h. Organs were then dehydrated in ethanol baths and propylene oxide (three times for 20 min) and embedded in propylene oxide and epon epikote resin (v/v) overnight and in epon twice for 3 h. Resin polymerization was conducted at 60 Â°C for 72 h. Semithin sections (0.8 Î¼m) were cut with a diamond knife (Leica Ultracut S; Rueil-Malmaison, France), and stained with azure 2 followed by the addition of 1 n NaOH to stop the reaction.

Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with primary polyclonal antibodies raised against either ABCA1 (1:500; Novus Biological, MontluÃ§on, France), ERÎ± (estrogen receptor Î±) (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ERRÎ± (estrogen-related receptor Î±) (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), progesterone receptor (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), noncleaved or cleaved SREBP1c (1:500 and 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SCD1 (stearoyl CoA-desaturase 1) (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PGF2R (PGF2Î± receptor) (1:500; Cayman Chemical), or Î²-actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a 1-h incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG (1:10,000 or 1:5000, respectively; Sigma). Peroxidase activity was detected using the Western Light System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein -fold changes were measured by densitometry of the x-ray films using Quantity One version 4.6.1 software (Bio-Rad). Measurement of Uterus Contractions in VitroâUteri were quickly dissected and carefully cleaned of surrounding fat prior to being suspended in organ baths (50 ml) filled with a Dejalon solution (155 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 0.55 mm CaCl2, 6.0 mm NaHCO3, 2.8 mm glucose, pH 7.4), equilibrated with air, and kept at 37 Â°C as described (32.Dalle M. Dauprat-Dalle P. Barlet J.P. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. Biophys. 1992; 100: 251-254PubMed Google Scholar) for measurement of tension. A resting tension (2 g) was applied to the suspended uteri. Contractions were recorded with a force-displacement transducer (MyographESAOÂ® 4, Jeulin, Evreux, France) and analyzed with SÃ©rÃ©nisÂ® software (Jeulin). Uteri were incubated with increasing concentrations of synthetic oxytocin (SyntocinonÂ®, Novartis Pharma, Rueil-Malmaison, France) or luprostiol, analogous of PGF2Î± (ProsolvinÂ®, Intervet, Angers, France). Results are expressed as a dose-response curve showing the uterine tension minus the basal tension. Statistical AnalysisâFor statistical analysis, Studentâs t test was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups. A p value of 0.05 was considered significant. Loss of LXRÎ² Results in Perturbations of Lipid Content in UterusâNo significant difference in the somatic indexes of uteri was observed among the genotypes of the wild type (0.38% Â± 0.03, n = 5), the lxrÎ±-/- mice (0.37% Â± 0.04, n = 4), the lxrÎ²-/- mice (0.40% Â± 0.02, n = 7), and the lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice (0.41% Â± 0.01, n = 5) at 3 months of age. Gross examination of uterus sections from lxr-deficient mice did not reveal any perturbation of the structures as assessed by the presence of an apparently normal endometrium, characterized by a monolayer of epithelial cells and a stroma, and the presence of circular and longitudinal layers of smooth muscle in myometrium (Fig. 1A, aâd). The uterus structure remains stable even after 12 months of age in all genotypes (data not shown). Determination of the cross-sectional area of the smooth muscle pointed out no significant variation in the various knock-out mice compared with the wild-type (Table 2). Higher magnification (Ã400) did not reveal any perturbation of the endometrium structure (data not shown), whereas vacuoles were visible in layers of myometrium from lxrÎ²-/- (Fig. 1A, g) and lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice (Fig. 1A, h), localized in the cytoplasm of myocytes (Fig. 1B). Because LXRs are known to have an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in various tissues, we examined whether some differences between wild-type and LXR-deficient mice in uterus lipid content were present. Histological analysis using oil red O staining performed on frozen sections pointed to an abnormal accumulation of neutral lipids in vacuoles observed in myometrium of lxrÎ²-/- (Fig. 1A, k) and lxrÎ±; Î²-/- (Fig. 1A, l) mice, whereas no difference among the various genotypes was seen in the endometrium (data not shown). This lipid accumulation was visible in LXRÎ²-deficient mice as young as 1 month old (data not shown). Since lxrÎ±-/- mice appeared to have no lipid-rich vacuole (Fig. 1A, j), we concluded that the phenotype was due to the absence of LXRÎ².TABLE 2Surface analysis of the cross-sectional area of the uteri Quantifications (mean Â± S.E.) represent the relative surface of each part of the uterus: endometrium and circular (CL) and longitudinal (LL) layers.

Azure 2 dye, which stains lipids in yellow, showed that these vacuoles were localized in the cytoplasm of myocytes (Fig. 1B) and did not result of an infiltration of adipose tissue within the smooth muscle, as also suggested by the absence of any significant increase levels of adipocyte marker mRNA, such as the fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) and PPARÎ± and -Î³ (peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors Î± and Î³) (see Fig. 4A). In order to determine whether this lipid accumulation was generalized to various muscles, oil red O staining was performed on frozen slides of three different types of muscle: intestine (duodenum), heart, and rough muscle (quadriceps) of 3-month-old wild-type and lxrÎ±;Î²-/- females (Fig. 1C). None of the tested tissues were stained positively, except uterine smooth muscle, which was used as a control. These data led us to suggest the existence of tissue-specific mechanisms by which LXRÎ² regulates lipid homeostasis in uterine smooth muscle. LXRÎ² Null Mice Have Elevated Uterus Cholesteryl EstersâTo determine the nature of lipids accumulated in the uterus, thin layer chromatography analyses were performed on whole lipid extracts from uteri of 3- and 12-month old mice. Although LXR-mediated triacylglycerol accumulation had already been reported in vascular smooth muscle cells (33.Davies J.D. Carpenter K.L. Challis I.R. Figg N.L. McNair R. Proudfoot D. Weissberg P.L. Shanahan C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3911-3919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), biochemical analysis revealed that only the fraction containing cholesteryl esters was significantly increased after normalizing to uterus weight at 3 months (23.5- and 37.2-fold in lxrÎ²-/- and lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice, compared with wild-type mice; p < 0.0005) and 12 months of age (27.6- and 66.5-fold in lxrÎ²-/- and lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice, compared with wild-type mice; p < 0.0005) (Fig. 2). lxrÎ±-/- mice presented the same low amount of cholesteryl esters as the wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest that the increase in the oil red O staining observed in the lxrÎ²-/- and lxrÎ±; Î²-/- uterus was due to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters. Whatever the age considered, cholesteryl ester concentration was significantly higher in lxrÎ±;Î²-/- uterus than in lxrÎ²-/-. This could suggest a mechanism of a slight redundancy between the two isoforms, where LXRÎ± could partially reverse the drastic phenotype induced by absence of LXRÎ². No significant differences in free cholesterol (Fig. 2, white bars), triacylglycerol, and phospholipid contents (data not shown) were observed among the genotypes. Both LXRÎ± and LXRÎ² Are Expressed in the Various Compartments of the UterusâThe results described above suggested that the LXR-dependent changes observed in the cholesteryl esters content were primarily due to LXRÎ². We wondered whether this specificity in the LXR isoform was due to the exclusive expression of LXRÎ² in the tissue. The presence of LXRÎ± and LXRÎ² mRNA was checked by qPCR on whole uterus as well as mucosa and muscular parts. As shown in Fig. 3, lxrÎ± and lxrÎ² were detected in myometrium and endometrium parts of the uterus. In the myometrium, both isoform mRNAs were in a comparable amount compared with whole uterus. In order to confirm that we had an enrichment of the muscular part, OXTR mRNA was amplified, and the highest accumulation was obtained in the myometrium fraction, as expected. LXRs Regulate Cholesterol Efflux and Fatty Acid Metabolism in the Uterus in VivoâTo explore the underlying molecular mechanisms that might account for the cholesteryl ester accumulation in LXRÎ²-deficient mice, gene expression was examined by qPCR from whole uteri of wild-type and lxrÎ±; Î²-/- animals gavaged with the potent synthetic LXR agonist T1317 (Fig. 4A). In both genotypes, basal and T1317-induced levels of genes encoding SRBI (scavenger receptor BI) involved in cell cholesterol entry, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (red) and synthase (syn), responsible for de novo cholesterol synthesis, and ACAT1 and -2 (acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2, respectively), implicated in cholesterol esterification, were unchanged. In contrast, expression of abca1 and abcg1, encoding two cholesterol efflux transporters, showed an LXR-dependant regulation. T1317 treatment induced an increase of abca1 and abcg1 accumulation in uteri from wild-type mice (2.7- and 5.2-fold increase, respectively; p < 0.01). No induction of the LXR target genes was seen in lxr-deficient mice. As expected, a higher accumulation of ABCA1 was observed in the T1317-treated wild-type mice (5-fold compared with the vehicle-treated animals; p < 0.01) (Fig. 6B). Not surprisingly, transcripts of the low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr (low density lipoprotein receptor) was significantly lower in lxrÎ±;Î²-/- mice, since this gene is known to be regulated by the intracellular concentration of oxysterols through a negative regulation loop (34.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the basal level of abca1 was unchanged, basal accumulation of abcg1 was significantly lower in lxrÎ±;Î²-/- females (66% less than the wild-type mice; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). It is assumed that this decrease could be considered as the primum movens of the phenotype, since the intracellular cholesterol increase cannot induce ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters, leading to its sequestration and accumulation in myocytes. It could thus be suspected that LXRs regulate cholesterol efflux in uterus myocytes. In addition, RNA accumulation of known target genes of LXRs involved in fatty acid metabolism was studied (Fig. 4B). T1317 treatment induced the accumulation of srebp1c (31.3-fold, p < 0.005) and lpl (lipoprotein lipase) (2.6-fold, p < 0.01) in wild-type mice, encoding SREBP1c and LPL, respectively. Quite surprisingly, the level of the noncleaved form of SREBP1c did not appear to be different among the genotypes, whatever the treatment (Fig. 6B). Likewise, no variation of the cleaved form was observed in the same samples (Fig. 6B). Interesti"

In particular, many Tyr residues are located in the antigen-binding sites of antibodies and endow high affinity and high specificity to these antibodies. To investigate the role of interfacial Tyr residues in protein-protein interactions, we performed crystallographic studies and thermodynamic analyses of the interaction between hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and the anti-HEL antibody HyHEL-10 Fv fragment. HyHEL-10 has six Tyr residues in its antigen-binding site, which were systematically mutated to Phe and Ala using site-directed mutagenesis. The crystal structures revealed several critical roles for these Tyr residues in the interaction between HEL and HyHEL-10 as follows: 1) the aromatic ring of Tyr-50 in the light chain (LTyr-50) was important for the correct ternary structure of variable regions of the immunoglobulin light chain and heavy chain and of HEL; 2) deletion of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-50 in the heavy chain (HTyr-50) resulted in structural changes in the antigen-antibody interface; and 3) the side chains of HTyr-33 and HTyr-53 may help induce fitting of the antibody to the antigen.

Hot spot Tyr residues may contribute to the high affinity and high specificity of the antigen-antibody interaction through a diverse set of structural and thermodynamic interactions. Protein-ligand interactions via noncovalent bonds play a central role in many biological processes. To exhibit their functions, most proteins specifically recognize their partners or targets with certain affinities. Recently, analyses of the three-dimensional structures of many protein-protein complexes, mutational analyses, and analyses of the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions have revealed the roles of noncovalent bonds (i.e. hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts). In general, the factors that determine the affinity and specificity of an interaction are the surface area and structure of the binding interface, including the electrostatic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic complementarities (1Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). It has been reported that aromatic residues, especially Tyr and Trp, are more frequently found at the core of interaction sites and make more energetically favorable contributions to binding than do other amino acids (1Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 2Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol.

Proteins. 2002; 47: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).The concept of a protein-binding hot spot, defined as the critical residues for a protein interaction, was first proposed by Clackson and Wells (4Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Hot spot residues make energetically significant contributions to binding, typically contributing more than 2 kcal mol-1 in Gibbs energy change (ÎG) to the interaction. The frequency of Tyr residues in hot spots is far greater than that of Trp, suggesting that Tyr residues are a preferred amino acid for protein interaction hot spots (2Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Tyr has both a hydrophobic aromatic ring and a hydrophilic hydroxyl group in one side chain. Thus, from a structural point of view, Tyr residues can potentially contribute to binding via the following: 1) hydrogen bonding via the side-chain hydroxyl group; 2) hydrophobic interactions; 3) van der Waals interactions; and 4) amino-aromatic (cation-Ï) interactions via the aromatic ring (5Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem.

Among the three-dimensional structures of 26 proteinaceous antigen-antibody and 14 peptide-antibody complexes, we observed that there were, on average, nearly 17 contacting residues in the antigen-binding site, of which 24% were Tyr. 5M. Shiroshi and K. Tsumoto, unpublished results.5M. Shiroshi and K. Tsumoto, unpublished results. Thus, it appears that Tyr is used with the highest frequency during natural selection of antibodies. Tyr residues contribute to â¼17% of the overall interfacial area of antigen-antibody complexes (1Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), and buried Tyr residues tend to be interaction hot spots (2Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Tyr residues are critical during the development of antibodies with high specificity and high affinity for their targets. Although Phe also has an aromatic ring, the frequency of Phe at antigen-binding sites was â¼4%, much lower than that of Tyr. 5M. Shiroshi and K. Tsumoto, unpublished results.In a recent report (8Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grutter M.G. Pluckthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), the ankyrin repeat protein off7, which was selected from a ribosome display library against maltosebinding protein, has a binding site, including seven aromatic residues, four of which are Tyr residues. In addition, the structure of artificially selected antibody against human vascular endothelial growth factor shows that antigen recognition is mediated mostly by Tyr residues, which cover 71% of the antigen-binding site (9Fellouse F.A. Wiesmann C. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12467-12472Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Tyr residues might play an important role in generating high affinity, high specificity binding sites during artificial selection processes as well.We have focused on the interaction between hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and the variable domain fragment (Fv) of the anti-HEL antibody HyHEL-10, which is one of best studied proteinaceous antigen-antibody interactions (10Tsumoto K.

Of the 19 residues in HyHEL-10 involved in antigen binding, six are Tyr residues, two in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin light chain (VL) and four in the heavy chain (VH) (Fig. 1, a and b) (13Kondo H.

These Tyr residues contact 12 residues of HEL through van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonding, or amino-aromatic (cation-Ï) interactions, or via interfacial water molecules. Together, these contacts encompass almost the entire HEL epitope recognized by HyHEL-10 (Fig. 1c). Because of the abundance of Tyr residues in the binding site, the HyHEL-10-HEL system may be a good model for investigating the role of Tyr residues in protein-protein interactions.In a previous study, we investigated the role of the Tyr residues in the VH region of HyHEL-10 (HyHEL-10 VH) using site-directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (11Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We found that Tyr residues located in the CDR of HyHEL-10 VH had a variety of significant roles in binding as follows: formation of hydrogen bonds via hydroxyl groups; hydrophobic interactions; van der Waals interactions (due to their large volume); and stabilization of local structure (due to their aromatic rings). Structural analyses of the complex between HEL and antibody mutants with one or two Tyr residues in the interfacial region of HyHEL-10 would provide more precise insights into the role of these residues in the antigen-antibody interaction.To elucidate the contribution of Tyr residues to high affinity and high specificity antigen binding, in combination with thermodynamic analyses we performed crystallographic studies of HyHEL-10 Fv mutants in complex with HEL, in which the six interfacial Tyr residues of HyHEL-10 were mutated to Phe and Ala. On the bases of the results obtained, we discuss how Tyr residues contribute to the specificity and affinity of proteinaceous antigen-antibody interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of HyHEL-10 Mutant FvsâThe gene structure of the expression vector of the HyHEL-10 Fv fragment was described in our previous paper (20Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). LY50A, 6The abbreviation used for mutants is, for example, LY50A, the mutant of HyHEL-10 Fv in which Ala is substituted for Tyr-50 of the VL chain. LY96F, and HY53A mutants were produced by the method of Kunkel as described in our previous paper (16Yokota A. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Kondo H. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5410-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar). The double Ala substitution mutant of the HyHEL-10 Fv fragment, HY33A/Y53A, was generated by insertion of an XhoI/EcoRI fragment of the gene encoding the HY53A mutant into the identical site of the gene encoding the HY33A mutant. We obtained wild-type and mutant Fv fragments as secreted proteins using the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expression system. BL21(DE3) cells harboring the appropriate expression plasmid were precultured in 3 ml of LB medium, then inoculated into 2ÃYT medium with 100 mg/liter ampicillin, and shaken overnight at 28 Â°C. The culture was centrifuged, and the bacteria were resuspended in 2Ã YT medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm and then shaken overnight at 28 Â°C again. The culture was centrifuged at 3000 Ã g for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 80% saturation, followed by centrifugation. The protein pellet was solubilized in 30-40 ml of PBS buffer and then dialyzed against PBS buffer. Fv fragments were purified using affinity chromatography. The protein solution was loaded onto an HEL-Sepharose column (20Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the column was washed with PBS buffer and then wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl). Fv fragments were eluted using elution buffer (0.1 m Gly-HCl (pH 2.0) containing 0.2 m NaCl) and buffered rapidly with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Fv-containing fractions were centrifuged, and minor impurities were removed by gel filtration with a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl. Purified Fv fragments were concentrated using a Centriprep-10 column (Millipore, Bilerica, MA). The antigen, HEL, was purchased from Seikagaku-Kogyo Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).Isothermal Titration CalorimetryâThermodynamic parameters of the interaction between HEL and wild-type or mutant HyHEL-10 Fv fragments were determined by ITC using a VPITC (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The experimental conditions were as follows: in a calorimeter cell, the Fv fragment, at a concentration of 5 Î¼m in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 m NaCl, was titrated with a 50 Î¼m solution of HEL in the same buffer at four different temperatures (25, 30, 35, or 40 Â°C). The HEL solution was injected 20 times in portions of 10 Î¼l over 15 s. Thermograms were analyzed with the program Origin7 (MicroCal, Inc.) after subtraction of the thermogram against the buffer only. The enthalpy change (ÎH) and binding constant (Ka) for the antigen-antibody interaction were obtained directly from the experimental titration curve. The Gibbs free energy change (ÎG =-RT ln Ka) and the entropy change (ÎS = (-ÎG +ÎH)/T) for the association were calculated from ÎH and Ka. The heat capacity change (ÎCp) was estimated from the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structural Determination of the HyHEL-10 Mutant Fv-HEL ComplexâExcept for the HY33A/Y53A-HEL complex, all mutant Fv-HEL complexes were crystallized under conditions similar to those of the wild-type Fv-HEL complex (13Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The best crystals of Fv-HEL complexes were grown in 0.1 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.6-7.8), 9-11% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000, and 7-9% (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The resultant crystals were elongated bipyramid shapes. Crystals of the HY33A/Y53A-HEL complex were obtained in 0.1-0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 15-20% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6); hexagonal pillar-like crystals were obtained. All crystallization conditions included glycerol at a final concentration of 15% as a cryoprotectant.Data sets for the wild-type Fv-HEL complex and all mutant Fv-HEL complexes were obtained using the synchrotron x-ray source at beamline BL6A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The diffraction images were processed by the interactive data processing package DPS/MOSFLM/CCP4. Integration was carried out using the MOSFLM software (22Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, p. 26, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar); scaling was carried out using SCALA software (23Evans P.R.

Crystallographic and refinement data for each Fv mutant-HEL complex are summarized in the supplemental Table 1.Calculation of root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.) for structural comparison was done using the programs LSQKAB (28Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2309) Google Scholar) and COMPAR in the CCP4 software suite. Interfacial areas were calculated with NACCESS (29Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M.

Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite. Determination of contacting atoms between Fv and HEL was performed with the CONTACT program in the CCP4 suite. Figures were drawn with the program WebLab Viewer Lite (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA).Atomic coordinates and structural factors for each mutant Fv-HEL complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The Protein Data Bank accession codes are as follows: wild type (2DQJ), LY50A (2DQI), HY33F (2DQC), HY33A/Y53A (2DQF), HY50F (2DQD), HY53A (2DQE), HY53F (2DQG), and HY58A (2DQH).RESULTSMutant Fv fragments were expressed using VL-VH coexpression vector and an E. coli expression system. They were purified to more than 95% purity by HEL-Sepharose affinity chromatography following size exclusion chromatography. As shown in our previous study, single Ala substitution mutants at positions H33 7The abbreviation used for residues is, for example, H33, residue number 33 of the VH chain. (HY33A mutant) and H50 (HY50A mutant) could not be purified by affinity chromatography, despite their high expression levels, because of their extremely low affinity for HEL (11Tsumoto K.

Ala substitutions at HTyr-33 and HTyr-50 cause large decreases in binding affinity using the HyHEL-10 Fab-HEL or HyHEL-63 Fab-HEL system; the latter antibody is related to HyHEL-10 and recognizes a similar epitope (17Pons J. Rajpal A. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 958-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Li Y. Urrutia M. Smith-Gill S.J. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the double Ala substitution mutant of HTyr-33 and HTyr-53, HY33A/Y53A, could be purified using affinity chromatography.Thermodynamic AnalysesâThe interactions between mutant Fv fragments, constructed additionally in this study (LY50A, LY96F, HY33A/Y53A, and HY53A), and HEL were analyzed thermodynamically using ITC. The thermogram of each experiment was obtained by titrating the HEL solution into the Fv solution, from which the base line obtained by titrating HEL solution into the buffer was subtracted (Fig. 2, a-c). Together with the previous data on the other mutants, thermodynamic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the Ala substitution mutant of LTyr-50 (LY50A), the thermodynamic analysis showed that the decrease in enthalpy change (ÎÎH, 10.4 kJ mol-1) was smaller than that of the Phe substitution mutant (ÎÎH, 16.7 kJ mol-1) (Fig. 2a and Table 1). In contrast, the entropic change was similar to that of the wild type (TÎÎS, 3.2 kJ mol-1). Ala substitution at HTyr-53 did not lead to the large Gibbs energy change compared with the wild-type-HEL interaction (ÎÎG; 0.9 kJ mol-1) (Fig. 2b and Table 1). However, large decreases in binding enthalpy (ÎÎH; 15.9 kJ mol-1) and entropic loss (TÎÎS; 15.0 kJ mol-1) were observed in the HY53A-HEL interaction. The binding constant of the HY33A/Y53A-HEL interaction (Ka = 1.9 Ã 106 m-1) was higher than that of the HY33A mutant but much lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The large decrease in Gibbs energy (ÎÎG; 31.3 kJ mol-1) resulted from the large loss of binding enthalpy in HY33A/Y53A mutant.FIGURE 2Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry of interactions of HyHEL-10 Fv mutants with HEL.

Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of Fv Mutant-HEL ComplexesâThe crystal structures of mutated HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complexes were solved at resolutions sufficient for determining local structural differences (1.8-2.5 Ã) (supplemental Table 1). Most of the interfacial water molecules, which mediate the Fv-HEL interaction, were conserved between each mutant Fv-HEL complex and the wild-type complex (supplemental Table 2).Although LTyr-50 does not directly contact the residue of the VH chain, the relative orientation of VL, VH, and HEL is altered in the LY50A-HEL complex. In particular, the difference in the orientation of Fv and HEL between the wild-type and mutant complexes is large (Table 2). The large space generated by the Ala substitution at site L50 is occupied by water molecules that form a hydrogen-bonding network.TABLE 2r.m.s.d. in the C-Î± atoms of each chain (Ã)VL fitVH fitHEL fitFv fitAll fitLY50A vs. WTVL0.280.671.620.410.56VH0.810.200.980.310.37HEL1.681.040.331.110.6HY33F vs. WTVL0.070.090.160.080.09VH0.120.070.170.070.09HEL0.180.170.090.150.10HY33AY53A vs. WTVL0.301.151.980.440.76VH0.880.553.380.681.09HEL2.212.730.502.721.10HY50F vs. WTVL0.090.200.710.100.14VH0.180.120.820.130.17HEL0.460.450.120.420.24HY53F vs. WTVL0.130.140.220.130.14VH0.150.130.210.130.14HEL0.170.190.140.190.15HY53A vs. WTVL0.070.080.130.070.07VH0.090.070.160.070.08HEL0.090.090.070.090.08HY58A vs. WTVL0.140.200.290.150.15VH0.210.180.330.180.20HEL0.190.280.130.180.15 Open table in a new tab The structure of the HY33F-HEL complex shows that the overall structure, the interfacial water molecules, and the local structure around the mutation site of the HY33F-HEL complex are almost the same as those of the wild-type complex (Table 2 and supplemental Table 2 and Fig. 3b). The structure also showed that the decrease in polar area (-26 Ã2) and the increase in nonpolar area (+32 Ã2) that occurred at the site of H33 compared with the wild type were the result of the substitution of HTyr-33 with Phe (supplemental Table 3).FIGURE 3Comparison of local structures (at the mutation site) between mutant and wild-type Fv-HEL complexes. a, LY50A-HEL; b, HY33F-HEL; c, HY50F-HEL; d, HY58A-HEL; and e, HY53A-HEL.

Residues of VL, VH, and HEL of the mutant complexes are shown in green, cyan, and pink, respectively. Water molecules are shown as red balls. Hydrogen bonds in the mutant complexes and wild-type complexes are depicted as red dotted lines and gray dotted lines, respectively. The amino-aromatic (cation-Ï) interaction is represented as a gray thick dashed line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the HY50F-HEL complex structure, there are no overall structural differences compared with wild type (Table 2). Two hydrogen bonds are absent because of deletion of the hydroxyl group of HTyr-50, leading to large structural changes in the side chain of Arg-21 of HEL. The amino-aromatic (cation-Ï) interaction between HTyr-58 and Arg-21 of HEL is also absent, because of structural perturbation of the side chain of Arg-21 (Fig. 3c). In addition, there is a significant rearrangement of the interfacial water molecules. In the wild-type complex, a water molecule (Wat-10) is completely buried in the Fv-HEL interface and forms hydrogen bonds bridging the Fv-HEL interface. In the HY50F-HEL complex, although newly arranged water molecules (Wat-46, Wat-74, Wat-100, and Wat-250) form a network of hydrogen bonds at the Fv-HEL interface, some of these water molecules are exposed to solvent, suggesting that the network of hydrogen bonds contributes less energetically than that seen in the wild-type complex. Some hydrogen bonds, an amino-aromatic interaction, and many van der Waals interactions between Arg-21 of HEL and HTyr-58 are lost because of these structural changes (supplemental Table 4).In the HY58A-HEL complex structure, there are no large changes in overall structure or in the local structure of the mutation site (Table 2 and Fig. 3d). Two water molecules newly introduced at the mutated site make no hydrogen bonds bridging Fv and HEL. The substitution of Ala for HTyr-58 results in the loss of an amino-aromatic interaction, hydrogen bonding via a water molecule, and some van der Waals contacts.The structure of the HY53A-HEL complex shows that both the overall and local structures of the HY53A-HEL complex were similar to those of the wild-type-HEL complex (Table 2 and Fig. 3e). Notably, the B factor in the loop around Asp-101 of HEL in the HY53A-HEL complex is higher than that in the wild-type complex by 4.7 Ã2"
https://openalex.org/W2120705392,"HAP1 (Huntingtin-associated protein 1) consists of two alternately spliced isoforms (HAP1A and HAP1B, which have unique C-terminal sequences) and participates in intracellular trafficking. The C terminus of HAP1A is phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation was found to decrease the association of HAP1A with kinesin light chain, a protein involved in anterograde transport in cells. It remains unclear how this phosphorylation functions to regulate the association of HAP1 with trafficking proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that HAP1 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in the assembly of protein complexes and the regulation of protein trafficking. The interaction of HAP1 with 14-3-3 is confirmed by their immunoprecipitation and colocalization in mouse brain. Moreover, this interaction is specific to HAP1A and is increased by the phosphorylation of the C terminus of HAP1A. We also found that expression of 14-3-3 decreases the association of HAP1A with kinesin light chain. As a result, there is less HAP1A distributed in neurite tips of PC12 cells that overexpress 14-3-3. Also, overexpression of 14-3-3 reduces the effect of HAP1A in promoting neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. We propose that the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of HAP1A with 14-3-3 regulates HAP1 function by influencing its association with kinesin light chain and trafficking in neuronal processes.

HAP1-immunoreactive puncta are also present in the cytoplasm of neurons in the brain (17.Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Ferrante R.J. Li X.J. Hersch S.M. J.

These puncta contain both HAP1A and HAP1B, as both proteins form heterodimers (18.Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 1: 2178-2185Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the interaction of HAP1A with KLC2 (9.McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), an accessory protein for the kinesin motor that drives microtubule-dependent anterograde transport (22.Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is decreased by phosphorylation of the C terminus of HAP1A (6.Rong J. McGuire J.R. Fang Z.H. Sheng G. Shin J.Y. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism underlying this regulation is important for elucidating the involvement of HAP1 in intracellular trafficking. In the course of our search for proteins that interact with HAP1, we also found that 14-3-3 binds HAP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The 14-3-3 family contains well conserved and ubiquitously expressed regulatory proteins. 14-3-3 proteins bind a large number of partners, including cytoskeletal and trafficking proteins, and are involved in the regulation of many crucial cellular processes, such as signal transduction and protein trafficking (23.Fu H.

In this study, we confirm the in vitro and in vivo association of 14-3-3 with HAP1. Moreover, we show that this interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation of the C terminus of HAP1A and can attenuate the association of HAP1A with kinesin light chain, leading to a decrease in the distribution of HAP1A in neurites and their outgrowths. These findings offer new insight into the mechanisms that regulate HAP1 trafficking and function. AntibodiesâWe used the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies to glutathione S-transferase (GST), HAP1A (18.Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 1: 2178-2185Google Scholar), kinesin light chain 2 (9.McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol.

The following secondary antibodies were used: peroxidase- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor 350-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Yeast Two-hybrid ScreenâWe used the C-terminal sequences of HAP1A (441â599 amino acids) or HAP1B (441â629 amino acids), which were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library (1.Li X.J.

Yeast strain Y190 was used for transformation. Positive clones were selected on Trp-, Leu-, and His- synthetic medium containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and further verified by a filter assay for Î²-galactosidase activity, as described previously (1.Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). MutagenesisâTo create point mutations in the C terminus of HAP1A, PRK expression vector encoding full-length HAP1A was used as a template. The following primers were used for PCR: forward primer 5â²-CGGTGCAAGATCTCAAGCCGCCTG-3â² with reverse primer 5â²-CGTCTAGATCATAGAGTTGCTGATCGGTA-3â² for the S597A mutation, or with 5â²-CGTCTAGATCATAGAGCTGATGATCGGTA-3â² for the T598A mutation. The PCR products were then subcloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of HAP1A cDNA. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ImmunoprecipitationâWhole-brain extracts from wide-type or HAP1 knock-out mouse pups (16.Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at postnatal day 1â2 were prepared by homogenizing in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 15 min, and 500 Î¼l of supernatant (at 1 mg/ml) was first clarified by incubation with 40 Î¼l of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 Â°C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. After pelleting the beads, the supernatant was then incubated with antibody to HAP1 (EM78) overnight at 4 Â°C, and HAP1-containing immunocomplex was recovered by incubating with 15 Î¼l of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 Â°C, followed by brief centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting with antibody to 14-3-3 (K-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation of transfected proteins, HA-tagged 14-3-3Î¶ was cotransfected into HEK293 cells with HAP1A, HAP1B, or mutant HAP1A (T598A) for 36 h. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4) by gentle rocking for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HAP1 (EM78) antibody, as described above. In Vitro BindingâGST fusion proteins containing full-length human 14-3-3Î¶ cDNA (GST-14-3-3), KLC2 (amino acids 124â411) (9.McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), or p150 dynactin (amino acids 1023â1223) (8.Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were described previously. These GST fusion proteins were produced in bacterial strain BL21 (Amersham Biosciences) and purified with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). HEK293 cells were transfected with HAP1A, HAP1B, or mutant HAP1A. After 24 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitors for 1 h at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was pre-clarified by incubating for 1 h with 40 Î¼l (1:1 slurry) of glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated for 1 h with 2 Î¼g of GST protein or GST-14-3-3Î¶ coupled to 40 Î¼l of glutathione-agarose beads in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and protein bound to the beads was resolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and underwent Western blotting with antibodies to HAP1 (EM78) and GST. For the in vitro binding assay with GST-KLC2 or GST-dynactin p150, HEK293 cells were either transfected with HAP1A alone or cotransfected with HAP1A and HA-14-3-3Î¶ (HA-14-3-3) for 24 h. Cells were then lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was pre-clarified by incubating with 40 Î¼l (1:1 slurry) of glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h and then incubated overnight with 2 Î¼g of GST fusion proteins coupled to 40 Î¼l of glutathione-agarose beads in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and protein bound to the beads was subjected to Western blotting with mouse anti-HAP1 and rabbit anti-GST antibodies. In vitro binding of 14-3-3 to synthesized peptides was performed using the method described previously (29.Wu M. Coblitz B. Shikano S. Long S. Cockrell L.M. Fu H. Li M. Anal.

Human 14-3-3Î¶ protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21. Fluorescence detection via microplates and determination of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) have already been described in detail in our previous studies (29.Wu M. Coblitz B. Shikano S.

Both nonphosphorylated (CGHPPASGTSYRSSTL) and phosphorylated Thr-598-containing (CGHPPASGTSYRSSpTL) peptides of HAP1A were examined. For comparison, nonphosphorylated SWTY (RGRSWTY) and phosphorylated SWpTY (RGRSWpTY) were also included in the study. Phosphorylation StudiesâHEK293 cells transfected with HAP1A for 24 h were incubated with serum-free medium overnight, and the cells were treated either with okadaic acid (0â2 Î¼m for 60 min) to increase phosphorylation or with staurosporine (0â1 Î¼m for 60 min) to inhibit phosphorylation. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell lysates were subjected to in vitro binding with 2 Î¼g of GST or GST-14-3-3. Immunofluorescent LabelingâTransfected HEK293 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Rat brain cortical neurons were isolated from E17â18 rat fetus and cultured as described previously (19.Li S.H. Li H. Torre E.R. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After three rinses with PBS, cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.2% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum/PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), rhodamine (red), or Alexa Fluor 350 (blue) in the blocking buffer for 30 min at 4 Â°C. For immunostaining of mouse brain, sections (10-Î¼m) containing the hypothalamic region from adult (4-month-old) mice were mounted on gelatin-precoated microscope slides and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS, the sections were permeabilized and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The brain sections were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer at 4 Â°C overnight. After three rinses with PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Light micrographs were taken using a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 200 MOT) with the Ã63 oil immersion objective lens and a digital camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-100) and processed with the Openlab modular software (Improvision, Inc). Confocal imaging was performed using the Ã60 oil immersion objective lenses on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope system. Quantification of Relative HAP1A Signal at Growth Conesâ PC12 cells were cultured on coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine. After transfection of HA-14-3-3 or GFP for 5 h, NGF was added to a concentration of 50 ng/ml for 24 h. Cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescent labeling with mouse anti-HA (Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-HAP1A antibodies. Confocal images were captured using the Ã63 oil immersion objective lens. The same setting was used to image all the cells examined. Two regions of interest were created for each cell as follows: the soma and the growth cone farthest from the soma (9.McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The relative HAP1A signal at the growth cones was represented as the ratio of growth cone HAP1A signal to soma HAP1A signal. A total of 30 cells from each group was selected and measured. Neurite Outgrowth StudiesâPC12 cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. HA-14-3-3 was transfected into PC12 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Six hours later, PC12 cells were infected with adenoviral HAP1A that also independently expresses GFP (31.Sheng G. Chang G.Q. Lin J.Y. Yu Z.X. Fang Z.H. Rong J. Lipton S.A. Li S.H. Tong G. Leibowitz S.F. Li X.J. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sixteen hours later, NGF was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. For controls, PC12 cells were either mock-transfected or infected with adenoviral HAP1A after mock transfection. To identify PC12 cells that express HA-14-3-3, cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescent labeling with anti-HA antibody. Adenoviral HAP1A-infected cells, which express GFP as well, were counted as HAP1A-positive cells. Adenoviral GFP-infected cells that express GFP alone served as a control. Confocal images were taken with the Ã40 oil immersion objective lens. Cells (300â350) from each group were examined to determine the percentage with neurites longer than 2 body diameters. Statistical AnalysisâStatistical significance (p < 0.05) was assessed using the Studentâs t test whenever two groups were compared. When analyzing multiple groups, we employed analysis of variance with ScheffÃ©âs post hoc test to determine statistical significance. Calculations were performed using Prism (version 4.0) software. Interaction of HAP1 with 14-3-3 in VitroâRodent HAP1 consists of two alternately spliced isoforms, HAP1A and HAP1B, which differ only in their short C-terminal sequences (579â599 aa of HAP1A versus 579â629 aa of HAP1B; see Fig. 1A). To identify novel binding partners that may differentially interact with these HAP1 isoforms, we used HAP1 C termini (441â599 aa of HAP1A and 441â629 aa of HAP1B) as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. There were three positive clones identified (two from the HAP1A screen and one from the HAP1B screen) that encode partial sequences of three different 14-3-3 isoforms as follows: Î¶ (64â225 aa), Î· (124â255 aa), and Îµ (80â120 aa), respectively (Fig. 1A). The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules in which seven mammalian isoforms (Î², Î³, Î·, Î¶, Îµ, Ï, and Ï) are highly homologous and capable of binding to the same target (23.Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 32.Mackintosh C. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The regions of 14-3-3 identified as interacting with HAP1 are highly homologous (>80% amino acid identity to the sequence) in all 14-3-3 isoforms, suggesting that HAP1 is likely to bind all the 14-3-3 proteins. We used 14-3-3Î¶, which is expressed in neuronal cells (33.van der Brug M.P. Goodenough S. Wilce P. Brain Res. 2002; 956: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34.Dai J.G. Murakami K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35.Birkenfeld J. Kartmann B. Anliker B. Ono K. Schlotcke B. Betz H. Roth D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), for further characterization in subsequent studies. To confirm the interaction of HAP1 with 14-3-3, we used GST fusion protein encoding 14-3-3Î¶ (GST-14-3-3) and performed in vitro binding with lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with either HAP1A or HAP1B. Interestingly, HAP1A bound GST-14-3-3, whereas HAP1B did not (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the specific interaction of 14-3-3 with HAP1A also occurs in cells, we cotransfected HA-14-3-3Î¶ (14-3-3) with either HAP1A or HAP1B in HEK293 cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation using anti-HAP1 antibody. Consistent with the GST-pulldown result, 14-3-3 was detected in HAP1A immunoprecipitates, but not in HAP1B immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). Thus, although 14-3-3 may bind various motifs of HAP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of HAP1 with 14-3-3 in mammalian cells appears to be dependent on the unique C-terminal sequences of HAP1A. When transfected into cells, HAP1B remains diffuse throughout the cytoplasm, whereas HAP1A forms puncta in the cytoplasm (18.Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 1: 2178-2185Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The punctate distribution of HAP1A allows us to examine its colocalization with other proteins. To test the critical role of the C-terminal region of HAP1A in binding to 14-3-3, we questioned whether 14-3-3 colocalizes with HAP1A puncta and, if so, whether this colocalization would depend on the C terminus of HAP1A. Transfection of 14-3-3 alone led to a diffuse distribution of transfected 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). Cotransfection of 14-3-3 with HAP1B showed the diffuse distribution of both proteins in the cytoplasm (data not shown). However, cotransfection of 14-3-3 with HAP1A caused an almost complete redistribution of 14-3-3 to HAP1A puncta (Fig. 1E). Deletion of the unique C-terminal sequence of HAP1A (HAP1-CD) still led to puncta formation, yet this deletion eliminated the colocalization of 14-3-3 with HAP1 puncta (Fig. 1E). These data therefore demonstrate that 14-3-3 interacts specifically with HAP1A in cells and that this interaction is dependent on the unique C-terminal sequences of HAP1A. Interaction of HAP1 with 14-3-3 in VivoâBecause hypothalamic neurons also show abundant HAP1 puncta in the cytoplasm (17.Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Ferrante R.J. Li X.J. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7674-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sheng G. Chang G.Q. Lin J.Y. Yu Z.X. Fang Z.H. Rong J. Lipton S.A. Li S.H. Tong G. Leibowitz S.F. Li X.J. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we performed immunofluorescence double labeling of HAP1 and 14-3-3 in the mouse hypothalamus to verify the in vivo association of HAP1 with 14-3-3. Some HAP1 puncta clearly contain 14-3-3 staining in neurons (Fig. 2A). Because not all HAP1 puncta show 14-3-3 staining to the same extent, this colocalization may reflect a dynamic interaction between 14-3-3 and HAP1, which would be c"
https://openalex.org/W2140354339,"The unbalanced excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter function in the neuronal network afflicted by seizures is the main biochemical and biophysical hallmark of epilepsy. The aim of this work was to identify changes in the signaling mechanisms associated with neuropeptide Y (NPY)-mediated inhibition of glutamate release that may contribute to hyperexcitability. Using isolated rat hippocampal nerve terminals, we showed that the KCl-evoked glutamate release is inhibited by NPY Y2 receptor activation and is potentiated by the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, we observed that immediately after status epilepticus (6 h postinjection with kainate, 10 mg/kg), the functional inhibition of glutamate release by NPY Y2 receptors was transiently blocked concomitantly with PKC hyperactivation. The pharmacological blockade of seizure-activated PKC revealed again the Y2 receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release. The functional activity of PKC immediately after status epilepticus was assessed by evaluating phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (Ser-831), a substrate for PKC. Moreover, NPY-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiographic binding studies indicated that the common target for Y2 receptor and PKC on the inhibition/potentiation of glutamate release was located downstream of the Y2 receptor, or its interacting G-protein, and involves voltage-gated calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2008432203,"Drp35 is a protein induced by cell wall-affecting antibiotics or detergents; it possesses calcium-dependent lactonase activity. To determine the molecular basis of the lactonase activity, we first solved the crystal structures of Drp35 with and without Ca2+; these showed that the molecule has a six-bladed Î²-propeller structure with two calcium ions bound at the center of the Î²-propeller and surface region. Mutational analyses of evolutionarily conserved residues revealed that the central calcium-binding site is essential for the enzymatic activity of Drp35. Substitution of some other amino acid residues for the calcium-binding residues demonstrated the critical contributions of Glu48, Asp138, and Asp236 to the enzymatic activity. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis revealed that the loss of activity of E48Q and D236N, but not D138N, was attributed to their inability to hold the calcium ion. Further structural analysis of the D138N mutant indicates that it lacks a water molecule bound to the calcium ion rather than the calcium ion itself. Based on these observations and structural information, a possible catalytic mechanism in which the calcium ion and its binding residues play direct roles was proposed for the lactonase activity of Drp35.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of hospital- and community-acquired infections. S. aureus causes serious and fatal diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome or septicemia (1Dinges M.M. Orwin P.M. Schlievert P.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 16-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Moreover, S. aureus has the remarkable and unfortunate feature that it can become readily resistant to antibiotics. Indeed, it has acquired resistance to almost all antibiotics so far, resulting in an increase in incidence of acute hospital-acquired infections (2Hiramatsu K. Aritaka N. Hanaki H. Kawasaki S.

Extensive studies have focused on how S. aureus acquires resistance to antibiotics, and genome sequencing analysis confirmed the existence of many resistance genes acquired by horizontal transfer from other species (3Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Nagai Y. Lian J. Ito T. Kanamori M. Matsumaru H. Maruyama A. Murakami H. Hosoyama A. Mizutani-Ui Y. Takahashi N.K.

Lancet. 2001; 357: 1225-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). In addition, S. aureus can cope with antibiotic stresses in an adaptive manner through regulation of the expression of many genes (4Kuroda M. Kuroda H. Oshima T. Takeuchi F. Mori H. Hiramatsu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Drp35 (a 35-kDa drug-responsive protein) is a cytoplasmic protein originally found to be markedly induced upon exposure of S. aureus to cell wall-affecting antibiotics (5Murakami H. Matsumaru H. Kanamori M. Hayashi H. Ohta T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Antibiotic susceptibility experiments using a drp35 defective strain and overexpressing strain of S. aureus revealed that Drp35 is correlated with bacitracin resistance, although it did not show significant changes in minimal inhibitory concentration for Î²-lactams, glycopeptides, or fosfomycin (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Drp35 can also be induced by a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, SDS, and CHAPS 2The abbreviations used are: CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PON, paraoxonase family protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DFPase, diisopropylfluorophosphatase; r.m.s., root mean square. (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a broad range of stresses that perturb membrane integrity are responsible for the induction of Drp35 and that Drp35 may be a factor responsible for such general stresses rather than specific anti-biotic stress. Interestingly, Drp35 possesses calcium-dependent lactonase activity, although it has not been clarified how this activity contributes to the ability of the S. aureus cell to cope with stress (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, paraoxonase family proteins (PONs) act as lactonases, and these proteins also require calcium ions for their catalytic activity similarly to Drp35 (7Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8Draganov D.I. La Du B.N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

Toxicol. 1998; 12: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that Drp35 is a bacterial counterpart of eukaryotic PONs (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PONs are promiscuous enzymes and can hydrolyze not only lactone but also paraoxon, phosphotriester, and esters and thereby inactivate various organophosphates, including insecticides or nerve agents, such as sarin and soman (7Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8Draganov D.I. La Du B.N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Several studies also proposed a relationship of PONs to diseases, such as antiatherosclerotic activity (8Draganov D.I.

The reaction mechanism of hydrolysis by PONs has been studied by structural analysis, directed evolution, and site-directed mutagenesis (13Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 14Aharoni A. Gaidukov L.

However, their physiological role has not been determined despite many studies, including molecular characterization, of these proteins. In analogy with the promiscuous function of PONs, Drp35 may play some important role in detoxification of compounds that affect the cytoplasmic membrane, and therefore, elucidating the precise function of Drp35 may provide some insight to overcome staphylococcal pathogenesis. However, Drp35 has not been characterized in detail at the molecular level, including determination of its physiological role. In the present study, we investigated its lactonase activity from a structural view-point. First, we report the crystal structures of Drp35 with and without calcium ions. In the presence of Ca2+, Drp35 has a six-bladed Î²-propeller structure with a calcium ion at its center. Comparison of lactonase activity with mutant proteins indicated the significance of residues coordinating to the calcium ion. Structural analysis of the D138N mutant and functional analyses using several mutants suggested that a water molecule coordinated to the calcium ion in the wild type may be essential for catalysis. Based on these findings, we discuss the mechanism of lactonase activity of Drp35. MaterialsâAll enzymes used in genetic engineering were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was obtained from Wako Fine Chemicals Inc. (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were of biochemical research grade. Construction of Expression Vector for Drp35 and Mutant ProteinsâThe gene encoding Drp35 was amplified using KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo), with S. aureus Mu50 genomic DNA as a template. The NcoI recognition sequence, CCATGG, in the drp35 gene was replaced with CCGTGG, which does not change the amino acid sequence, by the two-stage PCR method using the following primers: Drp35-S (5â²-NNNNCCATGGCCATGTCACAACAAGATTTACCTACATTATTTTATAGC-3â²), Drp35-AS (5â²-CCGCTCGAGTTGAAACTGAAAACTTTGATGACCTTTTGC-3â²), Drp35-mut-S (5â²-ACAGCTGAACCGTGGCTTGAAATT-3â²), and Drp35-mut-AS (5â²-AATTTCAAGCCACGGTTCAGCTGT-3â²) (restriction sites for digestion and ligation are underlined, and mutated nucleotides are indicated in italic type). The PCR products were inserted into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET28b vector (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). All expression vectors for mutant proteins were prepared with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using synthesized primers and the Drp35 expression vector described above as the template. The correctness of the DNA sequences was confirmed using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Expression and Purification of Drp35 and MutantsâTransformed Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3), harboring Drp35 expression vector and pT-RIL (Stratagene, Madison, WI), was grown at 37 Â°C in LB medium supplemented with 50 Î¼gml-1 kanamycin and 34 Î¼gml-1 chloramphenicol until the early stationary phase. To induce expression of the desired protein, isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was continued for 18 h at 25 Â°C. The selenomethionine derivative of Drp35 was obtained by the same method as described above except using M9 medium supplemented with 1 mm selenomethionine instead of LB medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C and then disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and then the adsorbed protein was eluted with 50 ml of a 0-0.5 m gradient of imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Drp35 were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and then further purified on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200-pg column (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing the desired protein were collected and used for further experiments. The Ca2+-bound form of Drp35 and Drp35-D138N mutant were prepared by the same methods as described above except using the following buffers: for cell disruption and equilibration for HisTrap column, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2; for elution from HisTrap column, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 500 mm imidazole; for size exclusion chromatography, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. For the enzyme assay, Drp35 and mutants were purified by the same method as described above, except for the use of a Hiprep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB) preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 instead of dialysis and size exclusion chromatography. Crystallization of Drp35, Drp35-Ca2+ Complex, and Drp35-D138N MutantâPurified Drp35 with or without CaCl2 was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), with or without 5 mm CaCl2, respectively, and then concentrated up to 20 mg ml-1. Initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix method at 20 Â°C, using a Crystal Screen kit, Crystal Screen 2 kit (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA), Wizard I, and Wizard II (Emerald Biostructures, Bainbridge Island, WA). Crystals of the apo form of Drp35 most suitable for further analyses were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.8, 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m lithium sulfate. Crystals of Drp35 complexed with Ca2+ were grown from 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1050 mm succinic acid (pH 7.0), 1% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. Crystals of the Drp35-D138N mutant were grown from a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1000 mm succinic acid (pH 7.0), 1% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. X-ray DiffractionâX-ray diffraction of selenomethionine-substituted Drp35 was performed on beamline NW12 at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) under cryogenic conditions (100 K). For single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing, a wavelength of 0.97908 AÃ¥ was chosen on the basis of the fluorescence spectrum of the selenium K absorption edge. The diffraction data of the Drp35-Ca2+ complex and Drp35-D138N mutant were collected on beamline BL44B2 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and on beamline NW12 at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), respectively. All of the diffraction data were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 program package (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

International Tables for Crystallography. 2001; F (Arnold, E., ed) Vol. , pp. , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands: 333-351Crossref Google Scholar). The subsequent phase improvement was performed with the programs SOLVE/RESOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Joint CCP4 and ESFEACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). SHELX identified the positions of all 60 selenium sites. The program SOLVE/RESOLVE was used for heavy atom refinement and initial phasing. The initial electron density map was obtained after phase improvement by the program DM with the operator of noncrystallographic symmetry obtained by RESOLVE. A total of 2756 of 3996 residues were built automatically by RESOLVE, and 3792 residues were rebuilt manually using the program LSQKAB (26Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2358) Google Scholar) as part of the CCP4 suite (27(1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr 50, 760-763Google Scholar) and the graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), based on the initial electron density map. The additional model building, positional energy minimization, and individual B factor refinements were carried out automatically with the program LAFIRE (29Yao M. Zhou Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To monitor the refinement, a random 10% subset from all reflections was set aside for calculation of the free R factor (Rfree). After automatic refinement and model fitting by LAFIRE, several cycles of refinement with the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and manual model fitting were carried out, and then the water molecules were located automatically. Due to the abundance of residues in an asymmetric unit against observed reflections, the difference between R and Rfree factor remarkably increased without the noncrystallographic symmetry restriction even in the final step of refinement. Therefore noncrystallographic symmetry restriction was applied to only the regions in which atoms could be well imposed throughout the refinement. The average of r.m.s. deviation of 12 molecules is 0.144 AÃ¥. Finally, 3849 residues and 1295 water molecules could be placed in the structure of Se-Drp35 with crystallographic R values and Rfree values of 20.0 and 22.2%, respectively. The structure of Drp35-Ca2+ complex and D138N mutant were determined by the molecular replacement method using the program MOLREP (31Vagin A. Teplyako A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) using the structure of Se-Drp35 as a search probe. To monitor the refinement, a random 10% subset from all reflections was set aside for calculation of the Rfree factor. The positional and individual B factor refinements were carried out automatically with the program LAFIRE. After automatic refinement and model fitting by LAFIRE, several cycles of refinement with the program CNS and manual model fitting were carried out. Finally, the water molecules were picked automatically by the program LAFIRE, and then calcium ions and ligand molecules were placed manually. The crystallographic R values and Rfree values for the Drp35-Ca2+ complex and Drp35-D138N mutant converged to 16.9% (19.7%) and 16.8% (20.2%), respectively. The stereochemical qualities of the final refined models were analyzed using the program PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Although crystals of Drp35-Ca2+ complex and Drp35-D138N mutant belong to space group P21 in analogy with Se-Drp35, none of the relationship was observed in cell parameters. The packing of noncrystallographically related molecules also does not have a simple correlation. Enzyme AssayâLactonase activity was determined as described previously using dihydrocoumarin as the substrate (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for Drp35 were determined in the range of 4.1-9.0 from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Buffers used were acetate (pH 4.1-5.5), MES (pH 5.6-6.8), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.4-9.0). kcat/Km values for each pH value ((kcat/Km)H) were fitted to a bell-shaped model using the equation, (kcat/Km)H = (kcat/Km)max/((10-pH/10-pKa1) + (10-pKa2/10-pH) + 1), where (kcat/Km)max is the pH-independent value, and pKa1 and pKa2 are the apparent pKa values for the acidic and basic groups, respectively. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)âAll DSC measurements were carried out with a VP-CAPILLARY DSC SYSTEM (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm acetate, pH 5.6, and 1 mm EDTA or against 50 mm acetate, pH 5.6, and 1 mm CaCl2. The dialysis buffer was used as a reference solution for the DSC scan. Protein samples of 0.60-0.94 mg ml-1 were heated from 10 to 85 Â°C at a scanning rate of 1 K min-1. Crystal Structure of Se-Drp35 and Drp35-Ca2+ ComplexâThe crystal structure of selenomethionine-substituted Drp35 was determined at a resolution of 2.4 AÃ¥ by the SAD method (Table 1). This structural information enabled a molecular replacement method to determine the structure of the Drp35-Ca2+ complex at a resolution of 1.72 AÃ¥. The subunit structures of the Drp35-Ca2+ complex are well superposed with those of Se-Drp35 with an averaged r.m.s. deviation of 0.30 AÃ¥. Each monomer consists of five helices (Î±1-Î±5) and 25 Î²-strands (Î²1-Î²25). These Î²-strands form six Î²-sheets, five of which are composed of four Î²-strands and one of which is composed of five Î²-strands (Fig. 1A). These Î²-sheets are located in a circular arrangement, resulting in a six-bladed Î²-propeller structure. As is often the case with many kinds of Î²-propeller protein, a âmolecular claspâ tethering the N- and C-terminal regions within a Î²-sheet was also observed in two Î²-sheets (blades 5 and 6) in Drp35 (33Jawad Z. Paoli M. Structure. 2002; 10: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all molecules of Se-Drp35, Drp35-Ca2+ complex, and Drp35-D138N mutant (see below), cis-peptide conformation was observed in His232-Glu233, located in the connecting loop between blades 1 and 6 (Fig. 1A). A structural alignment of Drp35 against all proteins in the Protein Data Bank by secondary structure matching (SSM) showed that the structure of Drp35 was similar to that of diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase) from Loligo vulgaris and serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) (r.m.s. deviation of 1.87 AÃ¥ for 264 CÎ± atoms and 2.50 AÃ¥ for 237 CÎ± atoms, respectively), although there was not significant amino acid sequence similarity (BLAST E-scores 4.3 and 1.6 for DFPase and PON1, respectively) (13Harel M.

Structure. 2001; 9: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These two eukaryotic proteins are classified as phosphotriesterases (EC 3.1.8) and possess a common biological activity (i.e. calcium-dependent hydrolysis activity) (9Gonzalvo M.C. Gil F. Hernandez A.F. Rodrigo L. Villanueva E. Pla A. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Hartleib J. Geschwindner S. Scharff E.I. Ruterjans H. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, Drp35 can hydrolyze lactones in a calcium-dependent manner and is a functional counterpart of PON (i.e. Drp35 is related structurally and functionally to DFPase and PON). The cis-peptide conformation found in Drp35 is not observed in the corresponding region in DFPase and PON1. Another apparent structural difference of Drp35 from PON is the absence of a canopy composed of Î±-helices that is required for binding of PON to the lipid layer of high density lipoprotein (13Harel M.

This is consistent with the observation that Drp35 is a soluble cytosolic protein and is not detected in the membrane fraction (6Morikawa K. Hidaka T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Ohta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanisms for DFPase and PON have been reported. In both enzymes, a pocket at the center of the Î²-propeller acts as a substrate entrance tunnel in which substrates are captured and reacted. Drp35 also has a pocket at the identical position (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it would hold the active site (see below). In the structure of Drp35-Ca2+ complex, two calcium ions (Ca1 and Ca2) were bound to one molecule of Drp35 (Fig. 1A). The averaged distance between Ca1 and Ca2 is 17.0 AÃ¥. Ca1 was bound at the bottom of the pocket located at the center of the Î²-propeller, where eight oxygen atoms derived from the side chains of Glu48, Asp138, Asn185, Asp236, Ser237, and three water molecules coordinated to Ca1 (Fig. 1, B and C). One of the water molecules was bound not only to Ca1 but also to OÎ´ in Asp138. The average distances between Ca1 and each ligated oxygen atom were as follows: 2.48 AÃ¥ for OÉ in Glu48, 2.52 AÃ¥ for OÎ´ in Asp138, 2.37 AÃ¥ for OÎ´ in Asn185, 2.36 AÃ¥ for OÎ´ in Asp236, 2.41 AÃ¥ for OÎ³ in Ser237, and 2.56, 2.42, and 2.38 AÃ¥ for three water molecules. The other calcium, Ca2, is bound on the surface, in which the carbonyl oxygens from Thr133, Ser110, Asp130, Tyr135, and Gly112 and OÎ³ from Thr133 were bound to Ca2. The average distances between Ca2 and each ligated oxygen atom were as follows: 2.53 AÃ¥ for oxygen in Thr133, 2.30 AÃ¥ for oxygen in Ser110, 2.52 AÃ¥ for oxygen in the main chain of Asp130, 2.50 AÃ¥ for oxygen in Tyr135, 2.47 AÃ¥ for oxygen in Gly112, and 2.51 AÃ¥ for OÎ³ in Thr133. Although all coordinating atoms were oxygens as in Ca1, none of the carboxylate groups, which are the most frequently observed groups as ligands in Ca2+-protein complexes (36Pidcock E. Moore G.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W1979662506,"The hormonal response of estrogen receptors (ER) Î± and ERÎ² is controlled by a number of cofactors, including the general transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). Growing evidence suggests that specific kinase signaling events also modulate the formation and activity of the ER coactivation complex. Here we show that ERÎ² activity and target gene expression are decreased upon activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 receptors despite the presence of CBP. This inhibition of ERÎ² involved activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, abrogating the potential of CBP to facilitate ERÎ² response to estrogen. Such reduced activity was associated with an impaired ability of ERÎ² to recruit CBP upon activation of Akt. Mutation of serine 255, an Akt consensus site contained in the hinge region of ERÎ², prevented the release of CBP and rendered ERÎ² transcriptionally more responsive to CBP coactivation, suggesting that Ser-255 may serve as a regulatory site to restrain ERÎ² activity in Akt-activated cells. In contrast, we found that CBP intrinsic activity was increased by Akt through threonine 1872, a consensus site for Akt in the cysteine- and histidine-rich 3 domain of CBP, indicating that such enhanced transcriptional potential of CBP did not serve to activate ERÎ². Interestingly, nuclear receptors sharing a conserved Akt consensus site with ERÎ² also exhibit a reduced ability to be coactivated by CBP, whereas others missing that site were able to benefit from the activation of CBP by Akt. These results therefore outline a regulatory mechanism by which the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway may discriminate nuclear receptor response through coactivator transcriptional competence.

Î± and ERÎ². Although encoded by unique genes, the two ERs share the functional domains characteristic of the nuclear hormone receptor family (1.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

These consist of an N-terminal region (also termed AB region), which confers ligand-independent activation of ERs through its activation function (AF)-1, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (C) that allows specific binding to genomic response elements, a flexible hinge region (D) that includes signals for nuclear localization and the binding of heat shock proteins, and finally a C-terminal region (EF) that contains the ligand binding domain, and the AF-2 function that mediates hormone-dependent activation. Increasing evidence suggests that, beside hormonal activation, ER function can be modulated by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, involving a wide variety of protein kinases that mostly target the AF-1 domain (2.Pearce S.T. Jordan V.C. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 50: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3.Sanchez M. Tremblay A. Sinnett D. Molecular Genetics of Cancer. Research Signpost, Kerala, India2005: 149-185Google Scholar). In particular, direct phosphorylation of ERÎ± AF-1 by MAPK/ERK in response to EGF was shown to induce ERÎ± transactivation in the absence of ligand (4.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 5.Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of Ser-167 by pp90RSK1 was described to promote ERÎ± AF-1 activity (6.Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt/protein kinase B also contributed to phosphorylate ERÎ± and mediate its ligand-independent activation, an effect shown to oppose the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (7.Campbell R.A. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Patel N.M. Constantinidou D. Ali S. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9817-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of ERÎ² has not been examined in detail, ERÎ² has been proposed as a potential target for intracellular kinases that modulate its transactivation properties. It was found that the ability of EGF and the oncogene Ras to activate ERÎ² resulted from the MAPK-directed phosphorylation of Ser-106 and Ser-124 within the AF-1 domain leading to favored recruitment of coactivators SRC-1 and CBP (8.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligand-dependent activation of ERÎ² by the protooncogene Brx was shown to involve phosphorylation of ERÎ² in a p38-dependent manner, although the exact site(s) were not described (10.Driggers P.H. Segars J.H. Rubino D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46792-46797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that activation of ErbB2 and ErbB3, which belong to the EGFR/ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, by growth factor heregulin resulted in a decrease in the estrogen-dependent cell growth and activity of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in breast cancer cells (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, unlike ERÎ±, this transcriptional repression of liganded ERÎ² by heregulin was dependent upon ERÎ² AF-1 function, thereby supporting a repressive role for kinase-mediated pathways in regulating ERÎ² AF-1 and AF-2 functions. Taken together, the regulation of estrogen receptor activity by phosphorylation is intricate and could dictate receptor function, whether it involves activation or repression. Recent evidence has emerged suggesting that nuclear receptor coactivators may also serve as points of convergence between the ER and growth factor signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of SRC coactivators has been described to modulate their intrinsic activities in mediating nuclear receptor transcription (12.Wu R.C. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Coregulatory proteins are often present in limiting concentrations in the nucleus so that modifications of their level of expression as well as their activity can lead to alterations in nuclear receptor signaling. The transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are evolutionary highly conserved proteins, and genetic evidence supports their availability to be critical. In humans, loss of one functional copy of cbp leads to Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome, a haploinsufficiency disorder resulting in mental retardation (13.Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Through their extremely versatile ability in bridging numerous transcription factors, including most nuclear receptors, with the basal transcription machinery, recruitment of CBP/p300 is important to maintain appropriate transcriptional events (14.Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). One of the likely mechanisms responsible for CBP/p300 recruitment involves phosphorylation. It was reported that phosphorylation of CBP promotes its interaction with several transcription factors, including CREB, Smad3, NFÎºB p65 subunit, and p53 (15.Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16.Kalkhoven E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of ERÎ² also facilitates the recruitment of CBP to potentiate the ligand-independent activation of ERÎ² in response to growth factors (9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given such diversity in the signaling pathways integrated by CBP, it is believed that phosphorylation-mediated events may compete at various levels for the limited availability of CBP. Here we describe a molecular mechanism by which ErbB2/ErbB3 and PI3K/Akt signaling impairs the activity of ERÎ² by reducing its ability to recruit and use CBP as a coactivator. The repression by Akt was also found for other nuclear receptors, for which a conserved Akt site may also participate in a manner similar to ERÎ². In contrast, nuclear receptors that do not share such homology yielded increased responsiveness to CBP and benefit from the enhanced intrinsic activity of CBP by Akt. Plasmid ConstructsâExpression of pCMX plasmids coding for ERÎ±, ERÎ², CBP, ErbB2, its constitutive variant V659E and ErbB3 receptors, and luciferase reporter constructs vitA2-ERE-tkLuc and UAStkLuc have been described previously (8.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ERÎ² fragments corresponding to the AB (amino acids 1-167) and DEF (amino acids 234-549) regions were obtained by PCR amplification and fused in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The ERÎ² Ser-255 to alanine and the CBP Thr-1872 to alanine mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. The expression plasmid coding for the constitutively active PI3K p110Î± catalytic subunit was a kind gift from J. Downward, and plasmids expressing Akt and K179M kinase dead Akt were generously provided by T. Chan and P. Tsichlis. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Luciferase AssayâHuman embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For transient transfection, cells were seeded in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS, and plasmid constructs were introduced into cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Typically, 50-60% confluent cells were transfected with 2 Î¼g of DNA per well, which include 500 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of receptor expression vector, 250 ng of CMX-Î²gal, 100 ng each of PI3K and Akt expression vector, and 30 ng of CBP plasmid when indicated. After 5-8 h, the medium was changed, and cells were stimulated with 10 nm estradiol (E2; Sigma) and/or 50 ng/ml heregulin-Î² (R&D Systems) for 16-20 h or left untreated. For luciferase assay, cells were lysed in potassium phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and light emission was measured using a luminometer (Wallac) after the addition of luciferin. Luciferase assays were performed in duplicate from at least three independent experiments, and values were expressed as relative light units normalized to the Î²-galactosidase activity of each sample. Western Analysis and Immunoprecipitation AssayâWestern analysis for the determination of phosphorylated and total Akt was performed as described with minor modifications (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected 293T cells were treated with 50 ng/ml heregulin-Î² for 20 min, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Membranes were incubated at 4 Â°C with blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in TBS, probed with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse anti-Akt monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and signals revealed by ECL using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The same procedure was used to determine the levels of ERÎ², except that cells were transfected with HA-tagged ERÎ² (WT or S255A) and analyzed by Western using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5). For immunoprecipitation assay, transfected cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were precleared before incubation with an anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed in lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Membranes were also probed with an anti-CBP antibody for standardization of CBP levels in each well. Generation of Hs-ER-stable Clones and RT-PCRâER-negative Hs578t breast cancer cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and transfected with expression vectors for ERÎ± and ERÎ² as described previously (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and resistant clones were isolated in the presence of G418 (0.6 mg/ml; Invitrogen) to generate Hs-ERÎ± and Hs-ERÎ² cell lines, respectively. Stable clones were functionally validated for their respective expression of ERÎ± or ERÎ² by Western analysis and for their estrogenic response by luciferase assay, compared with mock-transfected Hs578t cells. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (17.Avallone R. Demers A. Rodrigue-Way A. Bujold K. Harb D. Anghel S. Wahli W. Marleau S. Ong H. Tremblay A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 3165-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The relative signal intensity was analyzed (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) from three separate experiments. In Vitro Phosphorylation AssayâBacterially expressed and purified GST fusions of wild type and S255A mutated ERÎ² were prepared as described (18.Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Gigue`re V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation assay, GST-ERÎ² fusions immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were resuspended in kinase buffer containing [Î³-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and active Akt1 (Cell Signaling) and incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Beads were then washed twice in kinase buffer and twice in PBS, and 32P incorporation was determined following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor for equal loading. Fluorescence MicroscopyâCells were seeded on coverslips in a 6-well plate overnight prior to transfection in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS. Transient transfections were carried as above using the expression plasmids YFP-CBP and CFP-ERÎ². 20 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and examined in fluorescence with excitation/emission filters of 435/470 nm (for CFP) and 480/535 nm (for YFP) using a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope. ErbB2/ErbB3 Receptor Dimer Activation Impairs the Hormonal Response and Coactivation of ERÎ² by CBPâActivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/ErbB1, a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, is well recognized to promote ERÎ± and ERÎ² transcriptional activation (4.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 8.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, we have recently reported that activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer combination led to a decreased transcriptional activity of ERÎ² (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given the ability of CBP to associate and promote the activation of ERÎ² by a growth factor such as EGF (9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we addressed how CBP could modulate ERÎ² activity in response to ErbB2/ErbB3 activation. ER-negative human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with an EREtkLuc reporter and an ERÎ² plasmid. Cotransfection with CBP conferred a 2-fold increase in ERÎ² basal activity and a 7-fold increase in the presence of hormone (Fig. 1A). As reported previously (11.St Laurent V. Sanchez M. Charbonneau C. Tremblay A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer by growth factor heregulin-Î², which binds ErbB3, resulted in a reduced activation of ERÎ² by estrogen. Such impaired response was also mimicked using a constitutive variant of human ErbB2 (V659E), which corresponds to the natural mutation found in the rat Neu oncogene (19.Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, although CBP strongly transactivates ERÎ² in control cells, it is unable to prevent the inhibition of the hormonal response of ERÎ² when the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer is not only expressed but is also stimulated by heregulin-Î² (Fig. 1A). Despite the presence of CBP, the transcriptional activity of ERÎ² was decreased in both a hormone-independent and -dependent manner. This inhibition was even more pronounced in cells expressing the constitutive ErbB2 V659E mutant. Signaling of the EGFR/ErbB family members involves the activation of a variety of kinase pathways. More specifically, activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer has been shown to efficiently couple with the PI3K/Akt pathway, mainly through the intrinsic ability of numerous Src homology 2-binding motifs within ErbB3 that recognize the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (20.Fedi P. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of ErbB2/ErbB3 activation on the Akt pathway, the activity of endogenous Akt was determined by Western analysis using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser-473. Although treatment of mock-transfected 293T cells with heregulin-Î² did not lead to activation of Akt, indicating that endogenous expression of ErbB3 is negligible, if not absent, an increase in phosphorylated Akt was observed in cells expressing ErbB2/ErbB3 and treated with heregulin-Î² (Fig. 1B). Similarly, cells expressing the ErbB2 V659E variant in the presence of ErbB3 also showed increased levels of phosphorylated Akt. Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway Mimics the Inhibition of ERÎ² Response to Hormone in the Presence of CBP through the C-terminal Region of ERÎ²âThe possibility that ErbB2/ErbB3 activation by heregulin-Î² decreases ERÎ² activity and its coactivation by CBP by enhancing the activity of Akt was further tested by transient expression of a membrane-bound and constitutively active p110Î± subunit (CAAX) of PI3K. Expression of the p110Î± mutant was sufficient to activate endogenous Akt in 293T cells, which was further enhanced when cells were cotransfected with a plasmid for WT Akt, as determined by Western blot analysis (see Ref. 22.Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). Under these conditions, we found that the estrogen-dependent activation of ERÎ² in the presence of CBP, which reached almost 12-fold compared with untreated cells, was strongly impaired dropping to a 3-fold response in Akt-activated cells (Fig. 2A). As observed previously in ErbB2 V659E-expressing cells in response to Akt activation (Fig. 1A), the addition of CBP reduces further the response of ERÎ² to estrogen when compared with cells without exogenous CBP. These results suggest that ectopic expression of CBP could not relieve the inhibition of ERÎ² by the PI3K/Akt pathway, therefore mimicking the results in ErbB2/ErbB3-expressing cells. The repression of ERÎ² by activated Akt in the presence of CBP was partially relieved in cells expressing a dominant negative form of Akt (K179M), suggesting that the effects of activated PI3K on ERÎ² mainly transit through Akt (Fig. 2A). We next performed Western analysis to ascertain whether the modulation of ERÎ² activity was not a direct effect of its protein concentration under the conditions used. As shown in Fig. 2B, activation of the Akt pathway led to an accumulation of ERÎ² in untreated cells. A similar increase was also observed in the presence of estrogen, although the levels of ERÎ² were slightly lower compared with untreated cells, probably reflecting an increase in ER turnover in response to hormone as reported previously (23.Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the inhibition in ERÎ² activity to Akt activation is not related to a decrease in ERÎ² protein levels. CBP is known to transactivate estrogen receptors through both its AF-1 and AF-2 activities (9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

In an attempt to identify the functional domain within ERÎ² responsible for its impaired ability to be coactivated by CBP in response to Akt, we used Gal4 fusions of truncated forms of ERÎ² for which each respective AF-containing domain has been removed. Fig. 2C shows that in Akt-activated cells, the activation of a Gal4-ABÎ² (corresponding to ERÎ² amino acids 1-167) on a UAStkLuc reporter was further enhanced by CBP, reaching a near 5-fold increase compared with control cells. The N-terminal domain of ERÎ² is known to contain several serine residues that are conserved within the recognition motifs for Ser/Thr kinases of the MAPK family, and phosphorylation of specific residues was shown to allow for coactivators such as CBP to be recruited and to potentiate ERÎ² AF-1 activity (8.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9.Tremblay A. Giguere V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, none of the potential phosphorylation sites within ERÎ² AB region belongs to a consensus Akt site, suggesting that the enhanced activity of ERÎ² AF-1 by CBP in response to Akt might possibly result from other kinase pathways activated by Akt or direct effects on CBP itself. We next tested the role of the C-terminal region of ERÎ² in the same conditions. Cells transfected with a Gal4-DEFÎ² (amino acids 234-549) showed a reduced hormone-dependent activity to Akt activation in the presence of CBP, mimicking the response observed with full-length ERÎ² (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results indicate that the repressive effect of activated Akt on CBP-mediated transactivation of ERÎ² is mediated through a region contained in the C-terminal portion of ERÎ², which in the context of the full-length receptor seems to counteract the positive effect on the AF-1 activity. Serine 255 in the Hinge Region Mediates ERÎ² Inhibition to ErbB2/ErbB3 SignalingâOur examination of the C-terminal sequence of mouse ERÎ² revealed a consensus sequence RQRSAS255 in the hinge region of ERÎ² that corresponds to the recognition motif RXRXX(S/T) for the kinase Akt (Fig. 3A). To determine whether Ser-255 is a direct target for Akt-mediated phosphorylation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the serine at position 255 into an alanine and performed an in vitro kinase assay. Fig. 3B shows that disruption of Ser-255 strongly abolished the phosphorylation of ERÎ² by Akt compared with wild type, indicating that Ser-255 can be efficiently phosphorylated by Akt. We then tested whether Ser-255 was involved in the inhibition of ERÎ² activity to ErbB2/ErbB3 activation as observed in Fig. 1A. Using the S255A mutant in luciferase assay, we found that the inhibition observed for WT ERÎ² by either ErbB2/ErbB3 dimer expression or its activation with heregulin-Î² was completely abrogated by disruption of Ser-255 (compare Figs. 1A and 3C). Noticeably, the hormonal response of S255A was enhanced upon ErbB2/ErbB3 activation and further potentiated by CBP. This enhanced response to hormone by the S255A mutant was also observed in response to Akt activation using the constitutively active p110Î± PI3K construct in transfection (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the results indicate the hinge region of ERÎ² contains a specific site that not only can be targeted by Akt but also dictates responsiveness of ERÎ² to CBP coactivation in response to Akt signaling pathway. To determine whether Ser-255 is involved in the regulation of ERÎ² in terms of protein levels, we next performed Western analysis on cells expressing the ERÎ² S255A mutant. As compared with wild type ERÎ² (Fig. 2B), the disruption of Ser-255 completely abrogated the accumulation of ERÎ² in response to Akt activation (Fig. 3D), indicating"

PCC 6803. Up to now, 36 different cyanobacterial genomes have been completely sequenced, and the genomic information is available or will be available soon. The first cyanobacterium, the genome of which has been completely sequenced and released in 1996, was the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (1Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). In this genome almost 3200 potential protein encoding open reading frames (ORFs) 2The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; DCMU, 3-(3â²,4â²-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; PPBQ, para-phenyl-benzoquoinone; wt, wild type; PS, photosystem. have originally been identified and based on the available DNA sequences from Synechocystis and other organisms, as well as on homology searches; about 1700 of the Synechocystis genes have been annotated as ORFs coding for hypothetical proteins with unknown function. Because many of these hypothetical proteins are conserved within cyanobacteria or even show significant sequence homologies to proteins from other bacteria or plants, it is reasonable to assume that many of these proteins have important physiological functions, which have to be revealed. Two strategies have been applied in the recent years to elucidate possible biological functions of hypothetical proteins encoded by ORFs in Synechocystis. In the first approach an ORF of interest has been interrupted or deleted by genetic methods. The observation, whether an ORF can be deleted or not, indicates whether the encoded gene product is essential for Synechocystis or not (2Osiewacz H.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A subsequent analysis of a constructed mutant strain can give further insights on the possible function of a hypothetical protein, and many examples can be found in the literature. The CyanoMutant data base tries to compile information available about the generation of Synechocystis mutants and phenotypic characterizations (3Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to a directed mutagenesis approach, the gene products encoded by nonannotated ORFs from Synechocystis have been identified in several proteomic approaches (4Fulda S. Mikkat S. Huang F.

Although such a global analysis answers the question of whether an ORF is expressed and encodes for a physiological relevant protein, the identification of a protein alone does not allow us to draw any conclusion about a probable function of the protein. However, a first hint on the function of a protein can be gained if a hypothetical protein is co-purified with a protein or protein complexes, as it has e.g. recently been described for photosystem 2 (PS 2) from Synechocystis. After very mild solubilization of PS 2 from Synechocystis, several proteins have been co-purified with the complex, and a function of these newly identified proteins for the activity or assembly of PS 2 has been proposed (14Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To analyze the potential in vivo function of a small polypeptide encoded by the ORF ssr2998, we combine the genetic approach with protein purification. The ORF ssr2998, which is highly conserved in cyanobacteria, has been interrupted in Synechocystis, and the generated mutant strain was analyzed to reveal the physiological function of Ssr2998. The observed regulatory role of this protein for the cytochrome b6 f complex activity, its purification with this complex, and the fact that a gene encoding a homologous protein can be found in all cyanobacterial genomes sequenced so far suggest that Ssr2998 is functionally associated with, at least, the cytochrome b6 f complex in cyanobacteria. Molecular MethodsâMolecular methods have been performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5Î± according to standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was prepared by harvesting cells from an agar plate and resuspending them in 100 Î¼l of 1 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After boiling the cell suspension for 3 min and one centrifugation step, the supernatant contained genomic DNA and was directly used for PCR. Construction of a Îssr2998 MutantâA DNA fragment containing the ssr2998 ORF and 700-bp upstream and downstream region was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5â² primer, 5â²-gtcaaagcttccacttgggagggtattaa-3â²; and 3â² primer, 5â²-cttgaattctcagagtggagaggttacc-3â². The resulting 1.2-kb fragment was restriction digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated to the EcoRI/HindIII restriction digested pUC18 vector. The resulting plasmid pSsr2998 contains a unique SacI site in the ORF ssr2998. To interrupt the ORF ssr2998, the plasmid pSsr2998 was linearized via SacI and ligated to a kanamycin-resistant cassette (ntpII) taken from pBSL15 (16Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 52-56PubMed Google Scholar). For transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a mixotrophic grown culture with an OD750 of about 0.5 was adjusted to OD750 of 2.5. From this cell suspension, 200 Î¼l was mixed with 5 Î¼g of pSsr2998::Km and incubated for 30 h in a culture tube at 30 Â°C at 50 Î¼E/m2s light without shaking. The cells were then plated on BG11 agar supplemented with 10 Î¼g/ml kanamycin. Single colonies were subsequently plated on BG11 medium with increasing concentrations of kanamycin. Because Synechocystis contains multiple identical genome copies, the obtained mutants were checked for complete segregation. Genomic DNA of cells grown for various rounds in BG11 medium without added antibiotics was prepared as described above, and segregation was checked by PCR. Culture Conditions for Cyanobacterial StrainsâThe cells were cultivated as shaking culture in Erlenmeyer flasks or in U-tubes aerated with 2% CO2 at 30 Â°C. The cultures were inoculated with precultures of OD750 = 1(Â±0.2) and started at OD750 = 0.05. Illumination was done with white fluorescence light of 20 Î¼E/m2s (low light) or 80 Î¼E/m2s (high light). For photoautotrophic growth, BG11 medium was used that was supplemented by 10 mm glucose for mixotrophic and further by 10 Î¼m 3-(3â²,4â²-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU; Diuron) for photoheterotrophic growths conditions. Three independent cultures of each analyzed strain were measured 3-fold. Oxygen Evolution and ConsumptionâOxygen evolution and consumption were measured in 1 ml of cell suspension (OD750 of â¼1, about 5 Î¼g/ml chlorophyll) using a fiber-optic oxygen meter (PreSens, Regensburg, Germany). The cells were cultivated photoautotrophically under aeration at 20 Î¼E/m2s light. Three independent cultures of each analyzed strain were measured three times. Photosynthetic rates were determined in the presence of 15 mm NaHCO3 and PS 2 activity in the presence of 0.5 mm para-phenyl-benzoquinone (PPBQ). Respiratory oxygen consumption was recorded in the dark, and photosynthetic oxygen evolution was recorded at 1000 Î¼E/m2s light. Photosynthetic rate and PS 2 activity were determined as a difference of net oxygen evolution in light and oxygen consumption in the dark. PS 1 activity was measured as oxygen consumption in the presence of 20 Î¼m DCMU, 2 mm NaN3, 200 Î¼m 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, and 200 Î¼m methyl viologen. A base line was recorded in dark and light. Oxygen consumption caused by the Mehler reaction was determined as corrected oxygen consumption in the light by oxygen consumption in the dark. The chlorophyll content of the individual strains was determined as described in Ref. 17Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar using methanol as solvent for extraction. Low Temperature Fluorescence Emission SpectroscopyâLow temperature fluorescence emission spectra were measured using an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Spectronic Instruments) with cell suspensions of 5 Î¼g/ml chlorophyll. After 10 min of dark adaptation, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen (18Mao H.B. Li G.F. Li D.H. Wu Q.Y. Gong Y.D. Zhang X.F. Zhao N.M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with two individual clones of each strain being analyzed. Excitation and emission were carried out with a bandwidth of 4 nm. Upon phycobilisome excitation at 580 nm and chlorophyll excitation at 440 nm, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the range of 630â750 nm. Measurement of Phycobilisome Movements (âState Transitionsâ)âState transitions of wild type (wt) and mutant cells were analyzed by low temperature fluorescence emission spectra after excitation of the phycobilisomes at 580 nm (see above). The samples were prepared in different ways to induce different states prior freezing. For adjusting the cells to State 2 prior to freezing, the samples were incubated in the dark for 10 min. State 1 was induced by a 3-min exposure to strong far red light (200 Î¼E/m2s) after a 10-min dark incubation (19Schluchter W.M. Shen G. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Emlyn-Jones D. Ashby M.K. Mullineaux C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Light of 700 nm was generated by using an Omega BP700 filter. Alternatively to light, 150 Î¼m PPBQ was used to induce State 1 (21Mao H.B. Li G.F. Ruan X. Wu Q.Y. Gong Y.D. Zhang X.F. Zhao N.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cytochrome f and P700 Absorption KineticsâCytochrome f redox kinetic measurements were performed on a home-built photometer, as previously described (22Kirchhoff H. Horstmann S. Weis E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended to a final concentration of 12.5 Î¼g/ml chlorophyll in BG11 medium. Kinetics induced by 50-ms saturating flashes (655 nm, LED cone; Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) were determined at 551, 556, and 561 nm under continuous far red background illumination as in Ref. 23Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. RoÌgner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Kinetics of four different samples and 32 (2 times 16) individual traces of each sample was averaged (repetition frequency, 1 Hz). The cytochrome f kinetics were calculated as a difference of the kinetics measured at 556 nm minus the average of the kinetics at 551 and 561 nm (23Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. RoÌgner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting cytochrome f kinetics was smoothed by a Fourier correction, which allows subtracting the periodic noise and a subsequent Gaussian-weighted smoothing. P700 kinetics (single trace) was measured by a dual PAM-100 measuring system (Walz GmbH) with a chlorophyll concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml. The redox kinetics of cytochrome f and P700 were fitted with single exponential functions. Purification of the Cytochrome b6 f ComplexâThe cytochrome b6 f complex was isolated from a photosystem 1 less strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as described in detail recently (24Wenk S.-O. Schneider D. Boronowsky U. JaÌger C. Klughammer C. de Weerd F.L. van Roon H. Vermaas W.F. Dekker J.P. RoÌgner M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Membranes of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis were prepared as described in Ref. 25RoÌgner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and membrane proteins were extracted from thylakoids by extraction with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 200,000 Ã g (4 Â°C, 40 min), the cytochrome b6 f complex was purified from the supernatant by two high performance liquid chromatography steps. In the first step the membrane extract was loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction column (POROS 20BU; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Upon applying a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient, the cytochrome b6 f complex eluted at a concentration of about 1 m ammonium sulfate. After concentration and desalting of the cytochrome b6 f complex containing fractions, the complex was further purified on an anion exchange column (Uno Q6; Bio-Rad). Ssr2998 Codes for a 7.2-kDa Protein Conserved in Cyanobacteriaâ Several cyanobacterial genomes have been completely sequenced in the recent years, and in all genomes a high number of potential ORFs has been identified that code for proteins with unknown functions. The ORF ssr2998 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes a small hypothetical protein with unknown function. The protein has a calculated mass of 7.2 kDa, and no known protein domain or structural motif is predicted by computational methods. Based on the amino acid sequence, ssr2998 does not code for a transmembrane protein but rather for a soluble one. Interestingly, the encoded protein is highly conserved in cyanobacteria (Fig. 1), whereas no homologous proteins can be found in higher plants or green algae. Because the protein is conserved in cyanobacteria, it is reasonable to speculate that it has a physiological function important for cyanobacterial cells. Construction of a Synechocystis Îssr2998 StrainâTo investigate the function of the protein encoded by the Synechocystis ORF ssr2998, a mutant strain was constructed, in which the ORF is interrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette (Fig. 2A). Because Synechocystis contains multiple identical genome copies, complete segregation of the mutant strain was confirmed by PCR. After several rounds of selection, the cells were grown in medium without antibiotics, and genomic DNA was prepared and subsequently used as a template for PCR. When genomic DNA from a Synechocystis wt strain was used as a template, a fragment of 1.6 kb was amplified, corresponding to the size of the ssr2998 gene and parts of the upstream and downstream sequences (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no fragment corresponding to the size of the wt ssr2998 gene was amplified by PCR when genomic DNA from Synechocystis Îssr2998 was used as a template. The exclusively observed fragment of 3 kb corresponds in size to the wt fragment (1.6 kb) with the integrated resistance cassette (1.4 kb). These observations prove that the ORF ssr2998 can be completely deleted, and the encoded protein has therefore no essential function in Synechocystis under the chosen growth conditions. Disruption of ssr2998 Influences Growth of Synechocystisâ To analyze potential effects of the gene disruption on cellular processes, growth rates of wt and Îssr2998 Synechocystis cells were determined under photoautotrophic, mixotrophic, and photoheterotrophic growth conditions, as well as under two different light conditions (Table 1). Although wt and Îssr2998 cells show similar growth rates under photoautotrophic conditions at low light (20 Î¼E/m2s), the mutant strain showed a decreased growth rate or no growth under mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic conditions. This effect was more severe under high light than under low light conditions. Additionally, photoautotrophic growth of the mutant strain was not increased as much as in the wt strain under increasing light conditions. These observations indicated that Ssr2998 is involved in light dependent electron transfer reactions of Synechocystis. Because growth of the mutant strain depended on the light conditions, the photosynthetic electron transport rates of the mutant strain was analyzed and compared with the wt strain.TABLE 1Growth rates of wt and Îssr2998 Synechocystis cells grown in the presence of 2% CO2 at 30 Â°C and two different light intensities A dash indicates no growth observed. The results were obtained by 3-fold measurements using three independent cultures.Growth conditionLight intensityDoubling time/hMutant doublingwtÎssr2998Î¼E/m2stime (% of wt)Photo-autotrophic2021.1 Â± 1.222.3 Â± 0.8106804.3 Â± 0.28.7 Â± 1.2202Mixotrophic2010.6 Â± 0.7ââ804.2 Â± 0.2ââPhoto-heterotrophic2013.2 Â± 0.319.6 Â± 0.91488013.3 Â± 1.0ââ Open table in a new tab Activity and Stoichiometry of Photosynthetic Complexesâ The photosynthetic rates of Synechocystis cells were determined by measuring oxygen evolution in the presence of HCO-3, which allows determination of the activity of the whole electron transfer chain. Activity of PS 2 alone was measured as oxygen evolution in the presence of excess PPBQ. As the electron acceptor PPBQ replaces plastoquinone, PS 2 activity is independent of the redox state of the plastoquinone pool and of other, downstream localized components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Furthermore, PS 1 activity was determined by oxygen consumption caused by the Mehler reaction (26Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 34: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 2, the photosynthetic rate of the mutant strain was found to be reduced by about 18% in comparison with the wt strain, when measured with HCO-3 as electron acceptor. To test whether this effect was caused by a decreased PS 2 content, oxygen evolution of PS 2 was measured with PPBQ as electron acceptor and also with this acceptor a reduction of oxygen evolution of about 24% was observed (Table 2). These results suggested that reduction of the PS 2 activity was responsible for the reduced photosynthetic rates in the Îssr2998 mutant strain. In contrast, the activity of PS 1 was determined to be slightly increased relative to the wt strain as measured by oxygen consumption caused by the Mehler reaction (see above).TABLE 2Oxygen evolution and consumption of wt and Îssr2998 mutant grown with 5% CO2 at 30 Â°C and 20 Î¼E/m2s The results were obtained by 3-fold measurements using three independent cultures.WtÎssr2998Îssr2998Î¼mol/mg Chl/hÎ¼mol/mg Chl/h% of wtPhotosynthetic rate71 Â± 2058 Â± 1582PS 2 activity62 Â± 1447 Â± 376PS 1 activityâ1356 Â± 63â1537 Â± 166113 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether the individual activity or the overall quantity of PS 2 had changed, the relative amount of the photosystems and the phycobilisomes was determined by low temperature fluorescence emission spectroscopy (Fig. 3). After excitation of chlorophylls at 440 nm, fluorescence emission spectra indicated an increased PS 1/PS 2 ratio in the Îssr2998 mutant. Normalization of these emission spectra to the PS 2 peak at 695 nm (27Wittmershaus B.P. Woolf V.M. Vermaas W.F.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; V31: 75-87Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicated a relative increase of PS 1 (with a fluorescence maximum at 725 nm) in the mutant strain. In contrast, upon excitation of the phycobilisomes at 580 nm, no significant differences between the emission spectra of wt and mutant cells have been observed. So, why is the PS 2 content reduced in Synechocystis cells after disruption of ssr2998? One possible explanation was that PS 2 synthesis was down-regulated initiated by an over-reduced PQ pool. Disruption of ssr2998 Influences Energy Transfer between Phycobilisomes and PhotosystemsâAn overreduced PQ pool could be also a reason for missing adaptation capability of the mutant cells to certain growth parameters, especially to elevated light regime (Table 1). Cyanobacterial cells respond to changes in the light conditions by altering the light absorption properties of the two photosystems (28Bald D. Kruip J. RoÌgner M. Photosynth. Res. 1996; V49: 103-118Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29RoÌgner M. Boekema E.J. Barber J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kruip J. Bald D. Boekema E. RoÌgner M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One important way to adapt to changes in light is to change coupling of the soluble light harvesting proteins (phycobilisomes) to the two photosystems (31Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This process is regulated by the redox state of the PQ pool and called state transition. To investigate whether disruption of ssr2998 has an impact on the ability of the cells to react on changing light conditions, capability for performing state transition was tested either by illumination and/or chemical oxidation of the PQ pool. Fluorescence emission of whole cells was measured at 77 K after excitation of phycobilisomes at 580 nm. During transition from State 2 to State 1 PS 1 fluorescence emission at 725 nm should decrease, whereas PS 2 emission at 695 nm should increase (33Fork D.C. Satoh K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1983; 37: 421-427Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows fluorescence emission spectra, which were measured after preincubating cells in dark (State 2) and in far red light (State 1), respectively. In wt cells (Fig. 4A), the PS 1 emission at 725 nm decreases, whereas the PS 2 emission at 695 nm increases upon excitation of the phycobilisomes. These changes are caused by an increased binding of phycobilisomes to PS 2, and a decreased coupling to PS 1, which results in increased energy transfer to the PS 2 reaction center and decreased energy transfer to PS 1, respectively. In contrast, Îssr2998 cells showed no changes of the fluorescence emission at 695 and 725 nm after exposure of the cell cultures to the different light conditions (Fig. 4B). This observation suggested that the light quality does not influence binding of phycobilisomes to PS 2 and/or PS 1 in the mutant strain. This could have been caused either by a misregulation of phycobilisome movement or by a shift in the redox state of the PQ pool. Contrary to higher plants, in cyanobacteria the PQ pool is partially reduced in darkness (35Cooley J.W. Vermaas W.F. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4251-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) because of light-independent alternative electron transport routes (36Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. RoÌgner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This reduction level is usually decreased by light because of the high PS 1:PS 2 ratio and the resulted high oxidative force of PS 1 (35Cooley J.W. Vermaas W.F. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4251-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Over-reduction of the PQ pool or a diminished capacity at its oxidation could be explained by the absence of the state transition effect in the mutant after light induction. To test this possibility, we have investigated the energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PS 1 and PS 2 in the Îssr2998 strain in the presence of PPBQ, which decreases the reduction level of the PQ pool and thereby induces State 1 chemically. As shown in Fig. 5 both wt (Fig. 5A) and the Îssr2998 mutant (Fig. 5B) performed a fluorescence decrease at 725 nm and an increase at 695 nm in the presence of PPBQ. The effect was more pronounced when PS 1 was selectively excited by far red light illumination. All of these data indicate that increased energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PS 2 involving binding and/or movement of phycobilisomes is not inhibited in the mutant. In other words, the absence of state transition under normal conditions can be explained by the existence of an over-reduced PQ pool in the mutant.FIGURE 5Energy transfer from phycobilisomes to photosystems in the presence of PPBQ. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra (Î»excit = 580 nm) of wt (A) and the Îssr2998 mutant cells (B) are shown. The samples were incubated with (dashed line) or without (solid line) 150 Î¼m PPBQ for 10 min in the dark. Thereafter, dark-adapted samples with PPBQ were illuminated (dotted line) by far red light (700 nm at 200 Î¼E/m2s). The spectra were normalized to the emission peak at 650 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PQ Pool Is Over-reduced in the Îssr2998 Mutant Because of the Impaired Electron Transport through the Cytochrome b6f ComplexâDisruption of ssr2998 resulted in decreased content of active PS 2 and absence of state transition. Presumably, both phenomena were consequences of an over-reduced plastoquinone pool. The activity of PS 1 was, however, not impaired. These observations could either been explained by an involvement of Ssr2998 in biogenesis and/or stabilization of PS 2, or more likely, the protein acts in between PS 2 and PS 1. Electrons provided by PS 2 are transferred to PS 1 via the cytochrome b6f complex and plastocyanine (or cytochrome c6). It has recently been shown that mutations within the cytochrome b6 f complex can result in an highly reduced PQ pool (23Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. RoÌgner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Schneider D. Berry S. Volkmer T. Seidler A. RoÌgner M. J. Biol.

Direct kinetic measurements on cytochrome f and the primary PS 1 electron donor P700 were performed to investigate the electron transport through the cytochrome b6 f complex. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), the reduction kinetics of cytochrome f after a saturating flash was significantly (1.7 times) slower for the mutant cells. The calculated time constants (Ï) were 18 and 31 ms in the wt and mutant strain, respectively. Also, there was a considerable difference in the steady-state level of the oxidized cytochrome f population induced by continuous far red illumination (Fig. 6A).

SecA ATPase has been shown to be a nanomotor that associates with its protein cargo as well as the SecYEG channel complex and to undergo ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and retraction that promote stepwise protein translocation. Previous studies have shown that both the 65-kDa N-domain and 30-kDa C-domain of SecA appear to undergo such membrane cycling. In the present study we performed in vivo sulfhydryl labeling of an extensive collection of monocysteine secA mutants under topologically specific conditions to identify regions of SecA that are accessible to the trans side of the membrane in its membrane-integrated state. Our results show that distinct regions of five of six SecA domains were labeled under these conditions, and such labeling clusters to a single face of the SecA structure. Our results demarcate an extensive face of SecA that interacts with SecYEG and is in fluid contact with the protein-conducting channel. The observed domain-specific labeling patterns should also provide important constraints on model building efforts in this dynamic system.

The major Sec-dependent protein translocation pathway of Eubacteria, which is essential for both protein secretion and integral membrane protein insertion, has been subjected to intensive investigation for over two decades. Its core components consist of the SecA ATPase nanomotor along with SecYEG, the presumed protein-conducting channel (reviewed in Refs. 1.Veenendaal A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Biochim.

Peripheral components such as the export-specific SecB chaperone, which maintains preproteins in a loosely folded export-competent state and transfers them to SecA, along with the integral membrane SecDF complex, which plays an as yet unknown role in the process, are important for rapid and efficient protein translocation (3.Randall L.L.

The protein translocation reactions are organized by the SecA ATPase nanomotor, a complex protein that consists of a 65-kDa N-domain and a 30-kDa C-domain (6.Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The N-domain consists of two nucleotide-binding domains, NBF-I and NBF-II, 2The abbreviations used are: NBF, nucleotide-binding domain; PPXD, preprotein-binding domain; HSD, helical scaffold domain; HWD, helical wing domain; CTR, carboxyl-terminal region; AMS, 4-acetamido-4â²-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid; MPB, 3-(N-maleimido-propinyl)biocytin; P300, membrane fraction; RSO, right-side-out membrane vesicles; S300, soluble fraction; M/S, moderate to strong. which together form a high affinity nucleotide-binding cleft, whereas a protein substrate-binding domain (PPXD) is attached to NBF-I and is subject to its modulation (8.Hunt J.F.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The C-domain consists of a central helical scaffold domain (HSD), an organizing center upon which the various other domains of SecA reside, a helical wing domain (HWD), and a carboxyl-terminal region (CTR) that contains both acidic phospholipid and SecB binding sites (11.Fekkes P. van der Does C.

Soluble, peripheral membrane and integral membrane pools of SecA have been described previously (13.Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound SecA consists of a pool bound via acidic phospholipids as well as one bound with nanomolar affinity to SecYEG, the SecA receptor (14.Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both free and membrane-bound SecA have the capacity to interact directly with preproteins or to receive them via transfer from the SecB-preprotein complex (14.Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By simultaneously binding both protein substrates as well as SecYEG, SecA is able to initiate protein translocation. The dominant model for Sec-dependent protein translocation posits that a mobile region of SecA undergoes ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and retraction at SecYEG to promote the stepwise translocation of proteins (referred to as SecA membrane cycling) (18.Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This model was originally based on the observation that both the N- and C-domains of SecA appeared to undergo membrane insertion in an ATP-, preprotein-, and SecYEG-dependent fashion based on their protease-resistant state as well as their accessibility to labeling reagents that specifically label only the exterior side of the membrane (6.Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18.Economou A. Wickner W.

SecA has also been shown to undergo a default membrane insertion reaction in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (22.Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the additional observation that the protease-resistant state of the C-domain could also be induced in the presence of micellar SecYEG and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, under conditions in which SecYEG is degraded to small peptides, has led to the alternative suggestion that these translocation ligands simply induce a stable SecA conformational state (23.van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structure of SecYEG protein, its conformational flexibility, and the dimensions and topology of the protein-conducting channel should provide important clues into the molecular basis of SecA membrane cycling. However, these topics have been the source of considerable controversy. Monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric states for SecYEG have been detected in various biochemical and structural studies in which the presence of SecA, preprotein, and ATP stimulated the formation of dimeric and tetrameric forms of SecYEG (see Refs. 1.Veenendaal A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 24.Scheuring J. Braun N. Nothdurft L. Stumpf M. Veenendaal A. Kol S. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Weinkauf S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and references contained therein). A small 5â8-Ã protein-conducting channel has been proposed to lie within the SecYEG protomer, whereas a much larger channel of â¼20 Ã would be formed at the interface of SecYEG oligomers in the ring-like structures that have been observed previously (25.van den Berg B. Clemons W.M. Collinson I. Modls Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2003; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 26.Meyer T. Menetret J.-F. Breitling R. Miller K.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent studies favor the former model. In one study utilizing cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction, a ribosome-nascent chain complex was captured associated with a SecYEG dimer, where one protomer formed the active protein-conducting channel, while the second protomer was in an inactive state (29.Mitra K. Schaffitzen C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Simon J. Brooks C. Ban N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In a second study utilizing cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and disulfide bond formation, the translocating polypeptide chain was located exclusively within the central region of SecY (30.Cannon K. Or E. Clemons W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such a narrow channel, which begins with a 20â25-Ã opening but narrows to 5â8 Ã at the pore ring at the middle of the membrane, would significantly limit both the depth and extent of SecA membrane insertion at SecYEG. Clearly a high-resolution structure of SecA in its membrane-inserted state at SecYEG with or without a translocation intermediate is required to elucidate the structural dynamics of the translocon. However, given the difficulty in obtaining crystals of dynamic membrane proteins that diffract to atomic dimensions, this approach is likely to be difficult to achieve. The structure of the SecY complex from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, obtained recently, is of limited use, because Archaea do not possess a SecA homolog but instead utilize a signal recognition particle-mediated pathway for protein secretion (25.van den Berg B. Clemons W.M. Collinson I. Modls Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2003; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 31.Pohlschroder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, other approaches to obtain such structural information need to be sought. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, combined with either topologically specific sulfhydryl labeling or disulfide bond formation, has been shown to be a powerful method of assessing membrane protein structure and topology. For example, considerable information on the proximity of the different transmembrane helices and cytosolic or periplasmic domains of SecYEG protein has been obtained utilizing this approach (reviewed in Ref. 1.Veenendaal A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo assessment of the periplasmic accessibility of engineered cysteine residues within an integral membrane protein to membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagents has been utilized to derive the topology of membrane transporters in a less invasive manner than through the utilization of more conventional in vitro approaches (reviewed in Ref. 32.van Geest M. Lolkema J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Previously we utilized cysteine-scanning mutagenesis along with MPB labeling in RSO to demonstrate that at least three distinct regions within PPXD, NBF-II, and CTR of integral membrane SecA were periplasmically accessible (20.Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This approach is limited however by the laboriousness of the methodology as well as potential artifacts induced during sphero-plating and osmotic rupture, which is a particular concern given the highly dynamic nature of the Sec system. In the present study we have utilized in vivo rather than in vitro topology labeling to minimize system perturbation and have greatly expanded the number of cysteine mutants that have been examined. Our results provide the first detailed look at the membrane topology of integral membrane SecA protein in a more physiological manner than used previously. Strains, Plasmids, and ChemicalsâEscherichia coli BL21.19 (secA13(Am) supF(Ts) trp(Am) zch::Tn10 recA::CAT clpA:: KAN) is derived from BL21(Î»DE3) (33.Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and was used as the host for all secA-containing plasmids. Plasmid pT7secA-Cys-0, a derivative of pT7secA2 that has all four cysteine codons within secA changed to serine, has been described previously (20.Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); it was used to create the collection of monocysteine secA mutants described here utilizing a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. All secA mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis utilizing the DNA sequence facility at the University of Pennsylvania. The efficiency of plating of a given secA mutant, obtained by plating an appropriate dilution of an overnight culture of the strain on LB ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml) plates and incubating them overnight at either 42 or 30 Â°C, is defined as the ratio of the titer of colonies obtained at 42 Â°C divided by that obtained at 30 Â°C Ã 100%. MPB and AMS were purchased from Molecular Probes. Unless otherwise noted, most other chemicals were reagent grade or better and were obtained from Sigma or a comparable supplier. In Vivo MPB Labeling of CellsâEach monocysteine secA mutant was grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml) at 42 Â°C to an A600 of 0.65â0.7, after which the culture was chilled rapidly on ice for 10â20 min and then harvested by sedimentation at 7,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.075 volume of buffer 1 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA). Where specified, the resuspended culture was incubated with 5 mm AMS at 4 Â°C for 90 min followed by sedimentation at 20,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C, when the cell pellet was washed and resuspended in an equivalent volume of buffer 1 prior to MPB labeling. In other experiments the resuspended culture was incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 0 Â°C for 15 min prior to MPB labeling. Biotinylation was performed by incubation with 75 Î¼m MPB for 3 min at 0 Â°C. Labeling was quenched by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to 500 mm and incubation at 0 Â°C for 5 min followed by sedimentation of cells at 20,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equivalent volume of buffer 2 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. In certain instances the MPB labeling pattern was analyzed directly on total cell protein by the addition of sample buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (34.Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In other cases the MPB labeling pattern was analyzed on subcellular fractions. For this purpose cells were broken by two passages at 8,000 lb/in2 in a French pressure cell, and unbroken cells were removed by sedimentation at 13,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C, giving rise to the total cleared lysate. Soluble (S300) and membrane (P300) fractions were prepared by sedimentation of the total cleared lysate at 320,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C in a Sorvall RC M100 Micro-Ultracentrifuge. S300 was removed, and P300 was resuspended in one-sixth of the original volume of buffer 2. Following the addition of sample buffer and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, visualization of biotinylated proteins utilized streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes) and ECL (Pierce), whereas visualization of SecA content employed primary rabbit anti-SecA antisera and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and ECL. Construction of Monocysteine secA Mutants and In Vivo Labeling with MPBâPrevious studies have demonstrated the feasibility of performing a topological analysis of membrane proteins utilizing a cysteine-scanning approach combined with in vivo labeling with sulfhydryl-reactive reagents (reviewed in Ref. 32.van Geest M. Lolkema J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To undertake a similar approach with SecA ATPase, we created an extensive collection of monocysteine secA mutants. The mutations were targeted according to four principles. (i) We sought a mutation density that would provide us with detailed topological information on the different SecA domains, resulting in a collection of 63 monocysteine mutants for the 901-amino acid-residue SecA protein. (ii) By inspection of the homologous Bacillus subtilis SecA structure (8.Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) (the two proteins have 50% identity at the amino acid sequence level (35.Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36.Sadaie Y. Takamatsu H. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Gene. 1991; 98: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)), we attempted to confine our selection of monocysteine substitutions to either surface-accessible residues or residues that are located at domain-domain interfaces; the latter residues could readily become surface-accessible by a change in SecA conformation during its membrane insertion. (iii) To avoid nonfunctional secA mutants that would be difficult to grow in a haploid state and that could give rise to spurious results, we utilized an alignment of existing eubacterial SecA protein sequences to avoid highly conserved amino acid residues, and where feasible, we placed the substitution at a site where a naturally occurring cysteine residue was located in one of the SecA homologs. (iv) Finally, we tried to choose amino acid residues that were structurally/chemically similar to cysteine for substitution. The monocysteine substitutions were made on a plasmid-borne functional copy of the secA gene in which its four naturally occurring cysteine codons were substituted with serine (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). secA function was assessed in BL21.19, where chromosomal secA expression can be shut off by growth at 42 Â°C because of the presence of a secA amber mutation and a temperature-sensitive amber suppressor (37.Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Nearly all of our monocysteine secA mutants were functional in vivo as assessed by the ability of the appropriate plasmid-borne secA allele to complement the secA amber defect at 42 Â°C, and they gave rise to plating efficiencies of 25% or greater in general (defined under âExperimental Proceduresâ). The few monocysteine secA mutants that were nonfunctional were not subjected to further analysis in this study. To label regions of SecA in a topologically specific manner, we grew our strains under conditions in which only the monocysteine-containing secA gene copy was expressed at a moderate level (at 42 Â°C and without isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside induction), and we employed the readily detectable sulfhydryl-labeling reagent, MPB. Previous studies have shown that when MPB is utilized at low concentrations, it is impermeable to the plasma membrane and can be used to map periplasmically accessible portions of membrane proteins (Refs. 38.Bayer E. Zalis M. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 39.Loo T. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar; also shown below). The topological specificity of MPB labeling of SecA in RSO has also been demonstrated previously (20.Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In piloting our experiments we found that analysis of membrane fractions of in vivo labeled strains gave better clarity and sensitivity in our Western blots, although it was possible to analyze unfractionated cells directly as well. These procedures allowed us to directly compare the SecA labeling intensities of our different mutants without the use of immunoprecipitation or affinity purification, which complicate comparisons because of the high degree of variability in sample recovery. In addition, we found that by running the SDS-polyacrylamide gels for a longer time, better separation of high molecular weight membrane proteins in the range of SecA was achieved. By utilizing an MPB concentration and labeling time similar to those used in our previous study, we were able to achieve topologically specific labeling of SecA in vivo based on four criteria. (i) Cys-530, which has been shown previously to label strongly with MPB in RSO (20.Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was strongly labeled under our new regimen when the relevant P300 fraction was examined. By contrast, Cys-0, which lacked any cysteine residues, was not labeled even though both proteins were present at comparable levels (Fig. 1, compare panels A and B). (ii) Cys-530 labeling was prevented by pretreatment of cells with AMS (Fig. 1A), which has been utilized extensively to demonstrate topologically specific labeling by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents because of its membrane impermeability (39.Loo T. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). (iii) Cys-530, Cys-350, and Cys-470, which have been shown previously to label strongly, moderately, and weakly, respectively, in RSO (20.Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), gave a similar in vivo labeling pattern; furthermore, strong labeling was observed in these latter two cases if the integrity of the plasma membrane was breached by Triton X-100 treatment prior to labeling (Fig. 1A). (iv) Finally, only membrane-associated SecA and not soluble SecA was labeled in vivo unless the plasma membrane was permeabilized by Triton X-100 treatment prior to labeling (Fig. 1, compare panels A and C, which contain the P300 and S300 fractions, respectively). The single, prominent, MPB-labeled, soluble protein of unknown identity in S300 fractions was presumably periplasmic in origin and was unrelated to SecA. We noted, as previous authors have done, that there was a relatively small number of MPB-labeled membrane proteins in our P300 (Fig. 1A) due to the fact that most naturally occurring cysteine residues that are accessible to the trans side of the membrane often participate in disulfide bond formation (40.Stewart J. Hermodson M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This circumstance makes in vivo labeling with sulfhydryl-reactive reagents ideal when combined with a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach, provided that expression levels of the test membrane protein are sufficient for ready detection. To demonstrate that our procedure labeled SecYEG-bound SecA protein, we investigated the SecYEG dependence of MBP labeling. For this purpose we compared the MPB labeling efficiency of BL21.19 (pBBsecA-his), which contains secA on a low copy number plasmid (34.Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with that of BL21.19 (pBBsecA-his, pET610). Plasmid pET610 overproduces SecYEG protein, utilizing the powerful Trc promoter (41.van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results of this analysis showed that the specific activity of MPB labeling of SecA was increased 2.6-fold by SecYEG overproduction after accounting for a 34% lower SecA level in BL21.19 (pBBsecA-his, pET610) compared with BL21.19 (pBBsecA-his) (supplemental Fig. S1). Although the observed increase in specific activity of SecA labeling appears to be lower than the increase in SecYEG overproduction, we have shown previously that only a fraction of overproduced SecYEG protein properly assembles in the membrane where it gives rise to an increase in SecA high affinity binding sites and SecA-dependent translocation ATPase activity (42.Zito C.R. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40640-40646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the MPB-labeled residues of SecA arose from periplasmic exposure of a phospholipid-bound pool of SecA, although such speculation is inconsistent with the extractability of this pool of SecA by reagents that classically remove only peripherally bound membrane proteins (15.Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, this latter concern is inconsistent with our data given below. Data AnalysisâAnalysis of the MPB labeling pattern of 63 monocysteine secA mutants is given in Table 1. To ensure that our data were consistent, we performed two or more independent experiments (with separate Western blots) for each mutant, and positive and negative controls (Cys-530 and Cys-0, respectively) were included with each experiment. Given a modest degree of variability in labeling intensity and a continuum in labeling strength between strongly and moderately labeled mutants, we divided the labeling patterns into three groups: moderately to strongly labeled, weakly labeled, and unlabeled (M/S, W, and U, respectively, in Table 1). This scoring system provided a fairer representation of our data and eliminated a potentially more subjective bias. A large proportion (43%) of the SecA monocysteine residues are contained within the M/S group, a similar proportion (46%) are contained within the unlabeled (U) group, and the remainder (11%) resides within the weakly labeled (W) group.TABLE 1In vivo MPB labeling of monocysteine secA mutants Two different types of controls were used to ensure the quality of the entire data set. First, to confirm the topological specificity of labeling of the M/S group of mutants, we compared their labeling pattern in the absence and presence of AMS. Inclusion of AMS prevented MPB labeling of SecA and other proteins in all cases (supplemental Fig. S2). Second, to better understand the accessibility properties of the unlabeled group of mutants, we compared their labeling pattern in the absence and presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. This experiment indicated that these mutants could be divided into two subgroups. Cys-47, Cys-142, Cys-190, Cys-213, Cys-287,"

The P2Y receptor agonists ADP and ADPbetaS produced concentration-dependent relaxation of endothelium-denuded PCA smooth muscle with pD2 values of 5.3 and 4.9, respectively. RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting demonstrated mRNA and protein expression of P2Y1 and A2A adenosine receptors in the PCA. The nonselective P2 antagonist PPADS or the P2Y1-selective antagonist MRS2179 failed to alter ADP- or ADPbetaS-induced relaxations. Relaxations to ADP were, however, blocked by the A2A adenosine receptor-selective antagonists ZM241385 and SCH58261 (apparent pK(B) values of 9.2 and 8.9, respectively). We excluded roles for direct occupancy of A2A adenosine receptors by ADP or ADPbetaS as well as metabolism to adenosine as mechanisms for ADP-evoked relaxations. However, ADP responses were significantly enhanced in the presence of the ENT1 nucleoside transporter inhibitors dipyridamole and NBTI and were significantly inhibited by adenosine deaminase, indicating a role for extracellular adenosine. Suprafusion of [3H]-adenine-labeled PCA segments showed that ADP induced the release of a number of purines, including adenosine. These data suggest that ADP mediates relaxation of the PCA via a novel mechanism that involves adenine nucleotide-evoked adenosine release and the subsequent activation of A2A receptors."

In this study, we used human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing human retinal cone/brain NCKX2 to examine its Na+ affinity and kinetic parameters of Ca2+ transport. With the use of the ionophore gramicidin to control alkali cation concentrations across the plasma membrane, application of high intracellular Na+ promoted large NCKX2-mediated increases in intracellular free Ca2+ in the 15â20 Î¼m range; this also resulted in inactivation of NCKX2 transport, the first description of this novel kinetic state. The affinity of NCKX2 for internal Na+ was found to be sigmoidal, with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 and Kd = 50 mm.

Among the multitude of proteins that handle Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane of excitable tissue, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers play a prominent role in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. These proteins belong to one of two gene families: SLC8, the members of which mediate electrogenic exchange of three Na+ ions for one Ca2+ ion (1Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D.

Recently, NCKX5 transcripts have been reported to be rich in melanin-containing tissues, viz. the eye and skin (18Lamason R.L. Mohideen M.A. Mest J.R. Wong A.C. Norton H.L. Aros M.C. Jurynec M.J.

The NCKX proteins studied to date share a common predicted structure of two sets of five and six hydrophobic domains; the current topological model suggests an arrangement of five and five transmembrane segments separated by a large cytosolic loop (19Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Winkfein R.J. Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They also have a cleaved signal peptide that is essential for plasma membrane targeting, leaving a large extracellular loop at the N terminus (the C-terminal loop is also extracellular) (20Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9438-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NCKX and NCX proteins share sequence homology in only two transmembrane regions forming internal repeats termed the Î±1 and Î±2 repeats. Residues within the Î±1 and Î±2 repeats of human NCKX2 have been shown to be important for the transport function of NCKX2 and for its affinity for both Ca2+ and K+ (21Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T.

Kang K.-J. Szerencsei R.T. Winkfein R.J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7787-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NCKX-mediated exchange of Ca2+ is characterized by a unique requirement for Na+ over any other alkali cation (25Yau K.W. Nakatani K. Nature. 1984; 309: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 373: 25-45Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, to date, the residues responsible for Na+ binding and transport are unknown. Hence, we sought to devise an assay that will allow us to control internal Na+ to measure the affinity of the exchanger for Na+. Additionally, although all Na+/Ca2+ exchangers characterized to date are capable of mediating bidirectional transport of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane, most methods that have been devised to measure Na+/Ca2+ exchange in intact cells rely on measuring the reverse (Ca2+ influx) mode of exchange. For this study, we sought to examine the biophysical properties of the forward (Ca2+ efflux) mode of exchange of human NCKX2, which is the mode of transport that is of physiological relevance. Finally, we set out to evaluate the contributions of other cellular Ca2+-handling mechanisms in our assay system. From the results we obtained, we discovered that NCKX2 is a highly efficient Ca2+ extrusion mechanism, but displays a previously unknown inactive kinetic state that is both time- and Na+-dependent. The experimental procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (22Kang K.-J. Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol.

The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 300 Ã g for 1 min and washed with a medium of buffered 150 mm LiCl (150 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone (to reduce dye leakage), and 6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). The cells were resuspended in buffered 150 mm LiCl, and 50-Î¼l aliquots (containing â¼105 cells) were added separately to cuvettes containing 1950 Î¼l of test medium. The test medium was buffered 150 mm NaCl (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) or buffered 150 mm KCl (150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, 6 mm d-glucose, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). (The same stocks of test media were used to prepare mixed test media of different ionic compositions, i.e. 75 mm LiCl and 75 mm KCl was prepared by adding equal amounts of buffered 150 mm LiCl and buffered 150 mm KCl.) For the experiments carried out in buffered 150 mm KCl, pH 8.8 (see Fig. 2A), TAPS was used in place of HEPES. For each experiment, the cuvette containing Ca2+ indicator dye-loaded NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells was placed in the 25 Â°C thermostatted cuvette housing of an SLM Series 2 luminometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL), and fluorescence was continuously measured under constant stirring and upon the addition of various ion concentrations as described below. To clamp the alkali cation concentrations across the plasma membrane, the channel-forming alkali cation ionophore gramicidin (2 Î¼m) was added to the cuvette 3 min prior to the start of the experiment; other drug treatments (as described below) were also added at the same time as gramicidin. The first addition thereafter was 350 Î¼m CaCl2, which caused an instantaneous step increase in fluorescence due to Ca2+ binding to leaked Ca2+ indicator dye; this level of fluorescence remained constant throughout the duration of experimentation and was also observed in mock-transfected Ca2+ indicator dye-loaded HEK293 cells (data not shown) and hence was subtracted during analysis of fluorescence signals. On the other hand, in experiments in which EDTA was added to the cuvette to chelate external Ca2+, an instantaneous step decrease in fluorescence occurred, which signified chelation of Ca2+ from leaked Ca2+ indicator dye in the cuvette; in those cases, the value of the step increase in fluorescence at the beginning of the experimental recording period was added to the fluorescence values at the point at which EDTA was introduced in the cuvette. At the end of each experiment, 0.02% saponin was added in the presence of saturating CaCl2 to saturate the Ca2+ indicator dye and to obtain a maximal fluorescence signal, which was used to normalize the fluorescence values for the respective experiment. In the experiments carried out with 10 Î¼m external Ca2+, the Ca2+ was buffered by the addition of 1 mm HEDTA and 8 mm Ca2+/HEDTA to the cuvette; to chelate external Ca2+ in this case, 5 mm EDTA was added to the cuvette. Assaying for NCKX2 Reverse Exchange and Dependence on Internal Na+âTypical reverse exchange (Ca2+ influx) assays in whole cells rely on bathing the cells in a medium free of Na+ while monitoring intracellular Ca2+ increases. During the course of our experimentation, we noticed that the activity of NCKX, as assessed by the magnitude of induced Ca2+ influx, decayed with time as NCKX-transfected cells were placed in Na+-free medium. Along with the observation that the Ca2+ influx responses of NCKX-transfected HEK293 cells originating from different stocks were quite variable, this indicated that the discrepancies were likely due to variations in cytosolic Na+. Therefore, we set out to modify our assay to allow us to verify that the reverse exchange mode of NCKX is indeed dependent on internal Na+. To this end, we employed the cation channel-forming ionophore gramicidin to clamp monovalent cation concentrations across the plasma membrane and to allow us to control internal Na+ concentrations (27Cooper C.B. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 847-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schnetkamp P.P.M. Tucker J.E. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1153-C1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby circumventing the variability in assaying reverse exchange in intact cells. NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were loaded with the cell-permeant form of the Ca2+ indicator fluorescent dye fluo-3 and resuspended in buffered 150 mm LiCl. The cells were then placed in a cuvette containing buffered 150 mm KCl and treated with 2 Î¼m gramicidin, and 350 Î¼m CaCl2 was added to the cuvette 3 min later, which caused a step increase in fluorescence that remained constant (due to leaked dye; see âExperimental Proceduresâ). (Also note that all cuvette media contained 0.1 mm EDTA, and hence, the addition of 350 Î¼m CaCl2 gave a final free Ca2+ concentration in the cuvette of 250 Î¼m.) After 30 s, 75 mm NaCl was added to the cuvette, which caused a rapid increase in fluorescence (internal free Ca2+) that reached a plateau level within 10 s (Fig. 1A). The same aforementioned procedure was repeated, but in a cuvette with buffered 150 mm NaCl in place of buffered 150 mm KCl. In this case, the addition of KCl (40 mm) was required to initiate reverse exchange and to elevate intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1B), consistent with the established absolute requirement of NCKX for K+. NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were placed in a cuvette with buffered 150 mm LiCl and treated with gramicidin; after the addition of 350 Î¼m CaCl2, 40 mm KCl was added to the cuvette, but the fluorescence remained at the base line until the addition of 75 mm NaCl (Fig. 1C), at which point the fluorescence rose rapidly to around the same plateau level observed in Fig. 1 (A and B). Finally, to illustrate that the exchanger is absolutely dependent on Na+, NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were placed in a cuvette with buffered 75 mm LiCl and 75 mm KCl, and treated with 2 Î¼m gramicidin. The addition of 350 Î¼m CaCl2 caused only a small step increase in fluorescence (data not shown), which remained constant for >1 min, and the fluorescence was finally elevated by the addition of 75 mm NaCl (Fig. 1D). Therefore, using this modified protocol, we were able to consistently control Na+ concentrations in the medium and thereby assess the affinity of the exchanger for Na+. In all subsequent experiments, NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were resuspended in buffered 150 mm LiCl, placed in cuvettes with 150 mm KCl, and treated with 2 Î¼m gramicidin (unless specified otherwise). Reverse exchange was then initiated by the addition of NaCl subsequent to the addition of 350 Î¼m CaCl2; this concentration of Ca2+ was chosen to promote maximal Ca2+ influx through the exchanger while minimizing influx due to capacitative Ca2+ entry following internal Ca2+ store depletion (discussed below). Activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells typically requires the addition of millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (29Tanneur V. Ilgaz D. Duranton C. Fillon S. Gamper N. Huber S.M. Lang F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 445: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Bogeski I. Bozem M. Sternfeld L. Hofer H.W. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consistent with our observations (data not shown). Another modification we made in subsequent experiments was related to the observation that fluorescence amplitude levels attained using the described gramicidin clamp method were significantly higher than those previously obtained with intact cells (22Kang K.-J. Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6823-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that internal Ca2+ was elevated to a greater extent in the presence of the gramicidin clamp than in its absence. Hence, we tested two other intracellular Ca2+ indicators from Molecular Probes: fluo-4FF, with a reported Kd of 9.7 Î¼m, and fluo-5N, with a Kd of 90 Î¼m. On the basis of comparison of fluorescence increases among these various Ca2+ indicator dyes and transfection efficiencies we routinely obtained (70â80%), we estimated that the fluorescence value of 0.5 obtained with fluo-4FF (normalized to the total amount of dye present in all cells) corresponded to intracellular free Ca2+ in the range of 15â20 Î¼m. Therefore, in all subsequent experiments, we employed the cell-permeant form of the Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-4FF, which gave the best signal resolution without saturation of the fluorescence increase signals. Isolating the Activity of NCKX2 from Other Ca2+-handling MechanismsâThe addition of CaCl2 and Na+ to mock-transfected HEK293 cells in buffered 150 mm KCl did not result in an increase in internal Ca2+ (data not shown), indicating that HEK293 cells do not harbor endogenous Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. However, like all eukaryotic cells, they nevertheless have other mechanisms for intracellular Ca2+ regulation, viz. the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and mitochondria. The contributions of these mechanisms to regulation of intracellular free Ca2+ in our assay system were examined. The PMCA activity was decreased by carrying out the assay in KCl medium with the pH adjusted to 8.8; SERCA was inhibited with 0.4 Î¼m thapsigargin (Tg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering was disabled with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) at 2 Î¼m. All drugs were added to the cells in the cuvette at the beginning of the experiment along with gramicidin, i.e. 3 min prior to initiating reverse exchange to allow the Tg-induced rise in internal Ca2+ to return to the base line. Application of 0.4 Î¼m Tg to gramicidin-treated NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells resulted in a slight increase in the amplitude of fluorescence attained after inducing Ca2+ influx via reverse exchange compared with NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells treated with gramicidin alone (Fig. 2A). Increasing the pH of the assay medium resulted in greater enhancement of the reverse exchange amplitude of the fluorescence increase as well, but the most marked enhancement of reverse exchange activity was observed with cells treated with 2 Î¼m FCCP. The amplitude of fluorescence attained with cells treated with FCCP reached a value of â¼0.5 of maximal fluorescence compared with â¼0.2 for untreated cells (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that all these mechanisms contribute to some extent to regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ in HEK293 cells, and therefore, to isolate the activity of the exchanger, we must take into account the contribution of those mechanisms. We decided to closely examine the interplay of Ca2+ handling among NCKX2, SERCA, and mitochondria, but decided against carrying out our assays in pH 8.8 media (to inhibit PMCA), as that would preclude the use of gramicidin because it would lead to strong alkalinization of the cytosol. Moreover, it was unclear whether the observed enhancement of the fluorescence increase at pH 8.8 was attributable to the decreased activity of PMCA per se because increased medium pH is also known to enhance the activity of the exchanger itself (31Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B compares the amplitude of the fluorescence increase in untreated NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells with fluorescence amplitudes in NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells pretreated with 0.4 Î¼m Tg alone or with 2 Î¼m FCCP. Although the fluorescence increase induced by the addition of 75 mm Na+ in Tg-treated cells was somewhat higher compared with that in untreated control cells, the results were not statistically significant (p > 0.05, Student's t test, n = 3) (Fig. 2B). This suggested that SERCA alone did not contribute significantly to the magnitude of Ca2+ signals induced in HEK293 cells under our experimental conditions. On the other hand, the fluorescence amplitude more than doubled when cells were pretreated with Tg and FCCP in combination (p < 0.05, Student's t test, n = 3), suggesting that, in HEK293 cells, mitochondria are the major buffer of large NCKX2-mediated rises in cytosolic Ca2+. Hence, to ensure in subsequent experiments that we were isolating the activity of the exchanger, all NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were pretreated with both 0.4 Î¼m Tg and 2 Î¼m FCCP prior to initiating reverse exchange (unless stated otherwise). Measuring the Affinity of NCKX2 for Internal Na+âTo measure the affinity of NCKX2 for Na+, we normalized the initial rate of change in fluo-4FF fluorescence attained upon the addition of various concentrations of Na+ to the rate of fluorescence change obtained upon the addition of 150 mm NaCl (Vmax) in the presence of 250 Î¼m external free Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). In our experiments, Na+ concentrations were simultaneously changed in both intracellular and external solutions, and this was inevitable because of the use of gramicidin. The addition of 250 Î¼m external free Ca2+ proved to be sufficient to suppress competition of Ca2+ influx by external Na+ under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows the normalized rate of activity of NCKX2 in relation to the concentration of the substrate Na+. The Kd of NCKX2 for internal Na+ was 50 Â± 1.6 mm (n = 3), and the fitted Hill plot gave a coefficient of 2.6, indicating that NCKX moves multiple Na+ ions in each transport cycle. This is the first reported value of the Kd of NCKX for intracellular Na+; it can be compared with values previously reported for the Kd for extracellular Na+ of human and chicken NCKX2 expressed in the insect cell line High Five (38â48 mm Na+, Hill coefficient of 1.9) (32Sheng J.Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and in situ bovine rod NCKX1 (35 mm Na+, Hill coefficient of 2) (34Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 555-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Schnetkamp P.P.M. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forward Exchange (Ca2+ Extrusion) Mode of NCKX2âTo examine the forward exchange (Ca2+ extrusion) mode of NCKX2 operation, we loaded NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells with Ca2+ via the reverse exchange mode of operation of NCKX2 by the addition of 75 mm NaCl in the presence of 250 Î¼m external free Ca2+, and after the fluorescence reached the steady-state plateau level, 1 mm EDTA was added to the cuvette to chelate external Ca2+, thereby reversing the Ca2+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The fluorescence levels dropped precipitously upon the addition of EDTA presumably because of extrusion of Ca2+ from the cytosol via NCKX2 (Fig. 4A, Ctrl trace). We repeated this assay with Tg in the absence and presence of FCCP. Whereas the pattern of fluorescence change in Tg-treated cells mirrored that in untreated control NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells, those cells treated with both Tg and FCCP had a greatly diminished rate of Ca2+ clearance. This suggested that the rapid decrease in fluorescence observed in the untreated cells was not mediated by the exchanger, at least not entirely, but in fact, mitochondria in that case effectively and very rapidly sequestered cytosolic Ca2+. Hence, we proceeded to test the ability of NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells pretreated with Tg and FCCP to extrude Ca2+ under a range of different Na+ concentrations and found that the rate of Ca2+ extrusion diminished with increasing Na+ concentrations (Fig. 4B). This finding was surprising, as we were expecting that Ca2+ extrusion rates would accelerate as the concentration of Na+ was increased, according to kinetic considerations. In the example shown in Fig. 4B, the addition of 75 and 150 mm Na+ promoted rapid Ca2+ influx through the reverse mode of operation of NCKX2; however, when the forward mode was engaged, the fluorescence decayed very slowly and did not reach the base line by the end of the data recording period (>2 min), signifying that the exchanger had somehow inactivated and was no longer able to effectively extrude internal Ca2+. Time Course of Inactivation of NCKX2âTo exclude the possibility that elevating intracellular Na+ in our assay resulted in the apparent inactivation of the forward mode of exchange because of competitive inhibitory interactions between Na+ and Ca2+-K+ at the intracellular binding/transport site of the exchanger, we examined the time course of inactivation of NCKX2. In Fig. 5A, NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells were loaded with Ca2+ via the exchanger by the addition of 75 mm Na+ in the presence of 250 Î¼m external free Ca2+. At various time points thereafter, 1 mm EDTA was introduced to chelate extracellular Ca2+ and to initiate Ca2+ efflux from the cytosol via the exchanger. Fig. 5 shows the results from separate cuvettes using the same suspension of NCKX2-transfected HEK293 cells overlaid for illustrative purposes. The rate of Ca2+ clearance diminished with time, and it was clear that inactivation of the exchanger developed with a relatively slow time course; we estimated the tÂ½ of inactivation at 40 s. These results argue against competitive inhibition because the apparent inactivation process required significant time to develop and was not apparent when the cytosolic compartment was loaded with high free Ca2+ for periods of up to 40 s while still exposed to high levels of internal Na+ (75 mm). If competitive inhibition by Na+ was prominent, then the apparent inactivation process would have been expected to occur instantaneously upon the addition of EDTA. As a control, we examined the time course of the Ca2+ efflux component of NCKX2-transfected HE"

Two classes, class I and class II MHC, recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, respectively, have been discovered. Class II MHC molecules are heterodimers, composed of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain. These Î±Î² heterodimers are highly polymorphic, type I integral membrane proteins, assembled in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells and macrophages. Because the first crystal structure of a class II MHC molecule was reported in 1993 (1Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar), crystal structures of more than 20 MHC class II molecules from both human and mouse have been determined. Some of these structures have revealed that the MHC class II heterodimer can self-associate to further form a(Î±Î²)2 double dimer, termed the superdimer (2Schafer P.H. Pierce S.K. Jardetzky T.S. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the crystals the superdimer is arranged in such a way that allows simultaneous binding of two T cell receptors (TCRs) and two CD4 molecules (2Schafer P.H. Pierce S.K. Jardetzky T.S. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Dimerization of class II MHC, either as preformed complexes on the APC membrane or as induced upon TCR engagement, appears consistent with many aspects of class II immunology, including signaling and T cell activation (2Schafer P.H. Pierce S.K. Jardetzky T.S. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Chen Z.Z. McGuire J.C. Leach K.L. Cambier J.C. J.

However, it remains controversial as to whether the crystallographic superdimer constitutes evidence that the superdimer exists as a physiologically relevant conformation of MHC class II (5Schafer P.H.

In addition to peptide antigens, class II MHC can present a number of proteins, known as superantigens (SAgs), to T lymphocytes (9Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Kotzin B.L. Leung D.Y. Kappler J. Marrack P. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 99-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the MHC class II molecules on APCs, SAgs are recognized by TCRs carrying specific VÎ² subsets, leading to polyclonal activation of a large portion (up to 20%) of T lymphocytes. SAgs have been hypothesized to play important roles in a number of human diseases, including food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (10Kotzin B.L.

Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). SAgs are known to bind to the MHC molecules in diverse ways. Currently, two sites have been identified on the MHC, one with a low binding affinity for SAgs and the other with a high affinity (9Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Hudson K.R. Tiedemann R.E. Urban R.G. Lowe S.C. Strominger J.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp.

The low affinity site (KD = 10â5 m) is on the MHC Î±1 domain, whereas the high affinity site (KD = 10â7 m), which is Zn2+-coordinated, is on the MHC Î²-chain. Some SAgs have a single MHC-II-binding site; for instance, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 bind only to the MHC Î±-chain (17Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C.

Immunol. 1991; 174: 107-119PubMed Google Scholar), a natural pathogen of rodents. MAM can induce spontaneous chronic arthritis, which resembles human rheumatoid arthritis, in genetically susceptible strains of rodents. In vitro, administration of MAM can induce MHC class II-dependent T cell activation in a VÎ²-restricted fashion, leading to B cell proliferation and differentiation and triggering cytokine expression (26Cole B.C. Atkin C.L. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A structural study revealed that a MAM dimer can cross-link to two MHC molecules via interactions with the MHC Î±1 domains (27Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Mourad W. Li H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that the superantigenic activity of MAM via MHC class II molecules is Zn2+-dependent (28Bernatchez C. Al-Daccak R. Mayer P.E. Mehindate K. Rink L. Mecheri S. Mourad W. Infect.

In this study, we have used structural, sedimentation, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection approaches to investigate the molecular interactions between MAM and class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1, in the context of a hemagglutinin peptide (HA). Unexpectedly, we find that Zn2+ can induce the dimerization of a soluble class II MHC HLA-DR1/HA complex in solution. We also find that MAM binds the HLA-DR1/HA complex at a 1:1 stoichiometry, with a high affinity, and independent of zinc ion. Although Zn2+ is not directly involved in the binding between MAM and HLA-DR1, Zn2+-induced dimerization of the HLA-DR1/HA complex resulted in a dimerized MAMÂ·MHC complex, in which cooperative binding of MAM to the HLA-DR1/HA complex dimer was observed.

Correctly folded HA/HLA-DR1 complex was purified, using ion exchange chromatography, on a Mono Q column (GE HealthCare); it was biotinylated with the BirA enzyme (Avidity), and size-purified on a Superdex 200 FPLC column (GE HealthCare). The extent of biotinylation was estimated with the EZ biotin quantitation kit (Pierce). Typically, 99% of the protein was biotinylated. CrystallizationâCrystals of the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex were grown under the conditions described previously (27Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Mourad W. Li H.

To fully address whether zinc is involved in the complex formation, we soaked the complex crystals from the no-EDTA and no-Zn2+condition in the mother liquor containing 10 mm CdCl2. If a protein is known to bind zinc, cadmium ion is frequently used to substitute zinc for the determination of protein structure using the multiple isomorphous replacement method (36Kadima W.

The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) Sedimentation VelocityâSedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were conducted at 20 Â°C in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm. Double-sector cells were loaded with 400 Î¼l of proteins samples and with 410 Î¼l of reference solutions, respectively. Unless otherwise specified, the reference solution is Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) containing 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. In certain experiments, 2 mm EDTA or ZnCl2 was added to both protein and reference solutions. Data were recorded with absorbance detection at wavelengths of 280, 294, and 300 nm for low, moderate, and high concentrations of proteins, respectively. Absorbance profiles were analyzed with the software SEDFIT (39Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), using a model for continuous sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) (40Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R.

Distributions were calculated with maximum entropy regularization at a predetermined confidence level of 1 S.D. AUC Sedimentation EquilibriumâSedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted at a temperature of 20 Â°C and at three or four rotor speeds for each protein or mixture. The individual protein or protein mixture (100 Î¼l) at various concentrations in HBS, with or without EDTA/ZnCl2, was loaded into an Epon double-sector centerpiece. Reference cells were loaded with 110 Î¼l of reference solution. For the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, mixtures of MAM and DR1 at various molar ratios and concentrations (5:2, 5:3, 15:1, and 1:4, in a real micromolar ratio of concentrations for MAM:HLA-DR1) were used for sedimentation equilibrium analysis with three rotor speeds (20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm). For the complex with 1 mm ZnCl2, MAM and DR1, at 16:1 and 8:0.5 in a real micromolar ratio of concentrations, were analyzed with four rotor speeds (15,000, 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm). For DR1 alone, sedimentation equilibrium of DR1 was analyzed at concentrations of 1 and 5 Î¼m with or without 1 mm ZnCl2, with three rotor speeds (18,000, 21,000, and 24,000 rpm). In the Zn2+ titration experiment for DR1 alone, 2 Î¼m DR1 was used with various Zn2+ concentrations (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 mm). For MAM alone, the equilibrium experiment was conducted at protein concentrations of 2 and 15 Î¼m, with or without 1 mm ZnCl2, and with three rotor speeds (20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm). All equilibrium absorbance profiles were acquired at a 280-nm wavelength. The equilibrium sedimentation data were analyzed using the software SEDPHAT (39Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed by global least squares analysis of data from multiple concentrations and multiple rotor speeds, using conservation of mass constraints (39Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Affinity Measurement Using SPRâAffinity and kinetic analyses of the interactions between MAM and HLA-DR1/HA were determined using a BIAcore 3000 SPR instrument (BIAcore) at 25 Â°C. Biotinylated HLA-DR1/HA complex was immobilized (â¼260 RU) onto a streptavidin (SA) sensor chip (BIAcore). The concentrations used for the injected MAM samples ranged from 8 Î¼m to 32 nm, with 2-fold dilutions. A blank surface blocked by biotin was used as the control surface. To minimize nonspecific binding, we carried out all of the binding experiments in 10 mm Hepes buffer containing 1 m sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, at a flow rate of 30 Î¼l/min. Pulses of 10 mm NaOH were used to regenerate both surfaces between injections. Association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates, as well as the dissociation constant (KD), were obtained by global fitting of the SPR data from multiple concentrations to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model, using BIAevaluation software version 4.1. Crystal Structures of the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA Complex in the Presence of EDTAâPreviously, we determined the crystal structure of a MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex (27Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Mourad W. Li H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No Zn2+ could be detected coordinated into the crystals, even though the crystallization buffer contained 1 mm Zn(OAc)2 (27Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Mourad W. Li H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Stack R. Hauer C. Li H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, zinc has been reported to be critical for the biological function of MAM (29Etongue-Mayer P. Langlois M.A. Ouellette M. Li H. Younes S. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Langlois M.A. El Fakhry Y. Mourad W. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of zinc in the biological activity of MAM, we determined the crystal structures of the binary complex under several contrasting conditions. The MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex was successfully crystallized under conditions, similar to those previously described (32Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Stack R. Hauer C. Li H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but in the absence of Zn(OAc)2 and/or in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). These new crystals are isomorphous with those obtained under the Zn2+ condition. We also soaked the complex crystals in the mother liquor with 10 mm CdCl2. Diffraction data were collected to 2.8, 3.0, and 2.6 Ã resolution for the crystals without Zn2+, with EDTA, and with Cd2+, respectively. The crystal structures of these complex crystals were refined to Rfactor values of 27.2% (no Zn2+), 21.1% (EDTA), and 23.4% (Cd2+), with Rfree values of 31.2, 26.1, and 26.6%, respectively (Table 1). The structures determined from these crystals can be readily superposed with the structure of the complex crystal obtained in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 1) (27Zhao Y. Li Z. Drozd S. Guo Y. Mourad W. Li H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations in the C-Î± positions of all amino acids among these structures are within 0.35 Ã. For the Cd2+-soaked crystals, no Cd2+ ion could be located in the electron density map. These structures could suggest that the Zn2+ ion is not directly involved in the interaction between MAM and class II MHC molecules. MAM Binds to the HLA-DR1/HA Complex with a 1:1 Stoichiometry, in the Absence of Zn2+âTo further investigate the molecular interaction between MAM and class II MHC molecule, we performed sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation with individual proteins and mixtures (Fig. 2). Previously, we demonstrated that MAM exists as a monomer at low protein concentration (â¤11 Î¼m) and that it can dimerize at high concentrations (â¥25 Î¼m) independent of Zn2+ (41Li H. Zhao Y. Guo Y. Vanvranken S.J. Li Z. Eisele L. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The MAM monomer showed a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient (S) of about 2.1 (Fig. 2A), whereas the S value for a MAM dimer is 3.0 (41Li H. Zhao Y. Guo Y. Vanvranken S.J. Li Z. Eisele L. Mourad W. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the absence of Zn2+ ion, the HLA-DR1/HA complex showed a large peak, corresponding to a DR1 monomer, at 3.3 S (Fig. 2A). The sedimentation coefficient distribution of a mixture of 6 Î¼m MAM and 6 Î¼m HLA-DR1/HA showed two peaks at 2.1 and 4.0 S, respectively. The peak at 2.1 S corresponds to residue-unbound MAM monomer, whereas the peak at 4.0 S represents some species other than the unbound HLA-DR1/HA complex (at 3.3 S). This result demonstrates an interaction between the two molecules. Indeed, the value of the new peak at 4.0 S is very close to the S value (4.1 S) predicted by hydrodynamic modeling of a MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Increasing the protein concentrations of MAM (to 30 Î¼m) and HLA-DR1/HA (to 10 Î¼m) resulted in a peak for the sedimentation coefficient at 4.0 S, similar to that for the MAMÂ·DR1 complex at low protein concentrations (Fig. 2). Addition of EDTA to the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex did not alter the 4.0 S peak position (Fig. 2B). These experiments demonstrated that MAM forms a complex with the HLA-DR1/HA complex in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Because addition of EDTA to the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex mixture did not change the sedimentation profile, we conclude that formation of the MAM/HLA-DR1/HA complex is not dependent on divalent metal ions such as Zn2+. MAM Binds to the HLA-DR1/HA Complex with High Affinity, in the Absence of Zn2+âBy the SPR technique, we measured the affinity and kinetics of MAM binding to the HLA-DR1/HA complex. We produced a C-terminal biotinylated DR1 molecule using a strategy similar to that described by Wu et al. (42Wu L.C. Tuot D.S. Lyons D.S. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). A construct was made to express the Î²-chain of HLA-DR1 with an HA peptide covalently linked to its N terminus through a linker peptide similar to what we and others described previously (29Etongue-Mayer P.

In addition, an amino acid tag encoding a signal sequence for attaching biotin with the BirA enzyme was attached to the C terminus of the DR1 Î²-chain through a p"

We present here the first crystal structures showing an unexpected Ca2+ binding mode of the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A in atomic detail. Acidic residues from the linker region between the C2A and C2B domains of rabphilin-3A interact with the Ca2+-binding region of the C2B domain. Because of these interactions, the coordination sphere of the two bound Ca2+ ions is almost complete. Mutation of these acidic residues to alanine resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the intrinsic Ca2+ binding affinity of the C2B domain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that this interaction occurred only in the Ca2+-bound state of the C2B domain. In addition, this Ca2+ binding mode was maintained in the C2 domain tandem fragment. In NMR-based liposome binding assays, the linker was not released upon phospholipid binding. Therefore, this unprecedented Ca2+ binding mode not only shows how a C2 domain increases its intrinsic Ca2+ affinity, but also provides the structural base for an atypical protein-Ca2+-phospholipid binding mode of rabphilin-3A.

Rabphilin-3A belongs to a structurally diverse synaptic protein family whose role is to support and regulate the Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release process. A significant number of these proteins share a common structural feature, a tandem of C2 domains. Although specific roles have been attributed to some members of this family, the exact function of rabphilin-3A is still not clear at present. Rabphilin-3A has been shown to interfere with the exocytotic/endocytotic machinery in different secretory systems (1.Coppola T. Hirling H. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Catsicas S. Joberty G.

Many studies suggest that rabphilin-3A functions in the synaptic vesicle trafficking processes preceding and/or following the vesicle fusion itself. In PC12 cells, the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A was shown to interact with SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa), regulating the docking step of dense core vesicles (5.Tsuboi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39253-39259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rabphilin knock-out studies carried out in mouse (6.Schluter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzonopoulos T. Nicoll R.A. Janz R. Malenka R.C. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5834-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (7.Staunton J. Ganetzky B. Nonet M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9255-9264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that this protein is largely dispensable for the neurotransmitter release process. Nevertheless, in C. elegans, rabphilin-3A is able to potentiate the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) function (7.Staunton J. Ganetzky B. Nonet M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9255-9264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, it was shown that, in mouse neurons, rabphilin-3A alters, via its C2B domain, the recovery of synaptic responses after high frequency stimulation (8.Deak F. Shin O.H. Tang J. Hanson P. Ubach J. Jahn R. Rizo J. Kavalali E.T. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2856-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With the precise role of rabphilin-3A remaining to be clarified, these most recent findings suggest a fine-tuning function for this protein in the vesicle fusion machinery.Functionally, two regions of rabphilin-3A have been defined so far: the N-terminal Rab-binding domain, responsible for its interaction with the small GTPases Rab3 and Rab27 (9.Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13065-13075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal C2 domain tandem fragment, involved in the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding property of the protein (11.Chung S.H. Song W.J. Kim K. Bednarski J.J. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10240-10248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as well as in several protein-protein interactions.The tandem C2 domains of synaptic vesicle proteins function as membrane-targeting modules, activated upon an increase in the local Ca2+ concentration. More specifically, the fast synaptic vesicle fusion requires Ca2+ concentrations in the range of tens to hundreds micromolar. In binding assays with negatively charged membranes, this concentration range corresponds to the relative Ca2+ affinity of the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin 1, the hypothesized Ca2+ sensor for this process. In solution, the Ca2+ binding affinity of these C2 domains is significantly lower compared with their relative affinity in the presence of membranes (12.Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). This difference has been explained by a Ca2+-bridging mechanism underlying these interactions. According to this hypothesis, the incomplete Ca2+ coordination sphere in the C2 domains is filled by phosphate groups of the phospholipids, resulting in complete coordination spheres of the C2 domain-bound Ca2+ ions and thus in a tremendous increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity (13.Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar).The C2 core domain is defined by the typical eight-stranded Î²-sandwich fold. Many C2 core domains contain also a Ca2+-binding region (CBR) 5The abbreviations used are: CBR, Ca2+-binding region; SeMet, selenomethionine; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; CBL, Ca2+-binding loop; PS, phosphatidylserine.5The abbreviations used are: CBR, Ca2+-binding region; SeMet, selenomethionine; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; CBL, Ca2+-binding loop; PS, phosphatidylserine. with a conserved consensus sequence of acidic residues, but this motif alone does not reflect the large variations in the Ca2+ and Ca2+-mediated membrane binding affinities among these domains (14.Dai H.

Biol. 2004; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) structural rearrangements. So far, such structural changes have been identified only within the C2 core domains of these proteins.The Ca2+ binding mode of the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A has not been studied so far at atomic resolution. Its intrinsic Ca2+ binding affinity in solution has been shown to be in the 8-11 Î¼m range (18.Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR structure of the C2B core domain, this unusually high Ca2+ affinity in comparison with C2 domains with a similar fold but much lower intrinsic Ca2+ affinity could not be explained. We took advantage of complementary x-ray and NMR techniques to probe the structural basis of this fundamental feature. The structural work presented here shows that Ca2+ binding of the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A is not mediated only by the classical CBR. Unexpectedly, a sequence upstream of the C2 core domain that belongs to the C2A-C2B tandem linker participates in the Ca2+ binding. This has important implications for the high intrinsic Ca2+ binding affinity of the C2B domain, the spatial proximity of the C2 domains upon Ca2+ signaling, and the way rabphilin-3A may interact with biological membranes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and PurificationâThe cDNAs encoding fragments 371-510, 528-684, 519-684, and 371-684 of rat rabphilin-3A were cloned into the expression vector pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). The expression constructs encoding N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of these rabphilin-3A fragments were expressed and purified as described (19.Fykse E.M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2385-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein expression was carried out overnight in LB medium at 17 Â°C. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin. Cleavage of the fusion protein was performed with thrombin on a column. The fragment released was further purified on a HiTrap SP XL cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Fragment 519-684, used for crystallization experiments, was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex S-75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein was expressed in minimal medium supplemented with SeMet according to the EMBL Protein Expression Group (embl-heidelberg.de) and purified according to the established protocol.The C2B domain single mutants E529A and E530A, double mutant E529A/E530A, and triple mutant E528A/E529A/E530A were obtained using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The sense primers were designed as follows: E529A, 5â²-ATG GCT CTC TAT GAG GCG GAG CAG GTG GAG C-3â²; E530A, 5â²-ATG GCT CTC TAT GAG GAG GCG CAG GTG GAG C-3â²; E529A/E530A, 5â²-ATG GCT CTC TAT GAG GCG GCG CAG GTG GAG C-3â²; and E528A/E529A/E530A, 5â²-ATG GCT CTC TAT GCG GCG GCG CAG GTG GAG-3â².Crystallization and Structure DeterminationâFor crystallization, rabphilin-3A fragment 519-684 was concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained at 12 and 20 Â°C using vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution (0.1 m HEPES (pH 8.5), and 20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 or 20% polyethylene glycol 8000). They grew within 1 week to a final size of â¼25 Ã 25 Ã 100 Î¼m3 and were used for streak seeding to obtain crystals of SeMet protein as well as crystals of native protein with reservoir solutions containing 200 mm Ca2+. For data collection, all crystals were harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in a cryosolution containing the reservoir solution supplemented with 10% glycerol. Data were collected at Swiss Light Source beamline PX6 (Mar225 CCD detector) and processed using the program HKL2000 (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar). Statistics for data collection and processing are summarized in Table 1. The structure of crystals grown without adding Ca2+ was solved from SeMet crystals (space group P21212) by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the programs SHELXC, SHELXD, and SHELXE (21.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 22.Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The initial electron density map was excellent (supplemental Fig. 1) and allowed automatic model tracing, alternated with structure refinement by ARP/wARP (23.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), resulting in the modeling of 131 residues. Refinement was performed by manual model building with COOT (24.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22781) Google Scholar), followed by positional and B-factor refinement with REFMAC5 (25.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar) coupled with ARP solvent building. For placing hydrogen atoms and refining occupancies due to radiation damage, the final refinement was done with SHELXL (26.Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The final model contains 143 of 165 residues, two Ca2+ ions, and 68 water molecules. Residues at the N terminus (positions 519-523) and C terminus (positions 578-584) and in two loop regions (positions 536-538 and 587-588) are disordered. The structure of crystals grown in Ca2+ (space group P21) was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER (27.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) using the SeMet structure as the search model. There are two monomers in the asymmetric unit. After initial rigid body and restrained B-factor refinement with REFMAC5 (25.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar), manual model building was performed with COOT (24.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22781) Google Scholar). The final refinement was done with SHELXL (26.Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The model contains 149 residues for monomer A, 147 residues for monomer B, one phosphate group, two Ca2+ ions for each monomer, and a total of 77 water molecules. In both monomers, residues at the N and C termini are disordered (monomer A, residues 519-523 and 679-684; and monomer B, residues 519-524 and 678-684). In monomer A, loop residues 536-538 and 587-588 are also disordered, whereas in monomer B, only loop residues 533-538 are disordered. The phosphate group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Phe612 in monomer B and with Gly652 of a symmetry-related monomer B.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSe PEAKSe INFLSe high remoteNative crystal with Ca2+Data collectionWavelength (Ã)0.97920.97960.95000.9536Space groupP21212P21212P21212P21Cell parameters (Ã)a = 53.898, b = 60.043, c = 41.928a = 40.069, b = 59.606, c = 66.385 (Î² = 103.89Â°)Resolution (Ã)1.91 (2.01-1.91)1.92 (2.02-1.92)1.28 (1.38-1.28)1.85 (1.94-1.85)Redundancy7.07 (6.71)6.17 (3.90)1.72 (1.16)6.44 (4.43)Completeness (%)98.6 (96.9)96.9 (87.9)94.2 (72.7)97.2 (93.9)Mean I/Ï(I)18.62 (12.89)15.69 (7.74)14.38 (2.84)12.5 (3.07)Rint (%)aRint = â|Fo2 - Fo2(mean)|/â[Fo2].7.07 (12.90)8.32 (14.84)2.92 (21.00)8.86 (40.06)RefinementRbR = â||Fo| - |Fc||/â|Fo|.14.4019.48RfreecRfree is the same as R, expect for a 5% subset of all reflections.19.3726.75Protein atoms11232314Heteroatoms29Water molecules6877Mean B-value (Ã2)18.98528.618Main chain15.72625.973Side chains22.02731.210Standard uncertaintiesBond length (Ã)0.0110.005Bond angle0.030Â°0.021Â°Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored region89.687.7Allowed region10.411.5Generally allowed region00.4Disallowed region00.4a Rint = â|Fo2 - Fo2(mean)|/â[Fo2].b R = â||Fo| - |Fc||/â|Fo|.c Rfree is the same as R, expect for a 5% subset of all reflections. Open table in a new tab For both crystal structures, residues with completely or partially disordered side chains are listed in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The statistics of the Ramachandran plots and of the refinement are shown in Table 1.NMR MeasurementsâNMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker 700 or 900 spectrometer at 298 K. NMR samples for C2B domain fragments 519-684 and 528-684 and the C2A domain fragment (371-510) contained 1 mm 15N- or 15N/13C-uniformly labeled protein in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% D2O (NMR buffer). The C2A-C2B domain (residues 371-684) samples contained 0.3 mm 15N-labeled protein in NMR buffer. The Ca2+ concentrations added to the samples are specified below. Backbone C-Î±, C-Î², and nitrogen chemical shifts were obtained using standard triple-resonance experiments (28.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw (29.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView Version 5.0.4 (30.Johnson B.A. Blevin R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar) and Sparky (31.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky Version 3. University of California, San Francisco1989Google Scholar). 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effect values were calculated as the intensity ratios of the 1H-15N correlation peaks from pairs of interleaved spectra acquired with and without 1H saturation during the recycle time of 5 s (32.Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).The phospholipid binding assays were performed based on 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra of 0.5-1 mm 15N-labeled protein samples in NMR buffer. Liposomes were prepared from synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) as follows. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine and 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were dissolved at a molar ratio of 20:80 in chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (95:5, v/v). The lipid film obtained after overnight drying under vacuum was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. After sonication, the lipid solution was passed 17 times through a 400-nm pore size filter using an extruder device (LiposoFast, Avestin Inc.). This liposome solution was added to the NMR sample to a final lipid concentration of 10 mm, resulting in a 3-fold molar excess of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine to the protein.A stock solution of 50 mm 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl was used to perform a titration with 15N-labeled C2B domain fragment 519-684 in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+. Glycerophosphoserine was chemically synthesized according to patent WO 87/05024 (42Scolastico, C., and Palazzi, C. M. F. G. (August 27, 1987) Italy, Patent WO 87/05024Google Scholar). A 100 mm glycerophosphoserine stock solution in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl with 0.1 or 1 mm Ca2+ was used to perform titrations with 1 mm 15N-labeled C2B domain fragment 519-684 NMR samples.RESULTSOverall StructureâThe fragment chosen for crystallizing rabphilin-3A C2B domain fragment 519-684 was N-terminally extended by 5 residues compared with the fragment that had been used to solve the NMR structure of this C2B domain (fragment 524-684) (18.Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using synchrotron radiation, native and SeMet crystals grown without the addition of Ca2+ diffracted up to 1.58- and 1.28-Ã resolution, and native and SeMet crystals grown in the presence of 200 mm Ca2+ diffracted up to 1.91- and 1.85-Ã resolution, respectively. Therefore, the structure of the crystals obtained without the addition of Ca2+ (low Ca2+ structure) was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using the SeMet crystals. This structure was used as a search model to obtain the structure of the native crystals grown with 200 mm Ca2+ in the reservoir (high Ca2+ structure) by molecular replacement. Under low Ca2+ conditions, the C2B domain fragment crystallized in space group P21212 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the presence of 200 mm Ca2+ in the reservoir resulted in crystals in space group P21 with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. As already described for its solution structure (18.Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the core of the C2B domain folds as a typical type I antiparallel eight-stranded Î²-sandwich with a short helix between strands 5 and 6 and a longer helix between strands 7 and 8 in both crystal structures (Fig. 1, A and B; and supplemental Fig. 2). It strongly resembles the structure in solution (root mean square deviations of 1.2909 Ã with the low Ca2+ structure and 1.2386 and 1.2603 Ã with monomers A and B of the high Ca2+ structure, respectively) (supplemental Fig. 3). Two Ca2+ ions are bound in the low as well as high Ca2+ structure. This is in accordance with the surprisingly high Ca2+ binding affinity described for this C2 domain in solution (18.Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An unexpected feature is found in both crystal structures: several residues from the region upstream of the core domain (residues 519-549) interact with the CBR of the C2 domain (Fig. 1, C and D). In rabphilin-3A, this region is part of the linker between the C2A and C2B domains. More specifically, a stretch of 6 residues (Leu526-Gln531) docks to the region between Ca2+-binding loop (CBL) 1 and CBL3, thus forming a lid above the Ca2+-binding sites. The secondary structure of this short stretch differs between the two crystal structures. In the low Ca2+ structure, it forms an extended loop, whereas in the high Ca2+ structure, it forms a short helix. Despite differences in hydrogen bonding to symmetry-related molecules (supplemental Tables 3 and 4), the two structures obviously represent two possible conformations in which the N-terminal acidic region may contribute to Ca2+ binding. The loop connecting this N-terminal part of the linker region to Î²-strand 1 of the C2 core domain is partially disordered (Fig. 1, A and B; and supplemental Fig. 2).The C2A-C2B Linker Is Involved in Ca2+ BindingâIn both crystal structures, a glutamic acid residue establishes essential contacts with CBL3 and with both Ca2+ ions. This residue is Glu529 in the low Ca2+ structure and Glu530 in the high Ca2+ structure. Despite the different secondary structures in the N-terminal stretch, in both structures, these glutamic acid residues are in a nearly identical position and orientation relative to the Ca2+-binding sites and to CBL3 (Figs. 1, C and D; and 2B). They interact with the Ca2+ in binding site 2 through their main chain carbonyl groups and contact the Ca2+ in binding site 1 through water-mediated hydrogen bonding of their O-Îµ2. Otherwise, both Ca2+ ions interact with the acidic residues found in the classical consensus sequence (13.Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) of C2 domains (Fig. 2, A and B). The Ca2+ in binding site 2 is coordinated by the main chain carbonyl group of Met570; the O-Î´1 of Asp571 and Asp633; the O-Î´2ofAsp631, Asp633, and Asp639; and the already mentioned carbonyl group of the Glu529/Glu530 backbone. The Ca2+ in binding site 1 is coordinated by the main chain carbonyl of Tyr632; the O-Î´1ofAsp571, Asp631, and Asp633; and the O-Î´2ofAsp571 and Asp577. The seventh oxygen atom is provided by the only Ca2+-coordinating water molecule, which hydrogen bonds with the side chain O-Îµ2ofGlu529/Glu530 (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, both Ca2+ ions are heptacoordinate with a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, which recalls the one found in EF-hand proteins (supplemental Fig. 4). The water molecule that participates in the coordination sphere of the Ca2+ in binding site 1 as the seventh ligand interacts extensively with several Ca2+-binding residues belonging to the consensus sequence, viz. the O-Î´2ofAsp571, the O-Îµ2ofGlu530, the O-Î´2 of Asp 577, and the O-Î´1ofAsp633. In both crystal structures, the side chain carboxyl group of Glu529/Glu530 forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH groups of Ile634 and Gly635, thus securing a strong interaction between the N-terminal linker region and CBL3. Next to the Ca2+-bridging Glu529/Glu530 residue, Glu528/Glu529 (in low versus high Ca2+ structures) establishes, through its backbone carbonyl group, a hydrogen bond with the Ala572 main chain amide, holding CBL1 tightly packed in the CBR. Thus, in both crystal structures, the first of the two acidic patches from the linker (see Fig. 6) connects CBL1 and CBL3 through a hydrogen bond network (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 2Coordination of the Ca2+ ions in the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A.

Shown is the sequence alignment of C2B domains (rabphilin-3A and Doc2Î³) and C2A domains (rabphilin-3A; synaptotagmins (SYT) 7, 1, and 2; Doc2Î±; and Doc2Î²), including sequences upstream of the C2 core domains. All sequences are from Rattus norvegicus. The secondary structure elements correspond to the rabphilin-3A C2B core domain structures. Black arrows represent theÎ²-strands, and gray rectangles represent the Î±-helices. The color code for the alignment is as follows: dark green, identical residues; green, similar residues; and pale green, blocks of similar residues. The alignment was performed using Vector NTI. The red box highlights the acidic sequences upstream of the C2 core domains, and the orange boxes show the two acidic patches (first patch, residues 528-530; and second patch, residues 537-540) in the rabphilin-3A C2A-C2B tandem linker.

Ca 1 and Ca 2, Ca2+ in binding sites 1 and 2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another striking feature concerns the positioning of the Lys636 side chain, which interacts via hydrogen bonds with two Ca2+-binding residues, viz. Asp633 O-Î´1 and Asp639 O-Î´2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This has two consequences. First, the motions of the side chains of both Ca2+-binding residues may be restricted, holding them in an optimal position for binding the Ca2+ ions. Second, the positive charge carried by the side chain amino group of Lys636 is spatially located at the same position as the third Ca2+-binding site found in the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 (Fig. 3C).Acidic Residues from the Linker Are Essential for the High Ca2+ Binding Affinity of the C2B DomainâTo further investigate the interaction of the C2A-C2B domain linker region with the C2B core domain, we performed a solution NMR study. For this purpose, two C2B domain fragments were produced: a âlongâ fragment (residues 519-684), used to crystallize this domain, and a âshortâ fragment (residues 528-684), including the first acidic patch (see Fig. 6). Experiments to obtain C2B core domain fragment 541-684 in soluble form failed. Additionally, we also performed NMR measurements on the C2A-C2B tandem (residues 371-684) and C2A domain (residues 371-510) fragments.Triple-resonance backbone assignment experiments were carried out on C"
