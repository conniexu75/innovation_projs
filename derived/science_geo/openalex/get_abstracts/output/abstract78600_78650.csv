https://openalex.org/W2092336855,"IT seems generally accepted that the eucaryotic cellular form (that is, cells with developed nuclei) has developed from procaryotic forms. Stanier1 suggested that this transition may have taken place in the blue–green algae, because these have the same photosynthetic mechanism as do other algae and higher plants."

https://openalex.org/W2059576874,"WE have conducted experiments on speech communication in extremely noisy environments; one of our findings is particularly surprising, and may be of value to understanding situations in which intense noise is inherently present."

https://openalex.org/W2093367136,STUDIES of the nutrition and nitrogen metabolism of some macropod marsupials (kangaroos and wallabies) suggested that the level of energy metabolism of marsupials may be lower than that of eutherian mammals1.

https://openalex.org/W2071899765,"DURING an investigation of the possible role of chelation in the gastrointestinal absorption of iron in man, we have considered the endogenous ligands which could be secreted into the gut. Gastric juice seemed likely to be an important source because the rapid formation of iron chelates would require a low pH and because dietary iron is split off from protein during acid–peptic digestion in the stomach."
