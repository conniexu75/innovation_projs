Here, we report a combination of cell-cycle regulators that induce stable cytokinesis in adult post-mitotic cells. We screened cell-cycle regulators expressed in proliferating fetal cardiomyocytes and found that overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK4, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 efficiently induced cell division in post-mitotic mouse, rat, and human cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of the cell-cycle regulators was self-limiting through proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein products. In vivo lineage tracing revealed that 15%-20% of adult cardiomyocytes expressing the four factors underwent stable cell division, with significant improvement in cardiac function after acute or subacute myocardial infarction. Chemical inhibition of Tgf-β and Wee1 made CDK1 and cyclin B dispensable. These findings reveal a discrete combination of genes that can efficiently unlock the proliferative potential in cells that have terminally exited the cell cycle."

However, the role of sensory neurons in pulmonary host defense is unclear. Here, we found that TRPV1+ nociceptors suppressed protective immunity against lethal Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Targeted TRPV1+-neuron ablation increased survival, cytokine induction, and lung bacterial clearance. Nociceptors suppressed the recruitment and surveillance of neutrophils, and altered lung γδ T cell numbers, which are necessary for immunity. Vagal ganglia TRPV1+ afferents mediated immunosuppression through release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be an effective approach to treat lung infections and bacterial pneumonia."

In conclusion, attenuation of pericyte-derived fibrosis represents a promising therapeutic approach to facilitate recovery following CNS injury. Major obstacles blocking axonal regeneration after injury include scar formation, a long-lasting inflammatory response, proteoglycans, and myelin debris (Cregg et al., 2014Cregg J.M.

Neurol. 2016; 286: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Less attention has been given to the fibrotic, or stromal, compartment of the scar. Fibrotic scar tissue formation by a subset of perivascular cells, termed type A pericytes, is required for regaining tissue integrity, but creates a scar core of fibroblast-like cells and dense extracellular matrix (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C.

Previous attempts to remove or modify specific extracellular matrix molecules have shown potential to improve axonal regeneration (Brazda and Müller, 2009Brazda N. Müller H.W.

CNS injury, glial scars, and inflammation: Inhibitory extracellular matrices and regeneration failure.Exp. Neurol. 2008; 209: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, there are many different extracellular matrix proteins deposited in the fibrotic scar, and they often have complex, context-dependent functions and cannot easily be categorized as axon growth promoting or inhibiting (Condic and Lemons, 2002Condic M.L. Lemons M.L. Extracellular matrix in spinal cord regeneration: getting beyond attraction and inhibition.Neuroreport. 2002; 13: A37-A48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The large number of inhibitory cues present in the scar makes molecule-specific targeting strategies impractical. The identification of type A pericytes as the origin of fibroblast-like cells found in fibrotic scar tissue in the injured spinal cord (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C. Dias D.O. Tomilin N. Barbacid M. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. A pericyte origin of spinal cord scar tissue.Science. 2011; 333: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) enabled us in the current study to selectively reduce pericyte-derived scarring to assess its influence on axonal regeneration and functional recovery. We report that significantly more descending axons grow through the lesion site in the injured spinal cord when pericyte-derived fibrosis is moderately reduced, regenerating axons synaptically integrate below the lesion and functional recovery is improved. This identifies type A pericytes as a target for the development of therapies to promote axonal regeneration after CNS injury. We used Glast-CreERT2 transgenic mice carrying a ROSA26-YFP reporter allele to genetically label type A pericytes and their progeny forming the fibrotic scar following spinal cord injury (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C.

As previously established, following injury, inhibition of type A pericyte proliferation through cell-specific deletion of floxed KRas in mice with HRas and NRas null alleles by tamoxifen-induced genetic recombination with CreERT2 (we refer to these mice as Glast-Rasless) reduces fibrotic scar tissue formation (Figures 1A and S1A–S1L ) in a recombination-dependent manner (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C.

Two weeks after dorsal hemisection injuries, we found that 3/12 tamoxifen-injected Glast-Rasless mice showed highly efficient recombination levels, leading to complete block of fibrotic scar formation and failure to close the injury site. We refer to mice with this phenotype as Tam-tissue defect (Tam-def). The remaining 9/12 tamoxifen-injected Glast-Rasless mice displayed intermediate levels of recombination. We refer to mice with this phenotype as Tam. Tam animals had re-established tissue integrity but presented reduced fibrotic scar density in comparison with control mice of identical genotype injected with vehicle (hereafter referred to as vehicle animals). Vehicle animals presented dense PDGFRβ+ fibrotic scar cores (Figures 1B–1D and S1M–S1R). We next characterized the gene expression associated with type A pericyte-derived scarring, by RNA sequencing. Using the Glast-Rasless line (Figure 1A), we compared whole lesion segments from vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated animals 2 weeks after spinal cord dorsal hemisection. We identified 1,099 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p < 0.05, fold change > ± 1.5) (Figure S2A; Tables S1 and S2). In line with the reduction of fibrotic scar tissue, gene ontology analyses revealed gene expression differences in categories such as extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibril organization, cell-matrix and cell-substrate adhesion, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Figures 1E, S2B, and S2C). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a notable similarity to hepatic fibrosis/stellate cell activation (Mederacke et al., 2013Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S. Huebener P. Mu X. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Schwabe R.F. Fate tracing reveals hepatic stellate cells as dominant contributors to liver fibrosis independent of its aetiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). We found a large number of fibrosis-associated genes, encoding for an array of extracellular matrix molecules and collagen-processing enzymes, displaying reduced levels of expression in Tam animals when compared to vehicle animals. Strikingly, the expression of fibrosis-associated genes in Tam animals clustered with the expression profile of uninjured animals, rather than vehicle animals, establishing that type A pericytes are required for the generation of fibrotic tissue and that reducing their generation of progeny blocks a broad range of injury-induced gene expression changes (Figure 1G). Examples of differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time qPCR and at the protein level (Figures S2D–S2J and S2L–S2P). Vehicle animals displayed increased expression of fibrillar collagens type I and III, basal lamina-associated collagen type IV, collagen type VI, and fibronectin at the injury site compared to Tam animals (Figures S2F–S2J and S2L–S2P). Reduction of a specific cellular component of the scar can influence the contribution of other scar-forming cells (Anderson et al., 2016Anderson M.A. Burda J.E. Ren Y. Ao Y. O’Shea T.M. Kawaguchi R.

The glial scar is more than just astrocytes.Exp. Neurol. 2016; 286: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, astrocytes and fibrotic cells interact to form a sharp lesion border (Bundesen et al., 2003Bundesen L.Q. Scheel T.A. Bregman B.S. Kromer L.F. Ephrin-B2 and EphB2 regulation of astrocyte-meningeal fibroblast interactions in response to spinal cord lesions in adult rats.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7789-7800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the influence of reduced pericyte-derived scarring on other cell types, we analyzed changes in astrogliosis, inflammation, and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) numbers in Glast-Rasless mice 2 and 4 weeks after a dorsal hemisection (Figures S3A–S3R). The general inflammatory response, assessed as area covered by CD68+ macrophages/microglia, was not significantly changed between vehicle and Tam animals at 2 weeks post injury (wpi), while Tam-def animals showed an increased inflammatory response. During scar maturation/condensation at 4 wpi, Tam animals presented reduced inflammation compared to vehicle animals (Figures S3A–S3F and S3M). No changes were observed in the number of OPCs (non-vascular-associated NG2+/PDGFRα+ cells) (Assinck et al., 2017Assinck P. Duncan G.J. Plemel J.R. Lee M.J. Stratton J.A. Manesh S.B. Liu J. Ramer L.M. Kang S.H. Bergles D.E. et al.Myelinogenic plasticity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells following spinal cord contusion injury.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 8635-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) flanking the lesion or in spared but reactive neural tissue across all three groups at 2 and 4 wpi (Figures S3N and S3O). Although no difference in general astrogliosis and glial scar state was detected at 2 wpi across groups, the glial process network immediately flanking the lesion core tended to present a less complex arrangement in Tam animals (Figures S2K, S2Q, S3P, and S3Q). At 4 wpi, differences among groups became more apparent with Tam animals exhibiting reduced general astrogliosis, decreased dense wall-like configuration of glial processes at the glial-fibrotic lesion border, and diminished astrocyte reactivity within the parenchyma when compared to vehicle animals (Figures S3G–S3L, S3P, and S3R). A spinal cord dorsal hemisection interrupts bilaterally descending motor pathways, including the serotonergic raphespinal tract (RST) and the corticospinal tract (CST) (Tuszynski and Steward, 2012Tuszynski M.H. Steward O. Concepts and methods for the study of axonal regeneration in the CNS.Neuron. 2012; 74: 777-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). BDA-traced CST axons contacted glial and non-neural scar-forming cells 2 weeks following a dorsal hemisection (Figures 2A–2C and S3S–S3V). Because the injured spinal cord tissue rapidly is flanked by reactive astrocytes and OPCs, the glial scar represents the first barrier to regenerating axons (Fitch and Silver, 2008Fitch M.T. Silver J. CNS injury, glial scars, and inflammation: Inhibitory extracellular matrices and regeneration failure.Exp. Neurol. 2008; 209: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, Hackett and Lee, 2016Hackett A.R. Lee J.K. Understanding the NG2 glial scar after spinal cord injury.Front. Neurol. 2016; 7: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, we found that 46.9% ± 4.7% and 22.5% ± 4.2% of BDA+ CST axon tips make contact with GFAP+- reactive astrocytes and OPCs (Figures 2C, S3U, and S3V), respectively. Additionally, 16.1% ± 3.2% of the BDA+ axon tips contacted CD68+ cells, most likely reflecting axons undergoing macrophage-mediated axonal dieback (Busch et al., 2009Busch S.A. Horn K.P. Silver D.J. Silver J. Overcoming macrophage-mediated axonal dieback following CNS injury.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9967-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Figures 2C and S3T). Interestingly, 6.6% ± 3.1% of BDA-traced axon tips were able to penetrate the glial scar and the glial-fibrotic interface and contacted YFP+ type A pericyte-derived stromal cells (Figures 2A–2C and S3S). To investigate the influence of reduced type A pericyte-derived scarring on axonal regeneration, we quantified BDA-traced CST axons in Glast-Rasless mice after a dorsal hemisection. BDA+ CST axons in vehicle animals showed extensive retraction bulb formation and axonal dieback at 2 and 4 wpi. In comparison to the vehicle group, Tam animals displayed fewer dystrophic end bulbs, and on average, BDA+ CST axons were found closer to the rostral lesion margin. In contrast to the Tam group, Tam-def animals showed no significant difference in CST retraction bulb formation and axonal dieback compared to vehicle animals at 2 or 4 wpi (Figures 2D–2M). No CST axon regeneration into or beyond the lesion site was detected in vehicle or Tam animals at 2 wpi (Figures 2N and 2O). At 4 wpi, we observed BDA+ CST axons reaching the vicinity of the lesion core in Tam animals, with axons growing into and beyond the scar in some instances. Vehicle animals showed no CST axon regeneration into or beyond the scar at 4 wpi (Figures 2P and 2Q). We noticed that while in vehicle and Tam-def animals, CST axons stopped proximal to the glial-fibrotic lesion border, regrowing CST axons aligned with astrocyte processes and extended into the margin and core of the lesion in Tam animals at 4 wpi (Figures S3W–S3Z). We next assessed CST axon regeneration in Glast-Rasless mice 18 weeks after a dorsal hemisection (Figures 3A–3W ). Tamoxifen-induced genetic recombination with CreER is infrequently complete, as previously established (Göritz et al., 2011Göritz C. Dias D.O. Tomilin N. Barbacid M. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. A pericyte origin of spinal cord scar tissue.Science. 2011; 333: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The recombination efficiency in Glast-Rasless mice negatively correlated with fibrotic scar tissue generation and positively correlated with failure to close the injury site and the appearance of a tissue defect (Figures 3L–3N). Vehicle and Tam-def animals showed little or no CST axon regeneration into or beyond the lesion site. In contrast, 10.5% ± 2.1% of the traced CST axons (relative to traced CST axons found 3 mm proximal to the lesion in the same animals) extended into the lesion site in Tam animals (Figures 3A–3K, 3O, and 3P). This corresponded on average to 10.6 ± 2.6 traced CST axons reaching the lesion core per 10 sagittal sections. In 4 of the 10 Tam animals, CST fibers reached the scar core but did not grow beyond the lesion, while in the remaining 6 animals, CST axons extended caudally, reaching up to 4 mm beyond the lesion (Figures 3D–3F, 3H, and 3O–3R).

Of tumors that develop resistance to highly potent second-generation ALK inhibitors, approximately half harbor resistance mutations in ALK, while the other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance. Members of the latter group often have activation of at least one of several different tyrosine kinases driving resistance. Such tumors are not expected to respond to lorlatinib-a third-generation inhibitor targeting ALK that is able to overcome all clinically identified resistant mutations in ALK-and further therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we deployed a shRNA screen of 1,000 genes in multiple ALK-inhibitor-resistant patient-derived cells (PDCs) to discover those that confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. This approach identified SHP2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a common targetable resistance node in multiple PDCs. SHP2 provides a parallel survival input downstream of multiple tyrosine kinases that promote resistance to ALK inhibitors. Treatment with SHP099, the recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of SHP2, in combination with the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ceritinib halted the growth of resistant PDCs through preventing compensatory RAS and ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) reactivation. These findings suggest that combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for resistant cancers driven by several different ALK-independent mechanisms underlying resistance."

Cracking the code whereby these oscillations coordinate in time and space (spatiotemporal dynamics) to represent complex behaviors would provide fundamental insights into how the brain signals emotional pathology. Using machine learning, we discover a spatiotemporal dynamic network that predicts the emergence of major depressive disorder (MDD)-related behavioral dysfunction in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. Activity patterns in this network originate in prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, relay through amygdala and ventral tegmental area, and converge in ventral hippocampus. This network is increased by acute threat, and it is also enhanced in three independent models of MDD vulnerability. Finally, we demonstrate that this vulnerability network is biologically distinct from the networks that encode dysfunction after stress. Thus, these findings reveal a convergent mechanism through which MDD vulnerability is mediated in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2789971483,"More than 70% of all agricultural pests are insects in the order Lepidoptera, which, unlike other related insect orders, are not very sensitive to RNAi, limiting genetic studies of this insect group. However, the reason for this distinct lepidopteran characteristic is unknown. Previously, using transcriptome analysis of the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis, we identified a gene, termed up56, that is up-regulated in response to dsRNA. Here we report that this Lepidoptera-specific gene encodes a nuclease that contributes to RNAi insensitivity in this insect order. Its identity was experimentally validated, and sequence analysis indicated that up56 encodes a previously uncharacterized protein with homologous sequences in seven other lepidopteran species. Its computationally predicted three-dimensional structure revealed a high structural similarity to human exonuclease I. Exposure to dsRNA in O. furnacalis strongly up-regulated this gene’s expression, and the protein could digest single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), dsRNA, and dsDNA both in vitro and in vivo. Of note, we found that this up-regulation of up56 expression is faster than that of the gene encoding the key RNAi-associated nuclease Dicer. up56 knockdown in O. furnacalis significantly enhanced RNAi efficiency. Moreover, up56 overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster suppressed RNAi efficiency. Finally, up56 knockdown significantly increased the amount and diversity of small RNAs. Therefore, we renamed this protein RNAi efficiency–related nuclease (REase). In conclusion, we propose that REase may explain why lepidopterans are refractory to RNAi and that it represents a target for further research of RNAi efficiency in this insect order.

However, RNAi efficiency is the most important restriction factor of this technology, especially in lepidopteran insects, because many studies have shown that RNAi efficiency is relatively low in this insect order (5Terenius O.

In contrast, many Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera seem to be more sensitivity to RNAi, even though a certain degree of variability exists in these orders as well (2Baum J.A. Bogaert T.

This study attempts to disclose the reason why such a difference in RNAi efficiency is observed among different insect orders. It is well established that the RNAi pathway is a natural antiviral immunity system (9Ding S.W. RNA-based antiviral immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10 (20706278): 632-64410.1038/nri2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Viral dsRNA is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and processed into siRNAs by the Dicer enzyme, after which the siRNA can enter the subsequent RNAi pathway and cause the gene-silencing effect (10Fire A.

RNAi technology has been used as a genetic tool for investigating gene function, particularly in nonmodel insect species, and a potential method for pest control (6Joga M.R. Zotti M.J. Smagghe G.

RNA interference.Nature. 2002; 418 (12110901): 244-25110.1038/418244aCrossref PubMed Scopus (3515) Google Scholar). Several factors have been identified that could be related to RNAi insensitivity in insects, including impaired cellular uptake, the presence of viral infections, and a saturated RNAi machinery (14Christiaens O. Swevers L. Smagghe G. DsRNA degradation in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) associated with lack of response in RNAi feeding and injection assay.Peptides. 2014; 53 (24394433): 307-31410.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In fact, the three major RNAi pathways (microRNA, siRNA, and piwi-interacting RNA) are found in all 32 insect orders, but RNAi efficiency is very variable between many of these insect species (15Dowling D. Pauli T. Donath A. Meusemann K. Podsiadlowski L. Petersen M. Peters R.S. Mayer C. Liu S. Zhou X. Misof B. Niehuis O. Phylogenetic origin and diversification of RNAi pathway genes in insects.Genome Biol. Evol. 2016; 8 (28062756): 3784-3793PubMed Google Scholar). This means that even when the same amount of dsRNA is introduced into the insect body, the effective dsRNA that can be processed into siRNA and recruited to the RNA-induced silencing (RISC) complex are different between insect species (16Shukla J.N. Kalsi M. Sethi A. Narva K.E. Fishilevich E. Singh S. Mogilicherla K. Palli S.R. Reduced stability and intracellular transport of dsRNA contribute to poor RNAi response in lepidopteran insects.RNA Biol. 2016; 13 (27245473): 656-66910.1080/15476286.2016.1191728Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, in many insects, degradation of dsRNA, notably in the digestive system, seems to play a major role in low sensitivity to RNAi. Research indicates that dsRNA can be rapidly degraded in the saliva of Lygus lineolaris (17Allen M.L. Walker 3rd., W.B. Saliva of Lygus lineolaris digests double stranded ribonucleic acids.J. Insect Physiol. 2012; 58 (22226823): 391-39610.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, both the salivary secretions and the hemolymph were able to degrade the dsRNA rapidly (14Christiaens O. Swevers L. Smagghe G. DsRNA degradation in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) associated with lack of response in RNAi feeding and injection assay.Peptides. 2014; 53 (24394433): 307-31410.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was also found in the gut juice of Schistocerca gregaria (18Luo Y. Wang X. Wang X. Yu D. Chen B. Kang L. Differential responses of migratory locusts to systemic RNA interference via double-stranded RNA injection and feeding.Insect Mol.

In a comparative study between two different insect species, dsRNA was found to persist much longer in Blattella germanica hemolymph plasma than in Manduca sexta hemolymph (20Garbutt J.S. Bellés X.

In another study, two coleopteran insects, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera and Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and two lepidopteran insects, Spodoptera frugiperda and Helicoverpa zea, were fed dsRNA-containing diets. Two days later, samples were collected and, using Northern blotting to analyze the concentration of dsRNA in insects, the results revealed that dsRNA was much more stable in the coleopteran species than in the two lepidopterans (21Ivashuta S.

Interestingly, a recent study also showed that dsRNA degradation in the gut plays a role in some coleopteran insects as well, and that a high degree of variability in RNAi efficiency and dsRNA stability can be found between two very closely related species (22Christiaens O. Prentice K. Pertry I. Ghislain M. Bailey A. Niblett C. Gheysen G. Smagghe G. RNA interference: a promising biopesticide strategy against the African sweetpotato weevil Cylas brunneus.Sci.

These studies all indicate that there are nucleases that can degrade dsRNA in different tissues of insects, but that a degree of variability in nuclease activity is observed between insects. In the silkworm, desert locust, and Colorado potato beetle, Bm-dsRNase, Sg-dsRNase, and Ld-dsRNase were found in the gut, respectively (8Spit J. Philips A. Wynant N. Santos D. Plaetinck G.

In this nuclease family, dsRNA is the most preferred substrate, even though ssRNA, 4The abbreviations used are: ssRNAsingle-stranded RNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNAcDNAcomplementary DNAqRT-PCRreal-time quantitative PCRKTIKunitz trypsin inhibitor; chymotrypsinRNA-SeqRNA sequencingRdRPRNA-dependent RNA polymeraseFAWfall armywormdsEGFPdouble-stranded enhanced GFPqPCRquantitative PCRREaseRNAi efficiency–related nuclease. ssDNA, and dsDNA can be degraded as well (26Meiss G.

In fact, nucleases have been found to affect RNAi efficiency in many species. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the eri-1 (enhanced RNAi-1) gene, which encodes a nuclease, seems to inhibit RNAi efficiency because eri-1 mutant C. elegans are more sensitive to RNAi than WT worms (27Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. A conserved siRNA-degrading RNase negatively regulates RNA interference in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In Dicer-related helicase 2 (drh-2)–mutant nematodes, RNAi efficiency was also enhanced (28Lu R. Yigit E. Li W.X. Ding S.W. An RIG-I-like RNA helicase mediates antiviral RNAi downstream of viral siRNA biogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5 (19197349)e100028610.1371/journal.ppat.1000286Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Besides endogenous nucleases, exogenous nucleases introduced into the body can also affect RNAi efficiency. PPR3 of a fish DNA virus (PPIV) belonging to the class 1 RNaseIII endoribonuclease-like proteins can suppress RNAi in the nonhosts Nicotiana benthamiana and C. elegans through cleaving double-stranded siRNA (29Weinheimer I. Jiu Y. Rajamäki M.L. Matilainen O. Kallijärvi J. Cuellar W.J. Lu R. Saarma M. Holmberg C.I. Jäntti J. Valkonen J.P.

In previous research, we identified a gene that can be induced significantly by dsRNA presence and that we named up56 (30Guan R.B. Li H.C. Miao X.X. Prediction of effective RNA interference targets and pathway-related genes in lepidopteran insects by RNA sequencing analysis.Insect Sci. 2017; 10.1111/1744-7917.12437PubMed Google Scholar). Here we selected Ostrinia furnacalis as the major research subject and present data indicating that up56 is a new type of nuclease, called RNAi efficiency–related nuclease (REase) and that this nuclease is one of the factors that can explain why Lepidoptera are so refractory to RNAi. We investigated the expression profile of this gene, examined the enzyme activity of the translated protein, and investigated whether knocking down this nuclease could enhance RNAi efficiency in O. furnacalis. The full-length 1866-nucleotide cDNA sequence of REase was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology (GenBank accession no. F682492). Sequence similarity searches in GenBank (via NCBI) indicated that the highly identical genes were annotated as uncharacterized proteins and protein asteroid homologs. To investigate the correct identification, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 41 genes from 40 species belonging to six insect orders by the neighbor-joining method (Fig. 1A and Table S1). The results indicated that REase gathered together in one branch with six other uncharacterized proteins. All other 34 proteins, which were named as protein asteroids, gathered in the other branch. All uncharacterized protein genes in the branch with REase were only present in lepidopteran insects (Fig. 1A, red underline). We also found that the REase gene from O. furnacalis and the uncharacterized protein from Helicoverpa armigera were up-regulated by dsEGFP (Fig. 1B). However, expression of the protein asteroid genes from O. furnacalis, H. armigera, and Tribolium castaneum was not affected by dsEGFP exposure (Fig. 1C). Although these two types of genes have similar sequences, their function must be different. To further study the function of the REase gene, multiple sequence alignment analysis was done for the seven uncharacterized protein genes in these Lepidoptera (Fig. 1D). Their amino acid sequence similarity was found to be around 30%. Protein domain analysis revealed that this protein family contains a PilT N terminus (PIN) domain at the 5′ end (Fig. 1D, green underline). Three strictly conserved acidic residues are also labeled (Fig. 1D, red crosses). Apart from these three residues in the PIN domain, this gene shows a very high sequence diversity between different species (31Arcus V.L. McKenzie J.L. Robson J. Cook G.M. The PIN-domain ribonucleases and the prokaryotic VapBC toxin-antitoxin array.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2011; 24 (21036780): 33-4010.1093/protein/gzq081Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PIN domain proteins are found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, where they function as nucleases that are involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (32Glavan F. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Structures of the PIN domains of SMG6 and SMG5 reveal a nuclease within the mRNA surveillance complex.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (17053788): 5117-512510.1038/sj.emboj.7601377Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), so we deduced that REase is likely to be a new member of the PIN domain family and has nuclease activity. To further study the function of REase, the three-dimensional structure of REase was predicted by SWISS-MODEL. The results showed that the first 340 amino acids of REase had a similar secondary structure as 3qe9.1 of human exonuclease I (Fig. S1). The first 340 amino acids were then used to predict the three-dimensional structure using the I-TASSER service. The highest score-threading template was 3qe9Y, human exonuclease I. The predicted protein model was compared with 3qe9Y, and we found that these were highly consistent (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the 2-, 30-, 76-, 83-, 90-, 111-, 138-, 156-, and 169-amino acid sites are capable of binding to nucleic acid sequences (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the protein could have nuclease activity. Using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system to express REase, a 72-kDa protein was obtained (Fig. 2C). Western blotting was used to confirm that this 72-kDa protein was in fact REase (Fig. 2D). The purified REase was then incubated at 37 °C with dsRNA, ssRNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, and plasmid DNA. Three days later, the stability of these nucleic acids was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and we observed that all the types of nucleic acids could be degraded by REase (Fig. 2E). The enzyme degradation rates for dsRNA are shown in Fig. 2, F and G. These results indicate that about 50% of the dsRNA can be partially degraded after 1 day of incubation and that, after 2 days, all dsRNA was degraded (Fig. 2, F and G). According to the above results, we confirmed that REase is a new nuclease belonging to the PIN domain family. More important is that REase was only found in Lepidoptera insects according to current database information. The only problem is that enzyme activity was found to be relatively low. This may be due to the purity or structure effects on the enzyme activity by the in vitro expression system. To check whether virus-expressed REase can degrade dsEGFP in vivo, the purified REase and fluorescently labeled dsEGFP were injected into fifth-instar larvae of the Asian corn borer, using BSA as positive control. We observed that virus-expressed REase can speed up the degradation of fluorescently labeled dsRNA in the body of the Asian corn borer (Fig. S2). Previous results indicated that expression of REase can be up-regulated by introduction of dsEGFP (Fig. 1B). To investigate the relative transcript levels of REase in different tissues, total RNAs were isolated from the blood, brain, head, fat body, and midgut of dsRNA-treated and untreated fifth-instar O. furnacalis larvae. Gene transcript levels were then analyzed by qRT-PCR. REase was found to be mainly expressed in the midgut before dsRNA treatment (Fig. 3A). Expression was found to be up-regulated in different tissues 4 h after dsRNA treatment; however, the induced expression level in the midgut remained higher than in other tissues at this time point (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that REase is mainly functional in the midgut. To clearly understand the relationship between its expression pattern and its function in the midgut, dsEGFP was used to induce REase expression, and dsREase was used to knock down REase expression. We discovered that REase expression levels with both treatments were significantly different 4 h after treatment (Fig. 3B). Compared with dsEGFP-induced up-regulation, treatment with dsREase led to a knockdown of the REase expression level (Fig. 3B). Then the insect midgut fluid was extracted 6 h after being induced by dsEGFP or dsREase, using midgut fluid from untreated larvae as a control. Three different midgut extracts were incubated with dsRNA or DNA. The results showed that the extracts from dsEGFP-treated larvae were able to degrade dsRNA or DNA more quickly (Fig. 3, C and D, 1.5 h, lane 2) than the midgut fluid from dsREase-treated larvae (Fig. 3, C and D, 1.5 h, lane 3) because REase content was enhanced by dsEGFP treatment and reduced by dsREase treatment. These results suggest that REase expression rates can affect the nucleic acid degradation rate. We further repeated this experiment in the cotton bollworm (H. armigera) and found similar results. dsEGFP treatment also accelerated dsRNA degradation by midgut extracts in H. armigera (Fig. S3, 1 h, lane 2). Previous results indicated that, in general, dsRNA is more stable in coleopteran insect than in lepidopteran insects (21Ivashuta S. Zhang Y. Wiggins B.E. Ramaseshadri P. Segers G.C. Johnson S. Meyer S.E. Kerstetter R.A. McNulty B.C. Bolognesi R. Heck G.R. Environmental RNAi in herbivorous insects.RNA. 2015; 21 (25802407): 840-85010.1261/rna.048116.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results also confirmed that dsRNA is more stable in the midgut solution of the larvae of the coleopteran Holotrichia diomphalia than in the lepidopteran O. furnaclis and H. armigera. The dsRNA was digested after 2 h in the midgut solution of these lepidopteran insects (Fig. S4, 2 h, lanes 2 and 3), whereas in the midgut extract of the coleopteran species, the dsRNA was still unaffected 6 h after treatment (Fig. S4, 6 h, lane 1). This result was also confirmed by an in vivo test. Fluorescently labeled dsEGFP was injected into H. diomphalia grubs and O. furnaclis and H. armigera larvae. Each insect was injected with different amounts of dsEGFP according to body weight (1 μg/g of body weight). The fluorescence could be observed in the bodies of the coleopteran grubs after 15 days of injection; however, the fluorescent signal disappeared just 3 days after injection (Fig. S5). In contrast, in both lepidopteran species, the fluorescent signal was much weaker and disappeared almost entirely after 48–72 h. We hypothesize that, in these lepidopterans, the specific REase or REase-like enzyme accelerates the digestion of dsRNA. To further assess the in vivo effects of REase on dsRNA and RNAi efficacy, O. furnaclis KTI (Kunitz trypsin inhibitor) and CTP8 (chymotrypsin 8) were selected as marker genes. Fifth-instar larvae within 12 h of ecdysis were injected with dsKTI or dsCTP8. Not surprisingly, the REase gene expression was found to be up-regulated compared with control samples (Fig. 4, A and B, gray columns). Therefore, to suppress the expression level of the REase gene, a double RNAi experimental setup was used, injecting dsREase plus dsKTI or dsCTP8 (Fig. 4, A and B, black columns). Transcript-level analysis indicated that REase gene expression can be knocked down significantly compared with larvae that were treated only with dsKTI or dsCTP. To discover the effect of REase down-regulation on the RNAi efficiency of dsKTI or dsCTP, the relative expression levels of KTI and CTP8 after double RNAi treatment with dsREase plus dsKTI or dsCTP8 were compared with those when only dsKTI or dsCTP8 were injected. The results showed that knocking down the expression of REase could significantly enhance the RNAi efficiency of KTI and CTP8 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, C and D, black columns). We were unable to find a homologous gene of REase in the Drosophila melanogaster genome (Fig. 1A). To further verify the effect of REase on RNAi efficiency in vivo, we constructed the GMR/+; UAS-white-dsRNA/UAS-REase and GMR/+; UAS-white-dsRNA/+ transgenic Drosophila line. Expression of white-dsRNA and REase was induced in Drosophila compound eyes by a GMR-GAL4 driver. Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that REase could be overexpressed in these flies (Fig. 4E); at the same time, the white gene RNAi efficiency in the UAS-white dsRNA line was significantly more robust than in the REase overexpression line (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that REase overexpression can decrease target gene RNAi efficiency in vivo. However, GMR/+; UAS-white-dsRNA/UAS-REase can only decrease the RNAi efficiency, it c"

These cells persist in the bone marrow (BM) despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here we show that although the microRNA (miRNA) miR-126 supported the quiescence, self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs, miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from healthy individuals. Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 (SPRED1) by BCR-ABL, which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that mediates miRNA maturation. Endothelial cells (ECs) in the BM supply miR-126 to CML LSCs to support quiescence and leukemia growth, as shown using mouse models of CML in which Mir126a (encoding miR-126) was conditionally knocked out in ECs and/or LSCs. Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase in endogenous miR-126 levels, which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence. Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs, or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs, enhanced the in vivo anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC leukemia-initiating capacity, providing a new strategy for the elimination of LSCs in individuals with CML."
https://openalex.org/W2791459799,"Mass cytometry of diagnostic biopsies from children with B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia identifies a signaling state that predicts relapse. Insight into the cancer cell populations that are responsible for relapsed disease is needed to improve outcomes. Here we report a single-cell-based study of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis that reveals hidden developmentally dependent cell signaling states that are uniquely associated with relapse. By using mass cytometry we simultaneously quantified 35 proteins involved in B cell development in 60 primary diagnostic samples. Each leukemia cell was then matched to its nearest healthy B cell population by a developmental classifier that operated at the single-cell level. Machine learning identified six features of expanded leukemic populations that were sufficient to predict patient relapse at diagnosis. These features implicated the pro-BII subpopulation of B cells with activated mTOR signaling, and the pre-BI subpopulation of B cells with activated and unresponsive pre-B cell receptor signaling, to be associated with relapse. This model, termed 'developmentally dependent predictor of relapse' (DDPR), significantly improves currently established risk stratification methods. DDPR features exist at diagnosis and persist at relapse. By leveraging a data-driven approach, we demonstrate the predictive value of single-cell 'omics' for patient stratification in a translational setting and provide a framework for its application to human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2792774280,"Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for cortical circuit refinement. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis suggests that synaptic connections are strengthened during wake and downscaled during sleep; however, it is not obvious how the same plasticity rules could explain both outcomes. Using whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic input in urethane-anesthetized mice, which exhibit slow-wave-sleep (SWS)-like activity, we show that synaptic plasticity rules are gated by cortical dynamics in vivo. While Down states support conventional spike timing-dependent plasticity, Up states are biased toward depression such that presynaptic stimulation alone leads to synaptic depression, while connections contributing to postsynaptic spiking are protected against this synaptic weakening. We find that this novel activity-dependent and input-specific downscaling mechanism has two important computational advantages: (1) improved signal-to-noise ratio, and (2) preservation of previously stored information. Thus, these synaptic plasticity rules provide an attractive mechanism for SWS-related synaptic downscaling and circuit refinement."
https://openalex.org/W2792776749,"Excitation is balanced by inhibition to cortical neurons across a wide range of conditions. To understand how this relationship is maintained, we broadly suppressed the activity of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory neurons and asked how this affected the balance of excitation and inhibition throughout auditory cortex. Activating archaerhodopsin in PV+ neurons effectively suppressed them in layer 4. However, the resulting increase in excitation outweighed Arch suppression and produced a net increase in PV+ activity in downstream layers. Consequently, suppressing PV+ neurons did not reduce inhibition to principal neurons (PNs) but instead resulted in a tightly coordinated increase in both excitation and inhibition. The increase in inhibition constrained the magnitude of PN spiking responses to the increase in excitation and produced nonlinear changes in spike tuning. Excitatory-inhibitory rebalancing is mediated by strong PN-PV+ connectivity within and between layers and is likely engaged during normal cortical operation to ensure balance in downstream neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2791715060,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune pathology leading to neurodegeneration. Because of the complexity and heterogenic etiology of this disease, diagnosis and treatment for individual patients are challenging. Exosome-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as a new class of diagnostic biomarkers involved in both autoimmune and neurologic disorders. Interesting new evidence has emerged showing that circulating miRNAs are dysregulated in MS body fluids, including serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. We hypothesized that exosome-associated miRNAs could present a readily accessible blood-based assay for MS disease. We detected expression of miRNAs by quantitative PCR on a small cohort of MS patients. We analyzed circulating exosome-associated miRNAs of MS patients before and after therapy and found that 14 exosome-associated miRNAs were significantly down-regulated, while 2 exosome-associated miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in IFN-β-treated relapsing-remitting MS patients with response to therapy compared to those without response. We identified a serum miRNA panel that could be used to monitor the response to IFN-β therapy. Overall, these data suggest that circulating exosome-associated miRNA profiling could represent an easily detectable biomarker of disease and treatment response.—Manna, I., Iaccino, E., Dattilo, V., Barone, S., Vecchio, E., Mimmi, S., Filippelli, E., Demonte, G., Polidoro, S., Granata, A., Scannapieco, S., Quinto, I., Valentino, P., Quattrone, A.

https://openalex.org/W2792650071,"A permissive chromatin environment coupled to hypertranscription drives the rapid proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and peri-implantation embryos. We carried out a genome-wide screen to systematically dissect the regulation of the euchromatic state of ESCs. The results revealed that cellular growth pathways, most prominently translation, perpetuate the euchromatic state and hypertranscription of ESCs. Acute inhibition of translation rapidly depletes euchromatic marks in mouse ESCs and blastocysts, concurrent with delocalization of RNA polymerase II and reduction in nascent transcription. Translation inhibition promotes rewiring of chromatin accessibility, which decreases at a subset of active developmental enhancers and increases at histone genes and transposable elements. Proteome-scale analyses revealed that several euchromatin regulators are unstable proteins and continuously depend on a high translational output. We propose that this mechanistic interdependence of euchromatin, transcription, and translation sets the pace of proliferation at peri-implantation and may be employed by other stem/progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2793443776,"Delamination of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the ventricular surface is a crucial prerequisite to form the subventricular zone, the germinal layer linked to the expansion of the mammalian neocortex in development and evolution. Here, we dissect the molecular mechanism by which the transcription factor Insm1 promotes the generation of basal progenitors (BPs). Insm1 protein is most highly expressed in newborn BPs in mouse and human developing neocortex. Forced Insm1 expression in embryonic mouse neocortex causes NPC delamination, converting apical to basal radial glia. Insm1 represses the expression of the apical adherens junction belt-specific protein Plekha7. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Plekha7 expression suffices to cause NPC delamination. Plekha7 overexpression impedes the intrinsic and counteracts the Insm1-induced, NPC delamination. Our findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism underlying NPC delamination in which a BP-genic transcription factor specifically targets the integrity of the apical adherens junction belt, rather than adherens junction components as such."
https://openalex.org/W2790344146,"Considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been dedicated to understanding how neural circuits detect visual motion. In primates, much is known about the cortical circuits that contribute to motion processing, but the role of the retina in this fundamental neural computation is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of extracellular and whole-cell recording to test for motion sensitivity in the two main classes of output neurons in the primate retina—midget (parvocellular-projecting) and parasol (magnocellular-projecting) ganglion cells. We report that parasol, but not midget, ganglion cells are motion sensitive. This motion sensitivity is present in synaptic excitation and disinhibition from presynaptic bipolar cells and amacrine cells, respectively. Moreover, electrical coupling between neighboring bipolar cells and the nonlinear nature of synaptic release contribute to the observed motion sensitivity. Our findings indicate that motion computations arise far earlier in the primate visual stream than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2794045676,"Prostate cancer (PCa) represents one of the most common solid neoplasms, and metastasis is the second leading cause of death in adult males. Anoikis is a programmed cell death that is induced upon cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), which behaves as a critical protective mechanism for anchorage-independent cell growth and metastasis formation. However, in the absence of ECM attachment, shift of metabolic pattern and tolerance to anoikis facilitate the survival of aggressive cancer cells in the circulatory system as well as their metastasis to distant sites. Few molecular targets in PCa have thus far been reported to prevent anoikis resistance, metabolic reprogramming and metastasis simultaneously. In the present study, elevated migration, invasion, pyruvate production, lactate generation, ATP level, and impaired detachment-induced apoptosis were found in anoikis-resistant PCa cells, and genome microarray analysis demonstrated that the cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) was a potential molecular target for the regulation of the aforementioned malignant behaviors. Additional investigation revealed that the AMPK/glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b)/b-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression in anoikis-resistant PCa cells might be implicated in local progression, metabolic shift, and cellular migration and invasion, whereas knockout of CEMIP by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 in anoikis-resistant PCa cells reversed the described bioeffects by reducing expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), VEGF, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), and lactate dehydrogenase A. In addition, inhibition of glycolysis by CEMIP-mediated PDK4 down-regulation impaired the migration and invasion of anoikis-resistant PCa cells by attenuating MMP2 and VEGF expressions. Our findings establish that AMPK/GSK3b/ b-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression might promote migration and invasion in anoikis-resistant PCa cells by enhancing PDK4-associated metabolic reprogramming, which may provide a novel, promising therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced PCa.—Zhang, P., Song, Y., Sun, Y., Li, X., Chen, L., Yang, L., Xing, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2791428099,"Tumor growth and relapse are driven by tumor propagating cells (TPCs). However, mechanisms regulating TPC fate choices, maintenance, and self-renewal are not fully understood. Here, we show that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core regulator of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway, affects TPC self-renewal in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)—a pediatric cancer of muscle. VANGL2 is expressed in a majority of human RMS and within early mononuclear progenitor cells. VANGL2 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, reduced TPC numbers, and induced differentiation of human RMS in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Using a zebrafish model of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), we determined that Vangl2 expression enriches for TPCs and promotes their self-renewal. Expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative isoforms of RHOA revealed that it acts downstream of VANGL2 to regulate proliferation and maintenance of TPCs in human RMS. Our studies offer insights into pathways that control TPCs and identify new potential therapeutic targets."

However, using signal detection theory, attention-related effects on performance can be partitioned into changes in either the subject’s criterion or sensitivity. Neuronal modulations associated with only sensitivity changes were previously observed in visual cortex, raising questions about which structures mediate attention-related changes in criterion and whether individual neurons are involved in multiple components of attention. Here, we recorded from monkey lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and found that, in contrast to visual cortex, neurons in LPFC changed their firing rates, pairwise correlation, and Fano factor when subjects changed either their criterion or their sensitivity. These results indicate that attention-related neuronal modulations in separate brain regions are not a monolithic signal and instead can be linked to distinct behavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W2791897774,"Animals acquire behaviors through instrumental conditioning. Brain-machine interfaces have used instrumental conditioning to reinforce patterns of neural activity directly, especially in frontal and motor cortices, which are a rich source of signals for voluntary action. However, evidence suggests that activity in primary sensory cortices may also reflect internally driven processes, instead of purely encoding antecedent stimuli. Here, we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore, learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. After learning, DMS inhibition did not affect production of the rewarded patterns. These data demonstrate that cortico-basal ganglia circuits play a general role in learning to produce cortical activity that leads to desirable outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2790986817,"Homology-directed recombination (HDR)–mediated genome editing is a powerful approach for both basic functional study and disease modeling. Although some studies have reported HDR-mediated precise editing in nonrodent models, the efficiency of establishing pure mutant animal lines that carry specific amino acid substitutions remains low. Furthermore, because the efficiency of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-induced insertion and deletion (indel) mutations is normally much higher than that of HDR-induced point mutations, it is often difficult to identify the latter in the background of indel mutations. Using zebrafish as the model organism and Y box–binding protein 1 (Ybx1/ybx1) as the model molecule, we have established an efficient platform for precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in somatic cells, yielding an efficiency of up to 74% embryos. Moreover, we established a procedure for screening germline transmission of point mutations out of indel mutations even when germline transmission efficiency was low ("

However, most analyses about the effect of H. pylori infection have been done in patients with a history of CVD but not in healthy subjects. We evaluated the association between H. pylori infection and subclinical atherosclerosis by using cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in healthy subjects without previous CVD. From December 2007 to February 2014, 463 subjects who underwent the rapid urease test (CLO test), pulse-wave velocity (PWV) measurement, and MDCT for a self-referred health check-up were enrolled to this study. Helicobacter pylori infection was defined on the basis of CLO test positivity on endoscopic gastric biopsy. Significant coronary artery stenosis was defined as ≥50% stenosis in any of the major epicardial coronary vessel on MDCT. The CLO-positive subjects had a lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) level compared to the CLO-negative subjects. The incidence of significant coronary stenosis was higher in the CLO-positive group (7.6% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the number of subjects with coronary artery calcium score >0 and log{(number of segments with plaque)+1} were also significantly higher in the CLO-positive group. However, there was no statistical difference in the number of subjects with coronary artery calcium score >100, the prevalence of any plaque nor the plaque characteristics (calcified, mixed, or soft). Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was neither associated with CLO test positivity. The CLO-positive group was 3-fold more likely to have significant coronary artery stenosis even after adjusting for confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio 2.813, 95% confidence interval 1.051-7.528, P = 0.04). In a healthy population, current H. pylori infection was associated with subclinical but significant coronary artery stenosis. The causal relationship between H. pylori infection and subclinical atherosclerosis in a ""healthy"" population remains to be investigated in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2793037512,"Summary Axon guidance involves the spatiotemporal interplay between guidance cues and membrane-bound cell-surface receptors, present on the growth cone of the axon. Netrin-1 is a prototypical guidance cue that binds to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), and it has been proposed that the guidance cue Draxin modulates this interaction. Here, we present structural snapshots of Draxin/DCC and Draxin/Netrin-1 complexes, revealing a triangular relationship that affects Netrin-mediated haptotaxis and fasciculation. Draxin interacts with DCC through the N-terminal four immunoglobulin domains, and Netrin-1 through the EGF-3 domain, in the same region where DCC binds. Netrin-1 and DCC bind to adjacent sites on Draxin, which appears to capture Netrin-1 and tether it to the DCC receptor. We propose the conformational flexibility of the single-pass membrane receptor DCC is used to promote fasciculation and regulate axon guidance through concerted Netrin-1/Draxin binding.

PCR of the mating type loci and MLST typing using the ISHAM-MLST consensus scheme were used to evaluate the genetic relationship of 102 (63 clinical and 39 environmental) C. neoformans isolates from Uberaba, Brazil and to correlate the obtained genotypes with clinical, antifungal susceptibility and virulence factor data. All isolates were mating type alpha. MLST identified 12 known and five new sequence types (ST). Fourteen STs were identified within the VNI isolates, with ST93 (57/102, 56%) and ST77 (19/102, 19%) being the most prevalent. From the nine VNII isolates previously identify by URA5-RFLP only four (ST40) were confirmed by MLST. The remaining five grouped within the VNB clade in the phylogenetic analysis corresponding to the sequence type ST504. Other two environmental isolates also grouped within VNB clade with the new sequence type ST527. The four VNII/ST40 isolates were isolated from CSF. The two VNIV sequence types (ST11 and ST160) were isolated from blood cultures. Two of six patients evaluated with more than one isolates had mixed infections. Amongst the VNI isolates 4 populations were identified, which showed differences in their susceptibility profiles, clinical outcome and virulence factors. These results reinforce that ST93 is the most prevalent ST in HIV-infected patients in the Southeastern region of Brazil. The finding of the VNB molecular type amongst environmental Brazilian isolates highlights that this genotype is not restricted to the African continent."
https://openalex.org/W2793579688,"Cardiac development requires coordinated and large-scale rearrangements of the epigenome. The roles and precise mechanisms through which specific epigenetic modifying enzymes control cardiac lineage specification, however, remain unclear. Here we show that the H3K4 methyltransferase SETD7 controls cardiac differentiation by reading H3K36 marks independently of its enzymatic activity. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that SETD7 targets distinct sets of genes to drive their stage-specific expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation. SETD7 associates with different co-factors at these stages, including SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling factors during mesodermal formation and the transcription factor NKX2.5 in cardiac progenitors to drive their differentiation. Further analyses revealed that SETD7 binds methylated H3K36 in the bodies of its target genes to facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription. Moreover, abnormal SETD7 expression impairs functional attributes of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. Together, these results reveal how SETD7 acts at sequential steps in cardiac lineage commitment, and they provide insights into crosstalk between dynamic epigenetic marks and chromatin-modifying enzymes."

Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by toxic gain of function of the androgen receptor (AR). Previously, we found that co-regulator binding through the activation function-2 (AF2) domain of AR is essential for pathogenesis, suggesting that AF2 may be a potential drug target for selective modulation of toxic AR activity. We screened previously identified AF2 modulators for their ability to rescue toxicity in a Drosophila model of SBMA. We identified two compounds, tolfenamic acid (TA) and 1-[2-(4-methylphenoxy)ethyl]-2-[(2-phenoxyethyl)sulfanyl]-1H-benzimidazole (MEPB), as top candidates for rescuing lethality, locomotor function and neuromuscular junction defects in SBMA flies. Pharmacokinetic analyses in mice revealed a more favorable bioavailability and tissue retention of MEPB compared with TA in muscle, brain and spinal cord. In a preclinical trial in a new mouse model of SBMA, MEPB treatment yielded a dose-dependent rescue from loss of body weight, rotarod activity and grip strength. In addition, MEPB ameliorated neuronal loss, neurogenic atrophy and testicular atrophy, validating AF2 modulation as a potent androgen-sparing strategy for SBMA therapy."

The positions of the anterior and posterior commissures were measured in both a fiducial marker-based system and a co-registered system. To assess the effects of MR image distortions, co-registration was performed with four different ranges, and the accuracy of the results was compared. Co-registration between CBCT images gave a mean three-dimensional deviation of 0.2 ± 0.1 mm. The co-registration of stereotactic CT images with CBCT images produced a mean deviation of 0.5 ± 0.2 mm. The co-registration of MR images with CBCT images resulted in the smallest three-dimensional difference (0.8 ± 0.3 mm) when a co-registration region covering the skull base area was applied. The image co-registration errors in frameless GKSRS were similar to the imaging errors of frame-based GKSRS. The lower portion of the patient’s head, including the base of the skull, is recommended for the ROC."

Sites of action of volatile anesthetics on the GABAA receptor remain unknown, whereas sites of action of many intravenous anesthetics have been identified in GABAA receptors by using photolabeling. Here, we used photoactivatable analogs of isoflurane (AziISO) and sevoflurane (AziSEVO) to locate their sites on α1β3γ2L and α1β3 GABAA receptors. As with isoflurane and sevoflurane, AziISO and AziSEVO enhanced the currents elicited by GABA. AziISO and AziSEVO each labeled 10 residues in α1β3 receptors and 9 and 8 residues, respectively, in α1β3γ2L receptors. Photolabeled residues were concentrated in transmembrane domains and located in either subunit interfaces or in the interface between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain. The majority of these transmembrane residues were protected from photolabeling with the addition of excess parent anesthetic, which indicated specificity. Binding sites were primarily located within α+/β- and β+/α- subunit interfaces, but residues in the α+/γ- interface were also identified, which provided a basis for differential receptor subtype sensitivity. Isoflurane and sevoflurane did not always share binding sites, which suggests an unexpected degree of selectivity.-Woll, K. A., Zhou, X., Bhanu, N. V., Garcia, B. A., Covarrubias, M., Miller, K.

This prospective study was performed to investigate the duration of motor and sensory blockade following use of bupivacaine for ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic nerve blocks in dogs and to measure the plasma concentrations of bupivacaine that result from these procedures. Six dogs were anesthetized twice using a randomized cross-over design. At the first anesthetic, dogs were assigned to receive either an ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block or sciatic nerve block with 0.15 mL kg-1 of bupivacaine 0.5%. Two months later, the other nerve block was performed during a second anesthetic. At 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after injection, arterial blood samples were collected for laboratory measurement of bupivacaine. After 60 minutes, dogs were recovered from anesthesia. Starting at two hours post-injection, video-recordings of the dogs were made every two hours for 24 hours. The videos were randomized and the degree of motor and sensory blockade was evaluated using a three-point scoring system (0 = no effect, 1 = mild effect, 2 = complete blockade) by two blinded assessors. The median (range) times to full recovery from motor blockade were 11 (6-14) hours (femoral) and 12 (4-18) hours (sciatic), and 15 (10-18) hours (femoral) and 10 (4-12) hours (sciatic) for sensory blockade. There were no differences in the median times to functional recovery for the two techniques. Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were no different following the blocks and were less than 0.78 μg mL-1 at all times. These results suggest that these ultrasound-guided nerve blocks do not result in potentially toxic systemic levels of local anesthetic and that their duration of action is useful for providing anesthesia and analgesia for pelvic limb procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2792565458,"The terminal differentiation and elimination of the embryo-suspensor is the earliest manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD) during plant ontogenesis. Molecular regulation of suspensor PCD remains poorly understood. Norway spruce (Picea abies) embryos provide a powerful model for studying embryo development because of their large size, sequenced genome, and the possibility to obtain a large number of embryos at a specific developmental stage through somatic embryogenesis. Here, we have carried out global gene expression analysis of the Norway spruce embryo-suspensor versus embryonal mass (a gymnosperm analogue of embryo proper) using RNA sequencing. We have identified that suspensors have enhanced expression of the NAC domain-containing transcription factors, XND1 and ANAC075, previously shown to be involved in the initiation of developmental PCD in Arabidiopsis. The analysis has also revealed enhanced expression of Norway spruce homologues of the known executioners of both developmental and stress-induced cell deaths, such as metacaspase 9 (MC9), cysteine endopeptidase-1 (CEP1) and ribonuclease 3 (RNS3). Interestingly, a spruce homologue of bax inhibitor-1 (PaBI-1, for Picea abies BI-1), an evolutionarily conserved cell death suppressor, was likewise up-regulated in the embryo-suspensor. Since Arabidopsis BI-1 so far has been implicated only in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress induced cell death, we investigated its role in embryogenesis and suspensor PCD using RNA interference (RNAi). We have found that PaBI-1-deficient lines formed a large number of abnormal embryos with suppressed suspensor elongation and disturbed polarity. Cytochemical staining of suspensor cells has revealed that PaBI-1 deficiency suppresses vacuolar cell death and induces necrotic type of cell death previously shown to compromise embryo development. This study demonstrates that a large number of cell-death components are conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms and establishes a new role for BI-1 in the progression of vacuolar cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2792272237,"Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are enzymes acting on the cell membrane phospholipids resulting in fatty acids and lysophospholipids and deconstructing the cell membrane. This protein is commonly found in snake venoms, causing tissue inflammation in the affected area. Evidence indicates that snakes have natural resistance to their own venom due to protective properties in plasma, that inhibit the action of proteins present in their venom. Given that, this study aimed to purify and characterize a γPLI from Bothrops jararaca serum, named γBjPLI. PLA2 inhibitor was isolated using two chromatographic steps: an ion exchange column (DEAE), followed by an affinity column (crotoxin coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose resin). The purity and biochemical characterization of the isolated protein were analyzed by RP-HPLC, SEC, SDS-PAGE, circular dichroism and mass spectrometry. The ability to inhibit PLA2 was determined by enzymatic activity, neutralization of paw edema and myonecrosis. The protein purity was confirmed by RP-HPLC and SEC, whilst an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa and 20 kDa was obtained by SDS-PAGE, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively. According to mass spectrometry analysis, this protein showed 72% and 68% of coverage when aligned to amino acid sequences of two proteins already described as PLIs. Thus, the inhibitory activity of enzymatic, edema and myonecrotic activities by γBjPLI suggests a role of this inhibitor for protection of these snakes against self-envenomation."

Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L and questions about multi-morbidity, smoking and perceived physical fitness. Additionally, the main health condition, sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from referrals and public registers were used as predictor variables. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were performed.The mean (standard error) overall disability score was 30.0 (0.5), domain scores ranged from 11.9 to 44.7. Neurological diseases, multi-morbidity, low education, impaired physical fitness, pain, and higher HADS depressive score increased the overall disability score. A low HADS depressive score predicted a lower disability score in all domains.A moderate overall disability score was found among patients accepted for admission to a rehabilitation center but ""life activities"" and ""participation in society"" had the highest domain scores. This should be taken into account when rehabilitation strategies are developed."
https://openalex.org/W2791616798,"Homothallism (self-fertility) describes a wide variety of sexual strategies that enable a fungus to reproduce in the absence of a mating partner. Unisexual reproduction, a form of homothallism, is a process whereby a fungus can progress through sexual reproduction in the absence of mating genes previously considered essential for self-fertility. In this study, we consider the molecular mechanisms that allow for this unique sexual behaviour in the saprotrophic ascomycete; Huntiella moniliformis. These molecular mechanisms are also compared to the underlying mechanisms that control sex in Huntiella omanensis, a closely related, but self-sterile, species. The main finding was that H. omanensis displayed mating-type dependent expression of the a- and α-pheromones. This was in contrast to H. moniliformis where both pheromones were co-expressed during vegetative growth and sexual development. Furthermore, H. moniliformis also expressed the receptors of both pheromones. Consequently, this fungus is likely able to recognize and respond to the endogenously produced pheromones, allowing for self-fertility in the absence of other key mating genes. Overall, these results are concomitant with those reported for other unisexual species, but represent the first detailed study considering the unisexual behaviour of a filamentous fungus."

First line treatment is well established, however disease invariably recurs and improving prognosis is challenging. With the aim of personalizing therapy at recurrence, we have established a high content screening (HCS) platform to analyze the sensitivity profile of seven patient-derived cancer stem cell lines to 83 FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs, with and without irradiation. Methods Seven cancer stem cell lines were derived from patients with GBM and, along with the established cell line U87-MG, each patient-derived line was cultured in tandem in serum-free conditions as adherent monolayers and three-dimensional neurospheres. Chemotherapeutics were screened at multiple concentrations and cells double-stained to observe their effect on both cell death and proliferation. Sensitivity was classified using high-throughput algorithmic image analysis. Results Cell line specific drug responses were observed across the seven patient-derived cell lines. Few agents were seen to have radio-sensitizing effects, yet some drug classes showed a marked difference in efficacy between monolayers and neurospheres. In vivo validation of six drugs suggested that cell death readout in a three-dimensional culture scenario is a more physiologically relevant screening model and could be used effectively to assess the chemosensitivity of patient-derived GBM lines. Conclusion The study puts forward a number of non-standard chemotherapeutics that could be useful in the treatment of recurrent GBM, namely mitoxantrone, bortezomib and actinomycin D, whilst demonstrating the potential of HCS to be used for personalized treatment based on the chemosensitivity profile of patient tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2791331407,"The transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is involved in a variety of physiologic processes. Although its activity appears to be largely correlated with its phosphorylation status, cAMP-mediated dephosphorylation and the subsequent nuclear migration of the CREB-regulated transcription factors (CRTCs) are required to stimulate CREB transcriptional activity. Among the 3 identified mammalian homologs of CRTCs, CRTC3 has been shown to be expressed predominantly in adipose tissues in response to catecholamine signals that regulate lipid metabolism. Here, we show that prolonged cAMP signaling down-regulates CRTC3 in a proteasome-dependent manner and that neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (NEDD4L), a specific ubiquitin ligase for CRTC3, is responsible for this process. By recognizing the PY motif of CRTC3, NEDD4L interacts with CRTC3 and promotes its polyubiquitination. Interaction between NEDD4L and CRTC3 is further boosted by cAMP signaling, and this enhanced interaction appears to be dependent on the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of NEDD4L at the Ser448 site. Furthermore, we show that food withdrawal stimulates NEDD4L phosphorylation in mice, which then show a decrease of adipose tissue CRTC3 protein levels. Together, these results suggest that NEDD4L plays a key role in the feedback regulation of cAMP signaling by limiting CRTC3 protein levels.—Kim, Y.-H., Yoo, H., Hong, A.-R., Kwon, M., Kang, S.-W., Kim, K., Song, Y.

A perfect reference gene should have a constant expression level under all the experimental conditions. However, the same few housekeeping genes selected from the literature or successfully used in previous unrelated experiments are often routinely used in new conditions without proper validation of their stability across treatments. The advent of RNA-Seq and the availability of public datasets for numerous organisms are opening the way to finding better reference genes for expression studies. Globodera rostochiensis is a plant-parasitic nematode that is particularly yield-limiting for potato. The aim of our study was to identify a reliable set of reference genes to study G. rostochiensis gene expression.

The non-IPD cohort was matched according to age, sex, and baseline comorbidities, including benign prostate hyperplasia, stress incontinence, diabetes, and cerebrovascular diseases. The occurrence of OAB was monitored until the end of 2011. Hazard ratios of OAB were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.In total, 4,571 and 18,255 patients were included in IPD and non-IPD cohorts, respectively. Results showed a significantly higher overall incidence rate of OAB in the IPD cohort compared with the non-IPD cohort (14.5 vs. 6.37 per 10,000 person-years), with a 2.3-fold increased risk of OAB (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-3.51) after controlling for benign prostate hyperplasia and stress incontinence. The mean follow-up period for the IPD cohort was 5.0 years. This cohort study showed that the cumulative incidence of OAB was 0.65% at the fifth year and 1.54% at the tenth year after IPD diagnosis; this risk was highest in the age group 65-74 years.This study reveals that IPD is independently associated with an increased risk of OAB in patients with IPD.

To further investigate the role of the fifth subunit, we coexpressed a dimeric construct coding for a single polypeptide containing the ß4and α3 subunit sequences, with different monomeric subunits. With this strategy, which allowed the formation of single populations of receptors with unique stoichiometry, we demonstrated with immunofluorescence and biochemical and functional assays that only the receptors with 3 ß4 subunits are efficiently expressed at the plasma membrane. Moreover, the LFM export motif of ß4 subunit in the fifth position exerts a unique function in the regulation of the intracellular trafficking of the receptors, their exposure at the cell surface, and consequently, their function, whereas the same export motif present in the ß4 subunits forming the acetylcholine binding site is dispensable.—Crespi, A., Plutino, S., Sciaccaluga, M., Righi, M., Borgese, N., Fucile, S., Gotti, C., Colombo, S.

To mitigate ROS damage, organisms have evolved a variety of antioxidant systems to counteract these harmful molecules, however in certain pathological conditions these protective mechanisms can be overwhelmed. We have recently demonstrated that Peptide Inhibitor of Complement C1 (PIC1) mitigates peroxidase activity of the heme bearing proteins myeloperoxidase, hemoglobin, and myoglobin through a reversible process. To determine if this property of PIC1 was antioxidant in nature, we tested PIC1 in a number of well-established antioxidant assays. PIC1 showed dose-dependent antioxidant activity in a total antioxidant (TAC) assay, hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay, oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assay as well as the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to screen for PIC1 antioxidant activity in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of PIC1 in the TAC assay, as well as the HORAC/ORAC assay demonstrated that this peptide acts via the single electron transport (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms, respectively. Consistent with this mechanism of action, PIC1 did not show activity in a metal chelating activity (MCA) assay. PIC1 contains two vicinal cysteine residues and displayed similar antioxidant activity to the well characterized cysteine-containing tripeptide antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH). Consistent with the role of the cysteine residues in the antioxidant activity of PIC1, oxidation of these residues significantly abrogated antioxidant activity. These results demonstrate that in addition to its described complement inhibiting activity, PIC1 displays in vitro antioxidant activity."

Its levels seems to be dependent of renal function, since higher progranulin concentration is observed in patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, the effect of kidney transplantation on progranulin remains unknown. Objective To assess the serum progranulin levels in kidney transplant recipients before and after kidney transplantation. Methods Forty-six prospective kidney transplant recipients were included in this longitudinal study. They were evaluated before transplantation and at three and twelve months after transplantation. Clinical, anthropometric and laboratorial measurements were assessed. Progranulin was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results Serum progranulin significantly decreased in the early period after transplantation (from 72.78 ± 2.86 ng/mL before transplantation to 40.65 ± 1.49 ng/mL at three months; p<0.01) and increased at one year (53.15 ± 2.55 ng/mL; p<0.01 vs. three months), remaining significantly lower than before transplantation (p<0.01) (pover time<0.01). At one year after transplantation, there was a significant increase in body mass index, trunk fat and waist circumference compared to immediate period after transplantation. Progranulin was associated with waist circumference and fasting plasma glucose after adjusted for age, gender, study period, glomerular filtration rate, interleukin-6, high sensitivity C reactive protein and adiponectin. Conclusion Progranulin serum levels are increased before transplantation and a reduction is observed in the early period after transplantation, possibly attributed to an improvement in renal function. At one year after transplantation, an increment in progranulin is observed, seems to be independent of glomerular filtration, and remained significantly lower than before transplantation."

Lyopreservation is hypothesized to rely upon the creation of a glassy environment, which is commonly observed in desiccation-tolerant organisms. Non-uniformities in dried samples have been indicated as one of the reasons for instability in storage outcome. The current study presents a simple, fast, and uniform surface tension based technique that can be implemented for lyopreservation of mammalian cells. The technique involves withdrawing cells attached to rigid substrates to be submerged in a solution of lyoprotectant and then withdrawing the samples at a specific rate to an inert environment. This creates a uniform thin film of desiccated lyoprotectant due to sudden change of surface tension. The residual moisture contents at different locations in the desiccated film was quantified using a spatially resolved Raman microspectroscopy technique. Post-desiccation cellular viability and growth are quantified using fluorescent microscopy and dye exclusion assays. Cellular injury following desiccation is evaluated by bioenergetic quantification of metabolic functions using extracellular flux analysis and by a Raman microspectroscopic analysis of change in membrane structure.
