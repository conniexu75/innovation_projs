https://openalex.org/W3183900570,"Targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 Inside host cells, the RNA genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is translated into two polyproteins that are cleaved to give the individual viral proteins. The main viral protease, known as Mpro or 3CLpro, plays a key role in these cleavages, making it an important drug target. Drayman et al . identified eight drugs that target 3CLpro from a library of 1900 clinically safe drugs. Because of the challenge of working with SARS-CoV-2, they started by screening for drugs that inhibit the replication of a human coronavirus that causes the common cold. They then evaluated the top hits for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and for inhibiting 3CLpro. Masitinib, a broad antiviral, inhibited the main proteases of coronaviruses and picornaviruses and was effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication in mice. —VV"
https://openalex.org/W3186272776,"Background Whilst evidence of use of face masks in reducing COVID-19 cases is increasing, the impact of mandatory use across a large population has been difficult to assess. Introduction of mandatory mask use on July 22, 2020 during a resurgence of COVID-19 in Melbourne, Australia created a situation that facilitated an assessment of the impact of the policy on the epidemic growth rate as its introduction occurred in the absence of other changes to restrictions. Methods and findings Exponential epidemic growth or decay rates in daily COVID-19 diagnoses were estimated using a non-weighted linear regression of the natural logarithm of the daily cases against time, using a linear spline model with one knot (lspline package in R v 3.6.3). The model’s two linear segments pivot around the hinge day, on which the mask policy began to take effect, 8 days following the introduction of the policy. We used two forms of data to assess change in mask usage: images of people wearing masks in public places obtained from a major media outlet and population-based survey data. Potential confounding factors (including daily COVID-19 tests, number of COVID-19 cases among population subsets affected differentially by the mask policy–e.g., healthcare workers) were examined for their impact on the results. Daily cases fitted an exponential growth in the first log-linear segment (k = +0.042, s.e. = 0.007), and fitted an exponential decay in the second (k = -0.023, s.e. = 0.017) log-linear segment. Over a range of reported serial intervals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these growth rates correspond to a 22–33% reduction in an effective reproduction ratio before and after mandatory mask use. Analysis of images of people in public spaces showed mask usage rose from approximately 43% to 97%. Analysis of survey data found that on the third day before policy introduction, 44% of participants reported “often” or “always” wearing a mask; on the fourth day after, 100% reported “always” doing so. No potentially confounding factors were associated with the observed change in growth rates. Conclusions The mandatory mask use policy substantially increased public use of masks and was associated with a significant decline in new COVID-19 cases after introduction of the policy. This study strongly supports the use of masks for controlling epidemics in the broader community."
https://openalex.org/W3185282586,"Introduction At the population level, Black and Hispanic adults in the United States have increased risk of dying from COVID-19, yet whether race and ethnicity impact on risk of mortality among those hospitalized for COVID-19 is unclear. Methods Retrospective cohort study using data on adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from the electronic health record from 52 health systems across the United States contributing data to Cerner Real World Data TM . In-hospital mortality was evaluated by race first in unadjusted analysis then sequentially adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics using logistic regression. Results Through August 2020, 19,584 patients with median age 52 years were hospitalized with COVID-19, including n = 4,215 (21.5%) Black and n = 5,761 (29.4%) Hispanic patients. Relative to white patients, crude mortality was slightly higher in Black adults [22.7% vs 20.8%, unadjusted OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.02–1.22)]. Mortality remained higher among Black adults after adjusting for demographic factors including age, sex, date, region, and insurance status (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.27), but not after including comorbidities and body mass index (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93–1.23). Compared with non-Hispanic patients, Hispanic patients had lower mortality both in unadjusted and adjusted models [mortality 12.7 vs 25.0%, unadjusted OR 0.44(95% CI 0.40–0.48), fully adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59–0.86)]. Discussion In this large, multicenter, EHR-based analysis, Black adults hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher observed mortality than white patients due to a higher burden of comorbidities in Black adults. In contrast, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower mortality, even in fully adjusted models."
https://openalex.org/W3185408130,"Muscle glycogen depletion has been proposed as one of the main causes of fatigue during exercise. However, few studies have addressed the contribution of liver glycogen to exercise performance. Using a low-intensity running protocol, here, we analyzed exercise capacity in mice overexpressing protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) specifically in the liver (PTGOE mice), which show a high concentration of glycogen in this organ. PTGOE mice showed improved exercise capacity, as determined by the distance covered and time ran in an extenuating endurance exercise, compared with control mice. Moreover, fasting decreased exercise capacity in control mice but not in PTGOE mice. After exercise, liver glycogen stores were totally depleted in control mice, but PTGOE mice maintained significant glycogen levels even in fasting conditions. In addition, PTGOE mice displayed an increased hepatic energy state after exercise compared with control mice. Exercise caused a reduction in the blood glucose concentration in control mice that was less pronounced in PTGOE mice. No changes were found in the levels of blood lactate, plasma free fatty acids, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Plasma glucagon was elevated after exercise in control mice, but not in PTGOE mice. Exercise-induced changes in skeletal muscle were similar in both genotypes. These results identify hepatic glycogen as a key regulator of endurance capacity in mice, an effect that may be exerted through the maintenance of blood glucose levels."
https://openalex.org/W3184267423,"Previous research demonstrates that low-income countries face higher risks than high-income countries from toxic pollution and climate change. However, the relationship between these two risks is little explored or tested, and efforts to address the risks are often independent and uncoordinated. We argue that the global risks from toxic pollution and climate change are highly correlated and should be jointly analyzed in order to inform and better target efforts to reduce or mitigate both risks. We provide such analysis for 176 countries and found a strong (rs = -0.798;95%CI -0.852, -0.727) and significant (p<0.0001) relationship between the distribution of climate risk and toxic pollution. We also found that inequities in pollution production, economic status, and institutional readiness are interconnected and exacerbate risk for countries already in the highest risk categories for both toxic and non-toxic (greenhouse gas) pollution. The findings have policy implications, including the use of the proposed Target assessment to decide where best to address toxic and non-toxic pollution simultaneously, based on the need to minimize human suffering and maximize return on effort."
https://openalex.org/W3184983857,"Transgender and gender diverse people have unique risks and needs in the context of sexual health, but little is known about sexual health care for this population. In 2018, a national, online survey of sexual health and well-being was conducted with trans and gender diverse people in Australia (n = 1,613). Data from this survey were analysed to describe uptake of sexual health care and experiences of interpersonal and structural cisgenderism and transphobia. Experiences of cisgenderism and transphobia in sexual health care were assessed using a new, four-item scale of 'gender insensitivity', which produced scores ranging from 0 (highly gender sensitive) to 4 (highly gender insensitive). Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine if experiences of gender insensitivity in sexual health care were associated with uptake and frequency of HIV/STI testing in the 12 months prior to participation. Trans and gender diverse participants primarily accessed sexual health care from general practice clinics (86.8%), followed by publicly funded sexual health clinics (45.6%), community-based services (22.3%), and general hospitals (14.9%). Experiences of gender insensitivity were common overall (73.2% of participants reported ≥2 negative experiences) but most common in hospitals (M = 2.9, SD = 1.3) and least common in community-based services (M = 1.3, SD = 1.4; p<0.001). When controlling for sociodemographic factors, social networks, general access to health care, and sexual practices, higher levels of gender insensitivity in previous sexual health care encounters were associated with a lower likelihood of recent HIV/STI testing (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]:091,0.96, p<0.001) and less-frequent HIV/STI testing (B = -0.07, 95%CI:-0.10,-0.03, p = 0.007). Given the high rates of HIV and other STIs among trans and gender diverse people in Australia and overseas, eliminating cisgenderism and transphobia in sexual health care may help improve access to diagnostic testing to reduce infection rates and support the overall sexual health and well-being of these populations."
https://openalex.org/W3183196413,"The northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis Krøyer) population in the Gulf of Maine collapsed during an extreme heatwave that occurred across the Northwest Atlantic Ocean in 2012. Northern shrimp is a boreal species, and reaches its southern limit in the Gulf of Maine. Here we investigate proximate causes for the population collapse using data from fishery-independent surveys, environmental monitoring, and the commercial fishery. We first examined spatial data to confirm that the decline in population estimates was not due to a major displacement of the population, and then tested hypotheses related to fishing mortality and shifts in predation pressure. Fishing mortality may have contributed but could not explain the magnitude of the decline or the disappearance of pre-exploitable size individuals. Stomach contents analysis and biomass trends revealed no new fish predators of shrimp. However, longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii Lesueur) was unique among all species in showing time-series biomass peaks during spring, summer and fall of 2012, and spatial overlap with northern shrimp was unusually high in 2012. Longfin squid is a voracious and opportunistic predator that consumes crustaceans as well as fish. We hypothesize that the warmer temperatures of 2012 not only led to expansion of longfin squid distribution in Gulf of Maine, but had differential effects on migration phenology that further increased spatial overlap with northern shrimp. The weight of our evidence suggests that longfin squid predation was likely a significant factor in the collapse of northern shrimp in the Gulf of Maine."
https://openalex.org/W3185272601,"Suicide rates are higher in rural Australia than in major cities, although the factors contributing to this are not well understood. This study highlights trends in suicide and examines the prevalence of mental health problems and service utilisation of non-Indigenous Australians by geographic remoteness in rural Australia.A retrospective study of National Coronial Information System data of intentional self-harm deaths in rural New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania for 2010-2015 from the National Coronial Information System.There were 3163 closed cases of intentional self-harm deaths by non-Indigenous Australians for the period 2010-2015. The suicide rate of 12.7 deaths per 100,000 persons was 11% higher than the national Australian rate and increased with remoteness. Among people who died by suicide, up to 56% had a diagnosed mental illness, and a further 24% had undiagnosed symptoms. Reported diagnoses of mental illness decreased with remoteness, as did treatment for mental illness, particularly in men. The most reported diagnoses were mood disorders (70%), psychotic disorders (9%) and anxiety disorders (8%). In the six weeks before suicide, 22% of cases had visited any type of health service at least once, and 6% had visited two or more services. Medication alone accounted for 76% of all cases treated.Higher suicide rates in rural areas, which increase with remoteness, may be attributable to decreasing diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, particularly in men. Less availability of mental health specialists coupled with socio-demographic factors within more remote areas may contribute to lower mental health diagnoses and treatment. Despite an emphasis on improving health-seeking and service accessibility in rural Australia, research is needed to determine factors related to the under-utilisation of services and treatment by specific groups vulnerable to death by suicide."
https://openalex.org/W3183814955,"The human gut microbiota is known for its highly heterogeneous composition across different individuals. However, relatively little is known about functional differences in its ability to ferment complex polysaccharides. Through ex vivo measurements from healthy human donors, we show that individuals vary markedly in their microbial metabolic phenotypes (MMPs), mirroring differences in their microbiota composition, and resulting in the production of different quantities and proportions of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) from the same inputs. We also show that aspects of these MMPs can be predicted from composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. From experiments performed using the same dietary fibers in vivo, we demonstrate that an ingested bolus of fiber is almost entirely consumed by the microbiota upon passage. We leverage our ex vivo data to construct a model of SCFA production and absorption in vivo, and argue that inter-individual differences in quantities of absorbed SCFA are directly related to differences in production. Though in vivo studies are required to confirm these data in the context of the gut, in addition to in vivo read outs of SCFAs produced in response to specific fiber spike-ins, these data suggest that optimizing SCFA production in a given individual through targeted fiber supplementation requires quantitative understanding of their MMP."
https://openalex.org/W3185158208,"Drip irrigation under plastic mulch is widely used in Xinjiang, Northwest China. It can not only save water, but also reduce nutrient loss and improve fertilizer utilization. However, it is not clear whether the leaching occurs or not, what is the leaching amount? What is the relationship among fertilization, irrigation regimes, loss, cotton absorption, and cotton field under different fertilization and irrigation management under drip irrigation? Studying these issues not only provides reference for the formulation of fertilization and irrigation systems, but also is of great significance for reducing non-point source pollution. A long-term positioning experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2012 in Baotou Lake farm in Korla City, Xinjiang, with drip-irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under different N fertilizer and irrigation amounts. The treatments were designed comprising Control (CK,0 N, 0 P, and 0 K with an irrigation of 480 mm) and the following three other treatments: (1) Conventional fertilize and irrigation (CON, 357 kg N hm-2, 90 kg P hm-2, 0 kg K hm-2, and irrigation of 480 mm); (2) Conventional fertilization and Optimizing irrigation (OPT, 357 kg N hm-2, 90 kg P hm-2, 62 kg K hm-2, and irrigation of 420 mm); and (3) Optimizing fertilization and irrigation (OPTN, 240 kg N hm-2, 65 kg P hm-2, 62 kg K hm-2, and irrigation of 420 mm). The results found that the leaching would occur in arid area under drip irrigation. The loss of total N, NH4+, P, N and P loss coefficient was higher under conventional fertilize and irrigation treatment while the loss of NO3- was higher under conventional fertilization and optimizing irrigation treatment. The correlations among N, P absorption by cotton, loss of NH4+ and total phosphorus were quadratic function. The total nitrogen loss and cumulative nitrogen application was lineally correlated. The loss of NO3- and cumulative nitrogen application was exponential. The nitrogen and phosphorus absorption by cotton under conventional fertilization and optimizing irrigation treatment was 24.53% and 35.86% higher than that in conventional fertilize and irrigation treatment, respectively. The cotton yield under conventional fertilization and optimizing irrigation treatment obtained higher than that in other three treatments. Therefore, the conventional fertilization and optimizing irrigation treatment was the optimal management of water and fertilizer in our study. These results demonstrate that reasonable water, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilize could not only effectively promote the absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus, but also reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses under drip fertigation and plastic mulching."
https://openalex.org/W3186477006,"This study aimed to develop a high-performance deep learning algorithm to differentiate Stafne's bone cavity (SBC) from cysts and tumors of the jaw based on images acquired from various panoramic radiographic systems. Data sets included 176 Stafne's bone cavities and 282 odontogenic cysts and tumors of the mandible (98 dentigerous cysts, 91 odontogenic keratocysts, and 93 ameloblastomas) that required surgical removal. Panoramic radiographs were obtained using three different imaging systems. The trained model showed 99.25% accuracy, 98.08% sensitivity, and 100% specificity for SBC classification and resulted in one misclassified SBC case. The algorithm was approved to recognize the typical imaging features of SBC in panoramic radiography regardless of the imaging system when traced back with Grad-Cam and Guided Grad-Cam methods. The deep learning model for SBC differentiating from odontogenic cysts and tumors showed high performance with images obtained from multiple panoramic systems. The present algorithm is expected to be a useful tool for clinicians, as it diagnoses SBCs in panoramic radiography to prevent unnecessary examinations for patients. Additionally, it would provide support for clinicians to determine further examinations or referrals to surgeons for cases where even experts are unsure of diagnosis using panoramic radiography alone."

https://openalex.org/W3183288744,"Under the background of relatively slow agricultural labor transfer and land circulation, agricultural production outsourcing has become the main means of agricultural modernization. In order to provide a beneficial perspective for appropriately expanding the scale of rice control outsourcing services, we investigated the situation of rice control outsourcing in ten counties of Fujian Province, and analyzed the factors influencing rice farmers’ decision-making and control degree by using Heckman model. First of all, the main factors affecting farmers’ participation in outsourcing are agricultural labor force, whether family members are cooperative members, planting area, proportion of grain income, degree of organization of outsourcing team, region and so on. Secondly, agricultural labor force, cooperative members, planting area, part-time behavior, mechanical efficiency of prevention and control organization, and region are the main factors affecting the scale of control outsourcing. Thirdly, from a regional perspective, the rice farmers in northern and Western Fujian are more dependent on outsourcing services consumption compared with the rice farmers in Southern Fujian. These results have a clear impact on policymakers, indicating that policy and measures should encourage the prevention and control of the nature of cooperation, and improve the advanced nature of outsourcing facilities of plant protection equipment, thereby effectively improving the professional level of rice pest and disease control."

https://openalex.org/W3187005271,"Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) occurs when highly fermentable carbohydrates are introduced into the diet, decreasing pH and disturbing the microbial ecology of the rumen. Rumen amylolytic bacteria rapidly catabolize starch, fermentation acids accumulate in the rumen and reduce environmental pH. Historically, antibiotics (e.g., monensin, MON) have been used in the prevention and treatment of SARA. Biochanin A (BCA), an isoflavone produced by red clover (Trifolium pratense), mitigates changes associated with starch fermentation ex vivo. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of BCA on amylolytic bacteria and rumen pH during a SARA challenge. Twelve rumen fistulated steers were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: HF CON (high fiber control), SARA CON, MON (200 mg d-1), or BCA (6 g d-1). The basal diet consisted of corn silage and dried distiller's grains ad libitum. The study consisted of a 2-wk adaptation, a 1-wk HF period, and an 8-d SARA challenge (d 1-4: 40% corn; d 5-8: 70% cracked corn). Samples for pH and enumeration were taken on the last day of each period (4 h). Amylolytic, cellulolytic, and amino acid/peptide-fermenting bacteria (APB) were enumerated. Enumeration data were normalized by log transformation and data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The SARA challenge increased total amylolytics and APB, but decreased pH, cellulolytics, and in situ DMD of hay (P < 0.05). BCA treatment counteracted the pH, microbiological, and fermentative changes associated with SARA challenge (P < 0.05). Similar results were also observed with MON (P < 0.05). These results indicate that BCA may be an effective alternative to antibiotics for mitigating SARA in cattle production systems."
https://openalex.org/W3183248685,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to the development of a reference standard for the quality control of complex natural products, which will assist in the assessment of their authenticity and purity. The proposed method provides a template for the selection of samples, which can be pooled to obtain a reference standard. A shortfall of such an approach is, however, that the pooled sample is static in nature and therefore unable to capture difference in processing conditions or natural variations triggered by geographical or climatic impacts over time. To address this, the paper also outlines the development of a dynamic reference standard, which allows for ongoing adjustments to future variations. The method employs High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) derived extract profiles processed by multivariate analysis. The development of the dynamic reference standard is illustrated using honey, a complex natural matrix, as an example."
https://openalex.org/W3184400502,"Like most enveloped viruses, HIV must acquire a lipid membrane as it assembles and buds through the plasma membrane of infected cells to spread infection. Several sets of host cell machinery facilitate this process, including proteins of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport pathway, which mediates the membrane fission reaction required to complete viral budding, as well as angiomotin (AMOT) and NEDD4L, which bind one another and promote virion membrane envelopment. AMOT and NEDD4L interact through the four NEDD4L WW domains and three different AMOT Pro-Pro-x (any amino acid)-Tyr (PPxY) motifs, but these interactions are not yet well defined. Here, we report that individual AMOT PPxY and NEDD4L WW domains interact with the following general affinity hierarchies: AMOT PPxY1>PPxY2>PPxY3 and NEDD4L WW3>WW2>WW1∼WW4. The unusually high-affinity of the AMOT PPxY1-NEDD4L WW3 interaction accounts for most of the AMOT-NEDD4L binding and is critical for stimulating HIV-1 release. Comparative structural, binding, and virological analyses reveal that complementary ionic and hydrophobic contacts on both sides of the WW-PPxY core interaction account for the unusually high affinity of the AMOT PPxY1-NEDD4L WW3 interaction. Taken together, our studies reveal how the first AMOT PPxY1 motif binds the third NEDD4L WW domain to stimulate HIV-1 viral envelopment and promote infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3184962293,"New York City and Long Island, NY were early foci of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. The effects of COVID-19 on different sub-populations, and its key epidemiologic parameters remain unknown or highly uncertain. We investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 from January to August of 2020 in an established academic monitoring cohort of N = 9,697 middle-aged World Trade Center responders residing in Long Island, NY.A seroprevalence survey and a series of cross-sectional surveys were nested in a prospective cohort study. Measures included IgG antibody testing, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, review of electronic medical records, and surveys of symptoms. Correlates of infection were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression.The cohort was predominantly men in their mid-fifties; 6,597 cohort members were successfully contacted (68%); 1,042 (11%) individuals participated in the seroprevalence survey; and 369 individuals (5.6% of 6,597 study participants) underwent PCR testing. The estimated standardized cumulative incidence was 21.9% (95%CI: 20.1-23.9%), the asymptomatic proportion was 16.4% (36/219; 95%CI: 11.8-22.0%), the case hospitalization ratio was 9.4% (36/385; 95%CI: 6.6-12.7%), the case fatality ratio was 1.8% (7/385; 95%CI: 0.7-3.7%), and the hospitalization fatality ratio was 8.3% (3/36; 95%CI: 1.8-22.5%). Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with younger age, race/ethnicity, and being currently employed.The results of the present study suggest a high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among WTC responders in the spring and summer of 2020 and contribute to narrowing the plausible range of the proportion of infections that exhibit no symptoms. An increased risk of infection among younger employed individuals is likely to reflect a higher probability of exposure to the virus, and the racial disparities in the infection risk warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3183467146,"Whole genome sequencing of viral specimens following molecular diagnosis is a powerful analytical tool of molecular epidemiology that can critically assist in resolving chains of transmission, identifying of new variants or assessing pathogen evolution and allows a real-time view into the dynamics of a pandemic. In Cyprus, the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9, 2020 and since then 33,567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant (VOC-202012/01) was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall, we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures."
https://openalex.org/W3185677287,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) plays an important role in xenobiotic metabolism. While ligand binding induces PXR-dependent gene transcription, PXR shows constitutive transcriptional activity in the absence of ligands when expressed in cultured cells. This constitutive activity sometimes hampers investigation of PXR activation by compounds of interest. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of PXR activation. In the reported crystal structures of unliganded PXR, helix 12 (H12), including a coactivator binding motif, was stabilized, while it is destabilized in the unliganded structures of other nuclear receptors, suggesting a role for H12 stabilization in the basal activity of PXR. Since Phe420, located in the loop between H11 and H12, is thought to interact with Leu411 and Ile414 to stabilize H12, we substituted alanine at Phe420 (PXR-F420A) and separately inserted three alanine residues directly after Phe420 (PXR-3A) and investigated their influence on PXR-mediated transcription. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that the mutants showed drastically reduced basal activity and enhanced responses to various ligands, which was further enhanced by coexpression of the coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α. Mutations of both Leu411 and Ile414 to alanine also suppressed basal activity. Mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that PXR-F420A and PXR-3A bound to corepressors and coactivators in the absence and presence of ligands, respectively. We conclude that the intramolecular interactions of Phe420 with Leu411 and Ile414 stabilize H12 to recruit coactivators even in the absence of ligands, contributing to the basal transcriptional activity of PXR. We propose that the generated mutants might be useful for PXR ligand screening."
https://openalex.org/W3185747952,"Neuronal activity regulates spatial distribution of the SUMOylation system in cytosolic and dendritic sites, which has been implicated in learning, memory, and underlying synaptic structural and functional remodeling in the hippocampus. However, the functional target proteins for activated small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and downstream molecular consequences behind long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic plasticity remain to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated neuronal activity induced the covalent modification of cytosolic Akt1 by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) in rat cortical and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) was involved in the activity-induced Akt1 SUMO1-ylation, and K64 and K276 residues were major SUMOylated sites. Importantly, Akt1 SUMOylation at K64 and K276 enhanced its enzymatic activity and facilitated T308 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the N-terminal SAP domain of PIAS3 bound Akt1 directly. The disruption of Akt1-PIAS3 interaction by Tat-SAP, a synthetic Tat-fused cell-permeable peptide containing PIAS3 SAP domain, inhibited neuronal activity-induced Akt1 SUMOylation and impaired LTP expression and late phase LTP maintenance in the hippocampus. Correlatedly, Tat-SAP not only blocked the LTP-related extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-Elk-1-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/Arc signaling, but also disrupted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) pathway. These findings reveal an activity-induced Akt1 SUMOylation by PIAS3 that contributes to ERK1/2-BDNF/Arc and mTOR-4E-BP1 cascades, and in turn, long-lasting excitatory synaptic responses."
https://openalex.org/W3186351393,"Achieving maternal and newborn related Sustainable Development Goals targets is challenging for Nepal, mainly due to poor quality of maternity services. In this context, we aim to assess the Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) service availability and readiness in health facilities in Nepal by analyzing data from Nepal Health Facility Survey (NHFS), 2015.We utilized cross-sectional data from the nationally representative NHFS, 2015. Service availability was measured by seven signal functions of BEmONC, and service readiness by the availability and functioning of supportive items categorized into three domains: staff and guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and basic medicine and commodities. We used the World Health Organization's service availability and readiness indicators to estimate the readiness scores. We performed a multiple linear regression to identify important factors in the readiness of the health facilities to provide BEmONC services.The BEmONC service readiness score was significantly higher in public hospitals compared with private hospitals and peripheral public health facilities. Significant factors associated with service readiness score were the facility type (14.69 points higher in public hospitals, P<0.001), number of service delivery staff (2.49 points increase per each additional delivery staff, P<0.001), the service hours (4.89 points higher in facilities offering 24-hour services, P = 0.01) and status of periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths (4.88 points higher in facilities that conducted periodic review, P = 0.043).These findings suggest that BEmONC services in Nepal could be improved by increasing the number of service delivery staff, expanding service hours to 24-hours a day, and conducting periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths at health facilities, mainly in the peripheral public health facilities. The private hospitals need to be encouraged for BEmONC service readiness."
https://openalex.org/W3185034348,"Many eukaryotic cell-surface proteins are post-translationally modified by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety that anchors them to the cell membrane. The biosynthesis of GPI anchors is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol. This reaction is catalyzed by GPI GlcNAc transferase, a multisubunit complex comprising the catalytic subunit Gpi3/PIG-A as well as at least five other subunits, including the hydrophobic protein Gpi2, which is essential for the activity of the complex in yeast and mammals, but the function of which is not known. To investigate the role of Gpi2, we exploited Trypanosoma brucei (Tb), an early diverging eukaryote and important model organism that initially provided the first insights into GPI structure and biosynthesis. We generated insect-stage (procyclic) trypanosomes that lack TbGPI2 and found that in TbGPI2-null parasites, (i) GPI GlcNAc transferase activity is reduced, but not lost, in contrast with yeast and human cells, (ii) the GPI GlcNAc transferase complex persists, but its architecture is affected, with loss of at least the TbGPI1 subunit, and (iii) the GPI anchors of procyclins, the major surface proteins, are underglycosylated when compared with their WT counterparts, indicating the importance of TbGPI2 for reactions that occur in the Golgi apparatus. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized TbGPI2 not only to the endoplasmic reticulum but also to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that in addition to its expected function as a subunit of the GPI GlcNAc transferase complex, TbGPI2 may have an enigmatic noncanonical role in Golgi-localized GPI anchor modification in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3185498150,"To investigate if lumbar and lower limb kinematics or kinetics are different between groups with and without a history of LBP during lifting. Secondly, to investigate relationships between biomechanical variables and pain ramp during repeated lifting.21 LBP and 20 noLBP participants completed a 100-lift task, where lumbar and lower limb kinematics and kinetics were measured during lifting, with a simultaneous report of LBP intensity every 10 lifts. Lifts were performed in a laboratory setting, limiting ecological validity.The LBP group used a different lifting technique to the noLBP group at the beginning of the task (slower and more squat-like). Kinetic differences at the beginning included less peak lumbar external anterior shear force and greater peak knee power demonstrated by the LBP group. However, at the end of the task, both groups lifted with a much more similar technique that could be classified as more stoop-like and faster. Peak knee power remained greater in the LBP group throughout and was the only kinetic difference between groups at the end of the lifting task. While both groups lifted using a more comparable technique at the end, the LBP group still demonstrated a tendency to perform a slower and more squat-like lift throughout the task. Only one of 21 variables (pelvic tilt at box lift-off), was associated with pain ramp in the LBP group. Conclusions: Workers with a history of LBP, lift with a style that is slower and more squat-like than workers without any history of LBP. Common assumptions that LBP is associated with lumbar kinematics or kinetics such as greater lumbar flexion or greater forces were not observed in this study, raising questions about the current paradigm around 'safe lifting'."
https://openalex.org/W3185593974,"Population decline and extinction risk of river dolphins are primarily associated with flow alteration. Previous studies predominantly highlighted maintenance of adequate flow for low water seasons when habitats contract and the risk of local extinction escalates. Although river dolphins are sensitive to reduction in river flow, no studies quantify the relationships between flow and ecology of river dolphins to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of flow alteration. We quantify the relationships between flow and the ecology of river cetaceans concerning Ganges River dolphins (GRD; Platanista gangetica gangetica) usable area availability (AWS) for the low water season at wider flows (50-575 m3/s) at finer spatial and temporal scales. This study reveals that distribution of area usable to GRD is highly regulated by the adequate flow and river attributes (velocity and depth) interactions that likely offer energetically efficient modes of locomotion to GRD, suggesting the hydro-physical environment as a major determinant of river dolphin distribution and abundance. Flow and AWS relationships indicate that the flow during the dry season negatively contributed to AWS, whereas that of pre-monsoon maximized the AWS, suggesting that modifying flow regimes does alter in-stream habitats at varying spatial scales and may influence life-history strategies. Substantial fragmentation in suitable pool availability and loss of longitudinal connectivity exhibited by dry season flow suggested a higher risk of adverse biological effects during the dry season, which may reduce population viability by reducing survivorship and reproduction failure. Owing to river dolphins' dependence on the attribute of freshwater flow, they can be expected to be more affected by flow regulations as interactive effects. Considering the seasonal effects and changes in the availability of usable areas by flow alteration, adopting effective habitat retention plans by water-based development projects appears critical to avoid further ecological risks in aquatic species conservation. Identifying priority riverscapes for river cetaceans and prioritizing investment opportunities is an essential first step towards effective riverine cetacean conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3183274273,"Abdominal obesity (AO) has become a public health issue due to its impact on health, society and the economy. The relationship between socioeconomic disparities and the prevalence of AO has yet to be studied in Peru. Thus, our aim was to analyze the socioeconomic inequalities in AO distribution defined using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cut-off points in Peruvian adults in 2018-2019.This was a cross-sectional study using data from the 2018-2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) of Peru. We analyzed a representative sample of 62,138 adults over 18 years of age of both sexes from urban and rural areas. Subjects were grouped into quintiles of the wealth to calculate a concentration curve and the Erreygers Concentration Index (ECI) in order to measure the inequality of AO distribution. Finally, we performed a decomposition analysis to evaluate the major determinants of inequalities.The prevalence of AO among Peruvian adults was 73.8%, being higher among women than men (85.1% and 61.1% respectively, p < 0.001). Socioeconomic inequality in AO was more prominent among men (ECI = 0.342, standard error (SE) = 0.0065 vs. ECI = 0.082, SE = 0.0043). The factors that contributed most to inequality in the prevalence of AO for both sexes were having the highest wealth index (men 37.2%, women 45.6%, p < 0.001), a higher education (men 34.4%, women 41.4%, p < 0.001) and living in an urban setting (men 22.0%, women 57.5%, p < 0.001).In Peru the wealthy concentrate a greater percentage of AO. The inequality gap is greater among men, although AO is more prevalent among women. The variables that most contributed to inequality were the wealth index, educational level and area of residence. There is a need for effective individual and community interventions to reduce these inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W3183959328,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have augmented risk of developing venous thromboembolism, but the mechanisms triggering this burden on the coagulation system remain to be understood. Recently, cell-derived microparticles carrying procoagulant phospholipids (PPL) and tissue factor (TF) in their membrane have attracted attention as possible contributors to the thrombogenic processes in cancers. The aims of this study were to assess the coagulation activity of platelet-poor plasma from 38 SCLC patients and to provide a detailed procoagulant profiling of small and large extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from these patients at the time of diagnosis, during and after treatment compared to 20 healthy controls. Hypercoagulability testing was performed by thrombin generation (TG), procoagulant phospholipid (PPL), TF activity, Protein C, FVIII activity and cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA), a surrogate measure for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Our results revealed a coagulation activity that is significantly increased in the plasma of SCLC patients when compared to age-related healthy controls, but no substantial changes in coagulation activity during treatment and at follow-up. Although EVs in the patients revealed an increased PPL and TF activity compared with the controls, the TG profiles of EVs added to a standard plasma were similar for patients and controls. Finally, we found no differences in the coagulation profile of patients who developed VTE to those who did not, i.e. the tests could not predict VTE. In conclusion, we found that SCLC patients display an overall increased coagulation activity at time of diagnosis and during the disease, which may contribute to their higher risk of VTE."
https://openalex.org/W3186014722,"Microbial colonization of plant roots is a highly complex process that requires the coordination and regulation of many gene networks, yet the identities and functions of many of these gene products have yet to be discovered. Pantoea sp. YR343, a gamma-proteobacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Populus deltoides, forms robust biofilms along the root surfaces of Populus and possesses plant growth-promoting characteristics. In this work, we identified three diguanylate cyclases in the plant-associated microbe Pantoea sp. YR343 that are expressed in the presence of plant roots. One of these diguanylate cyclases, DGC2884, localizes to discrete sites in the cells and its overexpression results in reduced motility and increased EPS production and biofilm formation. We performed a genetic screen by expressing this diguanylate cyclase from an inducible promoter in order to identify candidate gene products that may be involved in root colonization by Pantoea sp. YR343. Further, we demonstrate the importance of other domains in DGC2884 to its activity, which in combination with the genes identified by transposon mutagenesis, may yield insights into the mechanisms of plant association as well as the activity and regulation of homologous enzymes in medically and agriculturally relevant microbes."
https://openalex.org/W3184285638,"Erythroferrone (ERFE), the erythroid regulator of iron metabolism, inhibits hepcidin to increase iron availability for erythropoiesis. ERFE plays a pathological role during ineffective erythropoiesis as occurs in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and β-thalassemia. Its measurement might serve as an indicator of severity for these diseases. However, for reliable quantification of ERFE analytical characterization is indispensable to determine the assay's limitations and define proper methodology. We developed a sandwich ELISA for human serum ERFE using polyclonal antibodies and report its extensive analytical validation. This new assay showed, for the first time, the differentiation of XLSA and β-thalassemia major patients from healthy controls (p = 0.03) and from each other (p<0.01), showing the assay provides biological plausible results. Despite poor dilution linearity, parallelism and recovery in patient serum matrix, which indicated presence of a matrix effect and/or different immunoreactivity of the antibodies to the recombinant standard and the endogenous analyte, our assay correlated well with two other existing ERFE ELISAs (both R2 = 0.83). Nevertheless, employment of one optimal dilution of all serum samples is warranted to obtain reliable results. When adequately performed, the assay can be used to further unravel the human erythropoiesis-hepcidin-iron axis in various disorders and assess the added diagnostic value of ERFE."
https://openalex.org/W3185018134,"A road-map of the genetic and phenotypic diversities in both crops and their wild related species can help identifying valuable genetic resources for further crop breeding. The clary sage (Salvia sclarea L.), a perfume, medicinal and aromatic plant, is used for sclareol production and ornamental purposes. Despite its wide use in the field of cosmetics, the phenotypic and genetic diversity of wild and cultivated clary sages remains to be explored. We characterized the genetic and phenotypic variation of a collection of six wild S. sclarea populations from Croatia, sampled along an altitudinal gradient, and, of populations of three S. sclarea cultivars. We showed low level of genetic diversity for the two S. sclarea traditional cultivars used for essential oil production and for ornamental purposes, respectively. In contrast, a recent cultivar resulting from new breeding methods, which involve hybridizations among several genotypes rather than traditional recurrent selection and self-crosses over time, showed high genetic diversity. We also observed a marked phenotypic differentiation for the ornamental clary sage compared with other cultivated and wild clary sages. Instead, the two cultivars used for essential oil production, a traditional and a recent one, respectively, were not phenotypically differentiated from the wild Croatian populations. Our results also featured some wild populations with high sclareol content and early-flowering phenotypes as good candidates for future breeding programs. This study opens up perspectives for basic research aiming at understanding the impact of breeding methods on clary sage evolution, and highlights interesting avenues for clary breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3185447909,"Nepal was under a severe lockdown for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were concerns regarding misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal during the first wave of the pandemic.We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Altogether, 25 questions (both open and closed-ended) were used. An overall performance score was calculated from the average of the 12 ""Knowledge"" questions for all the participants.Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% of the participants were aware how the disease was transmitted, with 54% aware that anyone can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Almost 98% of participants recognized the World Health Organization's (WHO) awareness message, but surprisingly, 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus, in contradiction to WHO information. Importantly, 95% of the participants were aware of personal protective equipment (PPE) and what the acronym stands for. Social distancing was felt to be key to limiting the disease spread; whilst 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. The mean overall ""Knowledge"" performance score was 69.65% (SD ± 22.81).There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion. It is recommended to follow WHO and national guidelines, whilst seeking published scientific evidence behind any unofficial statements, to accurately inform one's clinical practice."

The rational matching of urban land prices and land use intensity has become an important factor under accelerating urbanization, and promotes the healthy development of the social economy. Using data on residential land price and on land use intensity for 31 provinces and cities in China, we employ the E-G cointegration test and quadrant map classification to determine the coordination relationship between land price and land use intensity. We then employ HR coordination to calculate the coordination degree of land price and land use intensity, and classify the coordination type accordingly. Our results are as follows. (1) The spatio-temporal distribution of urban land price shows high variability with multiple maxima, and follows a decreasing trend from the southeast coastal area to the northwest inland area and the northeast. (2) The overall land use intensity is at or above the middle level, and shows large spatial differences between provinces, but the agglomeration between provinces is increasing. (3) From the perspective of the relationship between urban land price and land use intensity at the inter-provincial scale, we find that the land price and land use intensity are well coordinated, and the number of provinces has been dynamically changing during different development periods. There is an east-west difference in the spatial distribution of land price and land use intensity coordination level. Different provinces and cities with the same coordination stage show differences in their land price and land use intensity level."
https://openalex.org/W3186023492,"Steroid hormones regulate various aspects of physiology, from reproductive functions to metabolic homeostasis. Steroidogenic factor-1 (NR5A1) plays a central role in the development of steroidogenic tissues and their ability to produce steroid hormones. Inactivation of Nr5a1 in the mouse results in a complete gonadal and adrenal agenesis, absence of gonadotropes in the pituitary and impaired development of ventromedial hypothalamus, which controls glucose and energy metabolism. In this study, we set out to examine the consequences of NR5A1 overexpression (NR5A1+) in the NR5A1-positive cell populations in female mice. Ovaries of NR5A1+ females presented defects such as multi-oocyte follicles and an accumulation of corpora lutea. These females were hyperandrogenic, had irregular estrous cycles with persistent metestrus and became prematurely infertile. Furthermore, the decline in fertility coincided with weight gain, increased adiposity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance, indicating defects in metabolic functions. In summary, excess NR5A1 expression causes hyperandrogenism, disruption of ovarian functions, premature infertility, and disorders of metabolic homeostasis. This NR5A1 overexpression mouse provides a novel model for studying not only the molecular actions of NR5A1, but also the crosstalk between endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic systems."

The offset index was calculated as the distance of the CRVT from the BMO center relative to that of the BMO margin. The angular deviation of CRVT was measured with the horizontal nasal midline as 0° and the superior location as a positive value. The offset index and angular deviation were compared between glaucoma and fellow control eyes within individuals.NTG eyes had higher baseline intraocular pressure (P = 0.001), a larger β-zone parapapillary atrophy area (P = 0.013), and a larger offset index (P<0.001). In a generalized linear mixed-effects model, larger offset index was the only risk factor of NTG diagnosis (OR = 31.625, P<0.001). A generalized estimating equation regression model revealed that the offset index was larger in the NTG eyes than in the control eyes for all ranges of axial length, while it was the smallest for the axial length of 23.4 mm (all P<0.001).The offset index was larger in the unilateral NTG eyes, which fact is suggestive of the potential role of LC/BMO offset as a loco-regional susceptibility factor."

Association between PK parameters (AUC0-24: area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours, Cmax: maximum concentration and Ctrough: trough concentration) and cognitive scores (standardized into z-scores) were evaluated using rank regression adjusting for potential confounders.Median (IQR) global cognitive z-scores in the 83 PWH on 3TC/ABC and 471 PWH on FTC/TDF were 0.14 (-0.27, 0.38) and 0.09 (-0.28, 0.42), respectively. Higher 3TC AUC0-24 and Ctrough were associated with better global z-scores [rho = 0.29 (p = 0.02) and 0.27 (p = 0.04), respectively], whereas higher 3TC Cmax was associated with poorer z-scores [rho = -0.31 (p<0.01)], independently of ABC concentrations. Associations of ABC PK parameters with global and domain z-scores were non-significant after adjustment for confounders and 3TC concentrations (all p's>0.05). None of the FTC and TFV PK parameters were associated with global or domain cognitive scores.Whilst we found no evidence of either detrimental or beneficial effects of ABC, FTC and TFV plasma exposure on cognitive function of PWH, higher plasma 3TC exposures were generally associated with better cognitive performance although higher peak concentrations were associated with poorer performance."

This study aims to evaluate whether a massive public focus on sleep and smartphone use generated through a large-scale citizen science project, the SmartSleep Experiment, influence participants' night-time smartphone behavior. A total of 8,894 Danish adults aged 16 and above participated in the SmartSleep Experiment, a web-based survey on smartphones and sleep behavior. The survey was carried out for one week in 2018, combined with an extensive national mass media campaign focusing on smartphone behaviors and sleep. A follow-up survey aimed at evaluating whether survey-participants had changed their night-time smartphone behavior was carried out two weeks after the campaign. A total of 15% of the participants who used their smartphone during sleep hours at baseline had changed their night-time smartphone behavior, and 83% of those indicated that they used their smartphone less at follow-up. The participants who had changed their smartphone behavior had primarily taken active precautions to avoid night-time smartphone use, e.g., activating silent mode (36%) or reduced their smartphone use before (50%) and during sleep hours (52%). The reduction in sleep problems (54%), recognition of poor smartphone behavior (48%), and the increased focus on night-time smartphone use (42%) were motivational factors for these behavior changes. Using citizen science and mass media appeared to be associated with changes in night-time smartphone behavior. Public health projects may benefit from combining citizen science with other interventional approaches."

We sought to explore the impact of lockdown on glycaemia and whether this is sustained following easing of restrictions. Methods Retrospective, observational analysis in adults and children with type 1 diabetes attending a UK specialist centre, using real-time or intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring. Data from the following 28-day time periods were collected: (i) pre-lockdown; (ii) during lockdown; (iii) immediately after lockdown; and (iv) a month following relaxation of restrictions (coinciding with Government-subsidised restaurant food). Data were analysed for times in glycaemic ranges and are expressed as median (IQR). Results 145 adults aged 35.5 (25.8–51.3) years with diabetes duration of 19.0 (7.0–29.0) years on multiple daily injections of insulin (60%) and continuous insulin infusion (40%) were included. In adults, % time in range (70-180mg/dL) increased during lockdown (60.2 (45.2–69.3)%) compared to pre-lockdown (56.7 (43.5–65.3)%; p&lt;0.001). This was maintained in the post-lockdown time periods. Similarly, % time above range (&gt;180mg/dL) reduced in lockdown compared to pre-lockdown (p = 0.01), which was sustained thereafter. In children, no significant changes to glycaemia were observed during lockdown. In multivariable analysis, a greater increase in %TIR 3.9-10mmol/L (70-180mg/dL) during lockdown was associated with higher levels of deprivation (coefficient: 4.208, 95% CI 0.588 to 7.828; p = 0.02). Conclusions Glycaemia in adults improved during lockdown, with people from more deprived areas most likely to benefit. This effect was sustained after easing of restrictions, with government-subsidised restaurant eating having no adverse impact on glycaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3185689104,"For many years, there has been a trend to breed cats with an increasing degree of brachycephalic head features, which are known to have a severe impact on the animals’ health and welfare. The direct relation between different grades of brachycephaly and their negative implications have not been researched in this species. The aim of this study was therefore to establish correlations between the different grades of brachycephaly and reduced upper respiratory airways, exophthalmos of the eye globes and malalignment of the teeth in Persian cats. Sixty-nine Persian cats of various skull dimensions and ten Domestic shorthair cats were recruited for the study. The cats’ skulls were examined using three-dimensional reconstructions created from Computed Tomography datasets. Brachycephaly was graded using established craniometric measurements (facial index, cranial index, skull index, craniofacial angle). The flow area of the nasal passageways at different locations, the amount of the eye globe not supported by the bony orbit and the axial deviation of the teeth were quantified and evaluated for a correlation with the grade of brachycephaly. The results of this study clearly show that increased grades of brachycephaly in Persian cats resulted in larger extra-orbital parts of the ocular bulbs. The brachycephalic skull dimension also resulted in a lower height of the naso-osseal aperture, while other areas of the nasal airways were not correlated with the severity of brachycephaly. Persian cats showed a significantly increased occurrence of premolar tooth displacement in the upper jaw with increasing brachycephaly grades. It was interesting to note that the measured values had a broad range and values of some individual Persian cats showed an overlap with those of Domestic shorthair cats."

Assessment of intestine perfusion is eminently depending on the skills, and the experience of the surgeon. Thus, the therapy is biased by the right evaluation. Aim of this study is to determine the applicability, and the usefulness of fluorescent-imaging (FI) with indocyanine green (ICG) in a porcine model of mesenteric ischemia. Second end-point is the verification of a visual and quantitative assessment tool of the intestinal perfusion.In 18 pigs (54,2 ±2,9kg) an occlusion of a side-branch of the mesenteric artery was performed for 3 (group I, n = 7), 6 (group II, n = 7), and 10 hours (group III, n = 4). After reperfusion a 60 minutes observation period was carried out. 3 regions of interest were defined: ischemic bowel (D1), transitional zone (D2), and non-ischemic bowel (D3). ICG-FI was performed during baseline (T0), occlusion (T1), reperfusion (T2) and after an observation period of 60 minutes (T4).All experiments could be finished successfully. ICG-FI was assessed using assessment of background-subtracted peak fluorescence intensity (BSFI), slope of fluorescence intensity (SFI), and a baseline adjusted ratio of both parameters. ICG-FI confirmed loss of perfusion in D1, decreased perfusion in D2, and increased perfusion in D3. After reperfusion ICG-FI increased in group 2 due to a severe tissue damage resulting in a capillary leakage. In group I ICG-FI was equal to baseline values indicating the totally reversible loss of perfusion.Using ICG-FI to estimate intestine perfusion after different durations of ischemia is viable using a porcine model of mesenteric ischemia. Even small differences in perfusion can be reliably determined by ICG-FI. Thus, ICG-FI is an encouraging method to evaluate intestine perfusion intraoperatively."
https://openalex.org/W3183269099,"Though there are several interventions evaluated over the past 25 years, significant knowledge gaps continue to exist regarding the effective prevention of sexual violence. This study explored the socio-economic and context-specific distinctive characteristics of husbands and wives on sexual autonomy and unwanted sexual experiences of currently married women in India.We have utilized the recent round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015-16) data for this exploration. The NFHS-4 survey had adopted a stratified two-stage sample design to reach out to the survey households. A total of 63,696 couples are included in the analysis comprising of women of 15-49 years age and men of 15-54 years age. Multivariate techniques have been applied to understand the adjusted effects of socio-economic and demographic variables on control over their sexuality and sexual violence.Uneducated women married to uneducated men experienced more sexual violence and had less control over their sexuality than the other categories. The adjusted multivariate logistic model shows that educated husbands were significantly more likely to exercise control over their educated wives' sexuality (AOR = 0.88; CI:0.78-0.99). Women having older husbands were significantly less likely to be having no-control over own sexuality (AOR = 0.89; CI:0.83-0.95) and experienced sexual violence (AOR = 0.81; CI:0.70-0.95). Women having comparatively more-educated husbands were significantly less likely to experience sexual violence (AOR = 0.62; CI:0.47-0.81). Muslim women were significantly more likely to have no control overown sexuality. SC/ST women were significantly more likely to experience sexual violence (28%).This study highlights the factors associated with control over one's sexuality and preponderance to sexual violence: age, education, spouse working status, wealth status, husband's alcohol consumption, women autonomy, decision-making, and freedom for mobility. This study suggests that empowering women with education, creating awareness regarding reproductive health, and addressing their socio-economic needs to help them achieve autonomy and derive decision-making power."
https://openalex.org/W3184409064,"The aim of this study is to describe the kinematic gait characteristics of straight line walk in clinically sound dairy cows using body mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) at multiple anatomical locations. The temporal parameters used are speed and non-speed normalized stance duration, bipedal and tripedal support durations, maximal protraction and retraction angles of the distal limbs and vertical displacement curves of the upper body. Gait analysis was performed by letting 17 dairy cows walk in a straight line at their own chosen pace while equipped with IMU sensors on tubera sacrale, left and right tuber coxae (LTC and RTC), back, withers, head, neck and all four lower limbs. Data intervals with stride by stride regularity were selected based on video data. For temporal parameters, the median was calculated and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated based on linear mixed model (LMM) analysis, while for limb and vertical displacement curves, the median and most typical curves were calculated. The temporal parameters and distal limb angles showed consistent results with low variance and LMM analysis showed non-overlapping CI for all temporal parameters. The distal limb angle curves showed a larger and steeper retraction angle range for the distal front limbs compared with the hind limbs. The vertical displacement curves of the sacrum, withers, LTC and RTC showed a consistent sinusoidal pattern while the head, back and collar curves were less consistent and showed more variation between and within cows. This kinematic description might allow to objectively differentiate between normal and lame gait in the future and determine the best anatomical location for sensor attachment for lameness detection purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3186035878,"Physical objects and their pictures are two main kinds of design stimuli of creative activity, which can improve design quality but may induce design fixation. Previous studies are focused on the case where participants face a single picture, and their design stimulus may be incomplete as compared with the participants facing objects. To fully explore the influence of physical and pictorial examples on design novices, we investigated design fixation and design quality when they were provided with multiperspective pictures having information remarkably similar to physical objects. Specifically, two novice groups individually created their own designs after observing several examples by the way of the above two presentation modes. These designs were evaluated by two evaluators in terms of similarity, originality, and completeness. Statistical analysis showed that no significant difference was found in similarity and originality between the two groups, whereas the designs of the physical group outperformed those of the pictorial group in terms of completeness. This finding indicated that the two groups showed the same degree of design fixation, as multiperspective pictures presented most of the form information of the physical object. The results suggest that when instructing design novices, it is essential to control how to present design examples at different stages of the design process."

We aimed to characterize these in males and females and after different cytokine treatments 60 days after irradiation.Male and female rhesus macaques (n = 142) received a whole-body exposure with 700 cGy, from which 60 animals survived. Peripheral whole blood was drawn pre-exposure and before sacrificing the surviving animals after 60 days.We evaluated gene expression in a three-phase study design. Phase I was a whole-genome screening (NGS) for mRNAs using five pre- and post-exposure RNA samples from both sexes (n = 20). Differential gene expression (DGE) was calculated between samples of survivors and pre-exposure samples (reference), separately for males and females. 1,243 up- and down-regulated genes were identified with 30-50% more deregulated genes in females. 37 candidate mRNAs were chosen for qRT-PCR validation in phase II using the remaining samples (n = 117). Altogether 17 genes showed (borderline) significant (t-test) DGE in groups of untreated or treated animals. Nine genes (CD248, EDAR, FAM19A5, GAL3ST4, GCNT4, HBG2/1, LRRN1, NOG, SYT14) remained with significant changes and were detected in at least 50% of samples per group. Panther analysis revealed an overlap between both sexes, related to the WNT signaling pathway, cell adhesion and immunological functions. For phase III, we validated the nine genes with candidate genes (n = 32) from an earlier conducted study on male baboons. Altogether 14 out of 41 genes showed a concordantly DGE across both species in a bilateral comparison.Sixty days after radiation exposure, we identified (1) sex and cytokine treatment independent transcriptional changes, (2) females with almost twice as much deregulated genes appeared more radio-responsive than males, (3) Panther analysis revealed an association with immunological processes and WNT pathway for both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W3186196415,"Gaudiebility refers to the set of modulators that regulate the enjoyment experienced, there is only one scale to assess gaudiebility, and it is univariate, which is not congruent with the construct. Therefore, this work's objective was to build a multifactorial scale and study the psychometric properties of the Gaudiebility Scale for Adults of Morelia (GSAM). 1,884 adults participated; 273 in the pilot study and 1,611 in the final study. They responded to the final version of the GSAM, with 24 items and a scale of experienced enjoyment. The adequate fit of the model of 6 related factors of the GSAM was corroborated through confirmatory factor analysis. Adequate Cronbach's alpha values ​​were observed for the factors (Concentration (α = .796), Enjoyment in Solitude (α = .784), Sense of Humor (α = .760), Imagination (α = .740), Interest (α = .653) and Irrational Beliefs (α = .633)) and the total scale (α = .803). All the factors and the full scale showed positive relationships with the scale of experienced enjoyment. The GSAM obtained good indicators regarding its internal consistency and validity; therefore, it is concluded that the GSAM is adequate to assess gaudiebility in adults."

In previous studies, various proportion of patients was found to carry CD11b+ or CD11c+ B cells whose presence was an unfavourable prognostic factor. The exact mechanism however, how these receptors contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL has not been revealed so far. Here we analysed the role of CD11b and CD11c on B cells of CLL patients in the adhesion to fibrinogen and in the migration towards stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and studied the role of CR4 in the adherence of the CD11c+ B cell line BJAB. We observed that both CR3 and CR4 mediate adhesion of the malignant B cells. Moreover, we found, that CR4 was strongly involved in the migration of the leukemic cells towards the chemoattractant SDF-1. Our data suggest that CR3 and CR4 are not only passive markers on CLL B cells, but they might contribute to the progression of the disease. Since the role of SDF-1 is prominent in the migration of CLL cells into the bone marrow where their survival is supported, our findings help to understand how the presence of CD11c on leukemic B cells can worsen the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia."

This phenomenon is very striking, yet we know little about why it occurs. It has been proposed that the wrinkles act to distribute water away from the contact surfaces of the fingertip, meaning that wet objects can be grasped more readily. This study examined the coordination between the grip force used to hold an object and the load force exerted on it, when participants used dry or wrinkly fingers, or fingers that were wet but not wrinkly. The results showed that wrinkly fingers reduce the grip force needed to grip a wet object, bringing that force in line with what is needed for handling a dry object. The results suggest that enhancing grip force efficiency in watery environments is a possible adaptive reason for the development of wrinkly fingers."
https://openalex.org/W3184374593,"Revelations that some members of Congress, including members of key health care committees, hold substantial personal investments in the health care industry have raised concerns about lawmakers' financial conflicts of interest (COI) and their potential impact on health care legislation and oversight.1) To assess historical trends in both the number of legislators holding health care-related assets and the value and composition of those assets. 2) To compare the financial holdings of members of health care-focused committees and subcommittees to those of other members of the House and Senate.We analyzed 11 years of personal financial disclosures by all members of the House and Senate. For each year, we calculated the percentage of members holding a health care-related asset (overall, by party, and by committee); the total value of all assets and health care-related assets held; the mean and median values of assets held per member; and the share of asset values attributable to 9 health asset categories.During the study period, over a third of all members of Congress held health care-related assets. These assets were often substantial, with a median total value per member of over $43,000. Members of health care-focused committees and subcommittees in the House and Senate did not hold health care-related assets at a higher rate than other members of their respective chambers.These findings suggest that lawmakers' health care-related COI warrant the same level of attention that has been paid to the COI of other actors in the health care system."
https://openalex.org/W3184487697,"This study aimed to evaluate whether long-term insulin treatment is associated with abnormalities in retinal circulation in type 2 diabetic patients. We evaluated 19 eyes of nondiabetic individuals and 68 eyes of type 2 diabetic patients. The eyes of diabetic patients were classified into two groups according to the presence or absence of long-term insulin therapy. We used a Doppler optical coherence tomography flowmeter to measure diameter, velocity, and blood flow in the major temporal retinal artery. The pulsatility ratio (PR) and resistance index (RI), indices of vascular rigidity, were calculated from the blood velocity profile. PR and RI were significantly elevated in type 2 diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic subjects (P < 0.05). In type 2 diabetes patients, PR and RI were significantly higher in patients receiving long-term insulin treatment than in those without (P < 0.01). There was a significant difference in velocity (P < 0.05), but not diameter and blood flow, between nondiabetic subjects and type 2 diabetes patients. No significant difference in diameter, velocity, or blood flow was observed between the groups with and without long-term insulin treatment. Long-term insulin treatment can affect PR and RI, which might be associated with vascular rigidity of the retinal artery in patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3185797228,"To evaluate the postures in ergonomics applications, studies have proposed the use of low-cost, marker-less, and portable depth camera-based motion tracking systems (DCMTSs) as a potential alternative to conventional marker-based motion tracking systems (MMTSs). However, a simple but systematic method for examining the estimation errors of various DCMTSs is lacking. This paper proposes a benchmarking method for assessing the estimation accuracy of depth cameras for full-body landmark location estimation. A novel alignment board was fabricated to align the coordinate systems of the DCMTSs and MMTSs. The data from an MMTS were used as a reference to quantify the error of using a DCMTS to identify target locations in a 3-D space. To demonstrate the proposed method, the full-body landmark location tracking errors were evaluated for a static upright posture using two different DCMTSs. For each landmark, we compared each DCMTS (Kinect system and RealSense system) with an MMTS by calculating the Euclidean distances between symmetrical landmarks. The evaluation trials were performed twice. The agreement between the tracking errors of the two evaluation trials was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively assess the tracking performance of DCMTSs. The average errors (standard deviation) for the Kinect system and RealSense system were 2.80 (1.03) cm and 5.14 (1.49) cm, respectively. The highest average error values were observed in the depth orientation for both DCMTSs. The proposed method achieved high reliability with ICCs of 0.97 and 0.92 for the Kinect system and RealSense system, respectively."
