https://openalex.org/W3208696217,"The Delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has outcompeted previously prevalent variants and become a dominant strain worldwide. We report the structure, function, and antigenicity of its full-length spike (S) trimer as well as those of the Gamma and Kappa variants, and compare their characteristics with the G614, Alpha, and Beta variants. Delta S can fuse membranes more efficiently at low levels of cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its pseudotyped viruses infect target cells substantially faster than the other five variants, possibly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Each variant shows different rearrangement of the antigenic surface of the amino-terminal domain of the S protein but only makes produces changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD), making the RBD a better target for therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3210722677,"Emerging reports of rare neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection and vaccinations are leading to regulatory, clinical and public health concerns. We undertook a self-controlled case series study to investigate hospital admissions from neurological complications in the 28 days after a first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (n = 20,417,752) or BNT162b2 (n = 12,134,782), and after a SARS-CoV-2-positive test (n = 2,005,280). There was an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-3.92 at 15-21 days after vaccination) and Bell's palsy (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08-1.56 at 15-21 days) with ChAdOx1nCoV-19. There was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12-1.71 at 15-21 days) with BNT162b2. An independent Scottish cohort provided further support for the association between ChAdOx1nCoV and Guillain-Barré syndrome (IRR, 2.32; 95% CI: 1.08-5.02 at 1-28 days). There was a substantially higher risk of all neurological outcomes in the 28 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test including Guillain-Barré syndrome (IRR, 5.25; 95% CI: 3.00-9.18). Overall, we estimated 38 excess cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome per 10 million people receiving ChAdOx1nCoV-19 and 145 excess cases per 10 million people after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In summary, although we find an increased risk of neurological complications in those who received COVID-19 vaccines, the risk of these complications is greater following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test."
https://openalex.org/W3210386674,"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes COVID-19. Given its acute and often self-limiting course, it is likely that components of the innate immune system play a central part in controlling virus replication and determining clinical outcome. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with notable activity against a broad range of viruses, including RNA viruses1,2. NK cell function may be altered during COVID-19 despite increased representation of NK cells with an activated and adaptive phenotype3,4. Here we show that a decline in viral load in COVID-19 correlates with NK cell status and that NK cells can control SARS-CoV-2 replication by recognizing infected target cells. In severe COVID-19, NK cells show defects in virus control, cytokine production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity despite high expression of cytotoxic effector molecules. Single-cell RNA sequencing of NK cells over the time course of the COVID-19 disease spectrum reveals a distinct gene expression signature. Transcriptional networks of interferon-driven NK cell activation are superimposed by a dominant transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) response signature, with reduced expression of genes related to cell-cell adhesion, granule exocytosis and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In severe COVID-19, serum levels of TGFβ peak during the first two weeks of infection, and serum obtained from these patients severely inhibits NK cell function in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Our data reveal that an untimely production of TGFβ is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and may inhibit NK cell function and early control of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3208765987,"Understanding how viral and host factors interact and how perturbations impact infection is the basis for designing antiviral interventions. Here we define the functional contribution of each viral and host factor involved in human cytomegalovirus infection in primary human fibroblasts through pooled CRISPR interference and nuclease screening. To determine how genetic perturbation of critical host and viral factors alters the timing, course and progression of infection, we applied Perturb-seq to record the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of CRISPR-modified single cells and found that, normally, most cells follow a stereotypical transcriptional trajectory. Perturbing critical host factors does not change the stereotypical transcriptional trajectory per se but can stall, delay or accelerate progression along the trajectory, allowing one to pinpoint the stage of infection at which host factors act. Conversely, perturbation of viral factors can create distinct, abortive trajectories. Our results reveal the roles of host and viral factors and provide a roadmap for the dissection of host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3209240997,"Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timeline of introductions and onsets of local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally1-7. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions were reported in January and February 2020 (refs.8,9), the narrowness of the initial testing criteria, combined with a slow growth in testing capacity and porous travel screening10, left many countries vulnerable to unmitigated, cryptic transmission. Here we use a global metapopulation epidemic model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the early dispersal of infections and the temporal windows of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and onset of local transmission in Europe and the USA. We find that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was likely to have been present in several areas of Europe and the USA by January 2020, and estimate that by early March, only 1 to 4 in 100 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by surveillance systems. The modelling results highlight international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2, with possible introductions and transmission events as early as December 2019 to January 2020. We find a heterogeneous geographic distribution of cumulative infection attack rates by 4 July 2020, ranging from 0.78% to 15.2% across US states and 0.19% to 13.2% in European countries. Our approach complements phylogenetic analyses and other surveillance approaches and provides insights that can be used to design innovative, model-driven surveillance systems that guide enhanced testing and response strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3210516368,"Dopamine plays a central role in motivating and modifying behavior, serving to invigorate current behavioral performance and guide future actions through learning. Here we examine how this single neuromodulator can contribute to such diverse forms of behavioral modulation. By recording from the dopaminergic reinforcement pathways of the Drosophila mushroom body during active odor navigation, we reveal how their ongoing motor-associated activity relates to goal-directed behavior. We found that dopaminergic neurons correlate with different behavioral variables depending on the specific navigational strategy of an animal, such that the activity of these neurons preferentially reflects the actions most relevant to odor pursuit. Furthermore, we show that these motor correlates are translated to ongoing dopamine release, and acutely perturbing dopaminergic signaling alters the strength of odor tracking. Context-dependent representations of movement and reinforcement cues are thus multiplexed within the mushroom body dopaminergic pathways, enabling them to coordinately influence both ongoing and future behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3208756624,"The voltage-dependent motor protein prestin (also known as SLC26A5) is responsible for the electromotive behaviour of outer-hair cells and underlies the cochlear amplifier1. Knockout or impairment of prestin causes severe hearing loss2-5. Despite the key role of prestin in hearing, the mechanism by which mammalian prestin senses voltage and transduces it into cellular-scale movements (electromotility) is poorly understood. Here we determined the structure of dolphin prestin in six distinct states using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our structural and functional data suggest that prestin adopts a unique and complex set of states, tunable by the identity of bound anions (Cl- or SO42-). Salicylate, a drug that can cause reversible hearing loss, competes for the anion-binding site of prestin, and inhibits its function by immobilizing prestin in a new conformation. Our data suggest that the bound anion together with its coordinating charged residues and helical dipole act as a dynamic voltage sensor. An analysis of all of the anion-dependent conformations reveals how structural rearrangements in the voltage sensor are coupled to conformational transitions at the protein-membrane interface, suggesting a previously undescribed mechanism of area expansion. Visualization of the electromotility cycle of prestin distinguishes the protein from the closely related SLC26 anion transporters, highlighting the basis for evolutionary specialization of the mammalian cochlear amplifier at a high resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3209943140,"Remdesivir is one of the most widely recommended and used medications for COVID-19 treatment. However, different outcomes have been reported for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. Specifically, the effect of the timing of remdesivir initiation (from patient's symptom onset) on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients has not been investigated.This is a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and treated with or without remdisivir. The primary outcome was patient's recovery rate, defined as clinical improvement and patient's discharge by day 14 of symptom onset. The secondary outcome was the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality within 28 days of patient's symptom onset.Out of 323 hospitalized adults with COVID-19, 107 (33.1%) received no remdesivir during their hospital stay, 107 (33.1%) received remdesivir early within 7 days of the symptom onset, and 109 (33.7%) received it at 8 days or later of symptom onset. At day 14 following symptom onset, higher proportion of patients recovered in the early remdesivir compared to the late remdesivir cohort, or patients who did not receive remdesivir (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31 to 5.35). Moreover, early administration of remdesivir was associated with lower admission to intensive care unit (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.64), less need for mechanical ventilation (aHR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.51), and lower mortality at 28 days (aHR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.53), as compared to the late remdesivir cohort or patients who did not receive remdesivir.Early administration of remdesivir within 7 days of symptom onset is associated with less need for mechanical ventilation and lower 28-days mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3207987109,"Plant associated microbiomes are known to confer fitness advantages to the host. Understanding how plant factors including biochemical traits influence host associated microbiome assembly could facilitate the development of microbiome-mediated solutions for sustainable plant production. Here, we examined microbial community structures of a set of well-characterized Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in metabolic pathways for the production of glucosinolates, flavonoids, or a number of defense signalling molecules. A. thaliana lines were grown in a natural soil and maintained under greenhouse conditions for 4 weeks before collection of roots for bacterial and fungal community profiling. We found distinct relative abundances and diversities of bacterial and fungal communities assembled in the individual A. thaliana mutants compared to their parental lines. Bacterial and fungal genera were mostly enriched than depleted in secondary metabolite and defense signaling mutants, except for flavonoid mutations on fungi communities. Bacterial genera Azospirillum and Flavobacterium were significantly enriched in most of the glucosinolate, flavonoid and signalling mutants while the fungal taxa Sporobolomyces and Emericellopsis were enriched in several glucosinolates and signalling mutants. Whilst the present study revealed marked differences in microbiomes of Arabidopsis mutants and their parental lines, it is suggestive that unknown enzymatic and pleiotropic activities of the mutated genes could contribute to the identified host-associated microbiomes. Notwithstanding, this study revealed interesting gene-microbiota links, and thus represents valuable resource data for selecting candidate A. thaliana mutants for analyzing the links between host genetics and the associated microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3209760027,"Begomoviruses are transmitted by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in a persistent-circulative way. Once B. tabaci becomes viruliferous, it remains so throughout its life span. Not much is known about the copies of begomoviruses ingested and/or released by B. tabaci during the process of feeding. The present study reports the absolute quantification of two different begomoviruses viz. tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV, bipartite) and chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV, monopartite) at different exposure of active acquisition and inoculation feeding using a detached leaf assay. A million copies of both the begomoviruses were acquired by a single B. tabaci with only 5 min of active feeding and virus copy number increased in a logarithmic model with feeding exposure. Whereas, a single B. tabaci could inoculate 8.21E+09 and 4.19E+11 copies of ToLCNDV and ChiLCV, respectively in detached leaves by 5 min of active feeding. Virus copies in inoculated leaves increased with an increase in feeding duration. Comparative dynamics of these two begomoviruses indicated that B. tabaci adult acquired around 14-fold higher copies of ChiLCV than ToLCNDV 24 hrs post feeding. Whereas, the rate of inoculation of ToLCNDV by individual B. tabaci was significantly higher than ChiLCV. The study provides a better understanding of begomovirus acquisition and inoculation dynamics by individual B. tabaci and would facilitate research on virus-vector epidemiology and screening host resistance."

https://openalex.org/W3182583282,"Background The use of cannabis for symptoms of endometriosis was investigated utilising retrospective archival data from Strainprint Technologies Ltd., a Canadian data technology company with a mobile phone application that tracks a range of data including dose, mode of administration, chemovar and their effects on various self-reported outcomes, including pelvic pain. Methods A retrospective, electronic record-based cohort study of Strainprint TM users with self-reported endometriosis was conducted. Self-rated cannabis efficacy, defined as a function of initial and final symptom ratings, was investigated across the included symptom clusters of cramps, pelvic pain, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, depression, and low libido. Cannabis dosage form, dose and cannabinoid ratio information was also recorded. Results A total number of 252 participants identifying as suffering endometriosis recorded 16193 sessions using cannabis between April 2017 and February 2020. The most common method of ingestion was inhalation (n = 10914, 67.4%), with pain as the most common reported symptom being treated by cannabis (n = 9281, 57.3%). Gastrointestinal symptoms, though a less common reason for cannabis usage (15.2%), had the greatest self-reported improvement after use. Inhaled forms had higher efficacy for pain, while oral forms were superior for mood and gastrointestinal symptoms. Dosage varied across ingestion methods, with a median dose of 9 inhalations (IQR 5 to 11) for inhaled dosage forms and 1 mg/mL (IQR 0.5 to 2) for other ingested dosage forms. The ratio of THC to CBD had a statistically significant, yet clinically small, differential effect on efficacy, depending on method of ingestion. Conclusions Cannabis appears to be effective for pelvic pain, gastrointestinal issues and mood, with effectiveness differing based on method of ingestion. The greater propensity for use of an inhaled dosage delivery may be due to the rapid onset of pain-relieving effects versus the slower onset of oral products. Oral forms appeared to be superior compared to inhaled forms in the less commonly reported mood or gastrointestinal categories. Clinical trials investigating the tolerability and effectiveness of cannabis for endometriosis pain and associated symptoms are urgently required."
https://openalex.org/W3208225279,"The built environment of cities is complex and influences social and environmental determinants of health. In this study we, 1) identified city profiles based on the built landscape and street design characteristics of cities in Latin America and 2) evaluated the associations of city profiles with social determinants of health and air pollution. Landscape and street design profiles of 370 cities were identified using finite mixture modeling. For landscape, we measured fragmentation, isolation, and shape. For street design, we measured street connectivity, street length, and directness. We fitted a two-level linear mixed model to assess the association of social and environmental determinants of health with the profiles. We identified four profiles for landscape and four for the street design domain. The most common landscape profile was the ""proximate stones"" characterized by moderate fragmentation, isolation and patch size, and irregular shape. The most common street design profile was the ""semi-hyperbolic grid"" characterized by moderate connectivity, street length, and directness. The ""semi-hyperbolic grid"", ""spiderweb"" and ""hyperbolic grid"" profiles were positively associated with higher access to piped water and less overcrowding. The ""semi-hyperbolic grid"" and ""spiderweb"" profiles were associated with higher air pollution. The ""proximate stones"" and ""proximate inkblots"" profiles were associated with higher congestion. In conclusion, there is substantial heterogeneity in the urban landscape and street design profiles of Latin American cities. While we did not find a specific built environment profile that was consistently associated with lower air pollution and better social conditions, the different configurations of the built environments of cities should be considered when planning healthy and sustainable cities in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W3210116527,"The glycoside hydrolase 19 (GH19) is a bifunctional family of chitinases and endolysins, which have been studied for the control of plant fungal pests, the recycle of chitin biomass, and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria. The GH19 domain-containing sequences (22,461) were divided into a chitinase and an endolysin subfamily by analyzing sequence networks, guided by taxonomy and the substrate specificity of characterized enzymes. The chitinase subfamily was split into seventeen groups, thus extending the previous classification. The endolysin subfamily is more diverse and consists of thirty-four groups. Despite their sequence diversity, twenty-six residues are conserved in chitinases and endolysins, which can be distinguished by two specific sequence patterns at six and four positions, respectively. Their location outside the catalytic cleft suggests a possible mechanism for substrate specificity that goes beyond the direct interaction with the substrate. The evolution of the GH19 catalytic domain was investigated by large-scale phylogeny. The inferred evolutionary history and putative horizontal gene transfer events differ from previous works. While no clear patterns were detected in endolysins, chitinases varied in sequence length by up to four loop insertions, causing at least eight distinct presence/absence loop combinations. The annotated GH19 sequences and structures are accessible via the GH19 Engineering Database (GH19ED, https://gh19ed.biocatnet.de). The GH19ED has been developed to support the prediction of substrate specificity and the search for novel GH19 enzymes from neglected taxonomic groups or in regions of the sequence space where few sequences have been described yet."
https://openalex.org/W3209375320,"Introduction Authors of knowledge syntheses make many subjective decisions during their review process. Those decisions, which are guided in part by author characteristics, can impact the conduct and conclusions of knowledge syntheses, which assimilate much of the evidence base in medical education. To better understand the evidence base, this study describes the characteristics of knowledge synthesis authors, focusing on gender, geography, and institution. Methods In 2020, the authors conducted meta-research to examine authors of 963 knowledge syntheses published between 1999 and 2019 in 14 core medical education journals. Results The authors identified 4,110 manuscript authors across all authorship positions. On average there were 4.3 authors per knowledge synthesis (SD = 2.51, Median = 4, Range = 1–22); 79 knowledge syntheses (8%) were single-author publications. Over time, the average number of authors per synthesis increased (M = 1.80 in 1999; M = 5.34 in 2019). Knowledge syntheses were authored by slightly more females (n = 2047; 50.5%) than males (n = 2005; 49.5%) across all author positions. Authors listed affiliations in 58 countries, and 58 knowledge syntheses (6%) included authors from low- or middle-income countries. Authors from the United States (n = 366; 38%), Canada (n = 233; 24%), and the United Kingdom (n = 180; 19%) published the most knowledge syntheses. Authors listed affiliation at 617 unique institutions, and first authors represented 362 unique institutions with greatest representation from University of Toronto (n = 55, 6%). Across all authorship positions, the large majority of knowledge syntheses (n = 753; 78%) included authors from institutions ranked in the top 200 globally. Conclusion Knowledge synthesis author teams have grown over the past 20 years, and while there is near gender parity across all author positions, authorship has been dominated by North American researchers located at highly ranked institutions. This suggests a potential overrepresentation of certain authors with particular characteristics, which may impact the conduct and conclusions of medical education knowledge syntheses."
https://openalex.org/W3211215958,"Background Community pharmacists play an important role in reducing COVID-19-related secondary health problems. However, the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among pharmacists in Japan have not yet been elucidated. Methods We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey among 1,137 pharmacists working in health support pharmacies (HSPs) in Japan. These pharmacists are responsible for providing health consultations to community residents. We assessed COVID-19-related KAP among pharmacists and compared the results for two age groups: ≤49 years and ≥50 years. We used multiple regression analysis to examine which factors influence KAP scores regarding COVID-19. Results From among the 2,141 HSPs in Japan, a total of 1,137 pharmacists, each representing a different HSP, responded to the survey. The results indicated that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists have been providing consultations about COVID-19 to local residents, covering topics such as “Effective infection prevention methods” (60.6%) and “What the COVID-19 pandemic would be” (48.8%). Importantly, 73.5% of the pharmacists felt they “did not have enough information about COVID-19.” The main information resources about COVID-19 were Internet (91.2%) and television (78.9%). Across all respondents, the mean knowledge score (4.17/10) was lower than the mean scores for attitudes (7.26/10) and practices (5.79/10). Multiple regression analysis showed that having enough information about COVID-19 was a factor strongly associated with total KAP scores ( p &lt;0.001; 95% confidence interval, −1.344 to −0.540). Conclusions Pharmacists working in community pharmacies provide residents with information related to COVID-19. In this role as a health partner, these pharmacists need a way to strengthen and expand their knowledge, and moreover, their ability to support community residents. Learning more about the available academic and scientific information, as well as having access to accurate epidemiological information, can offer a means of reaching these goals."
https://openalex.org/W3208943301,"Behavioural synchrony among individuals is essential for group-living organisms. The functioning of synchronization in a multilevel society, which is a nested assemblage of multiple social levels between many individuals, remains largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to build a model that explained the synchronization of activity in a multilevel society of feral horses. Multi-agent-based models were used based on four hypotheses: A) horses do not synchronize, B) horses synchronize with any individual in any unit, C) horses synchronize only within units, and D) horses synchronize across and within units, but internal synchronization is stronger. The empirical data obtained from drone observations best supported hypothesis D. This result suggests that animals in a multilevel society coordinate with other conspecifics not only within a unit but also at an inter-unit level. In this case, inter-individual distances are much longer than those in most previous models which only considered local interaction within a few body lengths."

LENVA therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) should be mandatory for a precision medicine to optimize the drug dosage. To this end, the development of a sensitive and robust quantification method to be applied in the clinical setting is essential. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of LENVA in human plasma. On this premise, sample preparation was based on a protein precipitation and the chromatographic separation was achieved on a Synergi Fusion RP C18 column in 4 min. The method was completely and successfully validated according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, with good linearity in the range of 0.50–2000 ng/mL (R≥0.9968). Coefficient of variation (CV) for intra- and inter-day precision was ≤11.3% and accuracy ranged from 96.3 to 109.0%, internal standard normalized matrix effect CV% was ≤2.8% and recovery was ≥95.6%. Successful results were obtained for sensitivity (signal to noise (S/N) ratio &gt;21) and selectivity, dilution integrity (CV% ≤ 4.0% and accuracy 99.9–102%), and analyte stability under various handling and storage conditions both in matrix and solvents. This method was applied to quantify LENVA in patient’s plasma samples and covered the concentration range achievable in patients. In conclusion, a sensitive and robust quantification method was developed and validated to be applied in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3211056109,"The COVID-19 pandemic required significant public health interventions from local governments. Although nonpharmaceutical interventions often were implemented as decision rules, few studies evaluated the robustness of those reopening plans under a wide range of uncertainties. This paper uses the Robust Decision Making approach to stress-test 78 alternative reopening strategies, using California as an example. This study uniquely considers a wide range of uncertainties and demonstrates that seemingly sensible reopening plans can lead to both unnecessary COVID-19 deaths and days of interventions. We find that plans using fixed COVID-19 case thresholds might be less effective than strategies with time-varying reopening thresholds. While we use California as an example, our results are particularly relevant for jurisdictions where vaccination roll-out has been slower. The approach used in this paper could also prove useful for other public health policy problems in which policymakers need to make robust decisions in the face of deep uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W3208005500,"The efficacy of the public health measures to mitigate COVID-19 is influenced by health literacy which includes the level of knowledge about the disease and the preventive behaviours adopted by individuals. Thailand, being a low- and middle-income country with an ageing society, has to consider both the challenges that its health system has in disseminating information and the disparities in health literacy among its older population. This study investigated the knowledge and behaviour of older adults in Thailand regarding COVID-19 using the Impact of COVID-19 on Older Persons in Thailand, a cross-sectional survey. The data was primarily collected online and included 1,230 adults aged at least 60 years from nine provinces of the five regions of the country. The associated factors with the health literacy outcomes were tested using bivariate logistic regression analyses. It was observed that 43% of the older adults in the sample had proper knowledge of the disease and 33% adopted preventive behaviours. Knowledge about the disease was not associated with preventive behaviour. The associated factors common between the increased levels of knowledge and adoption of behaviours were rural area residence and higher educational attainment levels. Obtaining information from the internet was observed to increase knowledge while having the television and radio as sources of information had negative relationship. Many older adults continued to be employed during the lockdown period and this was associated with decreased adoption of preventive behaviour. The context of vulnerable populations, particularly older adults, is different with regard to their access to information and concern about income. Health information has to be tailored for targeted populations. Their needs also have to be addressed as they have increased risks because of financial and health susceptibilities."
https://openalex.org/W3209082658,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of children with primary brain tumors, the effectiveness of treatment modalities, and to detect factors related to the outcome. Methods A detailed analysis was performed on a series of 173 pediatric patients treated in a Serbian referral oncology institution between 2007 and 2016, based on their clinical, histological, treatment, and follow-up data. Results Mean survival time of all children was 94.5months. 2-, 5- and 10-year overall survival probabilities were 68.8%, 59.4%, and 52.8%, respectively. Patients with supratentorial tumors had longer survival than patients with infratentorial tumors and patients with tumors in both compartments (p = 0.011). Children with the unknown histopathology (brainstem glioma) and high-grade glioma had a shorter life than embryonal tumors, ependymoma, and low-grade glioma (p&lt;0.001). Survival of the children who underwent gross total resection was longer than the children in whom lesser degrees of resection were achieved (p = 0.015). The extent of the disease is a very important parameter found to be associated with survival. Patients with no evidence of disease after surgery had a mean survival of 123 months, compared with 82 months in patients with local residual disease and 55 months in patients with disseminated disease (p&lt;0.001). By the univariate analysis, factors predicting poor outcome in our series were the presentation of disease with hormonal abnormalities, tumor location, and the extent of the disease, while the factors predicting a better outcome were age at the time of diagnosis, presentation of the disease with neurological deficit, and type of resection. By the multivariate analysis, the extent of the disease remained as the only strong adverse risk factor for survival (HR 2.06; 95% CI = 1.38–3.07; p&lt;0.001). Conclusions With an organized and dedicated multidisciplinary team, the adequate outcomes can be achieved in a middle-income country setting. The presence of local residual disease after surgery and disseminated disease has a strong negative effect on survival."
https://openalex.org/W3210159958,"We present a new phenomenological model of human ventricular epicardial cells and we test its reentry dynamics. The model is derived from the Rogers-McCulloch formulation of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations and represents the total ionic current divided into three contributions corresponding to the excitatory, recovery and transient outward currents. Our model reproduces the main characteristics of human epicardial tissue, including action potential amplitude and morphology, upstroke velocity, and action potential duration and conduction velocity restitution curves. The reentry dynamics is stable, and the dominant period is about 270 ms, which is comparable to clinical values. The proposed model is the first phenomenological model able to accurately resemble human experimental data by using only 3 state variables and 17 parameters. Indeed, it is more computationally efficient than existing models (i.e., almost two times faster than the minimal ventricular model). Beyond the computational efficiency, the low number of parameters facilitates the process of fitting the model to the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W3208097071,"To develop an autophagy-gene-based signature that could help to anticipate the therapeutic effects of Colorectal Cancer (CRC).We downloaded the gene expression profiles of CRC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Genes with significant prognostic value in CRC were screened through univariate Cox regression analysis, while the LASSO Cox regression method was applied to screen optimal genes to construct the autophagy-related prognostic signature.11 autophagy genes were identified and selected for the establishment of prognosis prediction model for CRC patients. The CRC patients were classified into the low- and high-risk groups according to the optimal cutoff value. The time-dependent ROC curves indicated the good performance of this model in prognosis prediction, with AUC values of 0.66, 0.66, and 0.67 at 1, 3 and 5 years for TCGA samples, as well as AUC values of 0.63, 0.65 and 0.64 for GEO samples, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results confirmed risk score as the independent marker for prognosis prediction in CRC. Besides, the constructed nomogram also had high predictive value. The results analysis on the tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) relative ratios and mRNA levels of key immune checkpoint receptors indicated the signature was closely related to immune microenvironment of CRC in the context of TIICs and immune checkpoint receptors' mRNA level. The proportion of MSI-L + MSI-H in the high-risk group was higher than that in the low-risk group. Moreover, the tumor purity was evaluated by estimate function package suggested that lower tumor purity in CRC might lead to a poorer prognosis.The autophagy-related features obtained in this study were able to divide the CRC patients into low- and high-risk groups, which should be contribute to the decision-making of CRC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3208133233,"Cyber insurance is a risk management option to cover financial losses caused by cyberattacks. Researchers have focused their attention on cyber insurance during the last decade. One of the primary issues related to cyber insurance is estimating the premium. The effect of network topology has been heavily explored in the previous three years in cyber risk modeling. However, none of the approaches has assessed the influence of clustering structures. Numerous earlier investigations have indicated that internal links within a cluster reduce transmission speed or efficacy. As a result, the clustering coefficient metric becomes crucial in understanding the effectiveness of viral transmission. We provide a modified Markov-based dynamic model in this paper that incorporates the influence of the clustering structure on calculating cyber insurance premiums. The objective is to create less expensive and less homogenous premiums by combining criteria other than degrees. This research proposes a novel method for calculating premiums that gives a competitive market price. We integrated the epidemic inhibition function into the Markov-based model by considering three functions: quadratic, linear, and exponential. Theoretical and numerical evaluations of regular networks suggested that premiums were more realistic than premiums without clustering. Validation on a real network showed a significant improvement in premiums compared to premiums without the clustering structure component despite some variations. Furthermore, the three functions demonstrated very high correlations between the premium, the total inhibition function of neighbors, and the speed of the inhibition function. Thus, the proposed method can provide application flexibility by adapting to specific company requirements and network configurations."

The association of self-expanding valves (SEVs) and balloon-expandable valves (BEVs) with the consequent inflammatory response remains uncertain.Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI: SEVs or BEVs, from January 2010 to December 2019 were enrolled. Whole white blood cells (WBC) and subpopulation dynamics as well the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were evaluated.Three-hundred seventy consecutive patients (mean age 81.75 ± 6.8 years, 199 women's) were enrolled. In the entire population, significant kinetic changes in the WBC response (p <0.0001) between admission and first 24 hours post procedure, with a significant increase in total WBC (7.46 ± 2.26 to 10.08 ± 3.55) and absolute neutrophil count (4.97 ± 2.06 to 8.19 ± 3.43), NL ratio (3.72 ± 2.8 to 9.76 ± 7.29), and a meaningful decrease in absolute lymphocytes count (1.67 ± 1.1 to 1.1 ± 0.76). When compared between the types of valves, SEVs were associated with a more pronounced inflammatory response than BEVs, with total WBC (10.44 ± 3.86 vs. 9.45 ± 3.19) neutrophils (8.56 ± 3.75 vs. 7.55 ± 3.06) with p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively.This is the first description of a differential inflammatory response between the two leading delivery systems. SEV appears to trigger a more robust inflammatory response as compared to BEV. Clinical studies are warranted to assess the long term effect of our findings."

Descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were conducted.Prevalence of preDM, DM, and HTN in Qataris aged 18-64 years was 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.6%-14.7%), 10.4% (95% CI 8.4%-12.9%), and 32.9% (95% CI 30.4%-35.6%), respectively. Age was the common factor associated with the three conditions. Adjusted analyses showed that unhealthy diet (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.84, 95% CI 1.01-3.36) was significantly associated with preDM; that physical inactivity (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.12-2.46), central obesity (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.02-4.26), and HTN (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.40-3.38) were significantly associated with DM; and that DM (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.34-3.22) was significantly associated with HTN. Population attributable fraction of preDM associated with unhealthy diet was 7.7%; of DM associated with physical inactivity, central obesity, and HTN, respectively, was 14.9%, 39.8%, and 17.5%; and of HTN associated with DM was 3.0%.One in five Qataris is living with either preDM or DM, and one in three is living with HTN, conditions that were found to be primarily driven by lifestyle factors. Prevention, control, and management of these conditions should be a national priority to reduce their disease burden and associated disease sequelae."

However, few studies investigated the prognostic value of attenuation correction (AC) in MPI, and the results were controversial.To investigate the prognostic value of computed tomography (CT)-based AC thallium-201 (Tl-201) MPI.A total of 108 consecutive patients who underwent Tl-201 MPI and received coronary angiography within 90 days were included. Medical records were reviewed and missing information was completed after telephone contact. The prognostic value was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.After a mean follow-up of 7.72 ± 3.72 years, 27 patients had died, 41 had been readmitted for cardiovascular (CV)-related events and 44 had reached the composite of death plus CV-related re-admission. Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause mortality for SSS with a cutoff value of 13 for AC and 16 for non-AC (NAC) images showed a significant difference between the two curves for both AC and NAC images (p = 0.011 for AC and p = 0.021 for NAC). In the multivariable model, SSS and SRS showed similar independent predictive values in predicting all-cause mortality and composite of all-cause mortality plus CV-related re-admission, in both AC and NAC images. Subgroup analysis implicated that AC MPI possibly provided better risk stratification in obese patients.CT-based AC and NAC MPI showed similar value and were the only significant predictors for the composite of mortality and CV events."
https://openalex.org/W3208513861,"Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is widely used to investigate genomic variation. In several studies, the genetic variation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been analyzed in sputum samples without previous culture, using target enrichment methodologies for NGS. Alignments obtained by different programs generally map the sequences under default parameters, and from these results, it is assumed that only Mycobacterium reads will be obtained. However, variants of interest microorganism in clinical samples can be confused with a vast collection of reads from other bacteria, viruses, and human DNA. Currently, there are no standardized pipelines, and the cleaning success is never verified since there is a lack of rigorous controls to identify and remove reads from other sputum-microorganisms genetically similar to M. tuberculosis. Therefore, we designed a bioinformatic pipeline to process NGS data from sputum samples, including several filters and quality control points to identify and eliminate non-M. tuberculosis reads to obtain a reliable genetic variant report. Our proposal uses the SURPI software as a taxonomic classifier to filter input sequences and perform a mapping that provides the highest percentage of Mycobacterium reads, minimizing the reads from other microorganisms. We then use the filtered sequences to perform variant calling with the GATK software, ensuring the mapping quality, realignment, recalibration, hard-filtering, and post-filter to increase the reliability of the reported variants. Using default mapping parameters, we identified reads of contaminant bacteria, such as Streptococcus, Rhotia, Actinomyces, and Veillonella. Our final mapping strategy allowed a sequence identity of 97.8% between the input reads and the whole M. tuberculosis reference genome H37Rv using a genomic edit distance of three, thus removing 98.8% of the off-target sequences with a Mycobacterium reads loss of 1.7%. Finally, more than 200 unreliable genetic variants were removed during the variant calling, increasing the report's reliability."

Following nephrectomy, participants continued treatment and were followed-up with contrast-enhanced CT. Changes in imaging parameters before and after sunitinib were assessed with the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the log-rank test was used to assess effects on survival.12 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After 12 days, the solid and necrotic tumor volumes decreased by 28% and 17%, respectively (p = 0.04). However, tumor-volume reduction did not correlate with progression-free or overall survival (PFS/OS). Sunitinib therapy resulted in a reduction in median solid tumor diffusivity D from 1298x10-6 to 1200x10-6mm2/s (p = 0.03); a larger decrease was associated with a better RECIST response (p = 0.02) and longer PFS (p = 0.03) on the log-rank test. An increase in R2* from 19 to 28s-1 (p = 0.001) was observed, paralleled by a decrease in Ktrans from 0.415 to 0.305min-1 (p = 0.01) and a decrease in perfusion fraction from 0.34 to 0.19 (p<0.001).Physiological imaging confirmed efficacy of the anti-angiogenic agent 12 days after initiating therapy and demonstrated response to treatment. The change in diffusivity shortly after starting pre-surgical sunitinib correlated to PFS in mRCC undergoing nephrectomy, however, no parameter predicted OS.EudraCtNo: 2005-004502-82."
https://openalex.org/W3209436805,"In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, damaging coastal ecosystems. Seaside Sparrows ( Ammospiza maritima )—a year-round resident of Gulf Coast salt marshes—were exposed to oil, as shown by published isotopic and molecular analyses, but fitness consequences have not been clarified. We monitored nests around two bays in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, USA from 2012–2017 to assess possible impacts on the nesting biology of Seaside Sparrows. A majority of nests failed (76% of known-fate nests, N = 252 nests, 3521 exposure-days) during our study, and predation was the main cause of nest failure (~91% of failed nests). Logistic exposure analysis revealed that daily nest survival rate: (1) was greater at nests with denser vegetation at nest height, (2) was higher in the more sheltered bay we studied, (3) decreased over the course of the breeding season in each year, and (4) was not correlated with either sediment polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations or estimated predator abundance during the years for which we had those data. Although the Deepwater Horizon spill impacted other aspects of Seaside Sparrow ecology, we found no definitive effect of initial oiling or oiled sediment on nest survival during 2012–2017. Because predation was the overwhelming cause of nest failure in our study, additional work on these communities is needed to fully understand demographic and ecological impacts of storms, oil spills, other pollutants, and sea-level rise on Seaside Sparrows and their predators."
https://openalex.org/W3209561384,"The ectoparasite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman is the most important parasites of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera L. The most widely currently used treatment uses formic acid (FA), but the understanding of its effects on V. destructor is limited. In order to understand the mechanism of action of FA, its effect on Varroa mites was investigated using proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). V. destructor was collected from honey bee colonies with natural mite infestation before and 24 h after the initiation of FA treatment and subjected to proteome analysis. A total of 2637 proteins were identified. Quantitative analysis of differentially expressed candidate proteins (fold change ≥ 1.5; p ≤ 0.05) revealed 205 differentially expressed proteins: 91 were induced and 114 repressed in the FA-treated group compared to the untreated control group. Impaired protein synthesis accompanied by increased protein and amino acid degradation suggest an imbalance in proteostasis. Signs of oxidative stress included significant dysregulation of candidate proteins of mitochondrial cellular respiration, increased endocytosis, and induction of heat shock proteins. Furthermore, an increased concentration of several candidate proteins associated with detoxification was observed. These results suggest dysregulated cellular respiration triggered by FA treatment as well as an increase in cellular defense mechanisms, including induced heat shock proteins and detoxification enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3210961241,"The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) functions as an autoreceptor on dopaminergic cell bodies and terminals and as a postsynaptic receptor on a variety of neurons in the central nervous system. As a result of alternative splicing, the D2R is expressed as two isoforms: long (D2LR) and short (D2SR) differing by a stretch of 29 residues in the third intracellular loop, with D2SR being the predominant presynaptic isoform. Recent reports described a Ca2+ sensitivity of the desensitization time course of potassium currents elicited via D2SR, but not via D2LR, when either isoform was selectively expressed in dopaminergic neurons. Here, we aimed to study the mechanism behind this subtype-specific Ca2+ sensitivity. Thus, we measured the desensitization of potassium channel responses evoked by D2LR and D2SR using two-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes in the absence and presence of different amounts of β-arrestin2 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2), both of which are known to play important roles in D2R desensitization in native cells. We found that co-expression of both GRK2 and β-arrestin2 was necessary for reconstitution of the Ca2+ sensitivity of D2SR desensitization, while D2LR did not display Ca2+ sensitivity under these conditions. The effect of Ca2+ chelation by BAPTA-AM to slow the rate of D2SR desensitization was mimicked by the GRK2 inhibitor, Cmpd101, and by the kinase-inactivating GRK2 mutation, K220R, but not by the PKC inhibitor, Gö6976, nor by the calmodulin antagonist, KN-93. Thus, Ca2+-sensitive desensitization of D2SR appears to be mediated via a GRK2 phosphorylation-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3211183898,"Excess copper (Cu) in soil due to industrial and agricultural practices can result in reduced plant growth. Excess Cu resulted in severely retarded root growth with severe discoloration of Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and Medicago truncatula. Growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide resulted in similar symptoms that could be partially recovered by the addition of the reductant ascorbic acid revealing damage was likely due to oxidative stress. The addition of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in the presence of Cu prevented much of the damage, including plant growth and restoration of lignin synthesis which was inhibited in the presence of excess Cu. Transcriptome analyses of the impact of excess Cu and the amelioration after PAs treatment revealed that changes were enriched in functions associated with the cell wall and extracellular processes, indicating that inhibition of cell wall synthesis was likely the reason for retarded growth. Excess Cu appeared to induce a strong defense response, along with alterations in the expression of a number of genes encoding transcription factors, notably related to ethylene signaling. The addition of PAs greatly reduced this response, and also induced novel genes that likely help ameliorate the effects of excess Cu. These included induction of genes involved in the last step of ascorbic acid biosynthesis and of enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis. Combined, these results show that excess Cu causes severe oxidative stress damage and inhibition of cell wall synthesis, which can be relieved by the addition of PAs."
https://openalex.org/W3207935294,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes cell growth, proliferation, and survival in numerous tissues. Piperonylic acid, a metabolite present in peppers (Piper nigrum L. and Piper longum L.), can bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and induce an intracellular signaling cascade leading to the transcription of genes responsible for these actions, especially in keratinocytes. These cells are fundamental in maintaining cutaneous homeostasis and are the first to be damaged in the case of a wound. Thus, we hypothesized that piperonylic acid improves wound healing. C57BL6/J male mice were submitted to dorsal skin wounds caused by a 6 mm punch and treated topically with piperonylic acid or vehicle. The wounds were evaluated macro- and microscopically, and tissue samples were collected for immunofluorescence and real-time PCR analyses on days 6, 9 and 19 post-injury. Topical piperonylic acid improved wound healing from day 6 post-injury until closure. This phenomenon apparently occurred through EGFR activation. In addition, piperonylic acid modulated the gene expression of interleukin (Il)-6, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor (Tnf)-α, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (Mcp)-1 and insulin-like growth factor (Igf)-1, which are important for the healing process. By day 19 post-injury, the new tissue showed greater deposition of type I collagen and a morphology closer to intact skin, with more dermal papillae and hair follicles. We conclude that piperonylic acid may be a viable option for the treatment of skin wounds."
https://openalex.org/W3209263908,"Stunting, an indicator of restricted linear growth, has become a primary measure of childhood undernutrition due to its persistent high prevalence globally, and importance for health and development. Although the etiology is recognized as complex, most analyses have focused on social and biomedical determinants, with limited attention on psychological factors affecting care and nurturing in the home. We assessed whether the psychological distress of parents is related to child linear growth and stunting, and documented the associated risk factors, and examined the relationship between parental distress and behavioral and other risk factors for stunting.We used data from the Indonesia National Health Survey 2013, including 46,315 children 6-59 months of age. Multivariate linear, logistic, and multilevel multinomial logistic regression, using survey weights, were used to assess the relationship between parental distress, as assessed by the WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ20), with height-for-age z score (HAZ), stunting, and behavioral and other risk factors for stunting.Maternal, paternal and parental distress (i.e. both maternal and paternal distress) were associated with reduced linear growth of the children by 0.086 (95% CI -0.17, -0.00), 0.11 (95% CI -0.24, -0.02) and 0.19 (95% CI -0.37, -0.00) HAZ-scores, respectively. Maternal and paternal distress increased the risk of mild stunting (HAZ <-1) by 33% (95% CI 1.17,1.50) and 37% (95% CI 1.18,1.60), and the risk of moderate stunting (HAZ <-2) by 25% (95% CI 1.10,1.43) and 28% (95% CI 1.08,1.51]), respectively. Parental stress increased the risk of moderate stunting by 40% (95% CI 1.06,1.85). Amongst specific groups of risk factors, the proportion of HAZ-score lost was associated with socioeconomic factors (30.3%) including, low wealth, low maternal occupational status, low maternal education, rural residence, and low paternal occupational status; physiological factors (15.5%) including low maternal height, low maternal mid-upper arm circumference, being male, low paternal height; behavioral factors (8.9%) including open garbage disposal, paternal smoking, not using iodized salt; and experiencing at least one infectious diseases episode (1.1%).Maternal, paternal and parental stress were associated with reduced linear growth of children. These findings highlight the complex etiology of stunting and suggest nutritional and other biomedical interventions are insufficient, and that promotion of mental and behavioral health programs for parents must be pursued as part of a comprehensive strategy to enhance child growth and development, i.e. improved caretaker capacity, integrated community development, improved parenting skills, as well as reduced gender discrimination, and domestic violence."
https://openalex.org/W3210137930,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common neurological disorder whose outcomes vary widely depending on a variety of environmental factors, including diet. Using a Drosophila melanogaster TBI model that reproduces key aspects of TBI in humans, we previously found that the diet consumed immediately following a primary brain injury has a substantial effect on the incidence of mortality within 24 h (early mortality). Flies that receive equivalent primary injuries have a higher incidence of early mortality when fed high-carbohydrate diets versus water. Here, we report that flies fed high-fat ketogenic diet (KD) following TBI exhibited early mortality that was equivalent to that of flies fed water and that flies protected from early mortality by KD continued to show survival benefits weeks later. KD also has beneficial effects in mammalian TBI models, indicating that the mechanism of action of KD is evolutionarily conserved. To probe the mechanism, we examined the effect of KD in flies mutant for Eip75B, an ortholog of the transcription factor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) that contributes to the mechanism of action of KD and has neuroprotective effects in mammalian TBI models. We found that the incidence of early mortality of Eip75B mutant flies was higher when they were fed KD than when they were fed water following TBI. These data indicate that Eip75B/PPARγ is necessary for the beneficial effects of KD following TBI. In summary, this work provides the first evidence that KD activates PPARγ to reduce deleterious outcomes of TBI and it demonstrates the utility of the fly TBI model for dissecting molecular pathways that contribute to heterogeneity in TBI outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3210948908,"While numerous studies have revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance plant performance, the influence of these symbionts on temperate-forest herbaceous species in relation to soil physical and chemical properties has been left largely unexplored. Therefore, two perennial herbs, Geum urbanum (Rosaceae) and Senecio ovatus (Asteraceae), were examined in a laboratory pot experiment to determine whether AMF influenced their growth, photosynthetic performance index, and N and P contents in biomass. The treatments, involving three widespread AMF species, were prepared in the soils of two habitats colonised by both plants, namely beech and riparian forests, as follows: (1) control-soils without AMF, (2) Claroideoglomus claroideum, (3) Funneliformis geosporus, and (4) Funneliformis mosseae. Neither shoot mass nor photosynthetic performance index of G. urbanum and S. ovatus was enhanced by AMF. Senecio ovatus root mass was increased compared to control only by F. geosporus. Inconsistent effects were observed in N and P contents in shoots and roots of both species. The direction and magnitude of these responses were dependent on the fungal species and soil type. Although the plant species belong to families whose representatives are usually regularly colonised by and highly responsive to AMF, our study indicates that AMF had only a slight impact on the performance of G. urbanum and S. ovatus at the early stages of their development. The plants being slightly dependent on AMF are thus adapted to colonise temperate-forest soils with a low level of availability of AMF propagules."

Among the modifiable risk factors, dyslipidemia and khat chewing were expanding at an alarming rate in Ethiopia but were still underestimated. Thus, this study aimed to assess heavy khat (Catha edulis) chewing and dyslipidemia as modifiable hypertensive risk factors among patients in the southwest, Ethiopia.A facility-based case-control study was conducted among 136 cases and 270 controls from May 15 to July 30, 2017. A consecutive sampling technique was used in this study. Epi data version 3.1.1 and SPSS version 21 were used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported.The majority of the cases had a total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratio of >5 (72.1%). The odds of hypertension increased among participants who had attended no formal education [AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: (1.05-4.82)], history of alcohol consumption [AOR = 5.93,95% CI:(3.11-11.30)], moderate khat chewing [AOR = 3.68, 95% CI:(1.69,8.01)], heavy khat chewing [AOR = 18.18, 95% CI: (3.56-92.89)], mild intensity physical activity [AOR = 3.01, 95% CI: (1.66-5.47)], type of oil used for food preparation [AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: (1.49-5.28)], and dyslipidemia [AOR = 6.68, 95% CI: (2.93-15.23)].The study showed that modifiable risk factors were the major factors associated with the development of hypertension. The findings of this study highlighted that health education is needed to focus on physical exercise, quitting excess alcohol consumption, quitting khat chewing by giving special emphasis to those who had no formal education. In addition, consideration should be given to a healthy diet free of cholesterol and unhealthy behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3136384109,"We performed a post-occupancy assessment based on 500 occupant surveys in eight buildings using embedded radiant heating and cooling systems. This study follows-up on a quantitative assessment of 60 office buildings that found radiant and all-air buildings have comparable temperature and acoustic satisfaction with a tendency for increased temperature satisfaction in radiant buildings. Our objective was to investigate reasons of comfort and discomfort in the radiant buildings, and to relate these to building characteristics and operations strategies. The primary sources of thermal discomfort are lack of control over the thermal environment (both temperature and air movement) and slow system response, both of which were seen to be alleviated with fast-response adaptive opportunities such as operable windows and personal fans. There was no optimal radiant design or operation that maximized thermal comfort, and building operators were pleased with reduced repair and maintenance associated with radiant systems compared to all-air systems. Occupants reported low satisfaction with acoustics. This was primarily due to sound privacy issues in open-plan offices which may be exacerbated by highly reflective surfaces common in radiant spaces."
https://openalex.org/W3210010985,"Photo-induced behavioral responses (photobehaviors) are crucial to the survival of motile phototrophic organisms in changing light conditions. Volvocine green algae are excellent model organisms for studying the regulatory mechanisms of photobehavior. We recently reported that unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and multicellular Volvox rousseletii exhibit similar photobehaviors, such as phototactic and photoshock responses, via different ciliary regulations. To clarify how the regulatory systems have changed during the evolution of multicellularity, we investigated the photobehaviors of four-celled Tetrabaena socialis. Surprisingly, unlike C. reinhardtii and V. rousseletii, T. socialis did not exhibit immediate photobehaviors after light illumination. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the T. socialis eyespot does not function as a photoreceptor. Instead, T. socialis exhibited slow accumulation toward the light source in a photosynthesis-dependent manner. Our assessment of photosynthetic activities showed that T. socialis chloroplasts possess higher photoprotection abilities against strong light than C. reinhardtii. These data suggest that C. reinhardtii and T. socialis employ different strategies to avoid high-light stress (moving away rapidly and gaining photoprotection, respectively) despite their close phylogenetic relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3210269251,"Purpose Radiation dose estimates in epidemiology typically rely on intake predictions based on urine bioassay measurements. The purpose of this article is to compare the conventional dosimetric estimates for radiation epidemiology with the estimates based on additional post-mortem tissue radiochemical analysis results. Methods The comparison was performed on a unique group of 11 former Manhattan Project nuclear workers, who worked with plutonium in the 1940s, and voluntarily donated their bodies to the United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries. Results Post-mortem organ activities were predicted using different sets of urine data and compared to measured activities. Use of urinalysis data collected during the exposure periods overestimated the systemic (liver+skeleton) deposition of 239 Pu by 155±134%, while the average bias from using post-exposure urinalyses was –4±50%. Committed effective doses estimated using early urine data differed from the best estimate by, on average, 196±193%; inclusion of follow-up urine measurements in analyses decreased the mean bias to 0.6±36.3%. Cumulative absorbed doses for the liver, red marrow, bone surface, and brain were calculated for the actual commitment period. Conclusion On average, post-exposure urine bioassay results were in good agreement with post-mortem tissue analyses and were more reliable than results of urine bioassays collected during the exposure."

The larvicidal activity of the following formulations was tested: 1% ivermectin suspension in balanced sterile saline solution (BSSS), 1% ivermectin solution in propylene glycol, propylene glycol, 0.6% PVP-I in hyaluronic acid vehicle (IODIM®), and combination of ivermectin 1% solution and 0.6% PVP-I. One mL of each formulation was added to different Petri dishes containing the larvae. The time needed to kill the larvae was recorded.893 larvae were tested. The median time needed to kill the larvae was 46, 44, 11, 6, and 10 minutes for Iodim®, ivermectin 1% suspension, propylene glycol, ivermectin 1% solution, and a combination of ivermectin 1% solution with 0.6% PVP-I, respectively. Kaplan-Meyer analysis disclosed that the survival curves were significantly lower in samples treated with ivermectin 1% solution, ivermectin 1% solution + 0.6% PVP-I, and propylene glycol than in samples receiving other treatments or BSSS.In this in vitro study, ivermectin 1% solution in propylene glycol, ivermectin 1% solution + 0.6% PVP-I, and propylene glycol alone showed a good, relatively rapid larvicidal activity against O. ovis larvae. Further experimental and clinical studies are necessary to establish whether, or not, these formulations may be considered as potential candidates for the topical treatment for external ophthalmomyiasis caused by O. ovis."
https://openalex.org/W3210926812,"Numerous studies have clarified that sprinters possess unique morphological characteristics of the thigh muscles compared with non-athletes. However, little evidence is available regarding the morphological differences between sprinters and rugby players. This study aimed to examine the morphological differences in the individual hamstrings and quadriceps femoris muscles between sub-elite sprinters and rugby players. Ultrasound images were acquired from the proximal, middle, and distal regions of the thigh. From the images, the anatomical cross-sectional areas were calculated for 14 sub-elite sprinters, 14 rugby players, and 14 non-athletes. The calculated anatomical cross-sectional areas were normalized to two-thirds power of the body mass, and the normalized values of all regions were averaged as those of the individual muscles. In the hamstrings, the sizes of the biceps femoris short head and semitendinosus were greater in the sprinters than in the rugby players and/or non-athletes (all p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, in the quadriceps femoris, the sizes of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus intermedius were the greatest in the rugby players (all p &lt; 0.05). In the middle region of the biceps femoris short head and the proximal-middle regions of the semitendinosus, the muscle sizes were greater in the sprinters than in the rugby players (all p &lt; 0.05), and vice versa in the middle-distal regions of the rectus femoris (all p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that 1) sub-elite sprinters possess larger sizes of the biceps femoris short head and semitendinosus, whereas rugby players have larger sizes of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus intermedius, and 2) each of the athletes has different size distributions, especially along the lengths of BFsh, ST, and RF. The findings of the present study would be helpful for rugby players in designing training regimens aimed at enhancing sprint performance."
https://openalex.org/W3209019499,"Blue-green algae, Spirulina platensis is a well-known algal formulation known for its beneficial effects on the growth and development in several types of organisms. Although it is used as a food supplement, it possesses significant toxic effects on growth and development of organisms. This study assessed the positive/negative impacts of S. platensis on almond moth, Cadra cautella (almond moth) that is a serious pest of date fruits and other grains under laboratory conditions. The S. platensis powder were mixed with diet and newly hatched C. cautella larvae were fed. The larvae were observed on alternate days to record the data. The diet was changed once a week. The S. platensis proved very good nutrition supplement at lower dose. Whereas, moderate and high mortality was noted for 5 and 10% formulations, respectively. Moreover, larval span was significantly altered by different formulations and lower formulation (1%) resulted in shorter larval period compared to the rest of the formulations. Although 33% mortality was recorded under 5% S. platensis formulation, however, the larvae which reached to adult stage, copulated, and females laid more eggs. Furthermore, the highest mortality (90%) was observed under 10% S. platensis formulation and a few larvae reached adult stage; thus, no data on pupal period and reproductive traits was recorded for this formulation. These findings proved that S. platensis can be used as nutritional supplement as well as a toxic substance to manage C. cautella in date storage. However, future studies on this are needed to reach concrete conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W3209357610,"Retinal homeostasis relies on intricate coordination of cell death and survival in response to stress and damage. Signaling mechanisms that coordinate this process in the adult retina remain poorly understood. Here we identify Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling in Drosophila and its mammalian homologue Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFβ) superfamily, that includes TGFβ and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling arms, as central mediators of retinal neuronal death and tissue survival following acute damage. Using a Drosophila model for UV-induced retinal damage, we show that Dpp released from immune cells promotes tissue loss after UV-induced retinal damage. Interestingly, we find a dynamic response of retinal cells to this signal: in an early phase, Dpp-mediated stimulation of Saxophone/Smox signaling promotes apoptosis, while at a later stage, stimulation of the Thickveins/Mad axis promotes tissue repair and survival. This dual role is conserved in the mammalian retina through the TGFβ/BMP signaling, as supplementation of BMP4 or inhibition of TGFβ using small molecules promotes retinal cell survival, while inhibition of BMP negatively affects cell survival after light-induced photoreceptor damage and NMDA induced inner retinal neuronal damage. Our data identify key evolutionarily conserved mechanisms by which retinal homeostasis is maintained."
https://openalex.org/W3209563199,"Lack of precipitation and groundwater for irrigation limits crop production in semi-arid regions, such as the Southern High Plains (SHP). Advanced technologies, such as variable rate irrigation (VRI), can conserve water and improve water use efficiency for sustainable agriculture. However, the adoption of VRI is hindered by the lack of on-farm research focusing on the feasibility of VRI. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of irrigation rates on cotton yield as affected by soil physical properties and topography in the Southern High Plains. This study was conducted in two fields within a 194-ha commercially managed farm in Hale County, Texas, in 2017. An irrigation treatment with three rates was implemented in a randomized complete block design with two replications as separate blocks in each field. A total of 230 composite soil samples were collected from the farm in spring 2017 and analyzed for texture. Information on apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), elevation, and final yield were collected from the fields. A statistical model showed that the effect of irrigation rates on cotton yield depended on its interaction with soil physical properties and topography. For example, areas with slope >2% and sand content >50% had no significant response to higher irrigation rates. This model suggests that applying irrigation amounts based on the yield response can be a basis for VRI. This study provides valuable information for site-specific irrigation to optimize crop production in fields with significant variability in soil physical properties and topography."
https://openalex.org/W3209896641,"The safety and efficacy profile of bivalirudin has not been examined in a randomised controlled trial of patients undergoing rescue PCI.We conducted an open-label, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to compare bivalirudin with heparin ± glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) in patients undergoing rescue PCI.Between 2010-2015, we randomly assigned 83 patients undergoing rescue PCI to bivalirudin (n = 42) or heparin ± GPIs (n = 41). The primary safety endpoint was any ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) bleeding at 90 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was infarct size measured by peak troponin levels as a multiple of the local upper reference limit (Tn/URL). Secondary endpoints included periprocedural change in haemoglobin adjusted for red cells transfused, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) bleeding, ST-segment recovery and infarct size determined by the Selvester QRS score.The trial was terminated due to slow recruitment and futility after an interim analysis of 83 patients. The primary safety endpoint occurred in 6 (14%) patients in the bivalirudin group (4.8% GPIs) and 3 (7.3%) in the heparin ± GPIs group (54% GPIs) (risk ratio, 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-7.3, P = 0.48). Infarct size was similar between the two groups (mean Tn/URL, 730 [±675] for bivalirudin, versus 984 [±1585] for heparin ± GPIs, difference, 254, 95% CI, -283-794, P = 0.86). There was a smaller decrease in the periprocedural haemoglobin level with bivalirudin than heparin ± GPIs (-7.5% [±15] versus -14% [±17], difference, -6.5%, 95% CI, -0.83-14, P = 0.0067). The rate of complete (≥70%) ST-segment recovery post-PCI was higher in patients randomised to heparin ± GPIs compared with bivalirudin.Whether bivalirudin compared with heparin ± GPI reduces bleeding in rescue PCI could not be determined. Slow recruitment and futility in the context of lower-than-expected bleeding event rates led to the termination of this trial (ANZCTR.org.au, ACTRN12610000152022)."
https://openalex.org/W3210562533,"Streptococcus suis (S. suis) serotype 2 infection is a problem in the swine industry and responsible for most cases of human infection worldwide. Since current multiplex PCR cannot differentiate between serotypes 2 and 1/2, then serotype-specific antibodies (Abs) are required for serotype identification to confirm infection by serotype 2. This study aimed to generate Abs specific to S. suis serotype 2 by phage display from a human heavy chain variable domain (VH) antibody library. For biopanning, whole cells of S. suis serotype 2 were used as the target antigen. With increasing selection stringency, we could select the VH Abs that specifically bound to a S. suis serotype 2 surface antigen, which was identified as the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). From ELISA analysis, the specific phage clone 47B3 VH with the highest binding activity to S. suis serotype 2 was selected and shown to have no cross-reactivity with S. suis serotypes 1/2, 1, and 14 that shared a common epitope with serotype 2 and occasionally cause infections in human. Moreover, no cross-reactivity with other bacteria that can be found in septic blood specimens was also observed. Then, 47B3 VH was successfully expressed as soluble 47B3 VH in E. coli TG1. The soluble 47B3 VH crude extract was further tested for its binding ability in a dose-dependent ELISA assay. The results indicated that the activity of phage clone 47B3 was still retained even when the Ab occurred in the soluble form. A quellung reaction demonstrated that the soluble 47B3 VH Ab could show bioactivity by differentiation between S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2. Thus, it will be beneficial to use this VH Ab in the diagnosis of disease or discrimination of S. suis serotypes Furthermore, the results described here could motivate the use of phage display VH platform to produce serotyping antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3210848929,"Port implantations at the forearm are associated with an increased risk of relevant vein thrombosis. Therefore, with this study we sought to identify the responsible risk factors to improve technical quality of the method.This is a retrospective analysis of 313 patients with port implantation at the forearm in 2019. Then, exploratory statistics were conducted comprising Cox-Regression and Kaplan-Meier-Analyses.Mean age was 60 ± 14 years. 232 (74%) of the patients were female. No early infection was observed. 29 late infections and 57 cases of thrombosis occurred. In only 9% of the patients with thrombosis hospital admission was necessary for treatment. Median interval to the diagnosis of thrombosis was 23 days; inter-quartile-range: 16-75. Mean interval to elective port explantation was 227 ± 128 days. There was no effect of occurrence of thrombosis of the interventionalist, the assistance nor of several technical aspects. However, there was a significantly lower risk of thrombosis for primary implanted port system compared to replacement ports, Hazard-ratio: 0.34 [Confidence interval: 0.172, 0.674], p = 0.002. Age was a significant risk factor for late infections, Hazard-ratio: 3.35 [Confidence interval:1.84, 6.07], p < 0.0001.The main risk factor for adverse outcome after radiographically guided port implantation at the forearm is the type of the implanted port system. The reason for that might not be the material itself but the experience of a team with a certain port system. Age is a risk factor for late complications."
https://openalex.org/W3210917464,"Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Diagnosing TB in an early stage and initiating effective treatment is one of the best ways to reduce the burden of tuberculosis. Feasibility of Find cases Actively, Separate safely and Treat effectively (FAST) Strategy helps to improve the early diagnosis of tuberculosis cases among inpatient settings as well as out patient department patients and prevent TB transmission in hospital. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the FAST strategy, organizational factors, technical factors, barriers and enablers for the proper implementation of the FAST strategy in Nepal.A qualitative study was conducted from April 2019 to August 2019. Data was collected by using focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and client exit interviews. A retrospective research was conducted in different hospitals in Nepal where FAST strategy was implemented. The patients, health care workers, province, district, and National level stakeholders were interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to assess the feasibility as well as barriers and enablers of the FAST strategy.Study identified that the 'current setting' of implementation and service delivery arrangement at hospitals were not well arranged as per requirements. The research findings showed hospital ownership is crucial for mobilizing staff and proper space management inside hospitals. Study identified that unavailability of a separate room, limited capacity of GeneXpert machine, irregular supply of GeneXpert cartridge, and insufficient human resources for screening and counseling are the major barriers of FAST implementation in Nepal.FAST strategy is feasible to implement in healthcare settings in Nepal although the technical and organizational factors should be managed to ensure effective function of the strategy as per the approach. Hospital ownership is essential to mobilize health workers, improve client flow system and proper space management for FAST services."
