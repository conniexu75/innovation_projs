https://openalex.org/W2176094325,"Here I present the R package 'plantecophys', a toolkit to analyse and model leaf gas exchange data. Measurements of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration are routinely collected with portable gas exchange instruments, and analysed with a few key models. These models include the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model of leaf photosynthesis, the Ball-Berry models of stomatal conductance, and the coupled leaf gas exchange model which combines the supply and demand functions for CO2 in the leaf. The 'plantecophys' R package includes functions for fitting these models to measurements, as well as simulating from the fitted models to aid in interpreting experimental data. Here I describe the functionality and implementation of the new package, and give some examples of its use. I briefly describe functions for fitting the FvCB model of photosynthesis to measurements of photosynthesis-CO2 response curves ('A-Ci curves'), fitting Ball-Berry type models, modelling C3 photosynthesis with the coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model, modelling C4 photosynthesis, numerical solution of optimal stomatal behaviour, and energy balance calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. This open-source package makes technically challenging calculations easily accessible for many users and is freely available on CRAN."

While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect Hα emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet."
https://openalex.org/W2163739062,"Viral protein homeostasis depends entirely on the machinery of the infected cell. Accordingly, viruses can illuminate the interplay between cellular proteostasis components and their distinct substrates. Here, we define how the Hsp70 chaperone network mediates the dengue virus life cycle. Cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are required at distinct steps of the viral cycle, including entry, RNA replication, and virion biogenesis. Hsp70 function at each step is specified by nine distinct DNAJ cofactors. Of these, DnaJB11 relocalizes to virus-induced replication complexes to promote RNA synthesis, while DnaJB6 associates with capsid protein and facilitates virion biogenesis. Importantly, an allosteric Hsp70 inhibitor, JG40, potently blocks infection of different dengue serotypes in human primary blood cells without eliciting viral resistance or exerting toxicity to the host cells. JG40 also blocks replication of other medically-important flaviviruses including yellow fever, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Thus, targeting host Hsp70 subnetworks provides a path for broad-spectrum antivirals."
https://openalex.org/W2177228892,"The Asiatic fruit fly Drosophila suzukii has recently invaded Europe and North and South America, causing severe damage to fruit production systems. Although agronomic host plants of that fly are now well documented, little is known about the suitability of wild and ornamental hosts in its exotic area. In order to study the potential trophic niche of D. suzukii with relation to fruit characteristics, fleshy fruits from 67 plant species were sampled in natural and anthropic ecosystems (forests, hedgerows, grasslands, coastal areas, gardens and urban areas) of the north of France and submitted to experimental infestations. A set of fruit traits (structure, colour, shape, skin texture, diameter and weight, phenology) potentially interacting with oviposition choices and development success of D. suzukii was measured. Almost half of the tested plant species belonging to 17 plant families allowed the full development of D. suzukii. This suggests that the extreme polyphagy of the fly and the very large reservoir of hosts producing fruits all year round ensure temporal continuity in resource availability and contribute to the persistence and the exceptional invasion success of D. suzukii in natural habitats and neighbouring cultivated systems. Nevertheless, this very plastic trophic niche is not systematically beneficial to the fly. Some of the tested plants attractive to D. suzukii gravid females stimulate oviposition but do not allow full larval development. Planted near sensitive crops, these ""trap plants"" may attract and lure D. suzukii, therefore contributing to the control of the invasive fly."
https://openalex.org/W2181096351,"The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures. These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone, allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied."

https://openalex.org/W2175327158,"In activated B lymphocytes, AID initiates antibody variable (V) exon somatic hypermutation (SHM) for affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs) and IgH switch (S) region DNA breaks (DSBs) for class-switch recombination (CSR). To resolve long-standing questions, we have developed an in vivo assay to study AID targeting of passenger sequences replacing a V exon. First, we find AID targets SHM hotspots within V exon and S region passengers at similar frequencies and that the normal SHM process frequently generates deletions, indicating that SHM and CSR employ the same mechanism. Second, AID mutates targets in diverse non-Ig passengers in GC B cells at levels similar to those of V exons, definitively establishing the V exon location as ""privileged"" for SHM. Finally, Peyer's patch GC B cells generate a reservoir of V exons that are highly mutated before selection for affinity maturation. We discuss the implications of these findings for harnessing antibody diversification mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2175838118,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations at the dystrophin gene, is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. There is no cure for DMD and current therapeutic approaches to restore dystrophin expression are only partially effective. The absence of dystrophin in muscle results in dysregulation of signaling pathways, which could be targets for disease therapy and drug discovery. Previously, we identified two exceptional Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that are mildly affected, have functional muscle, and normal lifespan despite the complete absence of dystrophin. Now, our data on linkage, whole-genome sequencing, and transcriptome analyses of these dogs compared to severely affected GRMD and control animals reveals that increased expression of Jagged1 gene, a known regulator of the Notch signaling pathway, is a hallmark of the mild phenotype. Functional analyses demonstrate that Jagged1 overexpression ameliorates the dystrophic phenotype, suggesting that Jagged1 may represent a target for DMD therapy in a dystrophin-independent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2172567064,"Pathologists and radiologists spend years acquiring and refining their medically essential visual skills, so it is of considerable interest to understand how this process actually unfolds and what image features and properties are critical for accurate diagnostic performance. Key insights into human behavioral tasks can often be obtained by using appropriate animal models. We report here that pigeons (Columba livia)-which share many visual system properties with humans-can serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented. The birds proved to have a remarkable ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology after training with differential food reinforcement; even more importantly, the pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned when confronted with novel image sets. The birds' histological accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color as well as by degrees of image compression, but these impacts could be ameliorated with further training. Turning to radiology, the birds proved to be similarly capable of detecting cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammogram images. However, when given a different (and for humans quite difficult) task-namely, classification of suspicious mammographic densities (masses)-the pigeons proved to be capable only of image memorization and were unable to successfully generalize when shown novel examples. The birds' successes and difficulties suggest that pigeons are well-suited to help us better understand human medical image perception, and may also prove useful in performance assessment and development of medical imaging hardware, image processing, and image analysis tools."
https://openalex.org/W2227181960,"In LeuT, a prokaryotic homolog of neurotransmitter transporters, Na+ stabilizes outward-open conformational states. We examined how each of the two LeuT Na+ binding sites contributes to Na+-dependent closure of the cytoplasmic pathway using biochemical and biophysical assays of conformation. Mutating either of two residues that contribute to the Na2 site completely prevented cytoplasmic closure in response to Na+, suggesting that Na2 is essential for this conformational change, whereas Na1 mutants retained Na+ responsiveness. However, mutation of Na1 residues also influenced the Na+-dependent conformational change in ways that varied depending on the position mutated. Computational analyses suggest those mutants influence the ability of Na1 binding to hydrate the substrate pathway and perturb an interaction network leading to the extracellular gate. Overall, the results demonstrate that occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8, whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions. The results also provide evidence that N-terminal release and helix motions represent distinct steps in cytoplasmic pathway opening.

The results also provide evidence that N-terminal release and helix motions represent distinct steps in cytoplasmic pathway opening. Ion-coupled transporters utilize the energy stored in transmembrane ion gradients for the energetically uphill transport of solutes. The transporters appear to obey rules that govern when conformational changes are permitted to occur. Coupling between ion and substrate flux depends on the interconversion of inward- and outward-open transporter conformations preferentially when particular binding sites are occupied. For example, when ions and substrate are transported in the same direction (symport), coupling is maximized by only allowing these conformational changes to occur either when the transporter is empty or when it is loaded with both ions and substrate. If partially loaded transporter complexes were to undergo this conformational change, the resulting independent movement of ions or substrate would lead to a loss of coupling. Thus, occupation of ion and substrate sites is expected to influence the dynamics of conformational change in coupled transporters. Experimental evidence for the influence of binding events on transporter conformational change is sparse. However, in the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) 2The abbreviations used are: NSS, neurotransmitter:sodium symporter; smFRET, single molecule FRET; SERT, serotonin transporter; MD, molecular dynamics; DDM, dodecyl maltoside; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; SPA, scintillation proximity assay; TM, transmembrane helix; r.m.s.d., root-mean squared deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. family, several studies have shown that the Na+-coupled amino acid transporters Tyt1 and LeuT respond conformationally to the binding of Na+ and amino acids (1Quick M.

LeuT has proven to be a valuable structural model for understanding structure and function of NSS transporters for neurotransmitters such as glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Crystal structures of LeuT show substrate and two Na+ ions bound at sites near the center of the protein (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

Piscitelli C.L. Gouaux E. Unlocking the molecular secrets of sodium-coupled transporters.Nature. 2009; 459: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of LeuT have been obtained in outward-open, outward-occluded, and inward-open conformations (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that the openings of extracellular and cytoplasmic permeation pathways are coupled. First, addition of Na+ to LeuT closed the cytoplasmic pathway as measured using FRET (2Zhao Y. Terry D. Shi L. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A. Single-molecule dynamics of gating in a neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2010; 465: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and EPR (5Kazmier K. Sharma S. Quick M. Islam S.M. Roux B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. McHaourab H.S. Conformational dynamics of ligand-dependent alternating access in LeuT.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); EPR data also indicate that Na+ opened the extracellular pathway (3Claxton D.P. Quick M. Shi L. de Carvalho F.D. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. McHaourab H.S. Ion/substrate-dependent conformational dynamics of a bacterial homolog of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Conformational dynamics of ligand-dependent alternating access in LeuT.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second, an inward-open x-ray structure of LeuT was obtained by mutating the Na+ binding sites and a cytoplasmic gate residue and by binding a Fab fragment to the cytoplasmic surface (9Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These changes to the cytoplasmic side of the protein led to closure of the extracellular pathway even though neither the mutations nor the Fab fragment directly affected that pathway. Third, in the human serotonin transporter (SERT), the noncompetitive inhibitor ibogaine increased the accessibility of the cytoplasmic pathway and decreased it in the extracellular pathway (10Jacobs M.T. Zhang Y.-W. Campbell S.D. Rudnick G. Ibogaine, a noncompetitive inhibitor of serotonin transport, acts by stabilizing the cytoplasm-facing state of the transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29441-29447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Indeed, the expectation is that simultaneous opening of both pathways would lead to a transmembrane leak pathway that would be counter-productive for coupled transport; nevertheless, intermediates in which both pathways are at least partially closed, as in the occluded structures of LeuT (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) and MhsT (11Malinauskaite L.

Biol. 2014; 21: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), may facilitate coupling. In other words, although closure of one pathway does not necessarily result in opening of the other pathway, the reverse appears to be true, i.e. the opening of one pathway correlates with closure of the other pathway. In the absence of Na+ and amino acid substrate, NSS transporters equilibrate between inward- and outward-open conformations (2Zhao Y. Terry D. Shi L. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A.

Na+, in the absence of substrate amino acids, shifts the distribution between these states in favor of outward-facing (inward-closed) forms, an effect first observed with Tyt1 (1Quick M. Yano H.

However, it has not been experimentally established whether the roles of the two sites in LeuT in conformational change differ. Na+ is coordinated by the substrate carboxyl group in Na1 (Fig. 1A), and this interaction likely contributes to the strong Na+ dependence of substrate binding in LeuT (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K.

In contrast, Na+ binding to the Na1 site has been proposed, based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to modulate the transition between occluded and outward-open states (23Zhao C. Stolzenberg S.

Recent EPR studies with the structurally homologous Mhp1, however, were taken as evidence against the role of Na2 in conformational change (26Kazmier K. Sharma S. Islam S.M. Roux B. Mchaourab H.S.

Although a Na+ site corresponding to the Na2 site of LeuT was found in Mhp1, Na+ had little effect on the conformational equilibrium of this transporter, suggesting that Na2 in Mhp1, and by extension in LeuT, was not responsible for Na+-dependent conformational change. In neither transporter have the individual Na+ sites been directly tested for their involvement in conformational changes. To explore the roles of the two Na+ binding sites in the conformational dynamics of LeuT, we have monitored the conformation of LeuT Na1 and Na2 mutants in the absence of amino acid substrate. We measured accessibility of a cysteine inserted in the cytoplasmic pathway at the position corresponding to one of the endogenous cysteines of Tyt1 (1Quick M. Yano H. Goldberg N.R. Duan L.

In addition, we carried out MD simulations of wild type and mutant LeuT in outward-open conformations, also in the absence of substrate. Our results show that both the Na+ sites identified in LeuT crystal structures mediate the effect of Na+ on conformation, although the two sites have different modes of action. Site-directed mutagenesis of LeuT was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange protocol. LeuT Na+ site mutants were constructed in the background of the native LeuT, Y265C, and H7C-R86C sequences carrying an His8 tag at the C terminus (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. LeuT WT and mutants were expressed in C41 (DE3) E. coli cells as described previously (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

All binding experiments involving LeuT mutants were performed using the scintillation proximity assay described by Quick et al. (27Quick M. Javitch J.A. Monitoring the function of membrane transport proteins in detergent-solubilized form.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3603-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared from cells expressing LeuT mutants were thawed on ice, resuspended in solubilization buffer (200 mm NaCl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 20% glycerol, with 3 mg of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) per mg of membrane pellet, wet weight), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The solubilized membranes were bound to Cu2+ His tag YSi SPA beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) via the C-terminal His8 tag of the protein for 3 h at 4 °C. For each reaction, 400 μg of SPA beads were used per 40 μg of E. coli membrane protein. For leucine affinity measurements, the SPA beads were washed three times with 5 volumes of assay buffer (200 mm NaCl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm DDM) to remove non-specifically bound proteins. Aliquots of the bead suspension were transferred to the wells of an Isoplate-96TC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 6005078), and a range of cold leucine concentrations was added. The reactions were initiated by adding ∼1 μCi of [3H]leucine to a final concentration of 1 nm to 12 μm. For measuring the Na+ dependence of leucine binding, the Cu2+ YSi beads with bound protein were washed three times with 5 volumes of assay buffer free of Na+ (200 mm KCl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm DDM), and the beads were resuspended in the same buffer. Binding of leucine was assayed over a range of Na+ concentrations (0–400 mm), and the concentration of [3H]leucine used to initiate the reactions was, for each mutant being studied, 1/10th the measured KD value for leucine (at 200 mm Na+). Prior to counting, each plate was incubated for 30 min to allow the beads to settle. Radioactivity from each well was counted using a Wallac Microbeta plate reader using the SPA protocol. Nonspecific radioligand binding was assessed by parallel binding measurements in the presence of 400 mm imidazole. Membranes from C41 (DE3) E. coli cells expressing LeuT mutants (with Y265C) were suspended in Na+ or K+ buffer (200 mm NaCl or 200 mm KCl, respectively, containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. 40 μg of membranes were loaded per well of a 96-well EMD Millipore MultiScreen-HTS FB filter plate (MSFBN6B10) and washed 10 times with either Na+ or K+ buffer. Membranes were incubated with 0–1 mm 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) on the filter in either Na+ or K+ buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by washing the membranes with ice-cold buffer. These membranes are functionally unsealed toward MTSEA, which is permeant, and Na+. Rates of MTSEA reaction with Y265C in membranes prepared in KCl and assayed in NaCl were unchanged in the presence of 1 μm nigericin (data not shown). After washing, each filter was transferred to 600 μl of 200 mm NaCl containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 3 mm DDM, and 8 m urea and shaken for 30 min at 20 °C to solubilize the membranes and denature the proteins. The extract was added to nickel affinity resin (Ni-NTA-agarose, Qiagen) and labeled for 3 h at 20 °C with Alexa Fluor 750 C5 maleimide (Molecular probes, A30459) using a dye/protein molar ratio of about 20:1. Labeled LeuT was purified batchwise by washing with 40 mm imidazole and elution with 300 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a BisTris 4–12% gradient gel, and fluorescence was quantified using an Odyssey CLx Fluorescence Reader (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). LeuT from 3 liters of culture was purified by solubilizing with 0.2 g of DDM per g (wet weight) of membrane pellet in 200 mm NaCl containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, and 1 mm DDM, to a final DDM concentration of 40 mm. The supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 40 min was incubated with 2 ml (settled volume) of nickel affinity resin, Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), in solubilization buffer overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed in a column with solubilization buffer containing 40 mm imidazole; LeuT was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, and imidazole was removed by gel filtration. Purified LeuT was reconstituted into proteoliposomes at a protein/lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w) as described previously (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

https://openalex.org/W2177679116,"Glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) are the main regulators of the pituitary-thyroid and pituitary-gonadal axes. Selective interaction between GPHs and their cognate G protein-coupled receptors ensure specificity in GPH signaling. The mechanisms of how these hormones activate glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHRs) or how mutations and autoantibodies can alter receptor function were unclear. Based on the hypothesis that GPHRs contain an internal agonist, we systematically screened peptide libraries derived from the ectodomain for agonistic activity on the receptors. We show that a peptide (p10) derived from a conserved sequence in the C-terminal part of the extracellular N terminus can activate all GPHRs in vitro and in GPHR-expressing tissues. Inactivating mutations in this conserved region or in p10 can inhibit activation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor by autoantibodies. Our data suggest an activation mechanism where, upon extracellular ligand binding, this intramolecular agonist isomerizes and induces structural changes in the 7-transmembrane helix domain, triggering G protein activation. This mechanism can explain the pathophysiology of activating autoantibodies and several mutations causing endocrine dysfunctions such as Graves disease and hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Our findings highlight an evolutionarily conserved activation mechanism of GPHRs and will further promote the development of specific ligands useful to treat Graves disease and other dysfunctions of GPHRs."
https://openalex.org/W2177536801,"Color is an important determinant of pomegranate fruit quality and commercial value. To understand the genetic factors controlling color in pomegranate, chemical, molecular and genetic characterization of a ""white"" pomegranate was performed. This unique accession is lacking the typical pomegranate color rendered by anthocyanins in all tissues of the plant, including flowers, fruit (skin and arils) and leaves. Steady-state gene-expression analysis indicated that none of the analyzed ""white"" pomegranate tissues are able to synthesize mRNA corresponding to the PgLDOX gene (leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, also called ANS, anthocyanidin synthase), which is one of the central structural genes in the anthocyanin-biosynthesis pathway. HPLC analysis revealed that none of the ""white"" pomegranate tissues accumulate anthocyanins, whereas other flavonoids, corresponding to biochemical reactions upstream of LDOX, were present. Molecular analysis of the ""white"" pomegranate revealed the presence of an insertion and an SNP within the coding region of PgLDOX. It was found that the SNP does not change amino acid sequence and is not fully linked with the ""white"" phenotype in all pomegranate accessions from the collection. On the other hand, genotyping of pomegranate accessions from the collection and segregating populations for the ""white"" phenotype demonstrated its complete linkage with the insertion, inherited as a recessive single-gene trait. Taken together, the results indicate that the insertion in PgLDOX is responsible for the ""white"" anthocyanin-less phenotype. These data provide the first direct molecular, genetic and chemical evidence for the effect of a natural modification in the LDOX gene on color accumulation in a fruit-bearing woody perennial deciduous tree. This modification can be further utilized to elucidate the physiological role of anthocyanins in protecting the tree organs from harmful environmental conditions, such as temperature and UV radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2311675130,"Leishmania donovani is an intracellular parasite that infects professional phagocytes and causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The immune response during VL has been extensively studied in the context of T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 responses. Immunity against this parasite is dependent on IFN-γ production and subsequent macrophage activation, and the Th2 response promotes granuloma formation. The cytokine IL-17A is associated with neutrophilic inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils during experimental VL results in enhanced parasitic loads. Furthermore, although patients resistant to VL showed enhanced levels of IL-17A in circulation, little is known about the role of IL-17A during VL infection. Here, we used IL-17A-deficient mice and IL-17A reporter mice to address the role of IL-17A during VL. IL-17A(-/-) mice were highly resistant to VL infection, showing decreased parasites in the liver and spleen. This unexpected phenotype was associated with enhanced IFN-γ production by T cells and decreased accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes, resulting in reduced number of granulomas. We also found γδ T and Th17 cells as the main IL-17A(+) cells during VL infection. Our data reveal an unexpected role of IL-17A rendering susceptibility against L. donovani by regulating the IFN-γ response and promoting detrimental inflammation."

The recent identification of de novo production of adipocytes from bone marrow progenitor-derived cells in mice challenges this paradigm and indicates an alternative lineage specification that adipocytes exist. We hypothesized that alternative lineage specification of white adipocytes is also present in human adipose tissue. Bone marrow from transgenic mice in which luciferase expression is governed by the adipocyte-restricted adiponectin gene promoter was adoptively transferred to wild-type recipient mice. Light emission was quantitated in recipients by in vivo imaging and direct enzyme assay. Adipocytes were also obtained from human recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. DNA was isolated, and microsatellite polymorphisms were exploited to quantify donor/recipient chimerism. Luciferase emission was detected from major fat depots of transplanted mice. No light emission was observed from intestines, liver, or lungs. Up to 35% of adipocytes in humans were generated from donor marrow cells in the absence of cell fusion. Nontransplanted mice and stromal-vascular fraction samples were used as negative and positive controls for the mouse and human experiments, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2256679287,"Background Major depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and increased mortality following myocardial infarction. However, biomarkers of depression and increased cardiovascular risk are still missing. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate, whether nitric-oxide (NO) related factors for endothelial dysfunction, such as global arginine bioavailability, arginase activity, L-arginine/ADMA ratio and the arginine metabolites asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) might be biomarkers for depression-induced cardiovascular risk. Methods In 71 in-patients with major depression and 48 healthy controls the Global Arginine Bioavailability Ratio (GABR), arginase activity (arginine/ornithine ratio), the L-arginine/ADMA ratio, ADMA, and SDMA were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Psychiatric and laboratory assessments were obtained at baseline at the time of in-patient admittance and at the time of hospital discharge. Results The ADMA concentrations in patients with major depression were significantly elevated and the SDMA concentrations were significantly decreased in comparison with the healthy controls. Even after a first improvement of depression, ADMA and SDMA levels remained nearly unchanged. In addition, after a first improvement of depression at the time of hospital discharge, a significant decrease in arginase activity, an increased L-arginine/ADMA ratio and a trend for increased global arginine bioavailability were observed. Conclusions Our study results are evidence that in patients with major depression ADMA and SDMA might be biomarkers to indicate an increased cardiovascular threat due to depression-triggered NO reduction. GABR, the L-arginine/ADMA ratio and arginase activity might be indicators of therapy success and increased NO production after remission."
https://openalex.org/W2178048481,"In recent years, an increasing number of surveys have definitively confirmed the seasonal presence of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in highly productive regions of the Mediterranean Sea. Despite this, very little is yet known about the routes that the species seasonally follows within the Mediterranean basin and, particularly, in the Ionian area. The present study assesses for the first time fin whale acoustic presence offshore Eastern Sicily (Ionian Sea), throughout the processing of about 10 months of continuous acoustic monitoring. The recording of fin whale vocalizations was made possible by the cabled deep-sea multidisciplinary observatory, ""NEMO-SN1"", deployed 25 km off the Catania harbor at a depth of about 2,100 meters. NEMO-SN1 is an operational node of the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water-column Observatory (EMSO) Research Infrastructure. The observatory was equipped with a low-frequency hydrophone (bandwidth: 0.05 Hz-1 kHz, sampling rate: 2 kHz) which continuously acquired data from July 2012 to May 2013. About 7,200 hours of acoustic data were analyzed by means of spectrogram display. Calls with the typical structure and patterns associated to the Mediterranean fin whale population were identified and monitored in the area for the first time. Furthermore, a background noise analysis within the fin whale communication frequency band (17.9-22.5 Hz) was conducted to investigate possible detection-masking effects. The study confirms the hypothesis that fin whales are present in the Ionian Sea throughout all seasons, with peaks in call detection rate during spring and summer months. The analysis also demonstrates that calls were more frequently detected in low background noise conditions. Further analysis will be performed to understand whether observed levels of noise limit the acoustic detection of the fin whales vocalizations, or whether the animals vocalize less in the presence of high background noise."

Since few data are available concerning the beneficial properties of black tea and its theaflavin derivatives against periodontal disease, the objective of this study was to investigate their antibacterial activity as well as their ability to modulate interleukin-8 and human β-defensin (hBD) secretion in oral epithelial cells. Among the periodontopathogenic bacteria tested, Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to be highly susceptible to the black tea extract and theaflavins. Moreover, our data indicated that the black tea extract, theaflavin and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate can potentiate the antibacterial effect of metronidazole and tetracycline against P. gingivalis. Using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated oral epithelial cells, the black tea extract (100 μg/ml), as well as theaflavin and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (50 μg/ml) reduced interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion by 85%, 79%, and 86%, respectively, thus suggesting an anti-inflammatory property. The ability of the black tea extract and its theaflavin derivatives to induce the secretion of the antimicrobial peptides hBD-1, hBD-2 and hBD-4 by oral epithelial cells was then evaluated. Our results showed that the black tea extract as well as theaflavin-3,3'-digallate were able to increase the secretion of the three hBDs. In conclusion, the ability of a black tea extract and theaflavins to exert antibacterial activity against major periodontopathogens, to attenuate the secretion of IL-8, and to induce hBD secretion in oral epithelial cells suggest that these components may have a beneficial effect against periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2242114700,"Large-scale coral reef restoration is needed to help recover structure and function of degraded coral reef ecosystems and mitigate continued coral declines. In situ coral propagation and reef restoration efforts have scaled up significantly in past decades, particularly for the threatened Caribbean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, but little is known about the role that native competitors and predators, such as farming damselfishes, have on the success of restoration. Steep declines in A. cervicornis abundance may have concentrated the negative impacts of damselfish algal farming on a much lower number of coral prey/colonies, thus creating a significant threat to the persistence and recovery of depleted coral populations. This is the first study to document the prevalence of resident damselfishes and negative effects of algal lawns on A. cervicornis along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). Impacts of damselfish lawns on A. cervicornis colonies were more prevalent (21.6% of colonies) than those of other sources of mortality (i.e., disease (1.6%), algal/sponge overgrowth (5.6%), and corallivore predation (7.9%)), and damselfish activities caused the highest levels of tissue mortality (34.6%) among all coral stressors evaluated. The probability of damselfish occupation increased as coral colony size and complexity increased and coral growth rates were significantly lower in colonies with damselfish lawns (15.4 vs. 29.6 cm per year). Reduced growth and mortality of existing A. cervicornis populations may have a significant effect on population dynamics by potentially reducing important genetic diversity and the reproductive potential of depleted populations. On a positive note, however, the presence of resident damselfishes decreased predation by other corallivores, such as Coralliophila and Hermodice, and may offset some negative impacts caused by algal farming. While most negative impacts of damselfishes identified in this study affected large individual colonies and <50% of the A. cervicornis population along the FRT, the remaining wild staghorn population, along with the rapidly increasing restored populations, continue to fulfill important functional roles on coral reefs by providing essential habitat and refuge to other reef organisms. Although the effects of damselfish predation are, and will continue to be, pervasive, successful restoration efforts and strategic coral transplantation designs may help overcome damselfish damage by rapidly increasing A. cervicornis cover and abundance while also providing important information to educate future conservation and management decisions."

https://openalex.org/W2174022426,"Purpose Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in children and diagnostic polysomnography is costly and not readily available in all areas. We developed a pediatric modification of a commonly used adult clinical prediction tool for stratifying the risk of OSA and the need for polysomnography. Methods A total of 312 children (age 9–17 years) from phase 2 of the Tucson Children’s Assessment of Sleep Apnea cohort study, with complete anthropomorphic data, parent questionnaires, and home polysomnograms were included. An adolescent modification of STOP-Bang (teen STOP-Bang) was developed and included snoring, tired, observed apnea, blood pressure ≥ 95th percentile, BMI > 95th percentile, academic problems, neck circumference >95th percentile for age, and male gender. An apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 1.5 events/hour was considered diagnostic of OSA. Results Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves for parent-reported STOP-Bang scores were generated for teenage and pre-teen children. A STOP-Bang score of < 3 in teenagers was associated with a negative predictive value of 0.96. ROC curves were also generated based upon child-reported sexual maturity rating (SMR; n = 291). The ability of teen STOP-Bang to discriminate the presence or absence of OSA as measured by the AUC for children with SMR ≥ 4 (0.83; 95%CI 0.71–0.95) was better than children with SMR < 4 (0.63; 95%CI 0.46–0.81; p = 0.048). Conclusions In community dwelling adolescents, teen STOP-Bang may be useful in stratifying the risk of OSA."

Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are regulators of inflammatory genes, but their role in sex-specific responses is unclear. Our goal was to evaluate whether GR differentially regulates inflammatory gene expression in male and female mouse liver. Twenty-five percent of the 251 genes assayed by nanostring analysis were influenced by sex. Of these baseline sexually dimorphic inflammatory genes, 82% was expressed higher in female liver. Pathway analyses defined pattern-recognition receptors as the most sexually dimorphic pathway. We next exposed male and female mice to the proinflammatory stimulus LPS. Female mice had 177 genes regulated by treatment with LPS, whereas males had 149, with only 66% of LPS-regulated genes common between the sexes. To determine the contribution of GR to sexually dimorphic inflammatory genes we performed nanostring analysis on liver-specific GR knockout (LGRKO) mice in the presence or absence of LPS. Comparing LGRKO to GRflox/flox revealed that 36 genes required GR for sexually dimorphic expression, whereas 24 genes became sexually dimorphic in LGRKO. Fifteen percent of LPS-regulated genes in GRflox/flox were not regulated in male and female LGRKO mice treated with LPS. Thus, GR action is influenced by sex to regulate inflammatory gene expression.—Quinn, M. A., Cidlowski, J. A.

Using atomic force microscopy, ellipsometry, surface-enhanced IR spectroscopy, and protein film voltammetry, we explore enzyme coverage, integrity, and activity, thereby probing both structure and catalytic H2 conversion of the enzyme. Electrocatalytic efficiencies can be correlated with the mode of protein adsorption on the electrode as estimated theoretically by molecular dynamics simulations.

After more than 10,000 generations of coexistence, however, the Cit-lineage went extinct; cells with the Cit-phenotype dropped to levels below detection, and the Cit-clade could not be detected by molecular assays based on its unique genotype. We hypothesized that this extinction was a deterministic outcome of evolutionary change within the population, specifically the appearance of a more-fit Cit+ ecotype that competitively excluded the Cit-ecotype. We tested this hypothesis by re-evolving the population from a frozen population sample taken within 500 generations of the extinction and from another sample taken several thousand generations earlier, in each case for 500 generations and with 20-fold replication. To our surprise, the Cit-type did not go extinct in any of these replays, and Cit-cells also persisted in a single replicate that was propagated for 2,500 generations. Even more unexpectedly, we showed that the Cit-ecotype could reinvade the Cit+ population after its extinction. Taken together, these results indicate that the extinction of the Cit-ecotype was not a deterministic outcome driven by competitive exclusion by the Cit+ ecotype. The extinction also cannot be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, as the population size of the Cit-ecotype should have been many thousands of cells even during the daily transfer events. Instead, we infer that the extinction must have been caused by a rare chance event in which some aspect of the experimental conditions was inadvertently perturbed."

https://openalex.org/W2176328487,"Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) are involved in the acylation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. Palm kernel oil, extracted from Elaeis guineensis (oil palm) seeds, has a high content of medium-chain fatty acids mainly lauric acid (C12:0). A putative E. guineensis diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene (EgDGAT1-1) is expressed at the onset of lauric acid accumulation in the seed endosperm suggesting that it is a determinant of medium-chain triacylglycerol storage. To test this hypothesis, we thoroughly characterized EgDGAT1-1 activity through functional complementation of a Yarrowia lipolytica mutant strain devoid of neutral lipids. EgDGAT1-1 expression is sufficient to restore triacylglycerol accumulation in neosynthesized lipid droplets. A comparative functional study with Arabidopsis thaliana DGAT1 highlighted contrasting substrate specificities when the recombinant yeast was cultured in lauric acid supplemented medium. The EgDGAT1-1 expressing strain preferentially accumulated medium-chain triacylglycerols whereas AtDGAT1 expression induced long-chain triacylglycerol storage in Y. lipolytica. EgDGAT1-1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum where TAG biosynthesis takes place. Reestablishing neutral lipid accumulation in the Y. lipolytica mutant strain did not induce major reorganization of the yeast microsomal proteome. Overall, our findings demonstrate that EgDGAT1-1 is an endoplasmic reticulum DGAT with preference for medium-chain fatty acid substrates, in line with its physiological role in palm kernel. The characterized EgDGAT1-1 could be used to promote medium-chain triacylglycerol accumulation in microbial-produced oil for industrial chemicals and cosmetics."
https://openalex.org/W2178859693,"The Central African Republic is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries, suffering from chronic poverty, violent conflicts and weak disaster resilience. In collaboration with Doctors without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), this study presents a novel approach to collect information about socio-economic vulnerabilities related to malnutrition, access to resources and coping capacities. The first technical test was carried out in the North of the country (sub-prefecture Kabo) in May 2015. All activities were aimed at the investigation of technical feasibility, not at operational data collection, which requires a random sampling strategy. At the core of the study is an open-source Android application named SATIDA COLLECT that facilitates rapid and simple data collection. All assessments were carried out by local MSF staff after they had been trained for one day. Once a mobile network is available, all assessments can easily be uploaded to a database for further processing and trend analysis via MSF in-house software. On one hand, regularly updated food security assessments can complement traditional large-scale surveys, whose completion can take up to eight months. Ideally, this leads to a gain in time for disaster logistics. On the other hand, recording the location of every assessment via the smart phones’ GPS receiver helps to analyze and display the coupling between drought risk and impacts over many years. Although the current situation in the Central African Republic is mostly related to violent conflict it is necessary to consider information about drought risk, because climatic shocks can further disrupt the already vulnerable system. SATIDA COLLECT can easily be adapted to local conditions or other applications, such as the evaluation of vaccination campaigns. Most importantly, it facilitates the standardized collection of information without pen and paper, as well as straightforward sharing of collected data with the MSF headquarters or other aid organizations."

The fingers of the volunteers were screened for the presence of staphylococci, and the collected isolates were tested for resistance to fusidic acid. A total of 34 fusidic acid resistant staphylococcal strains (all were coagulase-negative) were isolated from 22 individuals (22/59, 37.3%). Examination of the resistance genes revealed that acquired fusB or fusC was present in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. urealyticus, Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis, Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Resistance islands (RIs) carrying fusB were found in S. epidermidis and S. capitis subsp. urealyticus, while staphylococcal chromosome cassette (SCC)-related structures harboring fusC were found in S. hominis subsp. hominis. Genotypic analysis of S. epidermidis and S. hominis subsp. hominis indicated that the fus elements were disseminated in diverse genetic strain backgrounds. The fusC elements in S. hominis subsp. hominis strains were highly homologous to SCCfusC in the epidemic sequence type (ST) 239/SCCmecIII methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or the pseudo SCCmec in ST779 MRSA. The presence of acquired fusidic acid resistance genes and their genetic environment in commensal staphylococci suggested that the skin commensal staphylococci may act as reservoir for fusidic acid resistance genes."

The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (JCCP) is the primary trials journal amongst American Psychological Association (APA) journals. The objectives of this study were to review RCTs recently published in JCCP to evaluate (1) adequacy of primary outcome analysis definitions; (2) registration status; and, (3) among registered trials, adequacy of outcome registrations. Additionally, we compared results from JCCP to findings from a recent study of top psychosomatic and behavioral medicine journals.Eligible RCTs were published in JCCP in 2013-2014. For each RCT, two investigators independently extracted data on (1) adequacy of outcome analysis definitions in the published report, (2) whether the RCT was registered prior to enrolling patients, and (3) adequacy of outcome registration.Of 70 RCTs reviewed, 12 (17.1%) adequately defined primary or secondary outcome analyses, whereas 58 (82.3%) had multiple primary outcome analyses without statistical adjustment or undefined outcome analyses. There were 39 (55.7%) registered trials. Only two trials registered prior to patient enrollment with a single primary outcome variable and time point of assessment. However, in one of the two trials, registered and published outcomes were discrepant. No studies were adequately registered as per Standard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Interventional Trials guidelines. Compared to psychosomatic and behavioral medicine journals, the proportion of published trials with adequate outcome analysis declarations was significantly lower in JCCP (17.1% versus 32.9%; p = 0.029). The proportion of registered trials in JCCP (55.7%) was comparable to behavioral medicine journals (52.6%; p = 0.709).The quality of published outcome analysis definitions and trial registrations in JCCP is suboptimal. Greater attention to proper trial registration and outcome analysis definition in published reports is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2178015804,"High-resolution metabolomics has created opportunity to integrate nutrition and metabolism into genetic studies to improve understanding of the diverse radiation of primate species. At present, however, there is very little information to help guide experimental design for study of wild populations. In a previous non-targeted metabolomics study of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), Rhesus macaques, humans, and four non-primate mammalian species, we found that essential amino acids (AA) and other central metabolites had interspecies variation similar to intraspecies variation while non-essential AA, environmental chemicals and catabolic waste products had greater interspecies variation. The present study was designed to test whether 55 plasma metabolites, including both nutritionally essential and non-essential metabolites and catabolic products, differ in concentration in common marmosets and humans. Significant differences were present for more than half of the metabolites analyzed and included AA, vitamins and central lipid metabolites, as well as for catabolic products of AA, nucleotides, energy metabolism and heme. Three environmental chemicals were present at low nanomolar concentrations but did not differ between species. Sex and age differences in marmosets were present for AA and nucleotide metabolism and warrant additional study. Overall, the results suggest that quantitative, targeted metabolomics can provide a useful complement to non-targeted metabolomics for studies of diet and environment interactions in primate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2266270518,"Insulin-stimulated translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicles (GSVs), the specialized intracellular compartments within mature adipocytes, to the plasma membrane (PM) is a fundamental cellular process for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Using 2 independent adipocyte cell line models, human primary Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell lines, we demonstrate that the endosome-associated protein-sorting complex retromer colocalizes with GLUT4 on the GSVs by confocal microscopy in mature adipocytes. By use of both confocal microscopy and differential ultracentrifugation techniques, retromer is redistributed to the PM of mature adipocytes upon insulin stimulation. Furthermore, stable knockdown of the retromer subunit-vacuolar protein-sorting 35, or the retromer-associated protein sorting nexin 27, by lentivirus-delivered small hairpin RNA impaired the adipogenesis process when compared to nonsilence control. The knockdown of retromer decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ expression during differentiation, generating adipocytes with decreased levels of GSVs, lipid droplet accumulation, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a role for retromer in the GSV formation and adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2173675098,"Osedax, commonly known as bone-eating worms, are unusual marine annelids belonging to Siboglinidae and represent a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation to a specialized habitat, namely sunken vertebrate bones. Usually, females of these animals live anchored inside bone owing to a ramified root system from an ovisac, and obtain nutrition via symbiosis with Oceanospirillales gamma-proteobacteria. Since their discovery, 26 Osedax operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been reported from a wide bathymetric range in the Pacific, the North Atlantic, and the Southern Ocean. Using experimentally deployed and naturally occurring bones we report here the presence of Osedax deceptionensis at very shallow-waters in Deception Island (type locality; Antarctica) and at moderate depths near South Georgia Island (Subantarctic). We present molecular evidence in a new phylogenetic analysis based on five concatenated genes (28S rDNA, Histone H3, 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA, and cytochrome c oxidase I-COI-), using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference, supporting the placement of O. deceptionensis as a separate lineage (Clade VI) although its position still remains uncertain. This phylogenetic analysis includes a new unnamed species (O. 'mediterranea') recently discovered in the shallow-water Mediterranean Sea belonging to Osedax Clade I. A timeframe of the diversification of Osedax inferred using a Bayesian framework further suggests that Osedax diverged from other siboglinids during the Middle Cretaceous (ca. 108 Ma) and also indicates that the most recent common ancestor of Osedax extant lineages dates to the Late Cretaceous (ca. 74.8 Ma) concomitantly with large marine reptiles and teleost fishes. We also provide a phylogenetic framework that assigns newly-sequenced Osedax endosymbionts of O. deceptionensis and O. 'mediterranea' to ribospecies Rs1. Molecular analysis for O. deceptionensis also includes a COI-based haplotype network indicating that individuals from Deception Island and the South Georgia Island (ca. 1,600 km apart) are clearly the same species, confirming the well-developed dispersal capabilities reported in other congeneric taxa. In addition, we include a complete description of living features and morphological characters (including scanning and transmission electron microscopy) of O. deceptionensis, a species originally described from a single mature female, and compare it to information available for other congeneric OTUs."

https://openalex.org/W2175018351,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an opportunistic fungal infection in patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematological malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or other forms of immunosuppression. In this group, Aspergillus infections account for the majority of deaths due to mold pathogens. Although early detection is associated with improved outcomes, current diagnostic regimens lack sensitivity and specificity. Patients undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and lung transplantation were enrolled in a multi-site prospective observational trial. Proven and probable IPA cases and matched controls were subjected to discovery proteomics analyses using a biofluid analysis platform, fractionating plasma into reproducible protein and peptide pools. From 556 spots identified by 2D gel electrophoresis, 66 differentially expressed post-translationally modified plasma proteins were identified in the leukemic subgroup only. This protein group was rich in complement components, acute-phase reactants and coagulation factors. Low molecular weight peptides corresponding to abundant plasma proteins were identified. A candidate marker panel of host response (9 plasma proteins, 4 peptides), fungal polysaccharides (galactomannan), and cell wall components (β-D glucan) were selected by statistical filtering for patients with leukemia as a primary underlying diagnosis. Quantitative measurements were developed to qualify the differential expression of the candidate host response proteins using selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assays, and then applied to a separate cohort of 57 patients with leukemia. In this verification cohort, a machine learning ensemble-based algorithm, generalized pathseeker (GPS) produced a greater case classification accuracy than galactomannan (GM) or host proteins alone. In conclusion, Integration of host response proteins with GM improves the diagnostic detection of probable IPA in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancy. Upon further validation, early detection of probable IPA in leukemia treatment will provide opportunities for earlier interventions and interventional clinical trials."

We defined whether a deficiency of Arrb2 affects overall survival, liver injury, and Arrb2-mediated signaling pathways using the BDL mouse as an established model of extrahepatic cholestasis. We found that deficiency of Arrb2 significantly enhances animal survival and reduced hepatic fibrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis. The protective effect of deficiency of Arrb2 was associated with increased phospho-Akt and inactivation of GSK3β, p38 MAPK, and Fas signaling pathways and inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that Arrb2 plays a critical role in obstructive cholestasis and significantly contributes to cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis.

Wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at East Tennessee State University, a facility accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). All procedures were approved by the East Tennessee State University Committee on Animal Care. Male mice aged 6–8 weeks were used in all experiments. BDL was performed as described in our previous study (1LeSage G.D. Alvaro D. Glaser S. Francis H. Marucci L. Roskams T. Phinizy J.L. Marzioni M. Benedetti A. Taffetani S. Barbaro B. Fava G. Ueno Y.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 1–5% isoflurane driven by 100% oxygen flow with the use of EZ-Anesthesia system. Under deep anesthesia, the peritoneal cavity was opened and the common bile duct was double-ligated and cut between the ligatures (BDL mouse). Control animals underwent a sham operation that consisted of exposure but not ligation of the common bile duct. After the sham operation or BDL at different times, mice were euthanized to obtain livers. The frozen liver sections from wild type and Arrb2 KO mice were harvested for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in cells was determined by the TUNEL assay using an in situ apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of apoptotic cells was counted in randomly selected fields to calculate the ratio of apoptotic cells and total 500 cells. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was performed to assess general histology. Sirius red was used to evaluate liver fibrosis. Negative control sections were incubated with non-immune immunoglobulin under the same conditions. 3–3′-Diaminobenzidine chromogen solution was used for visualization by light microscopy. The tissue sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 min. Three slides from each block were evaluated with bright field microscopy. Arrb2 full-length GFP vector and control GFP vector were kindly provided by Dr. Gang Pei, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China. WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Arrb2 KO MEFs were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). MEFs were seeded in culture plates 24 h before transfection. All transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (7Li H. Hu D. Fan H. Zhang Y. LeSage G.D. Caudle Y. Stuart C.

To generate Arrb2 with EGFP fusion expression constructs, the N terminus of the EGFP(1–180) and the C terminus of the Arrb2(188–418) DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using pIRES2-EGFP vector and full-length Arrb2 cDNA construct as template and then cloned into the pBluescript SK vector. After sequence confirmation, the EGFP-Arrb2 fragment was first subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector through HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, and the N- and C-terminal fragments of Arrb2 were subcloned into the EGFP fragment containing pCDNA3 vector by BamHI and EcoRI sites. Expression constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Briefly, protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid kit (7Li H. Hu D. Fan H. Zhang Y. LeSage G.D. Caudle Y. Stuart C. Liu Z.

Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature in a blocking solution composed of 5% skim milk powder dissolved in 1×TBS for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the blocking solution containing first antibody. The signals were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were quantified by scanning densitometry and computer-assisted image analysis. The primary antibodies used in this study were Akt, GSK3β, p38, ERK1/2, phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK3β, phospho-p38, phospho-ERK1/2, and Arrb2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Antibody against GAPDH was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Arrb2 KO MEFs were transfected with Arrb2 full-length GFP vector, C- or N-terminal truncated Arrb2 GFP vectors, or FLAG-Akt vector for 16 h. The cells were treated with serum deprivation (SD) for 6 h. Co-IP was performed with Pierce® coimmunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) as described by us (7Li H. Hu D. Fan H. Zhang Y. LeSage G.D. Caudle Y.

Anti-GFP antibody was immobilized using AminoLink Plus coupling resin. The antibody-coupled resin was incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4 °C. Protein complexes bound to the antibody were then eluted with elution buffer and analyzed by Western blot as described before. All data were represented as means ± S.E. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni tests to determine where differences existed among the groups. Differences were considered statistically significant for values of p < 0.05. We investigated the role of the multifunctional protein Arrb2 (7Li H. Hu D. Fan H. Zhang Y. LeSage G.D. Caudle Y.

As shown in Fig. 1A, BDL-induced mortality was significantly decreased in Arrb2 KO mice compared with WT mice. There were no deaths in sham control mice. BDL caused a significant reduction in the body weight of the WT mice compared with the Arrb2 KO mice (data not shown). The expression of Arrb2 in the liver was significantly enhanced after BDL as detected by Western blot (Fig. 1B). To evaluate whether Arrb2 plays a role in BDL-induced hepatic apoptosis, we subjected WT mice and Arrb2 KO mice to BDL for different time periods. The percentage of liver area occupied with bile infarcts, which correlates with the degree of liver apoptosis (25Kahraman A. Barreyro F.J. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Mott J.L. Akazawa Y. Masuoka H.C. Howe C.L. Gores G.J. TRAIL mediates liver injury by the innate immune system in the bile duct-ligated mouse.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was determined by H&E staining. We observed that BDL-induced areas of bile infarcts in WT mice appeared more prominent compared with Arrb2 KO mice, and the areas increased in size over time (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, morphometric evaluation of the percentage of liver with bile infarcts showed that deficiency of Arrb2 significantly reduces BDL-induced bile infarct area compared with WT mice (Fig. 2B). The percentage of liver area occupied with trichrome-stained areas was less in Arrb2 KO mice compared with WT mice following BDL suggesting that the early fibrousness in the BDL model is reduced by Arrb2 deficiency (Fig. 2, C and D). Growing evidence indicates that Arrb2 plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis (6Wang P. Gao H. Ni Y. Wang B. Wu Y. Ji L. Qin L. Ma L.

We therefore determined whether Arrb2 is involved in BDL-mediated apoptosis. We examined hepatocyte apoptosis in WT and Arrb2 KO mice following BDL using the TUNEL assay. Fig. 2E shows that a significant number of cells in the liver of WT mice were undergoing apoptosis, whereas only a few apoptotic cells were detected in the liver of Arrb2 KO mice following BDL. Recent evidence has shown that Arrbs modulate Akt signaling (11Povsic T.J. Kohout T.A.

Hannun Y.A. Proia R.L. Brenner D.A. Roles of AKT and sphingosine kinase in the antiapoptotic effects of bile duct ligation in mouse liver.Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Arrb2 regulates the activation of Akt signaling in the liver following BDL, we determined the levels of phospho-Akt. As shown in Fig. 3A, the following BDL levels of phospho-Akt in the liver were significantly increased in Arrb2 KO compared WT mice. GSK3β is an important downstream target from Akt (21Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Toll-like receptor-mediated cytokine production is differentially regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK3β on the inactivating residue serine 9 by Akt results in GSK3β inactivation (21Martin M. Rehani K.

The levels of phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) in the liver were significantly higher in the Arrb2 KO than in the WT mice following BDL (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that Arrb2 deficiency enhances BDL activation of Akt and decreases (by increased phosphorylation) GSK3β activity. Another survival pathway, MAPK/ERK1/2 (29Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y.

To determine whether the observed decreased GSK3β activity due to Arrb2 deficiency is responsible for decreased liver injury following BDL, we administered in vivo the pharmacological GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 that has been widely used to study the role of GSK3β both in vitro and in vivo (28Hu X. Paik P.K. Chen J. Yarilina A. Kockeritz L. Lu T.T. Woodgett J.R. Ivashkiv L.B.

Cardiol. 2007; 42: 653-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We observed that inhibition of GSK3β with SB216763 resulted in significant decreases in hepatic apoptosis in WT mice in response to BDL. However, inhibition of GSK3β did not alter hepatic apoptosis in Arrb2 KO mice following BDL (Fig. 3D), a finding consistent with GSK3β participating in series but not in parallel to Arrb2 on the inhibition of hepatic apoptosis. Recently, it has been reported that GSK3β modulates p38 MAPK signaling (31Manson M.M. Cancer prevention–the potential for diet to modulate molecular signalling.Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 induces hepatocyte apoptosis in models of cholestasis (33DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. β-Arrestins and cell signaling.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). We evaluated whether GSK3β plays a role in BDL-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Both BDL and sham-treated WT mice and Arrb2 KO mice were administered GSK3β inhibitor SB216763. BDL significantly increased the levels of phospho-p38 MAPK in WT mice but did not alter the levels of phospho-p38 MAPK in Arrb2 KO mice compared with the sham control mice (Fig. 4). The ratio of phospho-p38 to total p38 was 3-fold higher in sham Arrb2 KO mice compared with WT sham mice. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK3β in WT mice decreased the levels of phospho-p38 MAPK induced by BDL. However, inhibition of GSK3β in Arrb2 KO mice did not change the levels of phospho-p38 MAPK perhaps due to GSK3β already being completely inactivated (phosphorylated) in Arrb2 KO mice (Fig. 4). These data suggest that Arrb2 plays a role in GSK3β-mediated activation of p38 MAPK following BDL. Previous studies have shown Arrb2 directly binds to Akt and alters Akt function, either up-regulating or down-regulating, depending on the signaling source. Previous studies have not disclosed the site where Arrb2 binds to Akt (33DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. β-Arrestins and cell signaling.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). We created both full-length and N- or C-terminal Arrb2 expression vectors, and we determined whether these will alter the activation of Akt. MEF cells lacking Arrb2 were serum-deprived (SD) for 6 h to decrease Akt, and then Arrb2 expression was induced by the above expression vectors (Fig. 5A). There was similar transfection of Arrb2 in all transfection studies (data not shown). SD deceased p-Akt but not total Akt in cells expressing full-length and N-terminal Arrb2 expression vectors but did not alter p-Akt in cells expressing empty or C-terminal Arrb2 expression vectors (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the N terminus but not the C terminus of Arrb2 is responsible for dephosphorylation of Akt. The potential interaction between the full-length or N or C terminus of Arrb2 and Akt was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. Arrb2 KO MEF cells were transfected with Arrb2 full-length GFP or FLAG-tagged Akt plasmids following SD for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, full-length Arrb2 coimmunoprecipitated with Akt. We then transfected Arrb2 KO MEF cells with GFP-tagged C- or N-terminal Arrb2 and FLAG-tagged Akt plasmids following SD for 6 h. Notably, the N-terminal Arrb2 but not the C-terminal Arrb2 coimmunoprecipitated with Akt (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of the N-terminal Arrb2 with Akt promotes Akt dephosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that activation of Fas receptor is required for hepatocyte apoptosis following BDL (34Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P.J. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatocyte apoptosis after bile duct ligation in the mouse involves Fas.Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 669-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We determined whether Arrb2 deficiency prevents Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by treating WT mice and Arrb2 KO mice with anti-Fas antibody Jo2 that activates the Fas receptor. We found that administration of Jo2 significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in the livers in WT mice but not Arrb2 KO mice (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we also found that treatment with Jo2 dramatically attenuated the levels of phospho-Akt in WT mice but not in Arrb2 KO mice (Fig. 6B). Therefore, these data reveal that Arrb2 deficiency reduces Fas-dependent increase in apoptosis and reduction of phospho-Akt. To determine whether Arrb2 is required for inhibition of phospho-Akt following Fas activation, WT MEFs and Arrb2-deficient MEFs were transfected with Arrb2 full-length plasmid or control plasmid and then were incubated with or without Jo2, which activates the Fas receptor. As shown in Fig. 6C, Jo2 treatment decreases p-Akt but not total Akt in WT cells. In contrast, in Arrb2-deficient cells, Jo2 did not decrease p-Akt levels. Consistent with the effect of Arrb2 on p-Akt, which is an anti-apoptotic protein, the Jo2-dependent increase in TUNEL-positive MEF cells was markedly reduced in Arrb1 or -2 and in Arrb1- and -2-deficient cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 6D). Previous studies have shown that either Arrb1 or Arrb2 KO mice appear healthy and function normally unless challenged (24Ma L. Pei G. β-Arrestin signaling and regulation of transcription.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This study specifically addressed the role of Arrb2 in the liver injury due to BDL. Our results demonstrate that Arrb2 deficiency enhanced animal survival, decreased hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis, increased Akt, inactivated GSK3β, and reduced p38 MAPK signaling, the latter being previously demonstrated to be required for cholestatic liver injury (32Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. cFLIP-L inhibits p38 MAPK activation: an additional anti-apoptotic mechanism in bile acid-mediated apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26831-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Administration of a GSK3β inhibitor to BDL mice reproduced the effect of Arrb2 KO on liver cell apoptosis, Akt activation, and p38 inactivation. In vitro, activation of the Fas receptor, previously shown to be required for apoptosis in BDL (34Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P.J. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatocyte apoptosis after bile duct ligation in the mouse involves Fas.Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 669-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in the presence but not absence of Arrb2, decreases Akt and increases apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that the Arrb2-dependent decrease in Akt phosphorylation requires the interaction of the N terminus but not the C terminus of Arrb2. The results raise the likelihood of a novel role of Arrb2 in the modulation of liver injury. The scaffolding proteins Arrb1 and Arrb2 have been conventionally associated with receptor internalization. However, new roles of Arrbs in receptor trafficking and signal transduction have been discovered in recent years. Arrbs can scaffold different sets of molecules that determine different and even opposite effects on the same signaling cascade dependent on the receptor activated (24Ma L. Pei G. β-Arrestin signaling and regulation of transcription.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the case of Akt, which we focused on in these studies, previous studies by Beaulieu et al. (12Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. An Akt/β-arrestin 2/PP2A signaling complex mediates dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavior.Cell. 2005; 122: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) have shown Arrb2 can deactivate Akt by the formation of an Arrb-Akt complex upon stimulation of the D2-class dopamine receptors. Our studies show that in the liver injury model, the presence of Arrb2 similarly reduces p-Akt, which is associated with increased liver injury. Both in vitro and in vivo studies where we decreased phosphorylated Akt levels employing activation of Fas receptor by Jo2 antibody showed that Arrb2 is required for Fas receptor-dependent decreases in Akt phosphorylation and apoptosis. Other studies by Povsic et al. (11Povsic T.J. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. β-Arrestin1 mediates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and anti-apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51334-51339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have also shown that Arrbs have opposite effects, with insulin-like growth factor 1 activation of PI3K and Akt, which cause inhibition of apoptosis. Our studies did not determine the specific membrane receptors that are involved in the modulation of Arrb2 inactivation of Akt. This is a reasonable omission because previous studies have shown a large number of G-protein-coupled receptors to be involved in cholestatic liver injury (4Schoemaker M.H. Moshage H. Defying death: the hepatocyte's survival kit.Clin. Sci. 2004; 107: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); nevertheless, reductions of Akt due to Fas is one that we know is very relevant to cholestatic liver injury (19Osawa Y. Hannun Y.A. Proia R.L. Brenner D.A. Roles of AKT and sphingosine kinase in the antiapoptotic effects of bile duct ligation in mouse liver.Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We reveal for the first time that dephosphorylation of Akt by Arrb2 requires the N terminus of Arrb2, and we demonstrated direct protein-protein interactions between Akt and Arrb2 by co-immunoprecipitation studies and that this interaction also depends on the N terminus of Arrb2. Additional studies will be needed to demonstrate the specific subdomains where Akt and Arrb2 interact, because this additional information may allow the development of more specific inhibitors. Although drugs that nonspecifically disrupt Akt/Arrb2 scaffolding (e.g. lithium) may have therapeutic effects in the brain, the potential for these classes of drugs to modify liver injury has not been explored. In our studies we found that the degree of Akt phosphorylation was inversely related to GSK3β activity. GSK3β is an important downstream target from Akt (21Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Toll-like receptor-mediated cytokine production is differentially regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK3β on the inactivating residue serine 9 by Akt results in GSK3β inactivation (21Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M.

Previous studies have shown a reduction of GSK3β is associated with reduced liver injury in BDL mice (27Pi-Chieh Wang K. Lee L.M. Lin T.J. Sheen-Chen S.M. Lin J.W. Chiu W.T. Wang C.C. Hung K.S. Gene transfer of IGF1 attenuates hepatocellular apoptosis after bile duct ligation.J. Surg. Res. 2011; 167: 237-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We extended these previous observations by demonstrating that GSK3β inhibition reduces liver injury due to BDL. The GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 has been widely used to study the role of GSK3β in vivo, and our studies showed it significantly reduced both liver cell apoptosis and phosphorylation of p38. In models of cholestatic liver cell injury, previous studies showed that the only MAPK to increase liver cell apoptosis was p38 (32Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. cFLIP-L inhibits p38 MAPK activation: an additional anti-apoptotic mechanism in bile acid-mediated apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26831-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the GSK3β inhibitor did not decrease p38 phosphorylation in Arrb2 KO mice with BDL, we postulate that deficiency reduces p38 phosphorylation to a level that cannot be further decreased. Baseline p-p38 was increased in sham Arrb2 KO mice compared with WT mice, which is likely a phenotype of the KO. Because the increased baseline p-p38 was not associated with liver injury in Arrb2 KO mice, it is likely other counterbalancing influences come into play to prevent p38-dependent liver injury. Previous studies have shown that GSK3β regulates the stability of Arrb2 complex formations. GSK3 inhibitors or heterozygosity for GSK3β expression reduces Arrb2-Akt complex formation and increases Akt activity (35O'Brien W.T. Huang J. Buccafusca R. Garskof J. Valvezan A.J. Berry G.T. Klein P.S. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is essential for β-arrestin-2 complex formation and lithium-sensitive behaviors in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with GSK3β regulating the Arrb2-Akt complex in liver injury is our finding of the ability of the GSK3β inhibitor to reproduce the effect of Arrb2 KO on reduction of liver injury and decreased p38 phosphorylation. Further studies are needed to determine whether GSK3β regulates Arrb2-Akt complexes, and their regulation of cholestatic liver injury. In summary, this study is the first to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for Arrb2 regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis induced by BDL. Activation of Akt and inhibition of GSK3β, which are both negatively regulated by Arrb2, promote hepatocyte survival and inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis in Arrb2 KO mice. These findings suggest that targeted inhibition of Arrb2 might provide a novel therapeutic approach to prevent liver injury. X. Y., H. L., X. Z., Y. F., D. H., Y. C., and N.

In this study, we show that the ICs present in SLE patients by ligating to FcγRIIIa on CD4+ T-cells phosphorylate Syk and provide a co-stimulatory signal to CD4+ T-cells in the absence of CD28 signal. This led to the development of pathogenic IL-17A+ and IFN-γhigh CD4+ T-cells in vitro. Cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TGF-β1, and IL-23 were the only requirement for the development of both populations. SLE patients CD4+ T-cells that expressed CD25, CD69, and CD98 bound to ICs showed pSyk and produced IFN-γ and IL-17A. This FcγRIIIa-mediated co-signal differentially up-regulated the expression of IFN pathway genes compared with CD28 co-signal. FcγRIIIa-pSyk up-regulated several toll-like receptor genes as well as the HMGB1 and MyD88 gene transcripts. ICs co-localized with these toll-like receptor pathway proteins. These results suggest a role for the FcγRIIIa-pSyk signal in modulating adaptive immune responses.

We previously showed that non-lytic C5b-9 deposits trigger clustering of membrane rafts (MRs) observed in SLE T-cells. Hence, we examined the role for FcγRIIIa ligation by ICs in CD4+ T-cell responses in the presence of sublytic C5b-9 (5Engelhardt W. Matzke J. Schmidt R.E.

T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement with peptide-MHC (pMHC) and a co-stimulation by CD28 is required for CD4+ T-cell activation and differentiation into effector CD4+ T-cells (TE). This requirement of CD28 in the periphery varies based on anatomical location, stage of immune response, nature of T-cell subsets, and the activation status of the CD4+ T-cells (7Agarwal A.

Although the TH1 response initiates tissue damage, TH17 responses sustain tissue injuries during organ-specific autoimmunity, such as in synovium, heart, skin, and brain, which are also often the site of immune deposits. TH17 responses are observed both in inflammation and in autoimmunity (20Martin J.C. Baeten D.L. Josien R. Emerging role of IL-17 and Th17 cells in systemic lupus erythematosus.Clin.

T-cells express TLRs and promote cytokine secretion. TLR signaling augments the TH1, TH17, and Tregs responses (34Marshak-Rothstein A. Toll-like receptors in systemic autoimmune disease.Nat. Rev.

Immunol. 2011; 11: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs by DNA/RNA-ICs leads to autoantibody production. FcγRII (CD32) is a key participant for the delivery of DNA-ICs to many cell types (36Conti F. Spinelli F.R. Alessandri C. Valesini G. Toll-like receptors and lupus nephritis.Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2011; 40: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of TLR9 discriminate between self and non-self DNA (37Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Intracellular localization of Toll-like receptor 9 prevents recognition of self DNA but facilitates access to viral DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the FcγRIIIa-pSyk signal successfully replaced the CD28 requirement for differentiation of CD4+ T-cells. ICs ligation to FcγRIIIa phosphorylates Syk (pSyk), which caused the activation of CD4+ T-cells. In the presence of polarizing cytokines, this activation resulted in the development of CD4+IFN-γhigh and IL-17A-producing subsets. FcγRIIIa-pSyk co-signal induced colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) and IL-2 gene expression, which are associated with pathogenic TH17 cells. In SLE patients, CD4+ T-cell showed a subset that expressed activation markers CD25, CD69, and CD98, which also bound to ICs and showed pSyk. Furthermore, these activated cells produced IFN-γ and IL-17A. FcγRIIIa-pSyk-mediated signal differentially regulated the expression of IFN pathway genes. Co-signaling triggered by IC ligation of FcγRIIIa up-regulated expression of TLR signaling genes, suggesting a co-operation among these pathways. Blood from SLE patients and normal donors was collected with informed consent in the Saint Louis University Rheumatology clinic. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using the Histopaque gradient (Sigma). The donors 1–9 were analyzed for IFN-γ and IL-17A (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.). IL-21 production was analyzed in donors 1–4. This analysis from these donors is presented in Figs. 1, 2, and 4. Donors 8, 9, and an additional donor 10 were analyzed for the IFN gene analysis (shown in Fig. 9).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated within 12 h of sample collection, and monocytes were removed by overnight plating in a culture dish. The next day the CD4+CD45RA+ cells were purified using naïve CD4+ T-cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Product no. 130-094-131). Purified cells were maintained in culture with 20 units of IL-2 for 2 days. Thereafter, these cells were stimulated with plate-bound ICs at 10 μg/ml and using purified soluble C5b-9 at 2.5 μg/ml for 1 × 106 cells in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 (eBioscience, clone OKT3) at 0.25 μg/ml. Positive control cells were stimulated with plate-bound 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 (clone 28.2) and 0.25 μg/ml anti-CD3. At 24 h post stimulation cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2 (20 IU), IL-1β (50 ng), IL-6 (50 ng), IL-23 (20 ng), and TGF-β1 (10 ng) for each ml of medium (Peprotech, Princeton, NJ). On days 9–11, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for cytokine production. Cytokine levels were measured in the culture supernatants harvested on day five due to the concern for overgrowth in anti-CD3+anti-CD28 activation. Naïve CD4+ T-cells were activated for 48 h with plate-bound anti-CD3+anti-CD28. Cells were then cultured in the presence of 20 units IL-2 and examined for binding of labeled ICs. Cells on day 7 were activated with plate-bound anti-FcγRIIIa/b (0.5 μg/ml), ICs (10 μg/ml), and anti-CD3+anti-CD28 (0.5 and 1 μg/ml). Thymidine uptake was measured using Click-iT Plus Edu Alexa-488 assay (Product no. C10632, Life Technologies) 96 h post activation. Cells alone and isotype control (0.5 μg/ml) were used as negative controls. Cell surface staining was done using antibody conjugated directly with fluorochromes at room temperature for 30 min as per the manufacturer's recommended use. The binding of labeled ICs was performed using 1 μg of protein label/106 cells for 30 min at room temperature. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 2.5 μg/ml ionomycin for 4 h. Brefeldin at 5 μg/ml (Golgi Plus BD) was added after 1 h of PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Cells were collected for staining after 3 h. After cell surface staining the intracellular staining was performed using fixation/permeabilization reagents for IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-21 (eBioscience) according to manufacturer-suggested protocol. The following antibodies were used for cell surface or intracellular staining: Per-CP Cy5-anti-CD4, APC-anti-IFN-γ, PE-anti-IL21, PE-Cy7-anti-PD1, APC-eFluor780-anti-ICOS (eBioscience) PE-Cy7-anti-CD25, BV605-anti-CD69, BB515-anti-CD98, and Alexa Fluor 647-anti-IL-17A (BD Bioscience). PE-pSyk (Tyr-348) was purchased from eBioscience and PE-pSyk (Tyr-525/526) from Cell Signaling Technologies. Cells were stained in two panels: 1) anti-CD4, anti-pSyk (eBioscience), anti-IL-17A, anti-IFN-γ, and ICs; 2) anti-CD4, anti-CD25, anti-CD69, anti-CD98, and ICs. Staining using PE-pSyk (Cell Signaling Technologies) was performed in a separate panel from same samples. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometer (BD-LSRII, BD Biosciences). The flow data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). CD4+-gated T-cells were analyzed for pSyk presence with CD25, CD69, CD98, ICs, IL-17A, and IFN-γ. The graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 6. p values were calculated using non-parametric t test in Prism software. Total RNA was prepared from cells harvested between days 4–5 post-stimulation using kit from Agilent Technologies (Wilmington, DE). Semiquantitative analysis for gene expression was carried from cDNA generated from total RNA using a high capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) using the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method. For Rorc (Hs01076122), endogenous control GAPDH (Hs02758991) (Applied Biosystems) was used. The RQ, RQ (minimum), and RQ (maximum) were calculated by StepOne software and plotted using GraphPad Prism. For gene expression cDNA was analyzed as per the manufacturer recommendation in the TaqMan Array for human IFN pathway (product no. 4418931) and analyzed in Data-assist. For calculating RQ, the corresponding genes in CD28 co-stimulated sample were used to normalize the expression. GAPDH, GUSB, and HPRT1 were used as endogenous controls for IFN array analysis. Analysis of variance was carried out using Partek Genomic Suite (Life Technologies). cDNA prepared from anti-CD3+anti-CD28 treated and anti-CD3+ICs+C5b-9-treated cells was analyzed for human Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway genes using a RT2 Profiler PCR array plate (PAHS-018ZC, SAS Bioscience). Data were analyzed using vendor software, and ACTB, B2M, RPLP0, and GAPDH were used as endogenous controls included in the array. Culture supernatants were collected from activated cells on day 5 and kept frozen at −70 °C. Cytokine measurements were performed using the multiplexing assay as per the manufacturer's instruction (EMD Millipore). For statistical analysis a non-parametric t test was performed using GraphPad Prism software. P116 cells (ATCC, CRL-2676), an acute T-cell leukemia ZAP-70 mutant was grown as per the guidelines from ATCC. These cells were activated as described in the previous section. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using cold methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Cells were then kept for 1 h in 1% BSA/PBS and stained using antigen-specific antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 in BSA/PBS for 1 h and developed using anti-species specific Alexa Fluor fluorochrome conjugate (Life Technologies) at appropriate dilutions. Anti-TLR antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems and eBiosciences. Anti-MyD88 and anti-HMGB1 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. As a control for labeled ICs we used human IgG-conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Isotype controls for mouse monoclonal and purified rabbit IgG fraction were used as negative controls. We stained human CD4+FcγRIII+ cells after treating them with plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h with FITC-labeled anti-CD3 and anti-FcγRIIIa/b monoclonal (Clone245536) (R&D Systems). A secondary anti-mouse-Alexa-Fluor 594 was used to stain monoclonal anti-FcγRIIIa/b. IFN-γ is an autocrine TH1 differentiation factor that requires cytokine IL-12 for differentiation (19Hu X.

https://openalex.org/W2175152417,"The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors involved in patulin adsorption by heat-inactivated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cells. For preventing bacterial contamination, a sterilization process was involved in the adsorption process. The effects of various physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments, simultaneous treatments, and post-treatments on the patulin adsorption performances of six LAB strains were evaluated. The pre-treated cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the removal of patulin by viable cells was mainly based on adsorption or degradation, depending on the specific strain. The adsorption abilities were widely increased by NaOH and esterification pre-treatments, and reduced by trypsin, lipase, iodate, and periodate pre-treatments. Additionally, the adsorption abilities were almost maintained at pH 2.2–4.0, and enhanced significantly at pH 4.0–6.0. The effects of sodium and magnesium ions on the adsorption abilities at pH 4 were slight and strain-specific. A lower proportion of patulin was released from the strain with higher adsorption ability. Analyses revealed that the physical structure of peptidoglycan was not a principal factor. Vicinal OH and carboxyl groups were not involved in patulin adsorption, while alkaline amino acids, thiol and ester compounds were important for patulin adsorption. Additionally, besides hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction also participated in patulin adsorption, which was enhanced with the increase in pH (4.0–6.0)."
https://openalex.org/W2177721564,"X-ALD is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder where mutations in the ABCD1 gene result in clinically diverse phenotypes: the fatal disorder of cerebral childhood ALD (cALD) or a milder disorder of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The various models used to study the pathobiology of X-ALD disease lack the appropriate presentation for different phenotypes of cALD vs AMN. This study demonstrates that induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) derived brain cells astrocytes (Ast), neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs) express morphological and functional activities of the respective brain cell types. The excessive accumulation of saturated VLCFA, a ""hallmark"" of X-ALD, was observed in both AMN OLs and cALD OLs with higher levels observed in cALD OLs than AMN OLs. The levels of ELOVL1 (ELOVL Fatty Acid Elongase 1) mRNA parallel the VLCFA load in AMN and cALD OLs. Furthermore, cALD Ast expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines than AMN Ast and control Ast with or without stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. These results document that IPSC-derived Ast and OLs from cALD and AMN fibroblasts mimic the respective biochemical disease phenotypes and thus provide an ideal platform to investigate the mechanism of VLCFA load in cALD OLs and VLCFA-induced inflammatory disease mechanisms of cALD Ast and thus for testing of new therapeutics for AMN and cALD disease of X-ALD."
https://openalex.org/W2179685179,"How animals respond to varying environmental conditions is fundamental to ecology and is a question that has gained impetus due to mounting evidence indicating negative effects of global change on biodiversity. Behavioural plasticity is one mechanism that enables individuals and species to deal with environmental changes, yet for many taxa information on behavioural parameters and their capacity to change are lacking or restricted to certain periods within the annual cycle. This is particularly true for seabirds where year-round behavioural information is intrinsically challenging to acquire due to their reliance on the marine environment where they are difficult to study. Using data from over 13,000 foraging trips throughout the annual cycle, acquired using new-generation automated VHF technology, we described sex-specific, year-round activity budgets in Cape gannets. Using these data we investigated the role of weather (wind and rain) on foraging activity and time allocated to nest attendance. Foraging activity was clearly influenced by wind speed, wind direction and rainfall during and outside the breeding season. Generally, strong wind conditions throughout the year resulted in relatively short foraging trips. Birds spent longer periods foraging when rainfall was moderate. Nest attendance, which was sex-specific outside of the breeding season, was also influenced by meteorological conditions. Large amounts of rainfall (> 2.5 mm per hour) and strong winds (> 13 m s-1) resulted in gannets spending shorter amounts of time at their nests. We discuss these findings in terms of life history strategies and implications for the use of seabirds as bio-indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2175122437,"Background A conservative approach to fluid resuscitation improves survival in children with severe malaria; however, this strategy has not been formally evaluated in adults with the disease. Methods Adults hospitalised with malaria at two tertiary referral hospitals in Myanmar received intravenous fluid replacement with isotonic saline, administered at a maintenance rate using a simple weight-based algorithm. Clinical and biochemical indices were followed sequentially. Results Of 61 adults enrolled, 34 (56%) had Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection, 17 (28%) Plasmodium vivax mono-infection and 10 (16%) mixed infection; 27 (44%) patients were at high risk of death (P. falciparum infection and RCAM score ≥ 2). In the first six hours of hospitalisation patients received a mean 1.7 ml/kg/hour (range: 1.3–2.2) of intravenous fluid and were able to drink a mean of 0.8 ml/kg/hour (range: 0–3). Intravenous fluid administration and oral intake were similar for the remainder of the first 48 hours of hospitalisation. All 61 patients survived to discharge. No patient developed Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a requirement for renal replacement therapy or hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 60mmHg). Plasma lactate was elevated (> 2 mmol/L) on enrolment in 26 (43%) patients but had declined by 6 hours in 25 (96%) and was declining at 24 hours in the other patient. Plasma creatinine was elevated (> 120 μmol/L) on enrolment in 17 (28%) patients, but was normal or falling in 16 (94%) at 48 hours and declining in the other patient by 72 hours. There was no clinically meaningful increase in plasma lactate or creatinine in any patient with a normal value on enrolment. Patients receiving fluid replacement with the conservative fluid replacement algorithm were more likely to survive than historical controls in the same hospitals who had received fluid replacement guided by clinical judgement in the year prior to the study (p = 0.03), despite having more severe disease (p < 0.001). Conclusions A conservative fluid resuscitation strategy appears safe in adults hospitalised with malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2179894970,"RNA-seq is a new tool to measure RNA transcript counts, using high-throughput sequencing at an extraordinary accuracy. It provides quantitative means to explore the transcriptome of an organism of interest. However, interpreting this extremely large data into biological knowledge is a problem, and biologist-friendly tools are lacking. In our lab, we developed Transcriptator, a web application based on a computational Python pipeline with a user-friendly Java interface. This pipeline uses the web services available for BLAST (Basis Local Search Alignment Tool), QuickGO and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tools. It offers a report on statistical analysis of functional and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation's enrichment. It helps users to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, pathways, domains, gene/proteins features and protein-protein interactions related informations. It clusters the transcripts based on functional annotations and generates a tabular report for functional and gene ontology annotations for each submitted transcript to the web server. The implementation of QuickGo web-services in our pipeline enable the users to carry out GO-Slim analysis, whereas the integration of PORTRAIT (Prediction of transcriptomic non coding RNA (ncRNA) by ab initio methods) helps to identify the non coding RNAs and their regulatory role in transcriptome. In summary, Transcriptator is a useful software for both NGS and array data. It helps the users to characterize the de-novo assembled reads, obtained from NGS experiments for non-referenced organisms, while it also performs the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts/genes for both RNA-seq and micro-array experiments. It generates easy to read tables and interactive charts for better understanding of the data. The pipeline is modular in nature, and provides an opportunity to add new plugins in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2245146168,"Leishmania parasites and some molecules they secrete are known to modulate innate immune responses through effects on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Here, we characterized four Leishmania infantum potentially excreted/secreted recombinant proteins (LipESP) identified in our laboratory: Elongation Factor 1 alpha (LiEF-1α), a proteasome regulatory ATPase (LiAAA-ATPase) and two novel proteins with unknown functions, which we termed LiP15 and LiP23, by investigating their effect on in vitro differentiation and maturation of human DCs and on cytokine production by DCs and monocytes. During DCs differentiation, LipESP led to a significant decrease in CD1a. LiP23 and LiEF-1α, induced a decrease of HLA-DR and an increase of CD86 surface expression, respectively. During maturation, an up-regulation of HLA-DR and CD80 was found in response to LiP15, LiP23 and LiAAA-ATPase, while an increase of CD40 expression was only observed in response to LiP15. All LipESP induced an over-expression of CD86 with significant differences between proteins. These proteins also induced significant IL-12p70 levels in immature DCs but not in monocytes. The LipESP-induced IL-12p70 production was significantly enhanced by a co-treatment with IFN-γ in both cell populations. TNF-α and IL-10 were induced in DCs and monocytes with higher levels observed for LiP15 and LiAAA-ATPase. However, LPS-induced cytokine production during DC maturation or in monocyte cultures was significantly down regulated by LipESP co-treatment. Our findings suggest that LipESP strongly interfere with DCs differentiation suggesting a possible involvement in mechanisms established by the parasite for its survival. These proteins also induce DCs maturation by up-regulating several costimulatory molecules and by inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which is a prerequisite for T cell activation. However, the reduced ability of LipESP-stimulated DCs and monocytes to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that can be observed during human leishmaniasis, suggests that under certain circumstances LipESP may play a role in disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2176150239,"Research benefits increasingly from valuable contributions by citizen scientists. Mostly, participating adults investigate specific species, ecosystems or phenology to address conservation issues, but ecosystem functions supporting ecosystem health are rarely addressed and other demographic groups rarely involved. As part of a project investigating seed predation and dispersal as ecosystem functions along an urban-rural gradient, we tested whether elementary school children can contribute to the project as citizen scientists. Specifically, we compared data estimating vegetation cover, measuring vegetation height and counting seeds from a seed removal experiment, that were collected by children and scientists in schoolyards. Children counted seeds similarly to scientists but under- or overestimated vegetation cover and measured different heights. We conclude that children can be involved as citizen scientists in research projects according to their skill level. However, more sophisticated tasks require specific training to become familiarized with scientific experiments and the development of needed skills and methods."
https://openalex.org/W2177585006,"Detailed information about interspecific spatial associations among tropical tree species is scarce, and hence the ecological importance of those associations may have been underestimated. However, they can play a role in community assembly and species diversity maintenance. This study investigated the spatial dependence between pairs of species. First, the spatial associations (spatial attraction and spatial repulsion) that arose between species were examined. Second, different sizes of trees were considered in order to evaluate whether the spatial relationships between species are constant or vary during the lifetime of individuals. Third, the consistency of those spatial associations with the species-habitat associations found in previous studies was assessed. Two different tropical ecosystems were investigated: a montane cloud forest and a lowland moist forest. The results showed that spatial associations among species exist, and these vary among life stages and species. The rarity of negative spatial interactions suggested that exclusive competition was not common in the studied forests. On the other hand, positive interactions were common, and the results of this study strongly suggested that habitat associations were not the only cause of spatial attraction among species. If this is true, habitat associations and density dependence are not the only mechanisms that explain species distribution and diversity; other ecological interactions, such as facilitation among species, may also play a role. These spatial associations could be important in the assembly of tropical tree communities and forest succession, and should be taken into account in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2179310596,"Cough affects all individuals at different times, and its economic burden is substantial. Despite these widespread adverse effects, cough research relies on animal models, which hampers our understanding of the fundamental cause of cough. Postnasal drip is speculated to be one of the most frequent causes of chronic cough; however, this is a matter of debate. Here we show that mechanical stimuli by postnasal drip cause chronic cough. We distinguished human cough from sneezes and expiration reflexes by airflow patterns. Cough and sneeze exhibited one-peak and two-peak patterns, respectively, in expiratory airflow, which were also confirmed by animal models of cough and sneeze. Transgenic mice with ciliary dyskinesia coughed substantially and showed postnasal drip in the pharynx; furthermore, their cough was completely inhibited by nasal airway blockade of postnasal drip. We successfully reproduced cough observed in these mice by injecting artificial postnasal drip in wild-type mice. These results demonstrated that mechanical stimulation by postnasal drip evoked cough. The findings of our study can therefore be used to develop new antitussive drugs that prevent the root cause of cough."
https://openalex.org/W2180091496,"Disabled elderly individuals with kyphosis or loss of muscle strength often display forward head posture (FHP). This study aimed to determine the utility of a wheelchair incorporating pelvic support in preventing FHP in disabled elderly individuals. In this study, 14 disabled elderly individuals (87.1 ± 8.1 years) were selected. A wheelchair incorporating pelvic support (RX_ABS Lo) and a basic wheelchair (RX-1) were used. Each individual sat on both wheelchairs for 30 minutes. RX_ABS Lo has two belts to support the pelvic and thorax. Postures were recorded in the sagittal plane using a video camera. Cervical and trunk angles from horizontal were measured every 5 minutes. Simultaneously, contact areas and total pressures applied to the wheelchair seats and back supports were measured every 5 minutes. Comparisons of area under the curve values between the wheelchairs were performed using the paired t-test. Comparisons of time-dependent parameters for each wheelchair were performed using repeated one-way ANOVA. Cervical angles were greater when using RX_ABS Lo than RX-1. Although cervical angles were unchanged during 30 minutes when using RX_ABS Lo, the angles were significantly decreased after 30 minutes of using RX-1. Back support pressures and contact areas were greater for RX_ABS Lo than for RX-1. No significant difference in back support pressure distributions was observed during 30 minutes in the wheelchairs. The RX_ABS Lo may have utility in improving FHP by increasing cervical angles and improving stability with a back support to the upper thorax, lower thorax, and pelvis during prolonged sitting."
https://openalex.org/W2241933276,"Factors relevant to resource selection in carnivores may vary across spatial and temporal scales, both in magnitude and rank. Understanding relationships among carnivore occupancy, prey presence, and habitat characteristics, as well as their interactions across multiple scales, is necessary to improve our understanding of resource selection and predict population changes. We used a multi-scale dynamic hierarchical co-occurrence model with camera data to study bobcat and snowshoe hare occupancy in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during winter 2012-2013. Bobcat presence was influenced at the local scale by snowshoe hare presence, and by road density at the local and larger scale when hare were absent. Hare distribution was related primarily to vegetation cover types, and detectability varied in space and time. Bobcat occupancy dynamics were influenced by different factors depending on the spatial scale considered and the resource availability context. Moreover, considering observed co-occurrence, we suggest that bobcat presence had a greater effect on hare occupancy than hare presence on bobcat occupancy. Our results highlight the importance of studying carnivore distributions in the context of predator-prey relationships and its interactions with environmental covariates at multiple spatial scales. Our approach can be applied to other carnivore species to provide insights beneficial for management and conservation."
