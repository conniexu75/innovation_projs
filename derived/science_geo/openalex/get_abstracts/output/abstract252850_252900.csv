We now report that it is as a homodimer that the substrate adaptor Keap1 interacts with Cul3. The resulting complex facilitates ubiquitylation of the Nrf2 transcription factor but only when this substrate possesses within its Neh2 domain a second cryptic Keap1-binding site, the DLG motif, in addition to its previously described ETGE site. Both motifs recognize overlapping surfaces on Keap1, and the seven lysine residues of Nrf2 that act as ubiquitin acceptors lie between them. Based on these data, we propose a “fixed-ends” model for Nrf2 ubiquitylation in which each binding site becomes tethered to a separate subunit of the Keap1 homodimer. This two-site interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 constrains the mobility of the target lysine residues in the Neh2 domain, increasing their average concentration in the vicinity of the Rbx-bound ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and thus the rate at which the transcription factor is ubiquitylated. We show that self-association is a general feature of Cul3 substrate adaptors and propose that the fixed-ends mechanism is commonly utilized to recruit, orientate, and ubiquitylate substrates upon this family of ubiquitin ligases.

Ubiquitylation underpins virtually all biological processes as it is the major mechanism regulating the stability of critical effector molecules in eukaryotic cells. It refers to the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ϵ-NH2 group of a lysine residue in a target protein. The reaction proceeds in three stages with the final critical step, transfer of activated ubiquitin from an E2 2The abbreviations used are: E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; BCL6, B-cell lymphoma 6; BTB, Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac; CHX, cycloheximide; Cul, Cullin; ECH, erythroid cell-derived protein with cnc homology (i.e. Gallus gallus Nrf2); HA, hemagglutinin; IVR, intervening region; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Neh, Nrf2-ECH homology; Nrf, NF-E2 p45-related factor; PLZF, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger; Rbx, RING box protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; Sul, sulforaphane; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; BCL6, B-cell lymphoma 6; BTB, Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac; CHX, cycloheximide; Cul, Cullin; ECH, erythroid cell-derived protein with cnc homology (i.e. Gallus gallus Nrf2); HA, hemagglutinin; IVR, intervening region; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Neh, Nrf2-ECH homology; Nrf, NF-E2 p45-related factor; PLZF, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger; Rbx, RING box protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; Sul, sulforaphane; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to an acceptor lysine, facilitated by E3 ubiquitin ligases (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Modular complexes based around at least four Cullin-RING box (Cul-Rbx) holoenzymes constitute the largest family of E3 ligases identified to date. These holoenzymes, Cul1-Rbx1, Cul2-Rbx1, Cul3-Rbx1, and Cul5-Rbx2, differ in the nature of the substrate adaptors they bind (2Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

For example, Cul1-Rbx1 recruits protein dimers comprising the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1) bound to the eponymous domain found in over 40 F-box proteins (2Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The resulting E3 ligase is termed SCFF-box (Skp1, Cul1, and F-box, with the specific F-box protein identified in supercript). Cul3-Rbx1 recruits Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac (BTB) proteins to generate a large family of ligases that, by analogy with SCF ligases, are referred to as BC3BBTB ubiquitin ligases (6Pintard L.

For example, Skp1 and BTB proteins all utilize BTB folds to interact with Cul proteins (3Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Additionally, the domains utilized to recruit substrates can adopt analogous super-secondary structures; whereas F-box proteins frequently use WD40 domains to recruit substrates and BTB proteins commonly exploit Kelch-repeat domains for this purpose, both domains fold to give six-bladed β-propeller structures (3Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 10Stogios P.J. Prive G.G. Trends Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the seminal crystallographic study on the structure of the SCFF-box of Skp2 complex (12Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), these common features among adaptors suggest that probably all Cul-Rbx ligases function by recruiting and juxtaposing an E2 enzyme, via a C-terminal Rbx protein, and a substrate, via an N-terminal adaptor.The above model, in which a single substrate adaptor interacts with an E3 holoenzyme, may be incomplete as two examples exist supporting the idea that self-association of F-box proteins is required for ubiquitylation of some substrates by Cul1-Rbx1. First, association of two F-box proteins, Pop1p and Pop2p, is necessary for polyubiquitylation of Rum1p in fission yeast (13Wolf D.A. McKeon F. Jackson P.K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 373-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Seibert V. Prohl C. Schoultz I. Rhee E. Lopez R. Abderazzaq K. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, two F-box proteins, β-transducin repeat-containing protein 1 (βTrCP1) and βTrCP2, form hetero- and homo-oligomers with each other, but only the homo-oligomers could target phosphorylated IκBα for ubiquitylation (15Suzuki H.

The various rationales proposed to explain the necessity for adaptor self-association (discussed in Ref. 3Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) remain unsupported by evidence, and it is not clear whether these findings are idiosyncratic or of general significance. In particular, an analogous role for BTB protein dimers in substrate ubiquitylation by Cul3-Rbx1 has not been reported. Yet the BTB adaptor protein Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) homodimerizes in bacteria (16Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Wakabayashi N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6889-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 17Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc.

Additionally, evidence from the BTB domains of both B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factors (18Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The domain structure of this substrate is depicted in Fig. 1A with particular emphasis placed on its Nrf2-ECH homology 2 (Neh2) domain. For it is the ETGE motif found therein that directly interacts with the Kelch-repeat domain of Keap1 (Fig. 1D) (26Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Under normal redox conditions, this interaction results in ubiquitylation of the Nrf2 protein and, as a consequence, repression of its steady-state level. The ability of BC3BKeap1 to ubiquitylate the factor is inhibited by oxidative modification of specific cysteine residues in Keap1 (17Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I.

As Nrf2 promotes the transcription of genes whose products promote reductive chemistries, Keap1 provides the cell with a negative feedback control loop that plays a pivotal role in maintaining redox homeostasis (32Ishii T.

Additionally, we demonstrate that ubiquitylation of Nrf2 by BC3BKeap1/Keap1 4This nomenclature has been chosen to convey the essentially dimeric nature of the substrate adaptor. 4This nomenclature has been chosen to convey the essentially dimeric nature of the substrate adaptor. requires a second previously unrecognized Keap1-binding site, the DLG motif, to be present in its Neh2 domain (Fig. 1A). Based on these findings, we present a “fixed-ends” model for recruitment and orientation of Nrf2 upon BC3BKeap1/Keap1. The model accounts for the target lysine specificity displayed by the E3 complex and also provides a generally applicable rationale for substrate adaptor dimerization.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The pcDNA3.1/V5mNrf2, pCG-GAL(HA)mNeh2, pcDNA3.1/V5HisCmKeap1, pcDNA3.1/mKeap1, and pHisUb constructs have been described previously (36McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding mKeap1 fused at its N terminus with EGFP, pEGFP-mKeap1, was generated by PCR of the mKeap1 coding region using oligonucleotides bearing mismatches that introduced XhoI and EcoRI sites (forward primer, 5′-GAGGAACTGTGTCTCGAGATCCGGAACCCCATG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GTTGTCAGTGCTCAGGAATTCCAAGTGCTTCAGCAG-3′), and following restriction the product was ligated into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). The pET15bmKeap1 plasmid encoding a hexahistidine-mKeap1 fusion protein was generated by PCR amplification of the mKeap1 coding sequence with the following primer pair: 5′-CTTGTCATCCGGAACCATATGCAGCCCGAACCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGTCAGTGCTCGAGTATTCCAAGTGCTTC-3′. The product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET15b (Novagen). The pMal-mKeap1Δ1-307, encoding a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused to the Kelch-repeat domain of mKeap1, was generated by PCR amplification of the mKeap1 Kelch-repeat sequence with the following primer pair: 5′-CTACCTGGTGCAGATATTCGAATTCCTCACGCTGCACAAGCCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCTGTTGTCAGTCTGCAGGTATTCCAAGTGCTTCAG-3′. The product was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into EcoRI/PstI-digested pMal-2cX (New England Biolabs). An expression construct for hexahistidine-Xpress-mCul3 protein, pcDNA4/HisMaxBmCul3, was generated by PCR of the mCul3 coding region in IMAGE clone 3981140 using oligonucleotides bearing mismatches introducing EcoRI and XhoI sites (forward primer, 5′-GGCCGAGCACGAATTCGAATCTGAGCAAAGGC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CTCTCAGAGGGACTCGAGGCTTGATCTGAG-3′), and following restriction the product was ligated into pcDNA4/HisMaxB (Invitrogen). Plasmids for expression of both Myc-tagged and HA-tagged RhoBTB2 (provided by Dr Christopher Carpenter, Harvard Medical School) and Myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged SPOP (provided by Dr Maarten van Lohuizen, The Netherlands Cancer Institute) have been described previously (37Wilkins A.

For transfection, the pCMVβgal vector (Clontech) was used as an internal control. Constructs expressing mutated forms of the above proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the GeneEditor™ kit (Promega).Bacterial Expression and Purification of Protein—To purify recombinant hexahistidine-mKeap1, the pET15bmKeap1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and selected on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. One colony was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB broth containing 500 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the culture was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4. Expression of hexahistidine-mKeap1 protein was induced by addition of isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and after a further 2 h at 30 °C the bacteria were harvested, resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), lysed by addition of 1 mg of lysozyme, and sonicated. Hexahistidine-mKeap1 inclusion bodies were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and washed with two sequential volumes of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The final pellet was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. The purity of the hexahistidine-mKeap1 (>95%) and concentration were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. To purify MBP-mKeap1Δ1-307, pMal-mKeap1Δ1-307 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and MBP-mKeap1Δ1-307 was induced as described above. Post-induction, the bacteria were resuspended in 5 ml of Column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), lysed by addition of 1 mg of lysozyme, and sonicated. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), sterile-filtered, and passed through an amylose column (New England Biolabs). After extensively washing the column, the MBP fusion protein was eluted in Column buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose. Fractions containing protein were dialyzed against 2 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and stored at -80 °C.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Chemical Challenge—COS1 and RL34 cells were maintained as described previously (36McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Keap1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and their wild-type counterparts (39Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi J. Motohashi H. Noda S. Takahashi S. Imakado S. Kotsuji T. Otsuka F. Roop D.R. Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (40Nioi P. McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes and were either 90% confluent (COS1) or 30% confluent (keap1-/- MEF) when transfected ∼18 h later with constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were challenged with either 10 μm cycloheximide (CHX; Calbiochem) or sulforaphane (Sul; LKT Laboratories) at least 40 h after plating.Whole-cell Extracts, in Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblots—For immunoblots, whole-cell lysates were prepared by scraping cell monolayers into ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The in vivo ubiquitylation assay was carried out as described previously (36McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate EGFP-, V5-, or Myc-tagged proteins, clarified whole-cell lysates were prepared as described above, except that deoxycholate and SDS were omitted from the RIPA buffer. On occasion, clarified lysates that contained different ectopic proteins were mixed together. 1 μg of either rabbit anti-GFP, goat anti-V5, or mouse anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10) (all from Abcam) was added to each clarified lysate and mixed by end-over-end tumbling at 4 °C for 2 h. At this point, immunocomplexes were gathered with protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at 4 °C for 15 min. Material that remained bound to the resin after washing with modified RIPA buffer was eluted in 50 μl of Laemmli reducing sample buffer. Biochemical analyses were carried out by standard methods (36McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Antibodies used included mouse anti-V5 and mouse anti-Xpress (Invitrogen), goat anti-hKeap1 (E20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA, (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-GFP, goat anti-c-Myc, and rabbit anti-FLAG (the latter three were all from Abcam). During this study, a rabbit anti-mKeap1 antiserum was generated by immunization of a female New Zealand White rabbit with bacterially expressed MBP-mKeap1Δ1-307 protein and was used at a dilution of 1:5000.Gel Filtration—Confluent monolayers of cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed by scraping them into 300 μl of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20. The clarified lysate was applied to a Superdex-200 10/300 GL 10 × 300-mm column (Amersham Biosciences) and was eluted at 0.25 ml/min with lysis buffer. Fractions of 250 μl were collected.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONKeap1 Protein Exists as a Stable Dimer, but Not as a Monomer, in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether Keap1 oligomerizes in mammalian cells, we co-expressed EGFP- and V5-tagged forms of the protein in COS1 cells. After 24 h, whole-cell lysates were prepared from each dish of cells. EGFP-tagged mKeap1 was immunoprecipitated from these lysates and probed for the presence of V5-tagged adaptor by immunoblotting. The V5-tagged protein specifically co-immunoprecipitated with its EGFP-tagged counterpart (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and 8), indicating that Keap1 self-associates. These data also show that the interaction of the adaptor protein with itself is unaffected by treatment of COS1 cells with doses of the oxidative stressor Sul that are sufficient to inhibit BC3BKeap1 activity (36McMahon M.

Duplicate dishes of cells were treated with 0, 15, or 90 μm Sul for 2 h before whole-cell lysates were prepared, EGFP-mKeap1 immunoprecipitated (IP), and both whole-cell lysates (input) and IP fractions blotted with mouse anti-V5 and rabbit anti-GFP. WB, Western blot. B, a whole-cell lysate was prepared from COS1 cells expressing mKeap1 and size-fractionated on a Superdex-200 column. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and blotted with goat anti-hKeap1, either as combined aliquots from eight consecutive fractions (panel i), or individually (panel ii). The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (669 kDa, elution volume of 9.15 ml), apoferritin (445 kDa, elution volume of 9.26 ml), catalase (202 kDa, elution volume of 10.42 ml), β-amylase (200 kDa, elution volume of 10.75 ml), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, elution volume of 11.98), albumin (63.5 kDa, elution volume of 13.47 ml), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, elution volume of 16.53 ml), chymotrypsinogen (20.4 kDa, elution volume of 16.68 ml), and ribonuclease A (15.6 kDa, elution volume of 17.32 ml) as size standards. The graph of log Mw versus Kav for these nine proteins is depicted in panel iii, where Kav is defined as (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo). Ve indicates the elution volume for protein of interest; Vo indicates the void volume (7.7 ml); Vt indicates the total column volume (24 ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inspection of the data in Fig. 2A revealed that the proportion of mKeap1 in the immunoprecipitate that contained a V5 tag was similar to that in the corresponding whole-cell lysate (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). This is consistent with self-association of the adaptor proceeding to completion. In agreement with this, when we size-fractionated lysates from homeostatic COS1 cells expressing untagged mKeap1, the protein eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2B (i) and (ii)), with an estimated mass of 147-162 kDa, a value that is approximately twice the theoretical molecular weight of a Keap1 polypeptide (69.5 kDa). These data reveal that overexpressed Keap1 exists solely as a stable dimer under steady-state conditions.Self-association is not an artifact of overexpression as endogenous Keap1 also exhibits this property. To unequivocally identify the endogenous protein, we used two immunological reagents that interact with separate domains of the adaptor. Goat anti-hKeap1 is available commercially and was raised to a peptide within the BTB domain of the adaptor protein. In addition, we generated an antiserum against the Kelch-repeat domain of mKeap1. Both of these reagents recognized hexahistidine-mKeap1 standards (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 1-3). They also bound to ectopic untagged and EGFP-tagged forms of mKeap1 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5 and 6). Critically, only one endogenous protein in COS1 lysates was recognized by both reagents, and it co-migrated with untagged mKeap1 (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4). This protein, which we identify as Keap1, was present at approximately only 10 ppm of extracted COS1 protein. In an immortalized rat liver epithelial cell line, RL34, and MEFs, the adaptor is present in even lower amounts being below the limit of detection of our assay (approximately 2 ppm of extracted protein) (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 7-9). Endogenous Keap1 eluted as a single peak from a Superdex-200 column with proteins of 141-155 kDa (Fig. 3C), indicating that it exists solely as a dimer.FIGURE 3Endogenous Keap1 is a dimer in COS1 cells. Portions of bacterially expressed and purified hexahistidine-mKeap1 (4000, 400, and 40 pg in lanes 1-3, respectively), 10 μg of protein from COS1 cells (lane 4), COS1 cells heterologously expressing untagged mKeap1 or EGFP-mKeap1 (lanes 5 and 6, respectively), RL34 cells (lane 7), wild type (wt) MEF cells (lane 8) and Keap1-/- MEF cells (lane 9) were electrophoresed through 8% polyacrylamide gels and blotted with goat anti-hKeap1 (A) or rabbit anti-mKeap1 (B). WB, Western blot. C, a whole-cell lysate was prepared from COS1 cells and size-fractionated on a Superdex-200 column. Starting from elution volume 7.36 ml and ending at elution volume 16.36 ml (i.e. proteins from >1000 to ∼35 kDa), 36 fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and blotted with rabbit anti-mKeap1. Bands representing Keap1 are indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dimeric Keap1 Associates with Cul3—The above experiments suggest it is dimeric and not monomeric Keap1 that interacts with Cul3. We developed a co-immunoprecipitation-based assay to further investigate this issue.First, we confirmed that Xpress-tagged mCul3 co-immunoprecipitated with V5-tagged mKeap1 (Fig. 4, cf. lanes 1 and 2, and lanes 3 and 4). Next, we generated a mutant form of Keap1 that was unable to bind Cul3. To do this, we created a model of the Keap1 BTB homodimer structure based on those of BCL6 and PLZF (supplemental Fig. 1,"
https://openalex.org/W2097292535,"The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the senile plaque principally composed of tightly aggregated amyloid-β fibrils (fAβ), which are thought to be resistant to degradation and clearance. In this study, we explored whether proteases capable of degrading soluble Aβ (sAβ) could degrade fAβ as well. We demonstrate that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) can degrade fAβ and that this ability is not shared by other sAβ-degrading enzymes examined, including endothelin-converting enzyme, insulin-degrading enzyme, and neprilysin. fAβ was decreased in samples incubated with MMP-9 compared with other proteases, assessed using thioflavin-T. Furthermore, fAβ breakdown with MMP-9 but not with other proteases was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Proteolytic digests of purified fAβ were analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify sites of Aβ that are cleaved during its degradation. Only MMP-9 digests contained fragments (Aβ1-20 and Aβ1-30) from fAβ1-42 substrate; the corresponding cleavage sites are thought to be important for β-pleated sheet formation. To determine whether MMP-9 can degrade plaques formed in vivo, fresh brain slices from aged APP/PS1 mice were incubated with proteases. MMP-9 digestion resulted in a decrease in thioflavin-S (ThS) staining. Consistent with a role for endogenous MMP-9 in this process in vivo, MMP-9 immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques in the brains of aged APP/PS1 and APPsw mice, and increased MMP activity was selectively observed in compact ThS-positive plaques. These findings suggest that MMP-9 can degrade fAβ and may contribute to ongoing clearance of plaques from amyloid-laden brains.

One of the key pathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; ECE, endothelin-converting enzyme; Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; fAβ, amyloid-β fibrils; sAβ, soluble Aβ; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; NEP, neprilysin; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; ThS, thioflavin-S; ThT, thioflavin-T; TIMP, tissue inhibitors of MMP; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is the senile plaque, extracellular deposits found throughout the brains of AD patients, composed primarily of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Aggregated Aβ in senile plaques can be found in two conformations: non-β-pleated-sheet (nonfibrillar) conformation, known as “diffuse plaques” or β-pleated sheet (fibrillar) conformation, known as “compact plaques” (1Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The 42-amino acid peptide (Aβ1-42), the predominant peptide length found in senile plaques, has a remarkable propensity to aggregate at high concentrations to form a β-pleated sheet structure (2McLaurin J. Yang D. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). This is generally viewed as an irreversible process resulting in the formation of fibrillar Aβ (fAβ), which is insoluble and resistant to proteolysis, endowing compact plaques with a resistance to degradation and clearance. Given the purported irreversibility of Aβ fibril formation and the resistance to degradation, one might expect that senile plaques would continue to grow throughout disease progression; however, careful observational studies indicate that plaque size remains relatively constant over a wide range of disease durations (4Hyman B.T. Marzloff K. Arriagada P.V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo imaging in the APPsw (Tg2576) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (using multiphoton microscopy) demonstrated that plaques remain constant in size over a period of many months (5Christie R.H. Bacskai B.J. Zipfel W.R. Williams R.M. Kajdasz S.T. Webb W.W. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 858-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led some to believe that plaques, once formed, are in dynamic equilibrium with their environment, balancing formation with degradation (6Cruz L. Urbanc B. Buldyrev S.V. Christie R. Gomez-Isla T. Havlin S. McNamara M. Stanley H.E. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7612-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, a few isolated plaques in APPsw mice were found to decrease in size (5Christie R.H. Bacskai B.J. Zipfel W.R. Williams R.M. Kajdasz S.T. Webb W.W. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 858-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that endogenous mechanisms for plaque clearance may exist. Moreover, a semiquantitative analysis of plaque burden in Alzheimer disease cases revealed that the most advanced cases (by Braak staging) actually had a slightly lower frequency of plaques than less advanced cases (7Thal D.R. Arendt T. Waldmann G. Holzer M. Zedlick D. Rub U. Schober R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While plaques and amyloid fibrils have been viewed by some as resistant to proteolytic degradation, it is possible that certain (as yet unidentified) proteases may contribute to endogenous mechanisms leading to plaque clearance. A growing list of proteases are known to degrade soluble Aβ (sAβ) in vitro, including NEP (8Howell S. Nalbantoglu J. Crine P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), IDE (9Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), ECE (10Eckman E.A.

Tokes Z.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7910-7919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these proteases appears to have distinguishing Aβ cleavage sites, generating characteristic fragments. However, experimental evidence that these proteases degrade sAβ in vivo is available only for a few: gene deletion of NEP (14Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) in mice resulted in increased steady-state levels of Aβ in brain, suggesting a role in regulating endogenous basal levels of Aβ in vivo. Although all of these proteases demonstrate the ability to degrade sAβ, none has been convincingly shown to degrade Aβ fibrils or compact plaques. MMP-9, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease, has not been well studied with regards to its potential role in amyloid clearance. Initially synthesized as an inactive proenzyme, pro-MMP-9 is cleaved into an active form upon cellular release by other proteases (17Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar); this property puts MMP-9 in a unique position to regulate extracellular Aβ levels. Once activated, MMP-9 can be regulated by interacting with endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) (17Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Although expressed at low basal levels in normal brain tissue, MMP-9 expression is induced in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and vascular cells under a variety of pathological conditions (18Gu Z.

Moreover MMP-9 expression in astrocytes is induced in the presence of the Aβ peptide (25Deb S. Wenjun Zhang J. Gottschall P.E. Brain Res. 2003; 970: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the possibility that certain sAβ-degrading proteases were capable of degrading fAβ and amyloid plaques. Specifically, we examined the well studied sAβ-degrading proteases, ECE, IDE, and NEP, as well as MMP-9. We further examined the expression and activity of fAβ-degrading proteases in the brains of transgenic mouse models of AD. APP Transgenic Mice—Tg2576 (APPsw) and APP/PS1 mice, models of AD, were used in this study. The production, genotyping, and background strains of these mice have been described previously (26Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were compared with age-matched littermate wild-type controls. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University. Aβ Preparation and Analysis—Synthetic human Aβ1-42 (Bachem) or Aβ1-40 (American Peptide), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma) to a concentration of 5 mm, was diluted in MQ water to a final concentration of 25 μm immediately prior to use. Analysis with Tris-Tricine gels indicate that the vast majority of Aβ in this preparation (referred to as sAβ) was in the monomer form (data not shown). To prepare Aβ fibrils (fAβ), 5 mm Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-40 in Me2SO was diluted in 10 mm HCl to 100 μm (for Aβ1-42) or 200 μm (for Aβ1-40), vortexed for 30 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days (27Stine Jr., W.B. Dahlgren K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11612-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, fAβ was further purified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Fibrils were confirmed by thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence and electron microscopy (see below). Some experiments were repeated using Aβ1-42 from a different manufacturer (American Peptide). ThT assay: 10 μl of sample was added to 0.2 ml of 10 μm ThT in 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 10.5). Fluorescence intensity was monitored at λex of 440 nm and λem of 530 nm (28LeVine III, H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proteolytic Digestions—Human recombinant ECE, ICE, NEP, and MMP-9 (R&D Systems) were used for digestion reactions using the following buffers: ECE, 0.1 m MES, 0.1 m NaCl (pH 6.0); IDE, 50 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.5); NEP, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5); MMP-9, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35. Pro-MMP-9 was activated with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C for 24 h prior to use. For sAβ digestions, 100 nm protease was incubated with 2.5 μm sAβ at 37 °C for varying periods of time (4 h to 5 days), then analyzed by MS. For fAβ digestions (employing ThT or TEM), 200 nm protease was added to 10 μl of fAβ in reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to 5 days. After digestion, the reaction was analyzed by ThT assay or TEM. For fAβ digestions (employing MS), 10 μl of fAβ was applied to a Microcon 50-kDa centrifugal ultrafiltration unit (YM-50, Millipore) and washed with 500 μl of 10 mm HCl three times, then equilibrated with 500 μl of MQ water. Thirty μl of reaction buffer was added to the fAβ (retentate) and centrifuged; the filtrate was analyzed by MS (see below) to ensure that any contaminating Aβ monomer or fragments were washed away. Ten μl of 300nm protease and 20 μl of reaction buffer was added to the fAβ (retentate) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, then centrifuged and analyzed by MS to detect liberated fragments of fAβ. Mass Spectrometry—Samples were first passed through a reverse phase C18 Ziptip (Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions, then diluted 1:1 with matrix solution (a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), loaded onto a plate, and allowed to dry. The sample was then analyzed on an Applied Biosystesms (Foster City, CA) Voyager DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) operated in linear mode. Insulin was used as an internal standard, and a calibration line constructed from its [M + H]+ and [M + 2H]2+ ions was used for quantification (29Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Small volumes (5 μl) of fAβ samples were absorbed onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated, formvar/carbon-filmed 150-mesh copper grids. Grids were stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate and dried in a light-protected environment overnight before being viewed in a TEM (H-7500) operated at 80 kV (30Yang F. Lim G.P. Begum A.N. Ubeda O.J.

In Situ Plaque Degradation—Brains were removed from anesthetized 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice after perfusion with cold saline and snap-frozen on dry ice. Five-μm cryostat sections were collected on slides. Every other section was flipped 180° so that identical faces of adjacent sections were exposed. Paired adjacent sections (one incubated with buffer, the other with 70 nm protease) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days, stained with thioflavin-S (ThS) (31Sun A. Nguyen X.V. Bing G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), then imaged with fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX60). Using a 20× objective lens, identical fields from paired sections were photographed (precise alignment was confirmed by superimposing plaque staining patterns). The area of ThS fluorescence was determined using image analysis software (Sigma Scan) and expressed as a fraction of total area. Fractional area was compared between paired sections. The specific activities (Aβ degrading activity) of all proteases were approximately equivalent (Fig. 2C). Immunohistochemistry—APPsw mice (>16 months), APP/PS1 (>6 months), and age-matched wild-type mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brain cryostat sections (16 μm) were processed for immunofluorescence double labeling, a mixture of rabbit anti-MMP-9 (1:800, gift from Dr. Robert Senior (32Betsuyaku T. Fukuda Y. Parks W.C.

Xu J. Li Q. Chen S. Kim G.M. Hsu C.Y. Xu X.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9355-9363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were coverslipped and examined using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM). In Situ Zymography—Fresh frozen sections (10μ m) were incubated with DQ-gelatin (EnzCheck; Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 1% low gel temperature agarose (Sigma) in PBS containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1.0 μg/ml). Sections were incubated for 24 h at room temperature. For further immunostaining, sections were washed and fixed with ice-cold acetone and alcohol (1:1), then subjected to immunofluorescent staining as described above. Specificity of MMP activity was confirmed by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, which inhibits activity (34Goussev S. Hsu J.Y. Lin Y. Tjoa T. Maida N. Werb Z. Noble-Haeusslein L.J. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 99: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Statistics—Student's t test was employed to determine differences between two groups (ThT comparison ± protease). Paired comparisons (in situ plaque degradation assay) were analyzed using the paired t test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cleavage Sites for Aβ-degrading Proteases—Of the candidate proteases capable of degrading sAβ in vitro, only ECE, IDE, and NEP have evidence supporting a role in vivo (14Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y.

To directly compare Aβ-degrading activity and specific peptide fragments generated by digestion between these proteases and MMP-9, freshly prepared synthetic human Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-40 was incubated with each protease for 4 h prior to analysis with MALDI-TOF MS. Incubation of Aβ1-42 with each recombinant human protease (ECE, IDE, NEP, and MMP-9) resulted in relatively specific profiles of Aβ fragments (Fig. 1, A-F). The putative Aβ1-42 cleavage sites for each protease, based on the fragments generated, are shown in Fig. 1G. The major fragments generated from proteolytic cleavage of Aβ1-40 were similar to those generated from Aβ1-42 (supplemental Fig. 1). In general, the Aβ cleavage sites are in good agreement with previous studies (10Eckman E.A. Reed D.K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol.

However, a few differences were noted, possibly reflecting differences in the sources of the enzymes used (human versus rat), in the nature of Aβ substrate, in the digestion conditions (e.g. different buffers), or in detection and purification methods. MMP-9 generated six fragments that, in contrast to other proteases, were mostly in the hydrophobic C-terminal region of the Aβ peptide. All proteases examined exhibited a specific activity for sAβ degradation that was remarkably similar (see below). MMP-9 Degrades fAβ in Vitro—To determine whether sAβ-degrading proteases could degrade fAβ, human recombinant proteases (ECE, IDE, NEP, and MMP-9) or buffer alone were incubated with preformed Aβ fibrils. These fibrils were formed by incubating Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-40 at 37 °C for 5 days (see “Experimental Procedures”). For Aβ1-42, ThT fluorescence reached maximal values within 1 day, while Aβ1-40 reached maximal fluorescence within 3 days. Preformed Aβ fibrils were then incubated with proteases for 1-5 days at 37 °C and examined using ThT fluorescence. Of the four proteases examined, only MMP-9 reduced ThT fluorescence compared with buffer controls (fAβ1-42, Fig. 2A, fAβ1-40; supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that fAβ was degraded by this protease. This decrease in ThT fluorescence was time-dependent and declined to 70% of initial values by 96 h (Fig. 2B). To ensure that similar results could be obtained with Aβ preparations from different batches or manufacturers, we repeated the digestions using fAβ1-42 from two different sources (American Peptide and Bachem) and at least two different lots and obtained similar results in each case (data not shown). Because our experiments directly compared the proteolytic activity of four different enzymes, we determined the specific activity for sAβ-degradation using MALDI-TOF MS data after 0 and 5 days of incubating proteases alone (without substrate) at 37 °C. Specific sAβ degrading activity was remarkably similar for all four proteases at 0 days, declining to ∼50% after 5 days (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the observed differences in fAβ degrading activity did not reflect different specific activities for sAβ degradation among the proteases. To visualize ultrastructural changes in Aβ fibrils after incubation with proteases, we performed TEM on preformed fAβ incubated in buffer with or without the proteases. TEM of aggregated synthetic human Aβ1-42 demonstrated fibrils with an approximate diameter of 10 nm, consistent with prior reports (37Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 33: 679-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 38Serpell L.C. Blake C.C. Fraser P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13269-13275Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, thicker aggregates of fibers (80-100 nm diameter) were occasionally observed. Incubation of fAβ with ECE, IDE, or NEP, pro-MMP-9 produced no changes compared with PBS alone (Fig. 3, A-D), but MMP-9 incubation mixtures contained fewer fibrils. In addition, amorphous structures suggestive of decomposed fibrils were observed in the MMP-9 incubation mixtures (Fig. 3, F and G). These amorphous structures were very similar to that observed for α-helical structures (39Nilsson M.R. Methods (Amst.). 2004; 34: 151-160Google Scholar) or after Aβ fibril deaggregation with curcumin (30Yang F. Lim G.P. Begum A.N. Ubeda O.J. Simmons M.R. Ambegaokar S.S. Chen P.P. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5892-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). To explore the potential mechanisms of fibril disruption by MMP-9, we determined whether Aβ fragments were released by MMP-9 digestion of fAβ. Aβ fragments generated by incubating purified fAβ with ECE, IDE, NEP, or MMP-9 were isolated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. MMP-9 was the only protease examined that produced Aβ fragments (Fig. 4C), with molecular masses of 2461.68 and 3390.59 daltons corresponding to Aβ1-20 and Aβ1-30. Inhibition of MMP-9 activity with EDTA prevented the generation of Aβ fragments (Fig. 4B), suggesting that proteolytic cleavage at Phe20-Ala21 or Ala30-Ile31 may be important for fibril degradation. Impurities in the MMP-9 preparation are indicated by * and are also seen in the MS of the protease alone (supplemental Fig. 3). Masses of the impurities did not coincide with Aβ fragments. MMP-9 Degrades Compact Plaques in Situ—Although amyloid plaques are primarily composed of the Aβ peptide, numerous other components are known to colocalize in senile plaques, including proteoglycans, serum constituents, metal ions, and others. Furthermore, posttranslational modifications of Aβ may further stabilize amyloid deposits in plaques (40Atwood C.S. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Perry G. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) Thus, the ability of an enzyme to degrade Aβ fibrils need not imply an ability to degrade amyloid plaques. To determine whether MMP-9 degrades amyloid plaques, we developed a sensitive method to compare the load of compact plaques in adjacent brain sections from aged APP/PS1 mice. Adjacent brain sections were incubated with proteases or buffer alone and then stained with ThS, and the area of fluorescence was compared between matching high power fields from adjacent sections. The area of ThS fluorescence (thioflavin load) in brain sections incubated with ECE, IDE, or NEP did not differ from those incubated with buffer alone, but incubation with MMP-9 resulted in a significant decrease in thioflavin load (Fig. 5A-D), suggesting that MMP-9 could degrade compact amyloid plaques. Fig. 5E illustrates a representative comparison between two corresponding high power fields from adjacent sections (upper panels) and the same fields with contrast thresholding to illustrate plaque load (lower panels). Note the relative decrease in plaque sizes in the section incubated with MMP-9 (arrows, +MMP-9) compared with that incubated with buffer alone (-MMP-9). MMP-9 Expression and Activity in Brains of APPsw Mice— Unlike other MMPs, MMP-9 is expressed in specific cells at low basal levels, and its expression can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, reactive oxygen species, or stressors (41Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 375-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). We examined MMP-9 expression in the brains of aged APPsw, APP/PS1, and wild-type littermate mice. Aged wild-type mice demonstrated a few isolated cells with MMP-9 immunoreactivity localized primarily in the corpus callosum (Fig. 6A), while APPsw mice had many more cells with prominent MMP-9 immunostaining throughout the brain (including cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus, Fig. 6, B and C). Double staining with ThS revealed that many of the MMP-9 immunoreactive cells appeared to surround ThS-positive compact plaques (Fig. 6C). Moreover, the cells had the appearance of activated astrocytes, based on their hypertrophic cell bodies and immunoreactivity with anti-GFAP antibodies (as illustrated by the double labeling experiment in Fig. 6, D-F). Similar expression profiles were found in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice (data not shown). MMP-9 protein expression does not necessarily imply proteolytic activity. MMP-9 activity, like that of other MMPs, is stringently controlled through multiple mechanisms including transcriptional regulation, release from cells, activation through propeptide cleavage, and interaction with TIMPs. Thus, to examine net MMP-9 (gelatinase) activity in the brains of APPsw mice, in situ zymography was performed by incubating brain sections with fluorescently labeled gelatin. Gelatinase activity was detected within many but not all amyloid plaques (Fig. 6, G-I) in aged APPsw mice. Double labeling with ThS and anti-MMP-9 antibodies revealed that the vast majority of plaques with gelatinase activity were ThS-positive compact plaques surrounded by astrocytes expressing MMP-9 (data"
https://openalex.org/W2072526492,"Prolyl 4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins are oxygen-dependent enzymes that hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) α-subunits, leading to their subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Paradoxically, the expression of two family members (PHD2 and PHD3) is induced in hypoxic cell culture despite the reduced availability of the oxygen co-substrate, and it has been suggested that they become functionally relevant following re-oxygenation to rapidly terminate the HIF response. Here we show that PHDs are also induced in hypoxic mice in vivo, albeit in a tissue-specific manner. As demonstrated under chronically hypoxic conditions in vitro, PHD2 and PHD3 show a transient maximum but remain up-regulated over more than 10 days, suggesting a feedback down-regulation of HIF-1α which then levels off at a novel set point. Indeed, hypoxic induction of PHD2 and PHD3 is paralleled by the attenuation of endogenous HIF-1α. Using an engineered oxygen-sensitive reporter gene in a cellular background lacking endogenous HIF-1α and hence inducible PHD expression, we could show that increased exogenous PHD levels can compensate for a wide range of hypoxic conditions. Similar data were obtained in a reconstituted cell-free system in vitro. In summary, these results suggest that due to their high O2 Km values, PHDs have optimal oxygen-sensing properties under all physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations; increased PHDs play a functional role even under oxygen-deprived conditions, allowing the HIF system to adapt to a novel oxygen threshold and to respond to another hypoxic insult. Furthermore, such an autoregulatory oxygen-sensing system would explain how a single mechanism works in a wide variety of differently oxygenated tissues.

Furthermore, such an autoregulatory oxygen-sensing system would explain how a single mechanism works in a wide variety of differently oxygenated tissues. Biological systems tightly monitor acute changes in environmental conditions, initiate regulatory responses, and use negative feedback loops to limit the extent of these responses. To adapt to chronic changes, many environmental sensors are capable of adjusting their threshold values, allowing to respond again to acute deviations of a now different set point. Cells sense changes in environmental oxygen availability by a group of enzymes that directly control the cellular response to lowered oxygen by destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 2The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CA, carbonic anhydrase; Fi, inspiratory oxygen fraction; GLUT, glucose transporter; mAb, mouse monoclonal antibody; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation; PHD, prolyl 4-hydroxylase domain; pVHL, von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein; VBC, pVHL/elongin B/elongin C; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPH, HIF prolyl hydroxylase; EGLN, egg laying defective nine homolog; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine. 2The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CA, carbonic anhydrase; Fi, inspiratory oxygen fraction; GLUT, glucose transporter; mAb, mouse monoclonal antibody; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation; PHD, prolyl 4-hydroxylase domain; pVHL, von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein; VBC, pVHL/elongin B/elongin C; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPH, HIF prolyl hydroxylase; EGLN, egg laying defective nine homolog; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine. α subunits, the master transcriptional regulators of the hypoxic response.

PHDs hydroxylate HIF-1α and HIF-2α at two distinct proline residues within the HIFα oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. Under normoxic conditions, prolyl 4-hydroxylation allows binding of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal destruction (4Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl 4-hydroxylation is reduced, and HIF-1α and HIF-2α become stabilized, heterodimerize with the constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and regulate the expression of a large number of effector genes involved in adaptation to low oxygen (5Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE 2005,. 2005; : RE12Google Scholar).

Upon re-oxygenation, the PHD oxygen-sensing system must be rapidly reversed. Interestingly, PHD2 and PHD3, but not PHD1, have been reported to be hypoxically induced at both the mRNA and protein levels (2Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J.

Accordingly, elevated PHD2 and PHD3 levels have been demonstrated in a broad panel of established cancer cell lines (9Appelhoff R.J. Tian Y.M. Raval R.R. Turley H. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W.

Functional hypoxia-response elements are located in the promoter region of the human PHD2 gene as well as in the first intron of the human PHD3 gene, suggesting that PHD2 and PHD3 are HIF target genes themselves (10Metzen E.

Because the essential co-factor oxygen is basically lacking under hypoxic conditions, the HIF-dependent hypoxic increase in PHD abundance has been suggested to play a role in accelerating the termination of the HIF response following re-oxygenation (2Epstein A.C.

Indeed, biochemical in vitro studies revealed Km values of purified PHDs for oxygen close to the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in air, suggesting that the kinetics of specific HIFα hydroxylation under hypoxic conditions are rather slow (14Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, tissues in situ have to deal with a great variability of generally very low pO2 values, even when the inspiratory pO2 is considered to be “normoxic.” We therefore raised the question whether HIF-dependent regulation of PHD levels might lead to the adaptation of the PHD-HIF oxygen-sensing system to a given tissue pO2, rather than simply accelerating HIFα destruction following re-oxygenation. Such a self-regulatory loop might define a tissue-specific threshold for HIFα activation as a function of local pO2. Cell Culture—All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose, containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose (Sigma) to maintain cellular energy metabolism during prolonged hypoxic culturing. Culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-Hif1a+/+ and MEF-Hif1a–/– and mouse hepatoma Hepa1 and Hepa1c4 were cultured as described before (15Unruh A. Ressel A. Mohamed H.G. Johnson R.S. Nadrowitz R.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For long term hypoxia, MEFs were grown under 2% O2 for up to 256 h in a gas-controlled glove box to allow for handling of the cells under constant pO2 (InvivO2 400, Ruskinn Technologies, Leeds, UK). Cells were grown on 145-mm culture dishes and split every 48 h. Reagents used for splitting and permanent culturing were pre-equilibrated to the pO2 in the glove box before use. For oxygen titration, a single batch of transfected MEF-Hif1a–/– cells was distributed into different hypoxic incubators (Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) and simultaneously cultured for the indicated time periods. Protein Extractions and Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were washed twice and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Soluble cellular protein was extracted with a high salt extraction buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 essentially as described before (17Martin F. Linden T. Katschinski D.M. Oehme F. Flamme I. Mukhopadhyay C.K. Eckhardt K. Tröger J. Barth S. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. Blood. 2005; 105: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method, and 50–80 μg of protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-human HIF-1α mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-human PHDs rabbit polyclonal antibodies, Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); anti-V5 tag mAb, Invitrogen; anti-β-actin mAb, Sigma; horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, Pierce. Anti-human PHD3 mAb was kindly provided by P. J. Ratcliffe (Oxford, UK). Bound antibodies were detected with ECL substrate (Pierce), and chemiluminescence was quantified with a CCD camera-based light imaging system (FluorChem8900, AlphaInnotech, Witec, Littau, Switzerland) using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). mRNA Quantification—Exposure of mice to inspiratory 0.1% carbon monoxide or 7.5% oxygen and serum erythropoietin quantifications by radioimmunoassay have been published previously (18Wenger R.H.

Total RNA from tissue and cells was purified as described before (17Martin F. Linden T. Katschinski D.M. Oehme F. Flamme I. Mukhopadhyay C.K. Eckhardt K. Tröger J. Barth S. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. Blood. 2005; 105: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and RNA integrity was monitored by denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Stratascript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). mRNA levels for mouse carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX, glucose transporter (GLUT) 1, erythropoietin, and PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 were quantified with 2 μl of diluted cDNA reaction (corresponding to 1% of cDNA reaction) by real time RT-PCR. A SybrGreen qPCR reagent kit (Sigma) was used in combination with an MX3000P light cycler (Stratagene). Initial template concentrations of each sample were calculated by comparison with serial dilutions of a calibrated standard. To control for equal input levels, ribosomal protein S12 mRNA was determined, and data were expressed as ratios relative to S12 levels. Melting point analyses of amplified PCR products were performed after each run to verify specific amplification. For primer sequences see Supplemental Material. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids encoding full-length mouse HIF-1α, both wild-type and P402A and/or P563A mutants (note that all amino acid numbering corresponds to mouse HIF-1α sequences), were a kind gift of L. Poellinger (Stockholm, Sweden). A PCR product spanning the HIF-1α ODD region (amino acids 359–685) was cloned into the EcoRI site of pM3-VP16 (Clontech) to obtain one-hybrid constructs harboring an N-terminal GAL4 DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal VP16 transactivation domain. Resulting plasmids were termed G4.mHIF(359–685).VP16_wt, G4.mHIF(359–685).VP16_P402A, G4.mHIF(359–685).VP16_P563A, and G4.mHIF(359–685).VP16_PP/AA. For overexpression in mammalian cells, full-length human PHD2 and PHD3 (kindly provided by W. Kaelin, Jr., Boston, and I. Flamme, Wuppertal, Germany, respectively) were subcloned into pENTR4 and recombined into pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Similarly, vectors for expression of GST-tagged PHD isoforms in Sf9 insect cells were constructed by recombining coding sequences for PHD2 and PHD3 into pDEST20 (Invitrogen). All primary cDNA inserts were sequenced (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Transient Transfections—Cells were co-transfected with the indicated amounts of DNA using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Therefore, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes to subconfluency, and 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl containing a DNA/polyethyleneimine mixture (1:5, w/w) was added. For co-transfections, total DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Following overnight incubation, the cells were trypsinized and divided onto 12-well plates for luciferase assays and 100-mm dishes for immunoblotting. Luciferase Assays—MEF-Hif1a–/– cells were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of the indicated G4.mHIF(359–685).VP16 fusion constructs and up to 8 μg of the respective V5.PHD isoform, along with 1 μg of the GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid pGRE5xE1b, containing the firefly luciferase gene under control of E1b promoter and five GAL4 response elements (kind gift of D. Peet, Adelaide, Australia). Identical amounts of total DNA were transfected in each experimental setting. Following transfection, cultures were grown for an additional 24 h at the indicated oxygen concentration and lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase reporter gene activity was determined in a microplate luminometer (Berthold, Regensdorf, Switzerland) using luciferase firefly substrate (Promega). Protein concentration in the lysates was determined by a Bradford assay, and relative luciferase activity was calculated from the ratio between relative light units and micrograms of protein. RNA Interference—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells per single well of a 6-well plate. The day after, cells were transfected in fresh media with 80 nm siRNA duplexes targeting either human PHD2 (5′-ggacgaaagccaugguugcuuguua-3′, sense strand) or PHD3 (5′-gcuauccgggaaauggaacagguua-3′, sense strand) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 4 h of culturing at 20% oxygen, cells were subjected to the indicated oxygen concentrations and grown for an additional period of 24 h prior to lysis. Expression and Purification of PHDs—GST·PHD2 and GST·PHD3 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 80 h of infection, Sf9 cells were lysed in ice-cold 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm glycine, and 10 μm dithiothreitol. Crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were incubated with equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound protein was eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 2 μm FeSO4. Purity of recombinant proteins was estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Prolyl 4-Hydroxylation Assays—Enzymatic activity of recombinant PHD2 and PHD3 was determined by an in vitro hydroxylation assay performed essentially as described before (17Martin F. Linden T. Katschinski D.M. Oehme F. Flamme I. Mukhopadhyay C.K. Eckhardt K. Tröger J. Barth S. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H.

Briefly, biotinylated mouse HIF-1α-derived peptides (amino acids 555–573, either wild-type or P563A mutant) were bound to NeutrAvidin-coated 96-well plates (Pierce). Hydroxylase reactions using purified recombinant GST·PHD2 or GST·PHD3 enzyme were carried out for 1 h at room temperature. A polycistronic expression vector for His6- and thioredoxin-tagged pVHL/elongin B/elongin C (VBC) complex was kindly provided by S. Tan (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA). VBC was expressed in bacteria, purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and allowed to bind to the hydroxylated peptides. Bound VBC complex was detected by rabbit antithioredoxin antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate kit (Pierce). The peroxidase reaction was stopped by adding H2SO4, and absorbance was determined at 450 nm in a microplate reader. For oxygen titration experiments, the assay was performed in the hypoxic glove box. All reagents and solutions were allowed to equilibrate to the indicated oxygen concentration. Inter-assay comparability was guaranteed by calibration of each experiment to an internal standard curve using hydroxyproline-containing peptides. mRNA Levels of Inducible PHD Isoforms Show a Transient Maximum and Remain Up-regulated during Prolonged Hypoxia in Cell Culture—To study the kinetics of PHD expression during prolonged hypoxia (2% O2 for up to 256 h), mRNA levels of all three PHDs were determined in MEF-Hif1a+/+ and MEF-Hif1a–/– cells. PHD2 and PHD3 but not PHD1 mRNA levels were efficiently up-regulated under hypoxic conditions, peaked after 64–112 h, and remained elevated over the entire time course (Fig. 1A). As positive controls, mRNA levels of GLUT1 and CAIX, two well established HIF-1 target genes, were measured in the same time course. Interestingly, hypoxic GLUT1 up-regulation followed a similar kinetics as PHD2 mRNA expression, whereas CAIX levels were maximally induced 48 h later, as observed for PHD3 (Fig. 1A). Because both PHDs were readily induced after 4 h, we investigated the early onset of induction in a shorter time course. Induction of PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA was detectable as early as 60–120 min after hypoxic stimulation (Fig. 1B). None of the PHD isoforms was induced in hypoxic MEF-Hif1a–/– cells, suggesting a non-redundant role of HIF-1α for hypoxic up-regulation of PHD mRNA in these cell lines. In addition, a lack of PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA induction was also observed in functionally HIF-1β/ARNT-deficient mouse Hepa1c4 but not wild-type Hepa1 hepatoma cells after 38 h of hypoxic stimulation (Fig. 1C). Thus, these genetically altered cellular models confirm HIF-1-dependent PHD2 and PHD3 gene expression in both acute and chronic hypoxia, which has been demonstrated previously mainly in siRNA experiments (12Marxsen J.H.

Tissue-dependent Hypoxic Induction of PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA in Mice—To date, no systematic investigation on hypoxic PHD mRNA induction in vivo was available. Thus, we assessed the grade of hypoxic PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA induction in acutely and chronically hypoxic mice. To examine the effects of acute hypoxia, mice were treated for 4 h with an inspiratory gas mixture containing 0.1% carbon monoxide (CO), which induced a rapid onset of severe hypoxia by blocking ∼50% of the oxygen-binding sites in hemoglobin (data not shown). Strong hypoxic induction of erythropoietin mRNA content in kidney as well as erythropoietin and GLUT1 mRNA in liver and brain confirmed the activation of the HIF system in these mice (Fig. 2). The various PHD mRNA isoforms showed a broad disparity of hypoxic activation; PHD1 was not markedly regulated by hypoxia in most tissues; PHD2 was widely induced by hypoxia, albeit at rather low levels; and PHD3 was strongly induced already following 4 h of tissue hypoxia in the lung (15.6-fold), liver (5.2-fold), and kidney (3.8-fold), but only moderate induction factors similar to PHD2 were observed in other organs. Of note, striated muscle tissue (heart and to some extent tongue) showed the highest normoxic expression values for the inducible PHD2 and PHD3 isoforms. To investigate the kinetics of PHD mRNA induction under chronically hypoxic conditions, mice were exposed to inspiratory hypoxia (7.5% O2) from 24 to 72 h, and mRNA levels were determined in liver, kidney, and brain. Although erythropoietin mRNA expression was induced to a similar extent in kidney and brain already after 24 h of hypoxia, erythropoietin mRNA in liver did not increase until 72 h of hypoxic exposure (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous findings, serum levels of erythropoietin protein in these animals highly correlated with mRNA levels in kidney (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, the hypoxic inducibility of the known HIF target genes GLUT1 and CAIX was rather small. Although strong hypoxic induction of both proteins in tumors and tumor-derived cell lines is well established, they were not induced in liver; only one of them (CAIX) was induced after prolonged hypoxia in kidney, and both of them showed a transient induction in brain (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, these results confirmed the hypoxic status of the animals. Comparable results were obtained with the inducible PHD2 and PHD3 isoforms; only PHD2 showed a small, transient increase in the liver; only PHD3 was induced after prolonged hypoxia in the kidney; and both of them were transiently induced in the brain. Thus, under physiological inspiratory hypoxia, regulation of these genes appears to be more subtle than under in vitro conditions, in tumor hypoxia, or following severe tissue hypoxia in CO-treated mice. Hypoxic Induction of PHD2 and PHD3 Proteins Is Accompanied by Decreased HIF-1α Protein Levels—Hypoxic up-regulation of PHD2 and PHD3 has the potential to affect protein abundance of HIF-1α during prolonged hypoxia. To further elaborate this hypothesis, we quantified protein levels of HIF-1α as well as PHD2 and PHD3 in different cell lines. As exemplarily shown for HEK293 cells, endogenous HIF-1α protein levels decreased concomitantly with the hypoxic increase of endogenous PHD2 and PHD3 levels when cells were cultured for up to 72 h at 1% O2 (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained from lysates that were prepared under strictly hypoxic conditions, ruling out the possibility that increased levels of induced PHD enzymes might have influenced the protein levels of HIF-1α during lysis. HIF-1α mRNA levels in HEK293 were not significantly altered under the same hypoxic conditions, whereas PHD2 and PHD3 mRNAs were readily induced after 4 h of hypoxia (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, hypoxic PHD3 mRNA induction was steadily induced during the entire hypoxic incubation, whereas PHD2 mRNA levels reached maximal induction already before 4 h of hypoxia and remained constant for up to 72 h of hypoxia. A similar pattern of HIF-1α and PHD protein levels was observed in HeLa and Hep3B cells at oxygen concentrations as low as 0.2%, supporting the idea of a widespread regulative mechanism (see supplemental Fig. 1). These observations suggest that even under very limited oxygen supply, HIF-1α hydroxylation by PHDs functionally persists, implicating that HIF-1α turnover might be controlled by the PHD sensor system not only under normoxic conditions but also under severely hypoxic conditions. A Second Hypoxic Insult Activates Another HIF-1α Response in Cells Adapted to Chronic Hypoxia—If the novel HIF-1α protein base line following adaptation to chronic hypoxia indeed resulted from an altered steady state of the HIF-PHD oxygen-sensing circuit, the adapted cells should react to a second, more severe hypoxic insult by acutely inducing HIF-1α to a similar extent as at the first hypoxic insult. To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells were allowed to adapt to 1% oxygen for 72 h before they were exposed to 0.2% oxygen for up to 4 h. Although HIF-1α levels markedly decreased during chronic hypoxia, a rapid re-accumulation of HIF-1α protein was already observed 1 h after exposing the cells to 0.2% oxygen (Fig. 4C). A similar result was obtained when cells adapted to chronic hypoxia were treated with the PHD inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), suggesting that PHDs are responsible for HIF-1α regulation even in hypoxically adapted cells (Fig. 4D). PHD2 and PHD3 Silencing Increases Hypoxic HIF-1α Accumulation—As in HEK293 cells, simultaneous treatment of HeLa cells with hypoxia together with the PHD inhibitor DMOG led to additional accumulation of HIF-1α at oxygen concentrations as low as 0.2% (Fig. 5A). To provide further evidence that endogenous PHDs control HIF-1α protein levels even under hypoxic conditions, we applied siRNA to knock down PHD2 and PHD3 in HeLa cells. Interestingly, silencing of either PHD2 or PHD3 equally increased HIF-1α levels, irrespective of whether the cells were cultured at 20 or 1% oxygen (Fig. 5B). Although apparently both isoforms are involved in regulating HIF-α stability over a broad range of oxygen concentrations, combined silencing of PHD2 together with PHD3 most efficiently up-regulated HIF-1α at 20% as well as 1% O2 (Fig. 5B)."

https://openalex.org/W2148099781,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells possess the ability to renew themselves while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into virtually all cell types of the body. Current evidence suggests that ES cells maintain their pluripotent state by expressing a battery of transcription factors including Oct4 and Nanog. However, little is known about how ES cells maintain the expression of these pluripotent factors in ES cells. Here we present evidence that Oct4, Nanog, and FoxD3 form a negative feedback loop to maintain their expression in pluripotent ES cells. First, Oct4 maintains Nanog activity by directly activating its promoter at sub-steady-state concentration but repressing it at or above steady-state levels. On the other hand, FoxD3 behaves as a positive activator of Nanog to counter the repressive effect of Oct4. The expression of Oct4 is activated by FoxD3 and Nanog but repressed by Oct4 itself, thus, exerting an important negative feedback loop to limit its own activity. Indeed, overexpression of either FoxD3 or Nanog in ES cells failed to increase the concentration of Oct4 beyond the steady-state concentration, whereas knocking down either FoxD3 or Nanog reduces the expression of Oct4 in ES cells. Finally, overexpression of Oct4 or Nanog failed to compensate the loss of Nanog or Oct4, respectively, suggesting that both are required for ES self-renewal and pluripotency. Our results suggest the FoxD3-Nanog-Oct4 loop anchors an interdependent network of transcription factors that regulate stem cell pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2023080925,"Although disk accretion onto compact objects-white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes-is central to much of high-energy astrophysics, the mechanisms that enable this process have remained observationally difficult to determine. Accretion disks must transfer angular momentum in order for matter to travel radially inward onto the compact object. Internal viscosity from magnetic processes and disk winds can both in principle transfer angular momentum, but hitherto we lacked evidence that either occurs. Here we report that an X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in an observation of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655 - 40 (ref. 6) must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the disk. Detailed spectral analysis and modelling of the wind shows that it can only be powered by pressure generated by magnetic viscosity internal to the disk or magnetocentrifugal forces. This result demonstrates that disk accretion onto black holes is a fundamentally magnetic process."
https://openalex.org/W2074004676,"Iron acquisition in Arabidopsis depends mainly on AtIRT1, a Fe2+ transporter in the plasma membrane of root cells. However, substrate specificity of AtIRT1 is low, leading to an excess accumulation of other transition metals in iron-deficient plants. In the present study we describe AtIREG2 as a nickel transporter at the vacuolar membrane that counterbalances the low substrate specificity of AtIRT1 and possibly other iron transport systems in iron-deficient root cells. AtIREG2 is co-regulated with AtIRT1 by the transcription factor FRU/FIT1, encodes a membrane protein, which has 10 putative transmembrane domains and shares homology with vertebrate Fe2+ exporters. Heterologous expression of AtIREG2 in various yeast mutants, however, did not demonstrate an iron transport function. Instead, expression in wild-type and nickel-sensitive cot1 yeast cells conferred enhanced tolerance to elevated concentrations of nickel at acidic pH. A role in vacuolar substrate transport was further supported by localization of AtIREG2-GFP fusion proteins to the tonoplast in Arabidopsis suspension cells and root cells of intact plants. Transgenic plants overexpressing AtIREG2 showed an increased tolerance to elevated concentrations of nickel, whereas T-DNA insertion lines lacking AtIREG2 expression were more sensitive to nickel, particularly under iron deficiency, and accumulated less nickel in roots. We therefore propose a role of AtIREG2 in vacuolar loading of nickel under iron deficiency and thus identify it as a novel component in the iron deficiency stress response.

We therefore propose a role of AtIREG2 in vacuolar loading of nickel under iron deficiency and thus identify it as a novel component in the iron deficiency stress response. Iron deficiency in plants is visually expressed as chlorosis, first appearing in the youngest developing leaves and accompanied by a reduction in growth rate, dry matter production, and in most cases by a decrease of iron concentration (1Marschner H. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, London1995: 313-334Crossref Google Scholar). At the same time, root uptake capacities and leaf concentrations of other divalent metal cations increase (2von Wirén N. Mori S. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Cohen C.K. Fox T.C. Garvin D.F. Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In soils or nutrient solutions with unbalanced microelement supply, iron deficiency can then promote the toxicity of other transition metals (4Agarwala S.C. Bisht S.S. Sharma C.P. Can. J. Bot. 1977; 55: 1299-1307Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Fontes R.L.F. Cox F.R. J. Plant Nutr. 1998; 21: 1723-1730Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such toxicity seems also to be the case with nickel, supported by the observation that phytotoxicity of nickel decreased with increasing iron:nickel ratios in the leaf tissue (6Crooke W.M. Hunter J.G. Vergnano O. Ann. Applied Biol. 1954; 41: 311-324Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Kukier U. Chaney R.L. J. Environ. Qual. 2001; 30: 1949-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, an increased sensitivity to heavy metals under iron deficiency might represent a secondary, growth-limiting factor besides the lack of iron itself. Molecular studies in yeast showed that an iron deficiency-induced accumulation of transition metals other than iron was explained by a higher activity of non-selective low affinity iron transport. Deletion of FET3, an essential component for high affinity iron uptake in yeast, leads to a constitutive iron-deficient phenotype and a concomitant up-regulation of FET4, which encodes a low affinity Fe(II) transporter with poor substrate selectivity (8Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As a consequence, sensitivity to elevated concentrations of the transition metals cobalt, copper, zinc, and manganese was higher in fet3 mutants than in the corresponding wild type, consistent with increased metal accumulation (8Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, iron-dependent overaccumulation of divalent metal cations was found to be mediated by the Fe(II) transporter AtIRT1, which in fact transports a broad range of transition metals (9Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Atirt1 T-DNA insertion lines no longer accumulated manganese, zinc, and cobalt under iron deficiency and even showed an increased tolerance to toxic levels of cadmium (10Vert G.A. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulation of certain transition metals in iron-deficient Arabidopsis plants directly depends on AtIRT1 and appears as an unavoidable side effect of iron deficiency-induced iron acquisition. In the search for genes that might be involved in metal transport in Arabidopsis roots, homology to iron export proteins from animals pointed to the Arabidopsis gene At5g03570, named AtIREG2. The derived amino acid sequence of AtIREG2 shares 34.8% similarity to IREG1 (iron-regulated protein) from mouse, which encodes a iron exporter located in the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes. IREG1 mediates iron transport across the basolateral membrane into the extracellular lumen of the portal circulation, where it is bound as Fe3+ to transferrin (11McKie A.T. Marciani P. Rolfs A. Brennan K. Wehr K. Barrow D. Miret S. Bomford A. Peters T.J. Farzaneh F. Hediger M.A. Hentze M.W. Simpson R.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). IREG1 is not only expressed in duodenal enterocytes but is present in all cells in which iron export appears as a major function, such as placental cells, macrophages, and the yolk sac of nonmammalian vertebrates like zebra fish (12Donovan A. Brownlie A. Zhou Y. Shepard J. Pratt S.J. Moynihan J. Paw B.H. Drejer A. Barut B. Zapata A. Law T.C. Brugnara C. Lux S.E. Pinkus G.S. Pinkus J.L. Kingsley P.D. Palis J. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Zon L.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). These findings suggested a similar role of AtIREG2 in iron export. To unravel the function of AtIREG2 in the cellular homeostasis of transition metals, we tested functionality in yeast, investigated membrane localization of GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.4The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. protein fusions and analyzed transgenic plants either lacking the expression or overexpressing AtIREG2. Our results identify AtIREG2 as an as yet unrecognized component in metal homeostasis required to circumvent toxicity of nickel in iron-deficient Arabidopsis plants. Plasmids, Transgenic Plants, and Yeast Growth—DNA manipulations were carried out using standard protocols (13Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd.

The open reading frame (ORF) of AtIREG2 was amplified by PCR from an Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 cDNA library (kindly provided by Karin Schumacher, ZMBP, Tübingen, Germany) using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAGGAGGAAACAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCGAGCTCTCATGAAGCAAAAAAGTTGTTC-3′. PCR products were A-tailed, cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pDR195 (14Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) at the NotI site. The cDNA of AtIRT1 was subcloned from pFL61-AtIRT1 (kindly provided by C. Curie) into pDR195 at the NotI sites. For transient expression of an AtIREG2-GFP fusion protein in protoplasts, the AtIREG2 ORF without a stop codon was amplified using the primers 5′-GGATCCATGGAGGAGGAAACAGAAACTAGG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTGAAGCAAAAAAGTTGTTCAAAGG-3. The PCR product was inserted into the pGEM®-T Easy Vector and subcloned at the BamHI sites into the plant transformation vector pCF203 (kindly provided by C. Frankhauser, ETH Zuerich) under control of a CaMV-35S promoter and fused at the 3′-end to a gene encoding GFP. For the generation of Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtIREG2, a modified transformation vector based on pGreenII (44Hellens R.P. Edwards E.A. Leyland N.R. Bean S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) was used for insertion of the AtIREG2 ORF from pGEM-T into pGreen0229-35S between the CaMV-35S promoter and CaMV terminator sequences using the BamHI/PstI sites. The construction of a plant transformation vector for stable expression of a AtIREG2 promoter:AtIREG2-GFP fusion in Arabidopsis was based on the binary vector pTkan, which was derived from pPZP212 (15Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). To generate a new multiple cloning site, the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGAGGGCCCGGGACGTCCGCGGAGATCTACGCGTGTCGACTCGAGATATCCAACTAGTTGGCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GCCAACTAGTTGGATATCTCGAGTCGACACGCGTAGATCTCCGCGGACGTCCCGGGCCCT-3′ were hybridized and cloned into pTkan at the XbaI/PstI restriction sites resulting in pTkan+. The AtIREG2-GFP fusion was excised from the vector CF203 with Acc65I and PstI. A blunt end was created at the Acc65I cutting site and subcloned into the PstI/EcoRV restriction sites of pTkan+. A 1794-bp AtIREG2 promoter fragment was amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-TTCTGCAGTTCTTCTGACTACTTTGATTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGCCGAAGCTCAGGGAGAG-3′. The resulting PCR product was A-tailed, cloned into pGEM-T Easy, digested with NotI and subcloned into the pTkan+-AtIREG-GFP construct at the Bsp120I restriction site resulting in the plasmid pTkan+-AtIREG2 promoter-AtIREG2-GFP. The resulting binary plasmids were introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101:pMP90 and selected on 100 μg ml-1 rifampicin, 40 μg ml-1 gentamycin, and 100 μg ml-1 spectinomycin. Agrobacterium cells were pretransformed with pSoup to allow replication of the pGreen construct. A. thaliana Col-0 plants or tireg2-1 T-DNA insertion lines were then transformed via agrobacteria using the floral-dip method (16Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformants were selected on BASTA (pGreen) or 75 μg ml-1 kanamycin (pTkan+-AtIREG2 promoter-AtIREG2-GFP). The pTkan+-AtIREG2-promoter:AtIREG2-GFP construct was used for complementation of the ireg2-1 T-DNA insertion line (see below). Homozygous plants were identified in the T2 generation based on segregation analysis on 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin). Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines SALK_074442 (ireg2-1) and SALK_127071 (ireg2-2) were obtained from the stock of T-DNA insertion lines provided by SALK (17Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J.

To verify homozygosity in line ireg2-1, AtIREG2 forward primer 5′-TTTCCTCGACTTCGATTTGGT-3′ and AtIREG2 reverse primer 5′-CCATCGAGCAAGAAAATAGCC-3′, were used to amplify the wild-type AtIREG2 gene. To screen for the T-DNA insertion, PCR was performed with the reverse primer (see above) and the T-DNA left border primer LBb1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′). For line ireg2-2 the forward primer 5′-CGAAAAATTGAAAATCGAACTCAAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TGATCAGACCTTGCACCCCAT-3′ were used as gene-specific primers. The presence of the T-DNA insertion in ireg2-1 was verified by PCR with the reverse primer and LBb1 (see above). The location of the T-DNA insertion in both lines was determined by sequencing of the PCR product. Yeast cells were transformed by the LiAc method (18Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar) and transformants were selected on uracil-deficient medium containing 1% arginine as nitrogen source and the appropriate supplements. To support growth of the fet3fet4 mutant, solid YNB medium contained additionally 30 μm FeCl3, while the liquid YPD medium was acidified to pH 5.0 with HCl. For growth tests, saturated cultures of yeast transformants were spotted in 5-fold serial dilutions onto uracil-deficient YNB medium, containing 0.1% arginine, 3% glucose, 0.01% of each, histidine, leucine, methionine (when appropriate) that were supplemented with the respective metal as indicated.

Germination, preculture, growth conditions for the transition metal accumulation assay and Northern blot analysis of wild-type plants under heavy metal stress were conducted according to Loqué et al.

For Northern analysis, 20 μg of total root or shoot RNA were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA fragments obtained by NotI restriction digests from pDR195-AtIREG2 and pFL61-AtIRT1 were used as probes. In plate growth tests on different micronutrient or heavy metal concentrations, seeds of wild-type and transgenic plants were germinated in long day conditions in a growth chamber on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa, Haarlem, NL), 1% sucrose, solidified with 0.7% Difco agar (Becton Dickinson) and supplemented with metals at indicated concentrations. Plants were continued to grow on vertical plates for determination of root length. A 63Ni accumulation assay was conducted with 6-week-old wild-type plants, precultured under iron deficiency for 2-5 days. Plants were transferred to 20 μm 63NiSO4 for 30 min, and then roots were washed for 10 min with EDTA, pH 5.7. For 63Ni analysis plants were washed twice at 500 °C before and after wet digestion with 65% HNO3, resuspended in 2 ml of 1% HCl and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. For subcellular localization, Arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed as described previously (21Liu L.H. Ludewig U. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transformed protoplasts were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCP-SP Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Localization experiments with ireg2-1 recomplemented lines (see above) were conducted with homozygous T2 plants using an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with an ApoTome (Zeiss Axiovert 200 m, Jena, Germany). Plant roots were stained with 25 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min and shortly rinsed in ultra pure water before observation under the microscope. AtIREG2 Encodes an Iron-regulated Membrane Protein Related to Vertebrate Fe2+ Exporters—A phylogenetic analysis of eukaryote and prokaryote sequences with the highest similarity to Arabidopsis IREG2 clearly pointed to a separation of a plant cluster from an animal cluster, with particular high sequence conservation among mammalian sequences. AtIREG1 (At2g38460) and AtIREG2, which share 84.6% sequence similarity, fell into a first and AtIREG3 (At5g26820) into a second clade, both of these clades harboring an additional sequence from rice (Fig. 1A). To verify an iron-dependent regulation of AtIREG2, a Northern analysis was conducted with hydroponically grown Arabidopsis plants cultured under different iron regimes. Transcript levels of AtIREG2 in roots were up-regulated under iron deficiency and down-regulated after resupply of iron (Fig. 1B), similar to the Fe2+ transporter gene AtIRT1 (22Vert G.A. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). AtIREG2 Increases Nickel Tolerance in Yeast—Because of its homology with vertebrate iron exporters, we assumed a iron export function and tested in heterologous systems whether AtIREG2 might alleviate iron toxicity in iron-sensitive yeast strains. Neither the AFT1up strain, which exhibits a constitutive overexpression of genes involved in iron acquisition (23Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), nor ccc1, a mutant suffering from a lower capacity to transport iron into the vacuole, showed different growth on medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of iron when expressing AtIREG2 (data not shown). To test an iron import function AtIREG2 was expressed in the iron uptake-defective yeast mutant fet3fet4 (24Spizzo T. Byersdorfer C. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar) for a growth complementation test on 4-10 μm Fe(III). Growth of AtIREG2 transformants, however, did not differ significantly from that of control transformants (data not shown). In general, plant iron transporters such as AtIRT1 or AtNRAMPs discriminate poorly between iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, and cadmium (10Vert G.A. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 25Thomine S. Wang R. Ward J.M. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to screen for a heavy metal transport function of AtIREG2 employing yeast mutants with increased heavy metal sensitivities, like smf1, vma1, and cot1 at increasing concentrations of different transition metals (26Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 27Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Expression of AtIREG2 in a cot1 deletion strain reversed its nickel sensitivity (Fig. 2). Remarkably, AtIREG2-mediated tolerance to nickel was only observed at pH 5, but could not be observed at pH 6 or higher. This pH-dependent contribution of AtIREG2 to nickel tolerance pointed to a putative function of AtIREG2 in proton-dependent heavy metal export from the cytoplasm into the vacuole. Intracellular Localization of AtIREG2 in Planta—To examine the intracellular localization of AtIREG2 in planta, a GFP cDNA was fused to the 3′-end of AtIREG2 and the fusion construct was placed under control of a 35S promoter for transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts derived from a suspension cell culture. As observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, AtIREG2-dependent green fluorescence appeared as ring-shaped structures (Fig. 3A). A comparison to the transmission view and merging both images allowed identification of these globular compartments as vacuoles. Even in fully differentiated cells with large vacuoles, a small cytoplasmic region including organellar structures separated the AtIREG2-dependent fluorescence from the plasma membrane, clearly indicating tonoplast localization (Fig. 3A). In contrast, fluorescence derived from GFP alone localized to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus. In an independent approach, transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing an AtIREG2-GFP construct under control of a 1.8-kb fragment of the endogenous AtIREG2 promoter were analyzed (Fig. 3B). In root cortex cells, green fluorescence derived from AtIREG2-GFP was localized internal of red fluorescence derived from the lipophilic dye FM4-64, which labels the plasma membrane after short term incubation (29Takano J. Miwa K. Yuan L.X. von Wiren N. Fujiwara T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12276-12281Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that AtIREG2 is targeted to vacuolar membranes and suggested a role of AtIREG2 in substrate transport across the tonoplast. Overexpression of AtIREG2 Results in Enhanced Nickel Tolerance—Based on the enhanced tolerance to nickel of yeast cells transformed with AtIREG2, we investigated whether overexpression of AtIREG2 also increases tolerance to elevated concentrations of this metal in planta. Transgenic plants expressing AtIREG2 under control of the constitutive 35S promoter were generated and four independent homozygous lines were examined in the T2 generation. RNA gel blot analysis using plants grown under iron-sufficient conditions showed that AtIREG2 was highly expressed in roots of the lines 1, 4, and 10, while mRNA levels in line 7 were only slightly increased relative to the wild-type expression level (Fig. 4A). When seeds were germinated and grown for 12 days on agar plates supplemented with 100 or 200 μm nickel, wild-type seedlings experienced a severe loss of biomass (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the gain of fresh weight by the AtIREG2 overexpressor lines 1, 4, and 10 was unaffected even at 200 μm NiCl2. In agreement with its lower expression level of AtIREG2, line 7 showed an intermediate response with higher fresh weight than the wild type at 100 μm nickel but a similar reduction in fresh weight as wild-type plants at 200 μm nickel. This differential growth response was also reflected by visible signs of plant health. Wild-type plants developed chlorosis at 50 μm nickel and germinated poorly above 100 μm nickel, whereas lines 1, 4, and 10 developed cotyledons even up to 500 μm NiCl2 (supplemental Fig. S1A). To assess whether increased nickel tolerance was restricted to germination, non-stressed seedlings were subjected to different concentrations of nickel for 7 days. At 200 μm NiCl2, root growth was completely arrested in wild-type plants and in line 7, whereas root growth of the overexpressor lines 1, 4, and 10 was not impaired (supplemental Fig. S1B). A phenotypic analysis of the same lines on agar with elevated concentrations of cadmium, cobalt, manganese, zinc, or iron did not yield any significant differences related to the level of AtIREG2 gene expression (data not shown). Moreover, AtIREG2 gene expression levels in roots of wild-type plants were not increased after supply of 20 μm cobalt, cadmium, or nickel (supplemental Fig. S2). To assess the nickel accumulation, Arabidopsis lines were precultured on nutrient solution for 5.5 weeks and then continued to grow on nutrient solution supplemented with 30 μm nickel. After 5 days of nickel treatment, line 7 and wild-type plants started to show a slight growth depression, but nickel accumulation in roots of lines 1, 4, and 10 were approx. 40% higher (Fig. 4C), indicating that a higher nickel tolerance in transgenic lines was related to an enhanced capacity for nickel accumulation in roots. AtIREG2 Plants Accumulate Less Nickel in Roots and Show an Increased Nickel Sensitivity under Iron Deficiency—Two lines were obtained from the SALK collection (SALK_074442 and SALK_127071) (17Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H.M. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N.

Berry C.C. Ecker J.R. Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4111) Google Scholar) that carry T-DNA insertions in the AtIREG2 gene (Fig. 5A). In homozygous progenies from the T3 generation, verified by segregation and PCR analyses, iron deficiency induced expression of AtIREG2 was not detected (Fig. 5B), but plants did not exhibit any visible phenotypes in soil culture. We then grew plants hydroponically for 6 weeks before supplementing the nutrient solution with 10 μm nickel for 10 days. A subsequent analysis of transition metals in shoots yielded no significant differences in accumulation of any measured metal (data not shown), but in roots of both ireg2 insertion lines, nickel concentrations were only half of those of wild-type plants (Fig. 5C). All other metal concentrations in ireg2 roots were similar to wild-type plants. In contrast, overexpression of AtIREG2 led to a significantly higher accumulation in roots of nickel but also of manganese, copper, and zinc (line 10 in Fig. 5C). To confirm that the observed phenotype is indeed caused by loss-of-function of AtIREG2, we retransformed ireg2-1 plants with an AtIREG2-promoter-AtIREG2-GFP construct resulting in high levels of AtIREG2-GFP mRNA (Fig. 6A) and grew homozygous plants from the T2 generation on nickel-supplied agar under different iron regimes. The ireg2-1 insertion lines grew similar to the wild type under iron-sufficient medium supplemented with up to 30 μm nickel (Fig. 6B), while greater than 30 μm nickel-supplied ireg2-1 plants produced significantly less biomass (data not shown) or root growth (Fig. 6C). Under irondeficient growth conditions, however, growth repression of the ireg2-1 insertion line was severe in as little as 20 μm nickel, emphasizing that nickel sensitivity increases with iron deficiency. In comparison, complemented ireg2-1 insertion lines (lines 12 and 19) were less sensitive to nickel and at high nickel supplies, the complemented lines were even less sensitive than the wild type. To exclude the possibility that higher nickel tolerance of iron-sufficient plants was caused by the presence of EDTA in the growth medium, wild-type Arabidopsis plants were precultured for 2-5 days under iron deficiency and then exposed to 20 μm 63Ni for 30 min in the absence of any chelator (supplemental Fig. S3A). Nickel uptake rates clearly increased with iron deficiency emphasizing that nickel uptake relates to the iron nutritional status of the plants. Consistent with its up-regulation under iron deficiency (Fig. 1B), a potential function of IRT1 in iron deficiency-induced nickel uptake was indicated by a higher nickel sensitivity of yeast cells ectopically expressing IRT1 (supplemental Fig. S3B). AtIREG2 Encodes a Nickel Transporter—Iron acquisition by non-graminaceous plant roots, as in yeast cells and the vertebrate intestine, is based on the reduction of ferric iron via a membrane-bound reductase and on the subsequent uptake of ferrous iron across the plasma membrane via a transporter for Fe2+. In most organisms analyzed so far the relevant iron transporters discriminate poorly among transition metals (8Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

The dry form of AMD, which accounts for 90% of cases, is associated with the presence of small yellow “drusen” deposits between the choroid and the retinal pigment epithelium that result in gradual vision loss; about 10-20% of patients with dry AMD go on to develop the more severe wet form.

Factor H is believed to discriminate self from non-self by recognizing polyanionic structures on the former, such as sialic acid and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteoglycans (e.g. heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS)) and thus inhibits complement activation on host surfaces (11Kazatchkine M.D. Fearon D.T.

Purification of Full-length Factor H from Human Serum— Factor H was purified from 400 ml of plasminogen/plasmin-depleted pooled human plasma (HD Supplies, High Wycombe, UK) (17Sim R.B. Day A.J.

Heparin-binding Site Predictions—Previously, coordinates for four models of intact factor H were created from x-ray and neutron scattering data for purified factor H along with homology modeling for 17 of the 20 CCPs based on known NMR structures for factor H (CCP5, CCP15, CCP16) and vaccinia coat protein CCP3 and CCP4 (19Aslam M.

We used three of these models (termed B, C, and D; Protein Data Bank accession code 1haq) to predict heparin-binding sites on factor H in conjunction with a heparin pentasaccharide model of heparin (20Mulloy B.

All possible pairs of CCPs (e.g. CCP1-2, CCP2-3, etc.) were extracted from each model, and XPLOR version 3.8 (22Brünger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Version 3.1.

Autogrid version 3 was used to create the docking grid with a box size of 120 × 120 × 120 points spaced at 0.7 Å intervals, a dielectric constant of 1.0, in which the grid center was positioned at the center of the CCP pair.

Expression and Refolding of FHCCP6-8—Factor H cDNA corresponding to CCP6, CCP7, and CCP8 was amplified from factor H clone PE3 (9Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which encodes the His-384 variant, and was modified by PCR to include NcoI and BamHI restriction sites allowing ligation into a pET14b vector (Merck, Nottingham, UK); primers, which are shown in supplemental table S1, were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). Analysis of the construct on an ABI 3730xl Prism DNA sequencer using the T7 promoter and terminator primers (see supplemental figure Fig. S1) determined that there were no changes to the expected sequence. This construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Merck) using the manufacturer's protocol, expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded using a method described previously for CCP modules (24White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J.R. Fritchley S.J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A.G. Protein Sci. 2004; 9: 2406-2415Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein was purified to homogeneity using anion exchange on a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) equilibrated in 20 mm CAPS, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 10.0, and eluted with a gradient of 130 mm to 1 m NaCl over 20 min. The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was found to be >98% pure where the protein under reducing conditions had a lower mobility than the non-reduced material. One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy at 600 MHz (pH 7.3) indicated that the protein was folded (e.g. up-field shifted methyl resonances were observed), and the presence of disulfide bonds were determined by analysis of trypsin digests by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis (25Day A.J. Aplin R.T. Willis A.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was carried out using PCR with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), as recommended in the manufacturer's manual but using 18 amplification cycles in the reaction; primers (Applied Biosystems) are defined in table S1. Residues Lys-370, Arg-386, and Lys-387 were individually mutated to alanine in the context of the FHCCP6-8(His-384) construct and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis as above. In addition, His-384 was altered to tyrosine. The proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and disulfide mapping as described above. Heparin and Protein Biotinylation—For the biotinylation of unfractionated heparin (the 4th International Standard (4IS) (26Thomas D.P. Curtis A.D. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 52: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Mulloy B. Gray E. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)), 13 μl of a 25 mg/ml solution of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbo-dimide hydrochloride (Sigma, Poole, UK) in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, was added to 7.91 mg of 4IS heparin in 1 ml of 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5. Then 20 ml of 50 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce, Northumberland, UK) in dimethylsulphoxide (freshly made) was added to the heparin/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbo-dimide hydrochloride reaction and left to mix by rotation at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was dialyzed using a 500-molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane (Pierce) against 10 liters of water. The histidine and tyrosine variants of FHCCP6-8 were biotinylated using a similar method. Briefly, 200 μg of protein in 462 μl of water was added to 124 μl 0.2 mg/ml EZlink N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC Biotin (Pierce) in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5, and rotated at room temperature for 1 h. Excess biotin was removed from the reaction mixture using a 250 × 10-mm C5 high perfomance liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK), equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the biotinylated protein was eluted with an 10-80% acetonitrile gradient over 35 min and collected manually. The protein was recovered on a centrifugal evaporator (Holbrook, NY) and reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 8.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3; Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK)). Heparin Affinity Chromatography—The heparin binding properties of His-384 and Tyr-384 variants of FHCCP6-8 were compared with full-length human factor H by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) or a “home-made” column in which 20 mg of 4IS was coupled to 1.5 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma) in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, using the manufacturer's protocol. The 1-ml HiTrap column and ∼1-ml 4IS-column were equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3. Protein (200 μg of recombinant proteins; 100 μg of full-length factor H) was loaded onto the columns (in 1 ml of equilibration buffer), and any unbound material was removed with 5 column volumes of buffer and collected in 1-ml fractions. Protein was eluted from the columns using a linear salt gradient of 130 mm to 1 m NaCl over 20 min by mixing 20 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, with the equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which demonstrated that the species eluting between 340 and 460 or between 170 and 290 mm NaCl, for the HiTrap and 4IS columns, respectively, corresponded to FHCCP6-8/factor H proteins. This approach was also used to determine the relative heparin binding activities of K370A, R386A, and K387A mutants, in which 200 μg of protein was loaded individually onto the HiTrap column. Microtiter Plate Assays—The heparin/HS/DS binding activities of the FHCCP6-8(His-384) and FHCCP6-8(Tyr-384) variants (using biotinylated FHCCP6-8 constructs), and in some cases, full-length factor H (detected with an antibody) were compared using an assay in which the GAGs were immobilized on allylamine-coated EpranEx plates (28Mahoney D.J.

The following GAG preparations were analyzed: unfractionated heparins corresponding to 2IS, 4IS, and 5IS (27Mulloy B. Gray E. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thromb.

The GAGs (200 μl/well; 1 μg) were coated overnight at room temperature onto EpranEx plates in phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma, catalog number A-4503) in standard assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.3) for 90 min at 37 °C. The standard assay buffer was used for all subsequent incubations, dilutions, and washes at room temperature. The proteins were incubated at various concentrations with the immobilized glycosaminoglycans for 4 h. In the case of the biotinylated FHCCP6-8(His-384) and FHCCP6-8(Tyr-384) constructs, bound material was detected by adding 200 μl/well of a 1:10,000 dilution of ExtrAvidin alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, catalog number E-2636) for 30 min. Plates were then developed with 200 μl/well of 1 mg/ml disodium p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 9.3, and developed for 40 min, except for the DS-coated plates that were developed for 50 min. For the full-length protein, the level of binding (to 4IS, HIS, and HSII) was determined by incubation of the plates for 30 min with MRC OX23 (a monoclonal antibody against factor H (18Sim E. Palmer M.S. Puklavec M. Sim R.B. Biosci.

The plates were then developed for 10 min as described above. The absorbance values at 405 nm were determined and corrected against blank wells (i.e. those that contained no GAGs). Alternatively, the unlabeled FHCCP6-8(His-384), FHCCP6-8(Tyr-384), and mutant proteins (i.e. K370A, R386A, K387A in the context of the FHCCP6-8(His-384) construct) were adsorbed at 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline onto microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Kastrup, Denmark), and their ligand binding activities at pH 7.3 were determined using biotinylated 4IS heparin essentially as described in Ref. 21Mahoney D.J.

Plate assays were carried out in 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.3, and the level of bound heparin was determined as described above for the biotinylated proteins. In these plate assays, all data points were determined in quadruplicate from each of two independent experiments. Here we have investigated whether the Y384H polymorphism affects the interaction of factor H with the GAG heparin, as a model both for HS and for polyanions in general. Prediction of Heparin-binding Sites on Factor H—Initially, coordinates for a theoretical model of factor H (19Aslam M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

In CCP7, docking calculations consistently placed the bound pentasaccharide model in close proximity to three basic amino acids (Lys-370, Arg-386, and Lys-387), the latter two of which are adjacent to residue 384 (Fig. 1). Determination of Heparin-binding Residues in CCP7—To investigate the role of the amino acid residues in CCP7 predicted to bind heparin, a recombinant protein composed of CCP6, CCP7, and CCP8 was expressed in E. coli and then used as the basis for site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type protein (His-384 variant, denoted FHCCP6-8(His-384)) was demonstrated to be correctly folded, having the expected disulfide bond arrangement (data not shown), and to bind to heparin in a variety of assays (Fig. 2), providing evidence that this region of factor H is involved in the recognition of polyanions. Mutants were produced in the context of this construct (see supplemental Fig. S1) so that Lys-370, Arg-386, and Lys-387 were individually altered to alanine. One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the mutants all had essentially identical spectra to the wild-type protein (data not shown), indicating that these alterations do not perturb the tertiary structure of the protein. Furthermore, these proteins all had identical disulfide bond patterns. The effect of mutation on heparin binding function was assessed using affinity chromatography or using a microtiter plate assay, in which the proteins were immobilized and the binding of biotinylated heparin was determined essentially as described in Ref. 21Mahoney D.J. Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Blundell C.D. Fries E. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27044-27055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. As can be seen from the chromatograph in Fig. 3A, the R386A and K387A mutants have substantially reduced binding activity when compared with wild-type FHCCP6-8(His-384), eluting from the heparin affinity column at lower NaCl concentrations, whereas mutation of Lys-370 to alanine had no affect. Results from the plate assay were consistent with this (Fig. 3B); however, the K370A protein showed a small reduction in binding. These data indicate that Arg-386 and Lys-387 are both likely to play an important role in heparin binding. This is consistent with an earlier study in which these amino acids were replaced with alanine in a double mutant expressed in the context of CCP1-7, which was shown to have reduced binding to heparin-bovine serum albumin (35Giannakis E. Jokiranta T.S. Male D.A. Ranganathan S. Ormsby R.J. Fischetti V.A. Mold C. Gordon D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); in this case, no structural studies were undertaken to assess the effect of mutagenesis on the protein fold. Furthermore, Giannakis et al. (35Giannakis E. Jokiranta T.S. Male D.A. Ranganathan S. Ormsby R.J. Fischetti V.A. Mold C. Gordon D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that a R369A/K370A double mutant had greatly reduced heparin binding function. Our data indicate that Lys-370 has a minor contribution, if any, to the association with heparin.FIGURE 3Effect of mutagenesis on heparin-binding properties of His-384. Mutants K370A (squares), R386A (diamonds), and K387A (circles) were compared with wild-type protein by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap heparin column (A) and a microtiter plate assay (B) in which the binding of biotinylated heparin (4IS) to immobilized wild-type (WT) and mutant FHCCP6-8(His-384) proteins was determined. In A, the absorbance at 280 nm and the conductivity are shown, and the chromatogram is a representative example of three independent experiments. In B, all values are plotted as mean absorbance (n = 8) ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determining the Role of His-384/Tyr-384 in Heparin Binding—Given that His-384 is in close proximity to the heparin-binding residues on CCP7 (Fig. 1), it seemed plausible that this amino acid may participate in the interaction with heparin and that the histidine and tyrosine variants could have different functional activities. Therefore, FHCCP6-8(His-384) was mutated to tyrosine to generate the FHCCP6-8(Tyr-384) protein, and their heparin binding properties were compared; FHCCP6-8(Tyr-384) was shown to be folded, with correct disulfides, as before. From Fig. 2A, it is apparent that the His-384 variant elutes at lower salt strength than Tyr-384 from the HiTrap heparin affinity column (340 and 390 mm NaCl, respectively), whereas a higher salt strength is required to recover intact factor H. It is not surprising that the full-length protein binds more tightly to the affinity column given that it has at least two sites of heparin binding (i.e. CCP7 and CCP20; see Refs. 33Blackmore T.K.

https://openalex.org/W2139892051,"The globally disseminated Streptococcus pyogenes M1T1 clone causes a number of highly invasive human diseases. The transition from local to systemic infection occurs by an unknown mechanism; however invasive M1T1 clinical isolates are known to express significantly less cysteine protease SpeB than M1T1 isolates from local infections. Here, we show that in comparison to the M1T1 strain 5448, the isogenic mutant delta speB accumulated 75-fold more human plasmin activity on the bacterial surface following incubation in human plasma. Human plasminogen was an absolute requirement for M1T1 strain 5448 virulence following subcutaneous (s.c.) infection of humanized plasminogen transgenic mice. S. pyogenes M1T1 isolates from the blood of infected humanized plasminogen transgenic mice expressed reduced levels of SpeB in comparison with the parental 5448 used as inoculum. We propose that the human plasminogen system plays a critical role in group A streptococcal M1T1 systemic disease initiation. SpeB is required for S. pyogenes M1T1 survival at the site of local infection, however, SpeB also disrupts the interaction of S. pyogenes M1T1 with the human plasminogen activation system. Loss of SpeB activity in a subpopulation of S. pyogenes M1T1 at the site of infection results in accumulation of surface plasmin activity thus triggering systemic spread."

Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 molecules are predominantly sequestered in the cytoplasm. When stimulated with oxidative or electrophilic compounds, Nrf2 proteins can quickly translocate to the nucleus and form heterodimers with bZIP proteins called small Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) proteins (13Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14Motohashi H. O'Connor T. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Nrf2/Maf heterodimer formation can enhance the specificity and binding of Nrf2 to a cis-acting enhancer called antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) (15Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Ishii T. Aburatani H. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8044-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) located in the promoter of many antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes (16Inamdar N.M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Until now, Nrf2 signaling is generally considered to be regulated by a cysteine-rich protein called Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) (20Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 21Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nrf2 forms a dimer with Keap1 in vitro (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar) and probably in vivo as well. An ETGE motif (17Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and a DLG motif (23Katoh Y. Iida K. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Mizukami M. Tong K.I. McMahon M. Hayes J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) of the Neh2 (Nrf2 ECH homology 2) domain of Nrf2 have been elucidated to mediate cooperative binding with the Kelch/double glycine repeat domain of Keap1 (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 24Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Keap1 is an actin-binding protein (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Treatments with compounds to dissolve the cytoskeleton can result in Nrf2 nuclear accumulation (25Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). So the cytosolic sequestering of Nrf2 is attributed to Keap1 retention. Keap1 is also identified as a Cullin 3-dependent adaptor protein for ubiquitin ligase ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligase (26Cullinan S.B. Gordan J.D. Jin J. Harper J.W. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8477-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 27Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Therefore, Nrf2 molecules may not only be sequestered by Keap1 but also subjected to constant degradation. In vitro, the Nrf2/Keap1 dimer can only be formed under reducing conditions (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar) and can be disrupted by the treatment of phyto-oxidant sulforaphane or the phenolic compound tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Some cysteine residues in Keap1, such as Cys-151, Cys-273, and Cys-288, are found to be critical in Nrf2 retention and release (24Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 29Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that Keap1 functions as a redox-switch for Nrf2 signaling (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Whereas reducing conditions favor Keap1 retention of Nrf2, oxidative signals can induce Keap1 to quickly release Nrf2, leading to nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (20Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Although the Keap1 anchoring model seems to successfully explain the repression and activation of Nrf2 signaling in response to the changing redox conditions, some controversial observations are reported recently. It is reported that the cytosolic distribution of Keap1 is maintained by active nuclear export rather than cytoskeleton anchoring (30Velichkova M. Hasson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Karapetian R.N. Evstafieva A.G. Abaeva I.S. Chichkova N.V. Filonov G.S. Rubtsov Y.P. Sukhacheva E.A. Melnikov S.V. Schneider U. Wanker E.E. Vartapetian A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In certain cell lines, such as hepatoma HepG2 and H4IIEC3 cells, remarkably high amounts of endogenous Nrf2 are found in the cell nucleus at unstimulated conditions (32Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Nioi P. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32485-32492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Even if the Keap1 anchoring model is still applicable in these cells, the amount or activity of cytosolic Keap1 proteins may not be sufficient to sequester Nrf2. Furthermore, the basal expression of Nrf2-driven antioxidant genes such as HO-1, the modifier subunit of glutamyl-cysteine ligase, and Prdx1 (peroxiredoxin I) remained unchanged in the livers of Keap1 knock-out mice (33Okawa H. Motohashi H. Kobayashi A. Aburatani H. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Conceptually, the necessity of Keap1 in Nrf2 signaling is based on the assumption that Nrf2 is unable to maintain cytosolic segregation by itself under quiescent conditions. In addition, the redox-switching role of Keap1 assumes that Nrf2 per se lacks redox responsiveness, or the redox responsiveness Nrf2 is functionally irrelevant to its nuclear translocation. To date, only one reactive cysteine is characterized in the basic region of Nrf2 (34Bloom D. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutation of this cysteine to a serine only alters its DNA binding affinity but fails to alter the subcellular localization of Nrf2 (34Bloom D. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data therefore seem to provide further support to those assumptions. However, with the rapid progress in Nrf2 studies, those assumptions may merely reflect our limited knowledge about Nrf2. Recent studies have identified a nuclear export signal (NES) in the ZIP domain of Nrf2 (NESzip) and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the basic region of Nrf2 (bNLS) (35Li W. Jain M.R. Chen C. Yue X. Hebbar V. Zhou R. Kong A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These discoveries raise the question whether Nrf2 possesses other functional NES or NLS motifs. In this study, we identify a new functional NES located in the transactivation (TA) domain of Nrf2. The existence of multiple NES and NLS motifs in Nrf2 enables Nrf2 to maintain cytosolic segregation by itself under quiescent conditions. Furthermore, unlike the NESzip, this NESTA possesses a reactive cysteine residue (Cys-183). An enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged Nrf2 segment (amino acids 162-295), called EGFP-NESTA, exhibited a dosage-dependent nuclear translocation when treated with sulforaphane. Therefore, Nrf2 can sense the redox signal and translocate to the nucleus. These discoveries suggest Nrf2 may be able to transduce redox signals in a Keap1-independent manner. Keap1, however, may provide an additional regulation of the quantity of Nrf2 both at basal and at inducible conditions. Cell Culture and Chemicals—Human cervical squamous cancerous HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells were cultured as monolayer using minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.2 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Leptomycin B was purchased from Calbiochem. Reducing GSH, hydroperoxide (H2O2), diethyl maleate (DEM), and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma. Sulforaphane was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). Rabbit anti-lamin A (H-102), anti-Nrf2 (H-300), mouse anti-GFP (B-2), goat anti-Keap1, anti-HO-1 (C-20), and anti-β-actin (I-19) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (St. Cruz, CA). Plasmid Construction, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Knockdown—Full-length wild type human Nrf2 cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. Yuet W. Kan (University of California, San Francisco) and Jefferson Chan (University of California, Irvine). To examine the two NES-like motifs individually, two segments of Nrf2, NESTA (amino acids 162-295) and NESINT (amino acids 288-485), were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) by XhoI and BamHI digestion. The resulting plasmids were designated EGFP-NESTA and EGFP-NESINT, respectively. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) examination, the PCR-amplified NESTA segment was inserted into the pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech) by XhoI/BamHI digestion. The resulting plasmid was designated as ECFP-NESTA. As a positive control, N-terminal segment (amino acids 1-174) of Nrf2 was also PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pECFP-C1 vector. The resulting plasmid was designated ECFP-Nrf2NT. To examine the interaction between NESTA and Keap1, full-length Keap1 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were designated EYFP-Keap1. For NESTA ectopic expression, GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the ECFP vector or inserted into ECFP-NESTA plasmid by PstI/BamHI digestion to form an ECFP-GAL4DBD or ECFP-NESTA-GAL4DBD chimera. For mutation studies, the key leucine residue of the NESTA (Leu-184) or the reactive cysteine 183 (Cys-183) was substituted with alanine. The mutagenic primers were synthesized and PAGE purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the protocol described previously (35Li W. Jain M.R. Chen C. Yue X. Hebbar V. Zhou R. Kong A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The method of siRNA knockdown of Keap1 has been described in detail before (50Devling T.W. Lindsay C.D. McLellan L.I. McMahon M. Hayes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7280-7285ACrossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with few modifications. The sequence of siRNA primers is 5′-GGCCUUUGGCAUCAUGAACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUUCAUGAUGCCAAAGGCCTG-3′ (antisense). The primers were synthesized, and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. The siRNA primers were annealed to form double strand Keap1 targeting siRNA with TT and TG overhangs and transfected into HeLa cells using the Lipofectamine method. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Activity Assays—Transactivation activity assay has been described in detail before (37Shen G. Hebbar V. Nair S. Xu C. Li W. Lin W. Keum Y.S. Han J. Gallo M.A. Kong A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23052-23060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates at ∼4.0 × 105 cells/well. Twenty four hours after plating, cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine method according to manufacturer's instructions. For each well, 200 ng of ECFP-NESTA-GAL4DBD or its C183A mutant and 50 ng of GAL4-Luc reporter were added into 125 μl of Opti-MEM. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was added into another tube of 125 μl of Opti-MEM in a 1:2.5 ratio to the amount of plasmids and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The plasmid solution was then mixed with Lipofectamine solution with vigorous agitation and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were incubated with transfection complexes for 3 h, changed to fresh minimum essential medium, and cultured for 16 h. Cells were treated with 5 and 12.5 μm sulforaphane for an additional 6 h before harvesting. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped, and incubated in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, 10 μl of lysate was mixed with luciferase substrate (Promega), and the ARE-luciferase activity was measured using a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection System). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method. Luciferase activity was normalized by protein concentration. Cell Fractionation—The protocol to extract nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins has been described before (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes and transfected with 5 μg of plasmids using the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and harvested with cell lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants (cytosolic extract) were collected. Nuclear pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer A and then resuspended in high salt buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9), vortexed, and centrifuged. Supernatants (nuclear extract) were collected. The protein concentration of each sample was measured. To generate homogeneous electrophoretic patterns, cytosolic proteins were diluted in buffer B. 20 μg of nuclear proteins and 10 μg of cytosolic proteins were loaded for immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Twenty four hours after transient transfection of ECFP-Nrf2NT, ECFP-NESTA, and EYFP-Keap1, HeLa cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor. The protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by the Bradford method. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 50 μg of cell lysates expressing ECFP-Nrf2NT or ECFP-NESTA were mixed with 100 μg of cell lysate expressing EYFP-Keap1. The mixture was incubated with 20 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to remove endogenous IgG. Solutions were then incubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-GFP antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, subsequently mixed with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, and tumbled at 4 °C overnight. The IP solutions were then centrifuged. Pellets were washed three times with the lysis buffer. Protein complexes were eluted by loading buffer and heated to 80 °C for 5 min and subsequently analyzed via Western blotting. For Western blotting, either the IP products or lysates containing 20 μg of protein were resolved by 4-15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Fisher). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mg/ml NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.6, at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-Nrf2 (H-300) (1:750), goat anti-Keap1 (1:750), anti-lamin A (1:250), and anti-β-actin (1:1000) in 3% nonfat milk TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with TBST, the membrane was blotted with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using the ECL mixture from Bio-Rad. Epifluorescent Microscopy—Expression and subcellular distribution of EGFP-NESTA/INT or their mutants in response to treatments of LMB or oxidative compounds were examined using a Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescent microscope and a Nikon C-SHG1 UV light source purchased from Micron-Optics (Cedar Knolls, NJ). HeLa cells were cultured on ethanol sterilized glass coverslips and transfected with 1 μg of EGFP-NESTA or its mutants by using the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen) and cultured in minimum essential medium for 24 h. Prior to microscopic examination, some coverslips were briefly fixed in methanol for 2 min, rinsed three times in PBS, and then counterstained with PI (5 μg/ml PI in PBS solution supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A) to visualize the positions of cell nuclei. The EGFP signals were examined using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter, and the PI signals were examined with a Texas Red filter. The epifluorescent images were digitized using a Nikon DXM1200 camera and Nikon ACT-1 software (version 2). Images were superimposed using Adobe Photoshop CS version 8.0. For the kinetics study, the cell numbers exhibiting whole cell or cytosolic distribution pattern in response to sulforaphane treatments were counted. The ratio of whole cell distribution was calculated and plotted against the durations of sulforaphane treatment using a curve fitting software (Origin 7.0) based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. Confocal Microscopy and FRET Assay—To examine ectopic expression, HeLa cells were cultured in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected with plasmids expressing ECFP-GAL4DBD, ECFP-NESTA-GAL4DBD, or its L184A mutant. For FRET assay, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing ECFP-Nrf2NT, ECFP-NESTA, and EYFP-Keap1. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were examined using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a ×63 water-immersion objective. We used a sensitized emission method for the FRET assay (39Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 40Youvan D.C. Marrs B.L. Cell. 1984; 39: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Three filter sets were used to detect the donor (ECFP), acceptor (EYFP), and FRET signals. The FRET signal is corrected for spectral bleed through and contamination of donor and acceptor fluorescence according to Youvan's models (40Youvan D.C. Marrs B.L. Cell. 1984; 39: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as indicated in Equation 1,Fc=(FRET-bgfret)-cfdon×(Don-bgdon)-cfacc×(Acc-bgacc)(Eq. 1) The abbreviations uses are as follows: Fc is FRET concentration; bg is background intensity; cf is correction factor; fret is FRET signal; don is donor signal; and acc is acceptor signal. The FRET concentration was normalized to donor and acceptor concentrations according to Equation 2,Fn=Fc/(Don-bgdon)×(Acc-bgacc)Ac=Fc/(Acc-bgacc)(Eq. 2) For data acquisition, the donor (ECFP) channel was excited with an argon laser line at 457 nm, and the emission was detected using a bandpass filter of 475-525 nm. The acceptor (EYFP) channel was excited at 543 nm and its emission was detected at 545-600 nm. The FRET channel was excited at 457 nm, and the emission was detected at 545-600 nm. For data analysis, we used the LSM510 SP2 software (version 3.2) to subtract donor and acceptor bleed through and normalize against acceptor (EYFP) and donor (ECFP) intensity. Dissecting Individual NES-like Motif of Nrf2—Cytoplasmonuclear transportations are mediated by the importin and exportin proteins. They recognize a specific nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) on cargo proteins (41Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Consensus leucine-rich NES motifs can be formulated as Φ4(X)2-3Φ3(X)2-3Φ2XΦ1, where Φ represents hydrophobic amino acids, and X represents any amino acid (42Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To be a valid NES, Φ1 and Φ2 must be hydrophobic amino acids, and the positions of Φ3 and Φ4 may wobble (42Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In Nrf2, besides the documented NESzip (35Li W. Jain M.R. Chen C. Yue X. Hebbar V. Zhou R. Kong A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), there are several NES-like motifs. In this study, we examined one NES-like motif (175LLSIPELQCLNI186) located in the Neh5 transactivation domain (TA) and one NES-like motif (296LLNGPIDVSDLSL308) located in the intervening domain (INT), with the Φ-corresponding residues underlined. Both NES-like motifs have legitimate hydrophobic residues at the Φ1-3 positions. The Φ4 residue for NESTA is isoleucine 178. The Φ4 residue of NESINT is a glycine 299 residue or a proline 300 residue; none are long chain hydrophobic amino acids. Close to the Gly-299 residue, there are tandem leucines (residues 296-297) and an isoleucine residue (301). To examine whether these two NES-like motifs are functional, we made two enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged chimeras, EGFP-NESTA containing the TA segment of Nrf2 (amino acids 162-295) and EGFP-NESINT containing the INT segment of Nrf2 (amino acids 288-485) (Fig. 1). These two constructs were so designed that they contained no other consensus NES, NLS, or NES/NLS-like motifs. In addition, the elucidated Keap1-binding motifs were also carefully excluded. Nrf2 Possesses a Functional NES Located in the TA Domain—When expressed in HeLa cells, EGFP-NESTA exhibited a predominantly cytosolic distribution"
https://openalex.org/W2162589718,"Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol, which causes apoptosis in cultured cancer cells. We describe a cell surface resveratrol receptor on the extracellular domain of hetero-dimeric alphaVbeta3 integrin in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. This receptor is linked to induction by resveratrol of extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)- and serine-15-p53-dependent phosphorylation leading to apoptosis. The integrin receptor is near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition site on the integrin; an integrin-binding RGD peptide inhibits induction by resveratrol of ERK1/2- and p53-dependent apoptosis. Antibody (Ab) to integrin alphaVbeta3, but not to alphaVbeta5, inhibits activation by resveratrol of ERK1/2 and p53 and consequent apoptosis in estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) positive MCF-7, and ERalpha-negative MDA-MB231 cells. Resveratrol is displaced from the purified integrin by an RGD, but not RGE, peptide, and by alphaVbeta3 integrin-specific Ab. Resveratrol action is blocked by siRNAbeta3, but not by siRNAalphaV. [14C]-Resveratrol binds to commercially purified integrin alphaVbeta3 and to alphaVbeta3 prepared from MCF-7 cells; binding of [14C]-resveratrol to the beta3, but not to the alphaV monomer, is displaced by unlabeled resveratrol. In conclusion, binding of resveratrol to integrin alphaVbeta3, principally to the beta3 monomer, is essential for transduction of the stilbene signal into p53-dependent apoptosis of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996794995,"Many studies have suggested a role for the members of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα12 and Gα13) in oncogenesis and tumor cell growth. However, few studies have examined G12 signaling in actual human cancers. In this study, we examined the role of G12 signaling in prostate cancer. We found that expression of the G12 proteins is significantly elevated in prostate cancer. Interestingly, expression of the activated forms of Gα12 or Gα13 in the PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines did not promote cancer cell growth. Instead, expression of the activated forms of Gα12 or Gα13 in these cell lines induced cell invasion through the activation of the RhoA family of G proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of G12 signaling by expression of the RGS domain of the p115-Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115-RGS) in the PC3 and DU145 cell lines did not reduce cancer cell growth. However, inhibition of G12 signaling with p115-RGS in these cell lines blocked thrombin- and thromboxane A2-stimulated cell invasion. These observations identify the G12 family proteins as important regulators of prostate cancer invasion and suggest that these proteins may be targeted to limit invasion- and metastasis-induced prostate cancer patient mortality. Many studies have suggested a role for the members of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα12 and Gα13) in oncogenesis and tumor cell growth. However, few studies have examined G12 signaling in actual human cancers. In this study, we examined the role of G12 signaling in prostate cancer. We found that expression of the G12 proteins is significantly elevated in prostate cancer. Interestingly, expression of the activated forms of Gα12 or Gα13 in the PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines did not promote cancer cell growth.

These observations identify the G12 family proteins as important regulators of prostate cancer invasion and suggest that these proteins may be targeted to limit invasion- and metastasis-induced prostate cancer patient mortality. It is estimated that over 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5521) Google Scholar). Although the prognosis for patients with early stage prostate cancer has improved, the treatment options for patients with locally advanced disease or metastasis remain few. For this reason, prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in males and will claim the lives of greater than 25,000 American men this year alone (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5521) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is imperative that new strategies be developed to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer, and this requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate prostate cancer invasion and metastasis. Studies over the past three decades have clearly established that signaling through cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PAR-1, protease-activated receptor-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GFR, growth factor-reduced; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. controls many physiologic and pathophysiologic processes (2Rohrer D.K.

However, it is only recently that the functional significance of GPCRs in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis has begun to be appreciated (4Daaka Y. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE2Google Scholar). GPCRs for thrombin (5Tantivejkul K. Loberg R.D. Mawocha S.C. Day L.L. John L.S. Pienta B.A. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. J.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1832-1837PubMed Google Scholar) have all been implicated in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis. The best characterized example is the thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). PAR-1 is preferentially expressed in aggressive prostate cancer lines and in metastatic prostate cancer specimens (5Tantivejkul K. Loberg R.D. Mawocha S.C. Day L.L. John L.S.

Prostate. 2005; 66: 273-282Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies suggest that the activation of PAR-1 increases prostate cancer cell resistance to apoptotic stimuli (5Tantivejkul K. Loberg R.D. Mawocha S.C. Day L.L. John L.S. Pienta B.A. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 96: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), stimulates the expression of angiogenic factors (13Liu J. Schuff-Werner P. Steiner M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and promotes prostate cancer cell invasion (14Yoshida E. Verrusio E.N. Mihara H. Oh D. Kwaan H.C.

Nevertheless, the pathways through which PAR-1 and the GPCRs mentioned above affect prostate cancer cell function are not fully understood. GPCRs alter cellular function primarily through the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins consist of two functional signaling units, a guanine nucleotide binding α-subunit and a βγ-subunit dimer. The α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins can be divided into four families based on sequence homology: Gs,Gi,Gq, and G12 (4Daaka Y. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE2Google Scholar, 16Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). The last of the four families to be identified, the G12 family has been of particular interest to cancer researchers, since its members were found to promote the growth and oncogenic transformation of murine fibroblasts (18Chan A.M. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These findings led to the hypothesis that GPCRs may signal through the G12 proteins to promote tumorigenesis and tumor cell growth (20Radhika V. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, studies that examined the role of the G12 proteins in development found that G12 proteins were not required for cell growth but were critical for cell movement in the developing embryo (21Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Lin F. Sepich D.S. Chen S. Topczewski J. Yin C. Solnica-Krezel L. Hamm H. J.

Cancer. 2005; 5: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that G12 signaling may also play a role in cancer metastasis. Recently, we examined the role of the G12 proteins in human breast cancer. We found that the G12 proteins promote breast cancer metastasis by stimulating cancer cell invasion, not cancer cell growth (30Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Juneja J. Booden M.A. Der C.J. Daaka Y. Dewhirst M.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of G12 signaling in prostate cancer. We found that the G12 proteins are up-regulated in prostate cancer and that signaling through the G12 pathway does not increase prostate cancer cell growth. Rather, activation of G12 induces a striking increase in cancer cell invasiveness. These observations identify G12 family proteins as regulators of prostate cancer invasion and provide support for targeting these proteins in therapeutic strategies to limit invasion- and metastasis-induced patient morbidity and mortality. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies to RhoA, Gαq,Gα12, and Gα13 and the blocking peptide for the Gα12 antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Myc antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal antisera to Gα12 and Gα13 were also obtained from Dr. Stefan Offermanns (University of Heidelberg). Polyclonal antiserum to RGS2 was from Dr. David Siderovski (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Polyclonal antiserum to Gαq was from Dr. Tom Gettys (Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rogue, LA). Recombinant human thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN), and U46619 and tetanolysin were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Growth factorreduced Matrigel was from BD Biosciences, and the fibronectin, from human plasma, was from Sigma. Cell Lines—The PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cell lines were obtained from the Duke University Medical Center Cell Culture Facility. The immortalized prostate epithelial cells (PrECLHS) (31Berger R. Febbo P.G. Majumder P.K. Zhao J.J. Mukherjee S. Signoretti S. Campbell K.T. Sellers W.R. Roberts T.M. Loda M. Golub T.R. Hahn W.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8867-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Phillip Febbo (Duke University, Durham, NC). The PC3 cell line was maintained in F-12K nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The LNCaP and DU145 cell lines were maintained in RPMI (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The PrEC-LHS cells were maintained in a defined medium (PrEGM) from BioWhittaker (Rockland, ME). Adenoviral Infections—The dominant negative Rho kinase adenovirus was obtained from Dr. P. Vasantha Rao (Duke University, Durham, NC). The other recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by subcloning human Gαq(Q209L), Gα12(Q231L), Gα13(Q226L), and HA-RGS2, all from the UMR cDNA Resource (Rolla, MO), Myc-p115-RGS (gift of Dr. Tohru Kosaza, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL), and Mycp115RGS(E29K) (generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the Myc-p115) into the Adtrack-CMV vector (gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center, Baltimore, MD) and then recombining these with pAdEasy-1 in the BJ5183 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting DNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the viruses were serially amplified and purified using Adeno-X™ virus purification kits (BD Biosciences). Cell lines were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5-50, for 6-24 h at 37 °C, and infection efficiencies ranged from 80 to 100% based on GFP expression. Retrovirus Production—Recombinant retroviruses were constructed by subcloning human Gα12(Q231L), Gα13(Q226L), and HA-RGS2, all obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource, and Myc-p115 into the pLXRN vector (Clontech). The DNA constructs were co-transfected into the GP2-293 packaging line (Clontech) using Fugene (Roche Applied Science). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h later, clarified by filtration, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The concentrated virus was used to infect 1 × 106 cells in a 60-mm dish with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). PC3 cells were selected with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cell Invasion Assay—For invasion assays, transwell chamber filters (8-μm pore size, polycarbonate filter, 6.5-mm diameter; Costar) were coated with 50 μg of growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel™. After infection with adenovirus, cells were starved for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, detached with Cellstripper™ (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl were placed into the upper chamber of the transwell with or without agonists. For experiments using C3 toxin, 1 mg of purified C3, and 20 hemolytic units of tetanolysin were added to the cells for 1 h prior to harvesting the cells. For experiments with thrombin or U46619, the cells were treated at the indicated ligand concentration for 2 h prior to harvest and for the duration of the experiment. The upper well of the transwell was then transferred to a well containing 600 μl of 5 μg/ml of fibronectin diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 36 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Cells in the top well were removed with cotton swabs. The membranes were then stained (Hema3 staining kit; Fisher), and the cells were counted using a phase-contrast microscope. Five randomly selected high powered fields were counted for each membrane. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-C3 expression construct was obtained from Judith Meinkoth (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), and the GST-rhotekin-RBD construct was obtained from Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The GST-C3 and GST-rhotekin-RBD proteins were made in the BL21DE3 strain of E. coli (Invitrogen). Briefly, starter cultures from a transformed bacterial colony were grown for 16 h and then used to inoculate 500 ml of LB and grown at 37 °C for 2-3 h until the optical density reached 0.5-0.6. At this point, the cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma), and cultures were grown for an additional 2.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of buffer A (2.3 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) followed by dilution with 10 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a 1:500 protease inhibitor mix). The cells were then passed three times at 10,000 p.s.i. through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. Finally, the beads were washed three times in Buffer B. The C3 toxin was cleaved from the GST domain by gently rocking the beads overnight at 4 °C with 10 units of thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The cleaved product was then dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, visualized by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemistry—Institutional Review Board-approved prostate samples were from Ardais Co. (Lexington, MA). The tissue microarray (catalog no. BR801) was from US Biomax (Rockville, MD). Following paraffin removal and quenching of endogenous peroxidase, 5-μm sections were steamed in 10 mm citrate, pH 6.0, for 15 min in a steamer (catalog no. HS900; Black & Decker) and then incubated with Background Buster ® (Innovex Biosci, Richmond, CA) for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with Gα12 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:100 in phosphatebuffered saline for 1 h, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antisera (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove Park, PA) for 30 min, all at room temperature. Bound immune complex was visualized with diaminobenzidine (Innovex Biosci, Richmond, CA); hematoxylin counterstain (Fisher) was used. The Gα12 staining was graded 0-3+ based on intensity by two independent board-certified pathologists (T. A. F. and J. F. M.), and data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Dunn's multiple comparison test in Prism version 4.0c (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Miscellaneous Methods—The levels of activated Rho were determined using pull-down assays with a GST fusion of the RhoA-binding domain of rhotekin as previously described (32Meigs T.E. Juneja J. DeMarco C.T. Stemmle L.N. Kaplan D.D. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18049-18055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. Western blotting was performed using the Odyssey System (LICOR, Lincoln, Nebraska) according to the manufacturer's instructions. G12 Proteins Are Up-regulated in Invasive, Tumorigenic Prostate Cancer Cell Lines—To assess the biologic significance of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins in prostate cancer, we compared expression of Gα12 and Gα13 in an immortalized prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC LHS) (31Berger R. Febbo P.G. Majumder P.K. Zhao J.J. Mukherjee S. Signoretti S. Campbell K.T. Sellers W.R. Roberts T.M. Loda M. Golub T.R. Hahn W.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8867-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in the three commonly used prostate cancer cell lines: LNCaP, DU145, and PC3. Interestingly, Gα12 and Gα13 expression was significantly higher in the more tumorigenic and invasive DU145 and PC3 (33Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) cell lines than in the less tumorigenic, noninvasive LNCaP cell line (33Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or in the nontransformed prostate epithelial cell line (Fig. 1). This up-regulation appeared to be particularly pronounced for the Gα12 protein (Fig. 1). These data provided the initial evidence that increased G12 signaling may be associated with increased tumorigenicity and/or invasiveness of these two prostate cancer cell lines. Gα12 Is Up-regulated in Pathologic Specimens of Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate—To determine whether the in vitro findings that Gα12 expression is elevated in aggressive prostate cancer cells extended to actual human tissues, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of Gα12 expression in histopathologic specimens taken from patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Anti-Gα12-stained sections of prostate revealed that prostate cancer cells consistently expressed higher levels of Gα12 protein compared with benign prostate epithelial cells within the same tissue section (Fig. 2). Gα12 staining could be completely blocked by preincubation of the antibody with its blocking peptide, demonstrating antibody specificity (supplemental Fig. 1). Further, staining of these same sections with an anti-Gαq antibody demonstrated that benign prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells express similar levels of Gαq (data not shown), suggesting that this elevation in expression is specific to Gα12. To broaden our analysis of Gα12 expression in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray of 16 examples of normal prostate and 73 examples of invasive carcinoma with matched benign tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry, and the results were graded 0-3+ based on staining intensity. This analysis (not shown) demonstrated that Gα12 expression is significantly increased in invasive carcinoma of the prostate; the staining intensity of normal prostate epithelium was 0.2 ± 0.1; the staining intensity for invasive prostate cancer was 1.6 ± 0.1. Since prostate intraepithelial neoplasms (PINs) were not adequately represented in the commercial tissue microarrays, we also performed the Gα12 staining on 13 samples from radical prostatectomy cancer specimens obtained from our institution (Table 1). Staining of these sections confirmed that Gα12 expression is increased in PIN as well as invasive carcinoma of the prostate; in this analysis, the staining intensity of normal prostate epithelium was 0.67 ± 0.05, the staining intensity of PIN was 2.2 ± 0.08, and the staining intensity of invasive prostate cancer was 2.4 ± 0.05. Together, these data support the conclusion that Gα12 expression increases soon after neoplastic transformation of the prostate and before the tumors become invasive.TABLE 1Distribution of prostate surgical specimen field characteristics by Gα12 stainingSpecimennStaining intensityAverage ± S.E.0123Benign prostate epithelium243126793170.67 ± 0.80HG-PIN12642246532.19 ± 0.83ap < 0.0001 for HG-PIN versus benign prostate epithelium.Invasive CA236328781262.39 ± 0.74bp < 0.0001 for invasive cancer versus benign prostate epithelium.a p < 0.0001 for HG-PIN versus benign prostate epithelium.b p < 0.0001 for invasive cancer versus benign prostate epithelium. Open table in a new tab G12 Signaling Does Not Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Growth or Tumorigenesis—Previous studies have suggested that G12 signaling is able to promote fibroblast growth and tumorigenesis (18Chan A.M.

However, in breast cancer cells, G12 signaling did not appear to promote cell growth or tumorigenesis (30Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Juneja J. Booden M.A. Der C.J. Daaka Y. Dewhirst M.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In order to determine the biologic significance of the G12 proteins in prostate cancer, we first examined the effects of modulating the G12 pathway on prostate cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. In order to drive G12 signaling in the DU145 and PC3 cell lines, we used adenovirus to express the activated forms of Gα12 (Gα12 Q231L) and Gα13 (Gα13 Q226L). Expression of these activated variants had no effect on in vitro prostate cancer cell growth (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, in order to inhibit G12 signaling, we used adenovirus to express the RGS domain of the p115-Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) (p115-RGS). This domain selectively binds Gα12 and Gα13, preventing them from interacting with their downstream effectors (36Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Martin C.B. Mahon G.M. Klinger M.B. Kay R.J. Symons M. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Expression of this inhibitor of G12 signaling also had no effect on prostate cancer cell growth (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). To examine the effects of G12 signaling on prostate cancer cell tumorigenesis, recombinant retroviruses were used to stably express either Gα12 (Q231L) or the p115-RGS in the PC3 cell line. Interestingly, expression of neither of these proteins had any effect on the growth of PC3 cells in soft agar (supplemental Fig. 2C) or when implanted into the flanks of immunocompromised mice (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that G12 signaling does not affect prostate cancer cell growth or tumorigenesis.

We found that expression of the activated forms of Gα12 or Gα13 in the PC3 (Fig. 3A) and DU145 (Fig. 3B) cell lines significantly increased the ability of these cells to invade a Matrigel™ barrier reconstituted in a transwell migration chamber. Since most receptors that couple to the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins also couple to the Gq family, we expressed the activated form of Gαq (Gαq Q209L) in the prostate cancer cells as a control. Expression of activated Gαq failed to promote cellular invasion in either prostate cancer line (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that this ability to promote prostate cancer invasion is specific to the G12 family. G12 Signaling Promotes Prostate Cancer Cell Invasion through a Rho-dependent Pathway—The best characterized downstream effectors of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins are members of the RhoA family of monomeric GTPases.

We here use a purified recombinant mitochondrial transcription system and demonstrate that conserved sequence box II is a sequence-dependent transcription termination element in vitro.

Based on our findings, we propose a model for primer formation at the origin of heavy strand DNA replication. The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) contains two origins of replication, the origin of heavy strand replication (OH) and the origin of light strand replication (OL) (1Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). According to the strand-asymmetric model for mtDNA replication, DNA synthesis is continuous on both strands and takes place in a strand-asymmetric mode. The DNA synthesis from OH is unidirectional and proceeds to displace the parental heavy strand. After leading strand synthesis has reached two-thirds of the genome, it activates OL and DNA synthesis initiates in the opposite direction (2Robberson D.L. Kasamatsu H. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The strand-asymmetric model for mtDNA replication has been challenged by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses demonstrating the presence of conventional duplex mtDNA replication intermediates, which would indicate coupled leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis (5Holt I.J.

LSP-dependent transcription also generates primers required for initiation of mtDNA replication at OH (1Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 9Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and RNA attached to the newly synthesized H strand has been detected in both mouse and human cells (4Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism governing the switch between genomic length transcription and primer formation is still not completely elucidated. According to one model, the primary LSP transcript is cleaved by an endonuclease activity at certain locations in the OH region and these processed transcripts are used as primers for DNA synthesis. RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) has been proposed to execute this role in primer formation because the enzyme cleaves LSP transcript model substrates in vitro close to the major initiation sites of leading strand mtDNA synthesis mapped in vivo (11Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons in vertebrates of mtDNA sequence downstream of the LSP have revealed three conserved sequence blocks (termed CSB I, CSB II, and CSB III). CSB II increases the stability of an RNA-DNA hybrid, and transitions from the RNA primer to the newly synthesized DNA have been mapped to sequences within or near CSB II (4Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nearly 95% of the H-strand initiation events terminate at sites placed ∼600 bp downstream the initiation site (14Brown W.M. Shine J. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The arrested nascent H-strand remains stably hybridized to the circular parental molecule, forming a triple-strand structure characterized by the displaced parental H-strand. This triplex structure is known as the displacement loop (D-loop). We have previously reconstituted a human mtDNA transcription in a pure in vitro system from promoter-containing DNA fragments, recombinant transcription factor A (TFAM), transcription factor B2 (TFB2M), and RNA polymerase (POLRMT) (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We now report that in this defined system, a majority of LSP transcripts are prematurely terminated at CSB II, ∼100 bp downstream of the promoter. Premature termination is critically dependent on the exact CSB II sequence and is also negatively affected by mutations in the nearby CSB III. Interestingly, the 3′-ends of the prematurely terminated transcripts coincide with the major points of RNA to DNA transitions in the mtDNA control region. Based on our findings we suggest a new, RNase MRP-independent mechanism for primer formation in mitochondrial DNA replication. Transcription in Vitro—Recombinant proteins POLRMT, TFAM, and TFB2M were expressed and purified as described previously (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We cloned DNA fragments corresponding to bp 1-477 (LSP) and 277-477 of human mtDNA into pUC18. Using the 1-477 plasmid as template, we employed overlap extension PCR to mutate or delete the CSB I, CSB II, and CSB III elements. All mutant constructs were sequenced before use. After linearization, we used the plasmid constructs in transcription assays as previously described (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For the time course experiment in Fig. 1B, 25-μl fractions were taken at the indicated times from a 200-μl reaction. The pulse-chase experiment in Fig. 1C was performed in the same way as the time course experiment, but 4 μl of 100 mm cold UTP was added 5 min after the transcription reaction was initiated and fractions (25 μl) were taken at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min after addition of the cold UTP. For T7 RNA polymerase transcription we used 1× T7 transcription buffer supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). To introduce a T7 promoter upstream of mtDNA sequences, we subcloned wild-type and mutant mtDNA fragments (bp 1-393) into pBluescript SKII. Purification of Human mtDNA—Isolated platelets and HeLa cell mitochondria were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by incubation at 55 °C with slow shaking for 2 h. mtDNA was subsequently isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Primer Extension—mtDNA (5 μg) was linearized by SacII digestion, followed by heat inactivation (65 °C, 20 min) and ethanol precipitation. Linearized mtDNA was dissolved in water (18 μl) and divided into two fractions. One fraction was treated with Escherichia coli RNase H (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by heat inactivation (65 °C, 20 min). The isolated mtDNA was heated at 95 °C for 5 min to separate the D-loop strand and then annealed with a 5′ 32P-labeled primer (300 fmol) complementary to nucleotides 75-95 in mtDNA. Primer extension was performed with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as suggested by the manufacturer. For primer extension with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), we set up a 10-μl PCR reaction mixture containing linearized mtDNA (4 μl), 5′ 32P-labeled primer (300 fmol), dNTP (200 nm), Vent DNA polymerase (0.4 unit), and the Vent DNA polymerase reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The primer extension reaction was carried out by the sequential incubation at 95 °C 5 min, 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 1 min, 72 °C 10 min, and finally the reaction was placed on ice for further analysis. Primer extension reactions were analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. POLRMT, TFB2M, and TFAM can initiate transcription in vitro from linear DNA fragments containing mitochondrial promoter sequences (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, transcription from LSP generated not only the expected runoff transcript (RO), but also a shorter, prematurely terminated transcript (PT). We used phosphoimaging to calculate the relative molar amounts of the RO and PT transcripts. More than 50% of all transcription events initiated from LSP resulted in the shorter PT product (data not shown). Two lines of evidence suggested that the PT transcripts were derived from true termination of transcription. First, in a time course experiment, the relative ratios of RO and PT transcripts were stable over time, arguing against the possibility that the PT transcripts were due to POLRMT pausing (Fig. 1B). Second, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. After an initial 5-min pulse of radiolabeled UTP, we added an 8000-fold excess of cold UTP and followed the LSP transcription reaction for 60 min. If the PT transcripts were caused by POLRMT pausing, the ratio of PT to RO transcripts would decrease progressively with time, due to resumption of elongation by the stalled enzyme. In fact, the shorter transcript persisted for up to 60 min of incubation without any obvious change of the ratio between terminated and runoff transcripts (Fig. 1C). We conclude that PT transcripts are formed by true transcription termination and not by POLRMT pausing. The PT products terminated ∼100 bp downstream of LSP in a region encompassing the conserved sequence elements CSBI, CSB II, and CSB III (Fig. 2A). To examine whether these elements could influence PT formation, we replaced the individual CSB sequences with the complement sequence and monitored effects on transcription termination in vitro (Fig. 2B). The CSB III mutation caused a mild decrease in transcription termination, whereas the mutant form of CSB II nearly abolished PT formation (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Replacement of CSB I did not affect transcriptional termination and did not display any synergistic effects in combination with the mutated forms of CSB II or CSB III (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 5, and 6). We conclude that PT formation is critically dependent on the CSB II element. TFAM influences mitochondrial transcription activity, and a high affinity TFAM binding site is situated close to the 3′ of our PT transcript (16Fisher R.P. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We investigated whether TFAM concentrations could influence PT formation in vitro (Fig. 2C). The relative ratio of PT to RO transcript remained largely unchanged over different TFAM concentrations. Replacement of the CSB II sequence with its complement nearly abolished PT formation at all TFAM concentrations tested. The absence of premature transcription events in turn generated higher levels of the RO transcript. To exactly define the 3′-ends of the PT transcripts, we separated transcription reactions on an 8% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3). Premature transcription termination took place at nucleotide positions 300-282 (Fig. 3, lane 2). Termination therefore occurs immediately downstream of CSB II, which spans positions 315-299 (Fig. 2A). The observed transcription termination was DNA sequence dependent, and a deletion of the 304-290 region abolished transcription termination (Fig. 3, lane 3). Our data did not rule out the possibility that the PT transcripts were produced from a second initiation site, downstream of LSP. To investigate this possibility, we first monitored in vitro transcription on a series of LSP promoter constructs in which 2 bp at a time were mutated from positions -1 to -20 with the transcription initiation site corresponding to position +1 (17Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutations had identical effects on both RO and PT products, supporting the notion that both transcripts are initiated at the core LSP promoter (Fig. 4A). Second, we monitored premature transcription termination on a truncated template that had been linearized by restriction enzyme cleavage at position 277, just downstream of the premature transcription termination sites at nucleotide positions 300-282 (Fig. 4B). The truncated template produced a RO transcript of only 131 nt but did not affect the length of the PT products, further supporting the notion that these transcripts are produced by termination and are not due to the existence of a second transcription initiation site downstream of LSP. To better define the sequence requirements for transcription termination we made a series of mutant constructs (Fig. 5, A and B). PT formation was completely abolished in the 319-289 mutant, in which CSB II and an additional 12 base pairs downstream of this sequence element had been replaced with the complement sequence (Fig. 5B, lane 4). The 294-290 and 299-295 mutants, overlapping with the sites of transcription termination but positioned outside the conserved CSB II motif, had no distinct effect on PT formation (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, the 304-300 mutant, corresponding to the last part of CSB II, caused a drastic decrease in transcription termination (Fig. 5B, lane 3). Therefore, sequences within the 3′-end of the CSB II element are required for PT formation, whereas sequences immediately downstream of CSB II do not affect this process. We next investigated whether CSB II-dependent termination was specific to POLRMT or whether the same sequence element could affect the structurally related bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. We monitored the ability of the T7 enzyme to transcribe the D-loop region and observed a prominent prematurely terminated transcript of the expected size (Fig. 5C, lane 2). On a template lacking the CSB II element (the 319-289 mutant), the prematurely terminated transcript was completely abolished. We also used the 304-300 mutant template and obtained similar results for POLRMT and T7 RNA polymerase (data not shown). We conclude that the primary DNA sequence and probably also structural features of CSB II may stimulate transcription termination by both POLRMT and the T7 RNA polymerases. The CSB II region has previously been implicated in RNA primer formation for D-loop synthesis (4Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To directly compare transcription products formed by termination at CSB II with the start sites for DNA synthesis in D-loop formation, we isolated mitochondria from HeLa cells and thrombocytes. After purification, mtDNA was linearized with SacII treatment. We annealed a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide to nt 75-95 in the D-loop region and used primer elongation to map 5′-ends in the DNA, presumably corresponding to the start sites of DNA synthesis. Thermophilic DNA polymerases can copy RNA templates when they get a jump start on DNA covalently linked to RNA (18Mosig G. Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this problem we performed primer elongation before and after RNase H treatment. E. coli RNase H will specifically degrade the RNA part of the D-loop and thereby allowed us to exactly map the RNA to DNA transition sites. Without RNase H treatment, no significant signal was detected at the CSB II region, but we observed free 5′-ends at positions 151C and 191A, which have been reported previously as sites of initiation for mtDNA synthesis (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 8). After RNase H treatment the signal from positions Cys-151 and Ala-191 remained unchanged (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 5 and 6 or lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that no RNA remains associated with mtDNA at these positions. In contrast, RNase H treatment generated a strong signal from the CSB II region (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 5 and 6 or lanes 7 and 8), revealing RNA to DNA transitions at these locations. RNA to DNA transitions took place within a region immediately downstream of CSB II, with a maximum at positions 301-299 and 292-289 of the human mtDNA (Fig. 6B). These transitions therefore coincide with the 300-282 region in which we had observed premature termination of transcription (Fig. 6C). RNase MRP can cleave in vitro transcribed L-strand RNA at many of the major initiation sites of DNA replication mapped in vivo (11Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The relevance of these findings has been questioned, because the majority of RNase MRP is localized to the nucleolus, where the enzyme plays an important role in rRNA processing, and the amounts of detectable full-length MRP RNA in mitochondria have also been judged too small to attribute a mitochondrial function to RNase MRP (19Kiss T. Marshallsay C. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3737-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Kiss T. Filipowicz W. Cell. 1992; 70: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Lygerou Z. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Seraphin B. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a lack of genetic data to support a role for RNase MRP in primer formation, because to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports of robust mutants in RNase MRP, which distinguishes effects on rRNA processing in the nucleolus from mtDNA replication. The data presented here do not allow us to exclude the RNase MRP-dependent model for primer formation but suggest an alternative mechanism. In our experiments, we find that CSB II is a powerful transcription termination element. Mutations in CSB II abolish transcription termination, demonstrating the requirement of specific DNA sequences. We mapped the 3′-ends of the prematurely terminated transcripts and found that transcription terminates just downstream of CSB II between positions 300-282 in the mitochondrial genome. These sites coincide with the major RNA-DNA transition points in the D-loop of human mitochondria. The excellent correspondence between transcription termination and initiation of DNA replication leads us to propose that primer formation may be directed by sequence-specific DNA elements in human mitochondria, without involvement of RNase MRP. The human mitochondrial transcription and DNA replication machineries are structurally and functionally related to bacteriophage T7 (22Korhonen J.A. Pham X.H. Pellegrini M. Falkenberg M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2423-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial RNA polymerase interacts sequence specifically with promoters and displays significant sequence similarity to the monomeric bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (23Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Gaspari M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities also exist between the T7 DNA polymerase and POLγ, both of which are classified as family A DNA polymerases (4Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Ye F. Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the initiation of bacteriophage DNA replication, the T7 DNA polymerase displaces the RNA polymerase at a specific region and uses the newly synthesized transcript as a primer for DNA synthesis (26Fuller C.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fuller C.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3197-3206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, no primer processing is required to initiate T7 bacteriophage DNA replication. It is tempting to speculate that this mechanism has been conserved in mammalian mitochondria. CSB I, located just downstream of CSB II, may function as a loading site for the DNA replication machinery, because this sequence element has been shown to adopt a single-stranded conformation in vivo (28Cantatore P. Daddabbo L. Fracasso F. Gadaleta M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25020-25027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have here focused our attention on OH and the major RNA-DNA transition sites mapped in this region by others (4Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and us. There have also been reports of other initiation sites of mtDNA synthesis (9Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Crews S. Ojala D. Posakony J. Nishiguchi J. Attardi G.

These sites were all mapped by primer extension or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and at these mtDNA initiation sites there have been no reports of RNA to DNA transitions. Until RNA to DNA transitions have been demonstrated, we cannot exclude the possibility that these other sites are formed by processing, e.g. removal of the RNA primer together with a section of newly synthesized mtDNA (32Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

An interesting feature of the maturation of T4 lagging strand fragments is that T4 RNase H acts predominantly as an exonuclease, removing the primer and ∼30 nucleotides of adjacent DNA before synthesis of the upstream fragment is completed by DNA polymerase (33Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28516-28524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether hydrolysis of DNA adjacent to RNA primers also is a feature of mtDNA synthesis, but RNase H may play an important role in mammalian mtDNA replication because Rnaseh1-/- mice display a significant decrease in mitochondrial DNA content, leading to apoptotic cell death (35Cerritelli S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2159802295,"Several genes involved in nitrogen metabolism are known to contribute to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria. Here, we studied the function of the nitrogen regulatory protein GlnR in the Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We demonstrate that GlnR mediates transcriptional repression of genes involved in glutamine synthesis and uptake (glnA and glnPQ), glutamate synthesis (gdhA), and the gene encoding the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme Zwf, which forms an operon with glnPQ. Moreover, the expression of gdhA is also repressed by the pleiotropic regulator CodY. The GlnR-dependent regulation occurs through a conserved operator sequence and is responsive to the concentration of glutamate, glutamine, and ammonium in the growth medium. By means of in vitro binding studies and transcriptional analyses, we show that the regulatory function of GlnR is dependent on GlnA. Mutants of glnA and glnP displayed significantly reduced adhesion to Detroit 562 human pharyngeal epithelial cells, suggesting a role for these genes in the colonization of the host by S. pneumoniae. Thus, our results provide a thorough insight into the regulation of glutamine and glutamate metabolism of S. pneumoniae mediated by both GlnR and GlnA.

Thus, our results provide a thorough insight into the regulation of glutamine and glutamate metabolism of S. pneumoniae mediated by both GlnR and GlnA. Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in bacteria is closely connected with the intracellular levels of glutamine and glutamate, the main nitrogen donors in the cell. Glutamine is formed from glutamate and ammonium by glutamine synthetase (GlnA), which is a major way for the cell to assimilate ammonium. Glutamate can be formed either by glutamate dehydrogenase from 2-oxoglutarate and ammonium or by glutamate synthase, which converts glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate into two molecules of glutamate. Several studies indicate that nitrogen metabolism, especially glutamine metabolism, is important for the virulence of various bacterial pathogens (1Klose K.E. Mekalanos J.J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tamura G.S. Nittayajarn A. Schoentag D.L. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Tullius M.V. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3927-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Signature-tagged mutagenesis screens suggest that genes involved in glutamine metabolism, glnQ and glnA, are likely to play a role in the virulence of S. pneumoniae as well (4Hava D.L. Camilli A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1389-1406PubMed Google Scholar, 5Polissi A. Pontiggia A. Feger G. Altieri M. Mottl H. Ferrari L. Simon D. Infect.

In the well characterized Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, regulation of nitrogen metabolism is carried out mainly by CodY, GlnR, and TnrA (7Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The latter two are members of the MerR family of regulators, and both recognize the same operator sequence: 5′-TGTNAN7TNACA-3′. TnrA functions during growth on a poor nitrogen source (e.g. solely glutamate) when it activates or represses expression of various genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (8Wray Jr., L.V. Ferson A.E.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) in the presence of a good nitrogen source, like glutamine. Genetic experiments have shown that genes regulated by GlnR and TnrA are constitutively expressed in a mutant of glnA (8Wray Jr., L.V. Ferson A.E. Rohrer K. Fisher S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An explanation for this observation came with the discovery that in vitro DNA binding by TnrA is blocked by feedback-inhibited GlnA (19Wray Jr., L.V. Zalieckas J.M. Fisher S.H. Cell. 2001; 107: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that GlnA also controls the DNA binding activity of GlnR, this has never been shown. In fact, B. subtilis GlnR has a high affinity for DNA on its own (13Brown S.W. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis CodY functions as a repressor of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (20Shivers R.P. Sonenshein A.L.

In contrast to B. subtilis and L. lactis, a gene encoding glutamate synthase is not present. This suggests that S. pneumoniae has various ways to secure sufficient cellular glutamine levels, either by uptake from the environment or by de novo synthesis. In this study, we report on the important role of GlnR and GlnA in the regulation of glutamine and glutamate metabolism in S. pneumoniae and present indications for a role of GlnR targets in pneumococcal virulence. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and were stored in 10% glycerol at –80 °C. S. pneumoniae was grown essentially as described (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar): on plates in a flame-pot, giving an elevated CO2 concentration, or in liquid medium as standing cultures. L. lactis and Escherichia coli were grown as described previously (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Kanamycin and tetracycline were used in concentrations of 500 and 2.5 μg/ml for S. pneumoniae, respectively. Ampicillin was used in a concentration of 100 μg/ml for E. coli. Chemically defined medium with a final pH of 6.4 was composed as described (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except that sodium citrate was used in the buffer instead of ammonium citrate and that glutamine was omitted from the amino acid mixture. Glutamine, glutamate, and ammonium were added as specified under “Results.” Induction of gene expression with nisin was performed as described, using a stock solution of nisaplin, containing 20 mg/ml nisin (29Kloosterman T.G.

Open table in a new tab Construction of glnR, glnA, glnRA, zwf, and glnP Mutants of S. pneumoniae—The glnR-stop mutant (TK102) was constructed using plasmid pORI280 as follows. Primer glnR-stop 1 with two point mutations, leading to two premature stop codons at codon positions 20 and 21 in the glnR reading frame, was used in combination with primer glnR_R6–1 to PCR-amplify a fragment comprising the upstream part and the beginning of glnR. A second PCR product, comprising the rest of the glnR gene and part of the downstream sequence was produced with primers glnR-stop 2 and glnR-3. These PCR products were complementary by 20 bp covering the position of the stop codons and were used as a template in a PCR with primers glnR_R6-1 and glnR-3. The resulting product was cloned as an XbaI, BglII fragment in pORI280, giving plasmid pTK20. pTK20 was used to introduce the mutations into the chromosome of S. pneumoniae D39 as described (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), giving strain TK102. The mutations led to the disappearance of a HincII site, on the basis of which the proper mutant could be identified. The mutations were further verified by DNA sequencing. The glnA deletion strain (TK103) was generated by allelic replacement mutagenesis, removing 1300 bp of the glnA open reading frame (ORF). 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; CDM, chemically defined medium; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; H6-GlnR and H6-GlnA, His6-tagged GlnR and GlnA, respectively. A PCR fragment, generated with primers Spec_pORI38-Fp and Spec_pORI38-Rp on the spectinomycin resistance gene from pORI38, was cloned into the HindIII site of pORI28 in the same orientation as the erythromycin gene on this vector, yielding pORI28spec1. Next, the 3′-flanking region of glnA, amplified with primer pair glnA_R6–3/glnA_R6–4 (886 bp), was cloned into the NcoI/BglII sites of pORI28spec1, giving pTK18. pTK18 was cut with NdeI/AatII, and a PCR fragment generated with primers glnA_R6–1/glnA_R6–2 (808 bp), which was digested with the same enzymes, was ligated to it. This ligation mixture was used to generate a PCR product with primers glnA_R6–1 and glnA_R6–4, which was transformed to S. pneumoniae D39. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were examined for the presence of the glnA deletion by PCR and Southern blotting. The zwf deletion mutant (TK107), removing 1416 bp of the zwf ORF, was constructed in a similar way as the glnA mutant, using primers G6PDH-4/G6PDH-5 (660 bp) and G6PDH-6/G6PDH-7 (610 bp). To construct the glnRA mutant (TK104), the upstream part of glnR, amplified with primer pair glnR_R6–1/glnR_R6–2 (883 bp), was cloned into the XbaI/BamHI sites of pORI28spec1, giving pTK22. pTK22 was used together with pTK18, which contains the glnA_R6–3/glnA_R6–4 PCR product cloned into the NcoI/BglII sites of pORI28spec1, as a template in a PCR with primers glnR_R6–1 and glnA_R6–4. In this way, a PCR product was obtained containing the spectinomycin resistance gene flanked by the upstream and downstream sequence of glnRA. The resulting PCR product was transformed to D39. The deletion was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting. L. lactis 108 was used as the cloning host for plasmid pTK19. All other constructs were made in E. coli EC1000. To construct the glnP deletion mutant (TK106), removing 2080 bp of the glnP ORF, a PCR fragment, generated with primer pair Ery-rev/Ery-for on the erythromycin resistance gene from pORI28, was fused to the flanking regions of glnP, which were PCR-amplified with primer pairs glnPKO-1/gln-PKO-2 (628 bp) and glnPKO-3/glnPKO-4 (610 bp) by means of overlap extension PCR (30Song J.H. Ko K.S. Lee J.Y. Baek J.Y. Oh W.S. Yoon H.S. Jeong J.Y. Chun J. Mol. Cells. 2005; 19: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was transformed to S. pneumoniae D39, and clones were checked for the presence of the mutation by PCR. In the same way, a deletion mutant of gdhA, removing 1311 bp of the gdhA ORF, was constructed in D39 using primer pairs gdhAKO-1/gdhAKO-2 (479 bp) and gdhAKO-3/gdhAKO-4 (498 bp). Construction of capsuleless derivatives of D39 and its glnA, glnR, glnRA, and glnP mutants was done as described (31Pearce B.J. Iannelli F. Pozzi G. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using primers PE21 and FI4. Mutants were checked by PCR and appearance. In addition, they adhere several orders of magnitude better than the encapsulated mutants. Construction of lacZ Fusions—Chromosomal transcriptional lacZ fusions were constructed with the integration plasmid pORI13 as described (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Sanders J.W. Venema G. Kok J. Leenhouts K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For lacZ fusions to glnA, gdhA, and zwf, 600–800-bp fragments of the 3′ ends of the genes were PCR-amplified using primer pairs R6_glnA-5/R6_glnA-6, R6_gdhA-4/R6_gdhA-5, and R6_G6PDH-1/R6_G6PDH-2, respectively. These fragments were digested and cloned into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of PORI13, giving pTK8, pTK10, and pTK11, respectively. The constructs were introduced into S. pneumoniae D39nisRK, and D39nisRK containing either the glnA (TK100) or glnR (TK105) mutation, and clones were checked by PCR. Analogously, pTK9 and pTK12 were constructed with primers R6_PglnP-1/R6_PglnP-2 and R6_arcA-3/R6_arcA-4. These plasmids were used to generate chromosomal lacZ fusions to the glnP and arcA promoters. The glnQ-zwf intergenic region was cloned into pORI13 using primers Pg6pdh-1/Pg6pdh-2, giving pTK21. The lacZ fusions to the gdhA promoter were constructed in pPP2 with primer pair PgdhA-2/PgdhA-4, giving a PCR product comprising the full-length promoter (PgdhA-1) and primer pair PgdhA-3/PgdhA-4, resulting in a PCR product without the predicted GlnR operator (PgdhA-2), using E. coli EC1000 as the cloning host. The constructs were introduced in S. pneumoniae strains D39 and TK102. Construction of Overexpression Constructs—The glnR, glnA, and glnPQ genes were PCR-amplified with primer pairs glnR-9-his/glnR_R6–10, glnA-his/glnA_R6–8 and glnP-OX1/glnP-OX2, respectively, and cloned into the NcoI/XbaI sites of pNG8048E, giving pTK16, pTK15, and pTK17. In addition, the native glnR gene was cloned into pNG8048E using primers glnR-_R6–9/glnR_R6–10, giving pTK23. Purification of GlnR and GlnA—Overexpression of N-terminally His6-tagged GlnR and GlnA (H6-GlnR and H6-GlnA) was achieved with the nisin-inducible system in strain L. lactis NZ9000 (33Kuipers O.P. Ruyter P.G. Kleerebezem M. Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with nisin in 1-liter cultures at an A600 of 0.6, using a 10–7 dilution (2 ng/ml) of nisaplin, which was prepared as described (29Kloosterman T.G. Bijlsma J.J.E. Kok J.

https://openalex.org/W2163472560,"We tested the hypothesis that statins would decrease renal injury in renal artery stenosis (RAS) by restoring angiogenesis and attenuating intrarenal microvascular (IMV) remodeling. Single-kidney hemodynamics and function were quantified using electron-beam-computed tomography (CT) in normocholesterolemic pigs after 12 wk of experimental RAS, RAS supplemented with simvastatin (RAS+simvastatin), and normal controls. Renal circulation was also studied in vivo using angiography and ex vivo using a unique 3D micro-CT imaging technique. Angiogenic and remodeling pathways were subsequently explored in renal tissue. Blood pressure and the degree of stenosis were similarly increased in RAS groups. Simvastatin in RAS enhanced both intrarenal angiogenesis and peri-stenosis arteriogenesis and increased the expression of angiogenic growth factors and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. Furthermore, simvastatin decreased tissue-transglutaminase expression and IMV inward remodeling, restored IMV endothelial function, decreased fibrogenic activity, and improved renal function. Chronic simvastatin supplementation promoted angiogenesis in vivo, decreased ischemia-induced IMV remodeling, and improved IMV function in the stenotic kidney, independent of lipid lowering. These novel renoprotective effects suggest a role for simvastatin in preserving the ischemic kidney in chronic RAS."
https://openalex.org/W2006475649,"The tight junction protein ZO-1 is known to link the transmembrane proteins occludin, claudins, and JAMs to many cytoplasmic proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Although specific roles for ZO-1 at the tight junction are unknown, it is widely assumed that ZO-1, together with its homologs ZO-2 and ZO-3, serves as a platform to scaffold various transmembrane and cytoplasmic tight junction proteins. Thus the manner in which the zonula occludens (ZO) proteins multimerize has implications for the protein networks they can coordinate. The purpose of our study was to determine whether ZO-1 forms homodimers and to determine the protein interaction region. Using laser light scattering and analytical centrifugation, we show that protein sequences corresponding to the NH2-terminal half of ZO-1 form stable homodimers with a submicromolar equilibrium dissociation constant. Analysis of the molecular weight of different truncated forms of ZO-1 revealed that the second PDZ domain is both necessary and sufficient for dimerization. This interaction does not use the β-finger motif described for other PDZ dimers. Furthermore, ZO-1 does not dimerize via an Src homology 3 to Guk domain interaction as was demonstrated previously for MAGUKs, like PSD-95. Results from immunoprecipitation experiments with polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells stably transfected with full-length GFP-ZO-1 indicate that a substantial portion of ZO-1 forms homodimers in vivo. As described previously, ZO-1 also forms heterodimers with ZO-2 and ZO-3. We conclude that the dimerization of ZO proteins is unlike that of other MAGUKs and that the previously unrecognized ZO-1 homodimers may allow formation of protein networks distinct from those of heterodimers with ZO-2 and ZO-3.

The tight junction (TJ) 2The abbreviations used are: TJ, tight junction; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; SH, Src homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ZO, zonula occludens; SEC-MALS, size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LS, light scattering; RI, refractive index. 2The abbreviations used are: TJ, tight junction; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; SH, Src homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ZO, zonula occludens; SEC-MALS, size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LS, light scattering; RI, refractive index. is the apical-most element of the junctional complex in epithelial and endothelial cells. This complex includes the TJ, adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. The TJ forms a major barrier to paracellular movement of substances preserving unique chemical composition of apical and basolateral fluid compartments on opposite sides of the epithelial cell layer and coordinates transmembrane signaling (1Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 2Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1213-C1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The TJ is known to contain at least four classes of transmembrane proteins and >30 cytoplasmic signaling, scaffolding, and cytoskeletal proteins (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To understand how the barrier and signals are coordinated, more information is required on the specific molecular interactions of TJ proteins and specifically the proteins that coordinate interaction among transmembrane and cytosolic proteins. Peripheral membrane proteins of the tight junction are believed to be highly organized within a complicated network interconnecting cytoskeleton with transmembrane proteins. The three homologous zonula occludens (ZO) MAGUK proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3) are among the best characterized peripheral membrane proteins of the tight junction. They are composed of three PDZ domains, an SH3-GUK unit, and an actin-binding region; these proteins are believed to cluster different components of tight junctions together through the direct binding to specific domains and/or regions (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Each has multiple known binding partners; some are shared among all three, such as binding to actin and claudins, whereas others are unique, such as binding of E4-ORF1 protein from type 9 adenovirus to ZO-2 (4Glaunsinger B.A. Weiss R.S. Lee S.S. Javier R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5578-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In tissues lacking tight junctions, ZO proteins are localized to adherence junction where they are presumed to interact with cadherin-catenin complexes. Furthermore, ZO-1 was shown to bind many different connexins, structural components of gap junction, in a number of reports (5Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 6Kausalya P.J. Reichert M. Hunziker W.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2470-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Much efforts has been made to define the function of ZO proteins, for example through exogenous expression of truncated ZO-1 (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 8Ryeom S.W. Paul D. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A high degree of sequence conservation between ZO proteins suggests that these proteins may have a significant functional redundancy, making it difficult to elucidate their function. Strong evidence that ZO proteins are indeed functionally redundant came from a recent report demonstrating that in ZO-1-deficient cells, cytoplasmic ZO-2 was recruited into tight junctions to compensate for the loss of ZO-1 (11Umeda K. Matsui T. Nakayama M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44785-44794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ZO proteins are known to hetero-oligomerize via their second PDZ domains. ZO-1 binds to both ZO-2 and ZO-3, whereas ZO-2 and ZO-3 do not bind each other (12Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Because no endogenous ZO-1 from MDCK cells was detected in immunoprecipitates of transiently transfected human ZO-1, it was concluded that ZO-1 does not form homo-oligomers (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Hence, ZO proteins are thought to exist exclusively as ZO-1/ZO-2 and ZO-1/ZO-3 heterodimers (12Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Determining whether homodimers exist is critical for understanding the complexity of protein networks that ZO proteins could create. In this work we demonstrate that, contrary to the previous beliefs, ZO-1 forms a stable dimer via its second PDZ domain and partially characterizes biophysical properties of the dimer. We also show that significant amounts of ZO-1 in MDCK cells exist as a homodimer. Antibodies and Affinity Media—Mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). R40.76 antibody was obtained from Bruce Stevenson (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). All other antibodies and goat anti-rat IgG immobilized on Sepharose 4B were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Protein G-Sepharose was purchased from GE Healthcare. Molecular Cloning—A NotI-XhoI fragment of plasmid pSKZO-1 encoding about 1000 amino acid residues of ZO-1 was cloned into the pFastBacHTa vector. The resulting plasmid was digested with NheI and HindIII and ligated by PCR with a fragment of ZO-1 (∼720 bp) amplified with primers AAT CAT AAG GAG GTA GAA CGA GGC and TTT AA GCT TCT AAT CCG CCT TTC CCT CGG AAA CCC to introduce a stop codon after amino acid 806. To modify the NH2 terminus, the construct was digested with NotI and KasI and ligated with annealed oligonucleotides GCG CCA TGT CCG CCA GAG CTG C and GGC CGC AGC TCT GGC GGA CAT G. The resulting construct encodes amino acids 1-806 of human ZO-1 with an NH2-terminal His6 tag. Other constructs were obtained by similar procedures (details are available upon request). These constructs and their amino acid sequence ranges are presented in Fig. 4. GFP-ZO-1 was obtained by subcloning of ZO-1 into pEGFP-C1 vector, followed by subcloning of GFP-ZO-1 into pIRES vector. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ZO-1 Fragments— Recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were obtained using Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen). High Five cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3-5, harvested 48-60 h after infection, and kept frozen at -80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed in 6 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150-500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.8% Igepal CA-630, 12.5 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Protein was purified from the supernatant using EZview™ Red His-Select HC nickel affinity gel from Sigma and eluted into PBS containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 125 mm of imidazole. MDCK Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stable Clone Selection—MDCK cells were cultivated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum using 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks or 6-well plates. Cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 3 μg of GFP-ZO-1 plasmid and 5 μg of Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultivated in media containing 0.8 mg/ml G-418, and cell clones were isolated with cloning rings. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MDCK cells grown on 50-cm2 Petri dishes were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 0.6 ml of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and added to 30 μl of protein G beads preloaded with 5 μg of antibodies. Beads were incubated with the lysates for 2 h, washed five times with PBS containing 0.2% of Triton X-100, and boiled for 5 min in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer to elute bound proteins. Protein samples were resolved on 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with primary and fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies, and scanned with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Analytical Centrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical centrifuge. Partial specific volume of NZO-1 was estimated to be 0.727 using SEDNTERP software. NZO-1 at 2-6 μm was analyzed in PBS containing 1 mm of 2-mercaptoethanol at 20 °C at speeds ranging between 6,000 and 20,000 rpm. Samples were spun in a 6-channel 12-mm external fill equilibrium center-piece in an An-60 Ti rotor. Scans (280 nm) were collected at equilibrium in radial step mode with 0.001-cm steps and 5-point averaging. Data fitting was performed with one-component or monomer-dimer equilibrium models using XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Beckman Instruments, Rockville, MD). Size Exclusion Chromatography with Multiangle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS)—SEC-MALS experiments were performed with an Akta FPLC (GE Healthcare) coupled to a Wyatt DAWN EOS light scattering instrument, Wyatt Optilab refractometer, and Wyatt dynamic light scattering module (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). For chromatographic separations, a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was used at an eluent flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Molecular weight calculations were made by ASTRA software using a dn/dc value of 0.19 ml/g. The NH2-terminal Half of ZO-1 Forms a Dimer in Solution—The protein corresponding to the NH2-terminal half of ZO-1 (NZO-1, amino-acids 1-888) comprising three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, a GuK domain, and an acidic domain was purified to homogeneity from baculovirus-infected cells. NZO-1 resolves as a 100-kDa band on polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (predicted molecular mass of NZO-1 is 102.7 kDa), showing no significant impurities (Fig. 1A). Size exclusion chromatography revealed that NZO-1 elutes as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa, suggesting that NZO-1 may form a stable oligomer or be very highly asymmetric (Fig. 1B). Because size exclusion chromatography data are dependent on the shape of the protein, the determination of the exact molecular weight of the protein is difficult. To characterize the oligomeric state of NZO-1 in solution, we performed size exclusion chromatography with on-line detection of light scattering (LS) and refractive index (RI) signals, because this approach allows an accurate measurement of the molecular weight of the protein independently of its shape and/or amino acid composition (13Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Representative chromatographic profiles of NZO-1 obtained from LS and RI detectors are shown in Fig. 2A. The molecular mass of the NZO-1 calculated from LS and RI data was found to be 209 kDa indicating that NZO-1 is a dimer. The molecular mass is independent of the elution volume (Fig. 2B) indicating the absence of significant amounts of monomer and higher order oligomers under these conditions.FIGURE 2NZO-1 is a dimer. A, refractive index (solid line) and light scattering (dashed line) profiles of NZO-1; B, the dependence of calculated molecular weight on elution volume. The profiles appear displaced because the detectors are positioned in series in the flow path.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to determine the Kd value of the dimer, the NZO-1 was further characterized by analytical centrifugation. In two independent experiments, the single ideal species fit of sedimentation equilibrium data returned values close to 200 kDa indicating the predominance of a dimer in solution. The analysis of sedimentation equilibrium data shows that good fits can be obtained using a monomer-dimer model (Fig. 3). However, because comparable fits were obtained with a single species model using the theoretical molecular weight of the dimer (not shown), we concluded that monomer concentrations are sufficiently low that they cannot be determined accurately. This precluded the determination of Kd values of monomer-dimer equilibrium, still allowing us a theoretic analysis of simulated binding isoterms, which suggested that the Kd must be below 0.7 μm. Identification of the Dimerization Domain—To define which part of NZO-1 is responsible for dimerization, we purified truncated forms of NZO-1 using the insect cell/baculovirus expression system, and we investigated their oligomerization status by SEC-MALS. We created a truncated form lacking the seven NH2-terminal amino acid residues of ZO-1 because another MAGUK, hDlg, was reported to oligomerize via their NH2 termini (14Marfatia S.M. Byron O. Campbell G. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13759-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other constructs lacking different domains are shown on Fig. 4A. All constructs could be expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 4B). Molecular masses of all proteins determined from the positions of visualized bands on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels are close to the corresponding theoretical values except for PDZ2+I2 (amino acids 183-349), which has an apparent molecular mass 10 kDa higher than predicted. All purified truncation forms of ZO-1 were subjected to SEC-MALS in order to determine their molecular weight. Similarly to NZO-1, all investigated proteins eluted as single peaks with little or no dependence of calculated molecular weight on elution volume (data not shown). The results of SEC-MALS experiments are summarized in Table 1. Absolute molecular masses of all truncated forms of ZO-1 except PDZ3-acidic (this construct was found to be a monomer) are close to the theoretical masses of corresponding dimers (Table 1). Because all constructs except PDZ3-acidic include the second PDZ domain, these results clearly indicate that PDZ2 is necessary and sufficient for dimerization.TABLE 1Identification of dimerization motif of ZO-1 by light scatteringProteinAmino acidsTheoretical mass of monomerTheoretical mass of dimerMass by light scatteringOligomerization statekDakDakDaNZO11-888102.7205.4209DimerΔacidic1-80693.8187.6185DimerΔN78-80692.9185.8183DimerΔGuK1-64074.8149.6147DimerPDZ1-31-50258.8117.6126DimerPDZ1-2+I2a1-30038.977.878.9DimerPDZ1-21-27533.466.871.0DimerΔPDZ1+I1178-80674.2148.4145DimerPDZ3-acidic414-88856.3112.653.6MonomerPDZ2+I2183-34930.360.670.8DimerPDZ2183-27514.028.028.3Dimer Open table in a new tab Dimerization of ZO-1 in Vivo—Because ZO-1 was not previously thought to dimerize, we next sought to determine whether dimers exist in vivo. We established stable lines of MDCK cells expressing either GFP or GFP-tagged ZO-1. As reported previously (15Riesen F.K. Rothen-Rutishauser B. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the distribution of GFP-ZO-1 was similar to endogenous ZO-1, both being found almost exclusively in tight junctions (Fig. 5A). The localization of ZO-1 in control cells expressing GFP remained unchanged (Fig. 5A). Endogenous ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated from GFP and GFP-ZO-1 expressing cell lines using the R40.76 monoclonal antibody (this antibody recognizes canine but not exogenous human GFP-ZO-1). A significant fraction of GFP-ZO-1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous ZO-1, indicating the presence of ZO-1 dimers or higher order oligomers in vivo (Fig. 5B). In converse experiments, when GFP-ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies endogenous ZO-1 was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with GFP-ZO-1. No binding of GFP to ZO-1 was observed in control experiments (Fig. 5B). To understand how ZO-1 is distributed among homo- and hetero-oligomers with ZO-2 and ZO-3, we performed a series of repeated immunoprecipitations trying to completely deplete either ZO-1, ZO-2, or ZO-3 from MDCK cell lysates with subsequent quantification of the proteins in bound and unbound fractions. The NH2-terminal part of ZO-1 (amino acids 1-888) and the full-length ZO-2 expressed in insect cells were used as standards to perform quantitative immunoblotting (Fig. 6A); ZO-3 from insect cells could not be obtained in sufficient purity. ZO-2 and ZO-3 were depleted from the MDCK cell lysate to find out what fraction of ZO-1 is not bound to ZO-2 and ZO-3. A representative experiment and quantification as shown in Fig. 6B show that over 85% of ZO-2 and over 95% of ZO-3 could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against them. Quantitative analysis of ZO-1 revealed that about 107 fmol (50%) of solubilized ZO-1 is not bound to either ZO-2 or ZO-3 and remains in the supernatant. Accordingly, we found that about 50% of ZO-1 is bound to ZO-2 and ZO-3. Finally, we used MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-ZO-1 to quantify the amount of ZO-2 and GFP-ZO-1 that co-precipitate with endogenous ZO-1. Fig. 6C shows that endogenous ZO-1 could be quantitatively precipitated from MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-ZO-1. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 6C) revealed that about 40% of GFP-ZO-1 co-precipitated with endogenous ZO-1. Immunoblot with rabbit antibodies recognizing both GFP-ZO-1 and endogenous ZO-1 allowed us quantify the amounts of these proteins. Endogenous ZO-1 (arrowhead) and GFP-ZO-1 (arrow) were found to be expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 6C). Analysis of the protein sample obtained from R40.76 immunoprecipitates revealed that it contains 90 fmol of endogenous ZO-1 and about 65 fmol of GFP-ZO-1. Analysis with anti-ZO-2 antibodies revealed that 19 fmol of ZO-2 co-precipitated with endogenous ZO-1 (Fig. 6C) in MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-ZO-1 (Fig. 6C). ZO-1 was the first tight junction protein to be discovered and is thought to be one of the major scaffolds at tight junctions. The biochemical and biophysical properties of ZO-1 were poorly characterized so far, probably because of the difficulties associated with the expression of large constructs in bacteria. Using insect cells/baculovirus expression system, we were able to obtain milligram amounts of the NH2-terminal part of ZO-1 (the basic core structure ZO-1 shares with other MAGUKs like PSD-95 and disc large), which permitted the first detailed characterization of its biophysical properties. Because of anomalous gel filtration behavior of NZO-1, we used multiangle light scattering to characterize its oligomeric state. Unexpectedly, NZO-1 was found to exist exclusively as a stable dimer. Analytical centrifugation confirmed that NZO-1 forms a dimer with a submicromolar equilibrium dissociation constant. Such a low Kd value implies that NZO-1 would readily form homodimers in vivo. By analyzing the oligomerization status of various truncation mutants of ZO-1, we could unambiguously identify PDZ2 as a dimerization motif. The dimerization does not seem to occur via the recognition of internal “β-finger” by PDZ2 as in the case of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase-syntrophin (16Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), because the deletion of the regions flanking PDZ2 did not disrupt dimer formation. Rather, PDZ2 itself is likely to create a specific dimerization interface as reported for PDZ domains of Shank (17Im Y.J. Lee J.H. Park S.H. Park S.J. Rho S.H. Kang G.B. Kim E. Eom S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48099-48104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and GRIP1 (18Im Y.J. Park S.H. Rho S.H. Lee J.H. Kang G.B. Sheng M. Kim E. Eom S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The SH3-GuK unit of ZO-1 does not seem to contribute to oligomerization by domain swapping as suggested previously (19Mcgee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), because a construct containing PDZ3, SH3, GuK, and acidic domain was found to exist exclusively as a monomer. Because ZO-1/ZO-2 interaction was shown to involve the second PDZ domains of ZO-1 and ZO-2 (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 20Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it appears that second PDZ domains of all ZO proteins possess an intrinsic ability to dimerize. This idea is supported by the fact that the second PDZ domains of ZO proteins are very well conserved (70% identity and 94% similarity between PDZ2 of human ZO-1 and ZO-2). Noteworthy, previous reports suggest that various deletion mutants of ZO-2 bound to ZO-1 only if co-expressed in fibroblasts; no binding was detected using separately purified proteins for in vitro binding assays (20Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Based on our results, this is most likely due to the inability of ZO-2 to disrupt preformed dimers of ZO-1 and/or vice versa. In this regard, in vitro binding assays with separately purified ZO proteins seem to be less reliable compared with experiments utilizing co-expression of proteins in the same cell. The previous report of Fanning et al. (3Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) suggests that ZO-1 does not form homo-oligomers in MDCK cells because transiently transfected human ZO-1 and its deletion mutants did not precipitate endogenous canine ZO-1. This conclusion differs from that of the current study. A possible explanation for the previous failure to detect the ZO-1/ZO-1 interaction is that low levels of transient transfection efficiency and/or the low expression levels of transfected ZO-1 precluded the detection of the binding. To overcome the problem of low transfection rate and low expression levels, we cloned GFP-ZO-1 into the pIRES vector that is designed to select cells with high expressions of transgene polypeptides. Stably expressing GFP-ZO-1 correctly targets to the tight junction. Using R40.76 antibody to precipitate endogenous ZO-1 and anti-GFP antibody to precipitate exogenous GFP-ZO-1, we could show that homodimers (or homo-oligomers) of ZO-1 exist in vivo. In another experiment we could precipitate about 85% of ZO-2 and over 95% of ZO-3 from MDCK cell lysates. Even if one assumes that the remaining 15% of ZO-2 (∼32 fmol) is bound to ZO-1, about one-third of the total ZO-1 appears to be free of ZO-2 or ZO-3. In addition, in contrast to ZO-2 and ZO-3, a substantial amount of ZO-1 is not soluble in RIPA buffer and is therefore likely not to be in a complex with ZO-2 and ZO-3. We do not have ultimate proof that ZO-1 is free from ZO-2/ZO-3 and exists in a cell as a homodimer or homo-oligomer. However, experiments with cell lines expressing GFP-ZO-1 indicate that ZO-1/ZO-1 dimers are at least as abundant as ZO-1/ZO-2 heterodimers. Given that purified recombinant NZO-1 exists exclusively as a dimer with submicromolar Kd, it is likely that ZO-1 free of ZO-2 and ZO-3 dimerizes in the cell via its second PDZ domain. The relative efficiencies of homo- or hetero-oligomerizations between all ZO proteins have yet to be determined, but it is likely that the percentage of all kinds of homodimers and heterodimers will be dependent on the relative level of expression of all ZO proteins. In this regard, it is interesting that the expression profiles of ZO proteins differ from each other in various tissues indicating that various types of mono- and heterodimers of ZO proteins may form in different tissues. For example, ZO-3 is absent in ZO-1/ZO-2-positive endothelial tight junctions (21Inoko A. Itoh M. Tamura A. Matsuda M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the expression levels of ZO-1 and ZO-2 show different patterns along the nephron (22Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Namorado M.C. Martin D. Luna J. Alarcon L. Islas S. Valencia L. Muriel P. Ponce L. Reyes J.L. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2386-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a significant part of ZO-3 and especially of ZO-2 is localized to the cytoplasm of highly polarized cells, whereas ZO-1 is localized almost exclusively to the tight junction (Fig. 5A). This implies that particular homo- and hetero-oligomers of ZO proteins may also have differential subcellular distribution. ZO-1 and other MAGUKs are implicated in scaffolding of different proteins at plasma membranes through the direct binding to PDZ, SH3, and GuK domains. To enhance clustering, MAGUKs oligomerize via different mechanisms. For example, neuronal MAGUK PSD-95 was found to oligomerize through palmitoylation of two NH2-terminal cysteines (23Christopherson K.S. Sweeney N.T. Craven S.E. Kang R.J. El Husseini A.E.D. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3213-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The clustering of K+ channels was found to be palmitoylation-dependent, pointing to palmitoylation as a potential regulation mechanism (23Christopherson K.S. Sweeney N.T. Craven S.E. Kang R.J. El Husseini A.E.D. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3213-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ZO proteins, which are normally associated with tight junction in epithelial cells, are unique among MAGUKs in their ability to form highly stable dimers via the second PDZ domain. It is likely that the dimerization is highly important for the function of ZO proteins as molecular scaffolds, and our future studies will be aimed at understanding the role of PDZ2-dependent dimerization for the function of ZO proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1972562997,"To characterize the mechanism by which heterotrimeric G-proteins interpret the signals coming from various neurotransmitters of diverse efficacies (agonists and partial agonists) acting on α2A-adrenergic receptors, we used a fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based approach to study the effects of these partial agonists on the activation process of both the α2A-adrenergic receptor and its cognate Gi-protein. We show that ligands of different efficacies switch the receptor into distinct conformational states, which in turn set the speed and extent of the Gi-protein signaling. Thus, in cells the efficacy by which a receptor responds to diverse ligands is caused by the ability of the G-protein to differentiate between distinct receptor conformations. The data provide a new key characteristic underlying the mechanism of partial agonism at G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2161139507,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor (NPSR) are thought to have a role in asthma pathogenesis; a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms within NPSR have been shown to be associated with an increased prevalance of asthma. One such single nucleotide polymorphism leads to the missense mutation N107I, which results in an increase in the potency of NPS for NPSR. To gain insight into structure-function relationships within NPS and NPSR, we first carried out a limited structural characterization of NPS and subjected the peptide to extensive mutagenesis studies. Our results show that the NH2-terminal third of NPS, in particular residues Phe-2, Arg-3, Asn-4, and Val-6, are necessary and sufficient for activation of NPSR. Furthermore, part of a nascent helix within the peptide, spanning residues 5 through 13, acts as a regulatory region that inhibits receptor activation. Notably, this inhibition is absent in the asthma-linked N107I variant of NPSR, suggesting that residue 107 interacts with the aforementioned regulatory region of NPS. Whereas this interaction may be at the root of the increase in potency associated with the N107I variant, we show here that the mutation also causes an increase in cell-surface expression of the mutant receptor, leading to a concomitant increase in the maximal efficacy (Emax) of NPS. Our results identify the key residues of NPS involved in NPSR activation and suggest a molecular basis for the functional effects of the N107I mutation and for its putative pathophysiological link with asthma.

Asthma is a multifactorial disease with both genetic and environmental components that is characterized by an exaggerated immune response induced upon exposure to antigens. The disease has become a major public health concern as its incidence has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly in developed countries (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Lilly C.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 115: S526-S531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies in animal models have identified several genes and proteins that contribute to the asthmatic phenotype, although a complete understanding of the interplay between these factors, and their role in human disease, remains elusive (2Epstein M.M.

Science. 2004; 304: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Very little is known regarding the biochemical and physiological roles of NPSR. Its ligand is a 20-amino acid peptide known as neuropeptide S (NPS) because of its expression in the brain and its putative role in centrally mediated responses (as outlined below) (7Xu Y.L.

Activation of NPSR by NPS results in increased intracellular cAMP levels and Ca2+ mobilization, leading to the conclusion that it is coupled to Gs and Gq proteins (7Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K.

Reinforcing the genetic evidence that NPSR is involved in asthma, it has been reported that expression of the NPSR-B isoform, but not the NPSR-A isoform, is increased in bronchiolar smooth muscle and epithelial cells of asthmatics compared with healthy controls (4Laitinen T. Polvi A. Rydman P. Vendelin J. Pulkkinen V. Salmikangas P. Makela S. Rehn M. Pirskanen A. Rautanen A. Zucchelli M. Gullsten H. Leino M. Alenius H. Petays T. Haahtela T. Laitinen A. Laprise C.

It has also been shown that lung NPSR is up-regulated in a murine model of allergic asthma (4Laitinen T. Polvi A. Rydman P. Vendelin J. Pulkkinen V. Salmikangas P. Makela S. Rehn M. Pirskanen A.

Science. 2004; 304: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the B isoform of NPSR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cells in addition to the lung (12Vendelin J. Pulkkinen V. Rehn M. Pirskanen A.

Commun. 2005; 332: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in rodents. The structural determinants of NPSR activation by NPS are for the most part unknown. A recent report localized the pharmacophore to the NH2-terminal half of the peptide and demonstrated that the N107I variant of NPSR is a gain-of-function mutant (14Reinscheid R.K. Xu Y.L. Okamura N. Zeng J. Chung S. Pai R. Wang Z. Civelli O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We sought to better characterize structure-activity relationships within the receptor and its ligand as well as to define the molecular basis for the altered functional behavior of the N107I variant. We identify the key residues in NPS involved in activation of NPSR as well as demonstrate that the N107I mutation increases both intrinsic efficacy as well as intracellular trafficking of the receptor to the cell membrane. Generation of NPSR Vector Constructs—The NPSR-A isoform was amplified from a hypothalamus Marathon-ready cDNA library (BD Biosciences) by PCR using the Accuprime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions and using the following primers: “sense 1,” 5′-GTCAGGTACCACCATGCCAGCCAACTTCACAGAGGG-3′; “antisense 1,” 5′-TGCTCGATGCGGCCGCCTAGATGAATTCTGGCTTGGAC-3′. These primers introduce a KpnI recognition sequence and a Kozak sequence at the 5′ end, and a NotI cleavage site at the 3′ end. The NPSR-B isoform was generated from the NPSR-A construct by Splicing Overlap Extension PCR. Briefly, in a first round of PCR, the 1051-bp sequence corresponding to the common region of the two NPSR isoforms was amplified by PCR using the NPSR-A isoform sequence as template, and a 108-bp NPSR-B-specific sequence was obtained by annealing and amplification of the following overlapping primers: “sense 2,” 5′-GTCATCCGTCTCCGTCAGCTCCAGGAGGCTGCGCTAATGCTCTGCCCTCAACGAGAGAACTGGAAGGGTACTTG-3′; and “antisense 2,” 5′-GCTAGTAAGCGGCCGCTCACCTTGGAAGAGCCCAGGAAGGTACACCTGGCCAAGTACCCTTCCAGTTCTCTCGTTG-3′. These 2 PCR fragments were then spliced together in a second round of PCR using the primers “sense 1” and “antisense 2” (above) to generate the full-length NPSR-B isoform. The NPSR-A-N107I and NPSR-B-N107I constructs were generated from the above isoform-specific sequences by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and using the following primers: “sense 3,” 5′-GACAGATATTATTTGGCGATTCACTGG-3′ and “antisense 3,” 5′-CCAGTGAATCGCCAAATAATATCTGTC-3′. FLAG-tagged versions of the NPSR constructs were generated by PCR using the overlapping primers “Sp-flag sense,” 5′-GTAGGTACCACCATGAAGACGATCATCGCCCTGAGCTACATCTTCTGCCTGGTATTCGCCGACTAC-3′ and “Sp-flag antisense,” 5′-CTGCCTGGTATTCGCCGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACGCCCCAGCCAACTTCACAGAGGGCAGCTTCG-3′, which introduce a KpnI cleavage site, a signal peptide sequence, and a FLAG tag at the amino termini of the receptors (15Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were subcloned into the vector pcDEF3 (16Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) at the KpnI/NotI restriction sites and their sequences confirmed by automated capillary DNA sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator 3.0 system on the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Generation of CHO-NPSR and HEK 293 T-NPSR Cells—NPSR-expressing cells were generated through transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or HEK 293 T cells with pcDEF3 constructs containing the sequences for NPSR-A, NPSR-B, NPSR-A-N107I, or NPSR-B-N107I, or FLAG-tagged versions thereof (see above) using the Lipofectamine Plus system (Invitrogen). For CHO-NPSR cells, transfected cells were selected with G418 (750 μg/ml) to generate a bulk stable population and high activity clones were identified by plating single cells in flat-bottom 96-well Nunc plates (VWR, Mississauga, ON, Canada) using a FACSVantage cell sorter, allowing the clones to grow to confluence, and assessing their activity in the Ca2+-mobilization assay (described below). For HEK 293 T-NPSR cells, transfected cells were assessed in Ca2+-mobilization, binding, immunofluorescence, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays (all described below) as a bulk population, 48 h following transfection with the pcDEF3(NPSR) constructs. Peptide Synthesis—C-terminally amidated peptides were synthesized at the 0.1 mm scale by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Pioneer Peptide Synthesis System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as described previously (17Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The identity of all peptides was confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. All peptides were determined to be >95% pure by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a C18 column as the solid phase and a H2O:acetonitrile gradient as the solution phase. Peptide concentrations were determined using the bicinchonic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). Calcium Mobilization Assay—The calcium-mobilization assay was carried out as described previously (18Mathieu M.C. Sawyer N. Greig G.M. Hamel M. Kargman S. Ducharme Y. Lau C.K. Friesen R.W. O'Neill G.P. Gervais F.G. Therien A.G. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 100: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. CHO or HEK 293 T cells expressing the NPSR variants (see above) were plated (40,000 or 100,000 cells/well for CHO and HEK 293 T cells, respectively) in 96-well black-walled, clear-bottom plates. After incubation overnight and washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 105 μl/well of “no wash” calcium dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was loaded onto the cells and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Using the built-in sample addition feature of the FlexStation II instrument, 15 μl of agonist diluted in Hank's balanced salt solution (containing 20 mm Hepes and 0.24% bovine serum albumin) was added to the cells and fluorescence emission (λexc = 485 nm; λemm = 525 nm) was measured at 3-s intervals before, during, and after agonist addition for a total of 2 min. Data are reported as the difference between the maximal fluorescence and the baseline fluorescence. EC50 values, representing the concentration of agonist at which 50% activity is obtained, are reported as mean ± S.D. of multiple determinations. NMR Spectroscopy—Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired at a sample temperature of 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance Z-axis pulsed field gradient probe. NPS samples were analyzed at 3.1 mg/ml (1.4 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 5.0. H chemical shifts were referenced internally to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 at 0.00 ppm. The water resonance in all experiments was suppressed by low power saturation using an attenuated transmitter pulse during the relaxation delay. Sequence-specific chemical shift assignments were obtained with the combination of two-dimensional total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) (19Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 20Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4809) Google Scholar) experiments using standard methodologies (22Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York2005Google Scholar). All two-dimensional experiments were acquired in the hypercomplex mode for phase-sensitive presentation (23States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Clean TOCSY (19Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 24Levitt M.H. Freeman R. Frenkiel T. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 328-330Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with 1 K complex points in t2 and 512 points in t1 consisting of 16-32 transients per increment. Spin locking was achieved with an MLEV-17 (24Levitt M.H. Freeman R. Frenkiel T. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 328-330Google Scholar) mixing sequence for a duration of 65 ms preceded by a G-90-G magnetization randomization sequence using a 2.0-ms gradient pulse prior to the relaxation delay. Data sets were multiplied by a shifted Gaussian apodization function and zero-filled to 2 K by 1 K complex points prior to Fourier transformation. NOESY spectra were acquired using a range of mixing times. Solvent suppression was achieved by selective saturation of the water resonance during the 1-s recycle delay, t1 period, and mixing period. Data sets were acquired with 1 K complex points in t2 and 512 points in t1 with 96 transients per increment. The NOESY data were processed as described above. CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller set at 25 °C (JASCO, Easton, MD). Spectra were collected from 180 to 300 nm at a scan speed of 200 nm/min for 5 accumulations/sample with a data interval of 0.2 nm. Spectra were corrected for solvent background, and the peptide concentration was quantified by amino acid analysis. The raw CD signal was converted to molar ellipticity, [Θ], by [Θ] = Θobserved (MRW/10·l·c), where MRW is the mean residue weight (molecular mass divided by number of peptide bonds), l is path length in cm, and c is concentration in mg/ml. Spectral data were input into the program SSE, version 1.00.00 (JASCO), which is based upon the least squares method of Chang-Wu-Yang (25Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 26Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) for estimation of secondary structure characteristics. Binding Assay—HEK 293 T cells were plated (600,000 cells/well) in poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and transfected with 0.5 μg of the various NPSR constructs as described above. 48 h following transfection, cells were washed with 2% glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with various concentrations of 125I-NPS (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) in binding buffer (1 mm tyrosine, 1 mm phenylalanine, 1 mg/ml glucose, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) and in the presence or absence of unlabeled NPS (at 100 times the concentration of 125I-NPS) for 2 h at 4°C with mild agitation. Cells were then washed twice and lysed in the presence of 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Bound radioligand was measured by scintillation counting on a 1450 Microbeta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy and ELISA—HEK 293 T cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 8-well slides or 24-well plates (at 50,000 or 150,000 cells per well for immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISAs, respectively), incubated for 24 h, and transfected with the various NPSR constructs as described above. Analyses were carried out 48 h following transfection, as follows. For analysis of non-permeabilized cells, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:500 in blocking buffer) for 30 min. Cells were then washed, fixed in the presence of 3% paraformaldehyde (15 min, 4 °C), and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in blocking buffer. For immunofluorescence, cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500, Invitrogen), coverslips were mounted on the slides, and images were acquired on an Axioplan2 imaging microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For ELISAs, cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500; Roche Applied Science, Laval, Canada) and cleavage of the horseradish peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was monitored as per the manufacturer's instructions by measuring spectral absorbance at 492 nm. For analysis of permeabilized cells, cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to incubation with anti-FLAG antibody. Functional Properties of NPSR Variants—It has previously been demonstrated that a single nucleotide polymorphism leading to mutation of residue Asn-107 to Ile in NPSR is associated with an increased risk for asthma (4Laitinen T.

Hudson T.J. Laitinen L.A. Kere J. Science. 2004; 304: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that this mutation causes an increase in the potency of NPS for NPSR (14Reinscheid R.K. Xu Y.L. Okamura N. Zeng J. Chung S. Pai R. Wang Z. Civelli O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To confirm the latter finding, we assessed NPS-dependent intracellular Ca2+-mobilization of the wild type (WT) and N107I variants of both NPSR-A and NPSR-B splice isoforms in multiple clones of CHO-NPSR cells. As shown in Table 1, NPS activates NPSR-A-N107I with a ∼10-fold higher potency than its WT counterpart NPSR-A. This pattern is also observed for NPSR-B-N107I and NPSR-B and was confirmed in transiently transfected HEK 293 T cells (as described below). A comparison of the two splice variants themselves, however, reveals no significant difference in their potency for NPS, regardless of the nature of residue 107 (Table 1).TABLE 1Activity of NPS on different NPSR variants EC50 values (mean ± S.D.) were obtained from multiple Ca2+ mobilization concentration-response curves generated in at least three different clonal cell lines (CHO cells) or in bulk populations of transiently-transfected cells (HEK cells).NPSR variantEC50CHO-NPSR cellsHEK-NPSR cellsnmNPSR-A8.3 ± 5.126.1 ± 17.3NPSR-B9.5 ± 7.648.3 ± 11.0NPSR-A-N107I1.4 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 compared to corresponding WT receptor (NPSR-A or NPSR-B) using Student's t test2.1 ± 1.3ap < 0.05 compared to corresponding WT receptor (NPSR-A or NPSR-B) using Student's t testNPSR-B-N107I1.0 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 compared to corresponding WT receptor (NPSR-A or NPSR-B) using Student's t test3.9 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 compared to corresponding WT receptor (NPSR-A or NPSR-B) using Student's t testa p < 0.05 compared to corresponding WT receptor (NPSR-A or NPSR-B) using Student's t test Open table in a new tab Secondary Structure of NPS—To study the molecular basis for the functional difference between the WT and N107I variants, we first sought to investigate structure-function relationships in the WT receptor and its ligand.

https://openalex.org/W2080469947,"Two splice variants are derived from the BCL-x gene, proapoptotic Bcl-x(s) and antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L), via alternative 5' splice site selection. In previous studies, our laboratory identified an RNA cis-element within exon 2 of Bcl-x pre-mRNA that is a ceramide responsive termed CRCE 1. In this study, mass spectrometric analysis identified the splicing factor SAP155, as an RNA trans-acting factor binding to the purine-rich CRCE 1. The interaction of SAP155 with CRCE 1 was confirmed by the addition of an anti-SAP155 antibody (Ab) to EMSA decreasing the mobility of a protein:CRCE 1 complex (SuperShift). Furthermore, the down-regulation of SAP155 in A549 cells by RNA interference (RNAi) technology resulted in the loss of a 155 kDa protein complexed with CRCE 1. Moreover, this down-regulation of SAP155 induced an increase in the Bcl-x(s) with a concomitant decrease in the Bcl-x(L) splice variants and immunoreactive protein levels, thereby decreasing the Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) ratio. Specific down-regulation of SAP155 also inhibited the ability of exogenous ceramide treatment to further induce the activation of the Bcl-x(s) 5' splice site. Additionally, the specific down-regulation of SAP155 sensitized cells to undergo apoptosis in response to daunorubicin in a manner similar to ceramide. Therefore, we have identified SAP155 as an RNA trans-acting factor that binds to CRCE 1, functions to regulate the alternative 5' splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA, and is required for ceramide to induce the activation of the Bcl-x(s) 5' splice site. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that activation of the Bcl-x(s) 5' splice site can increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drug treatment, thus establishing a role for the alternative splicing mechanism of Bcl-x in chemotherapeutic sensitivity."

Chem. 1970; 245: 3129-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPO catalyzes P450-like oxygen insertion reactions (8Griffin B. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 85-137Google Scholar). Of particular interest for commercial applications is the enantioselective formation of epoxides from alkenes (9Allain E.J. Hager L.P. Deng L. Jacobsen E.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4415-4416Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Colonna S. Gaggero N. Casella L. Carrea G. Pasta P. Tetrahedron-Asymmetry. 1993; 4: 1325-1330Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), because CPO utilizes H2O2, whereas P450 enzymes depend on both molecular oxygen and electron transfer proteins. The capability of CPO to perform these diverse reactions makes it one of the most versatile of all known heme proteins. Structurally, CPO is unique, but it shares features with both peroxidases and P450 enzymes (11Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). As in cytochrome P450 enzymes, the proximal heme ligand of CPO is a cysteine (Cys-29), but similar to peroxidases, the distal side of the heme in CPO is polar. However, unlike other peroxidases, the normally conserved distal arginine is lacking in CPO and the catalytic acid base of CPO is a glutamic acid (Glu-183) and not a histidine. When Glu-183 is mutated to a histidine, the chlorination activity is reduced by 85%, which indicates the importance of this acidic residue for the catalytic activity of CPO (12Yi X. Conesa A. Punt P.J. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13855-13859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CPO is reactive at low pH with an optimum at pH 2.8 (1Beckwith J.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3091-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is likely due to the high redox potential required to oxidize a chloride anion, and therefore a glutamic acid residue instead of a histidine is used as a catalytic acid base. The crystal structure of CPO in the ferric ground state was determined more than 10 years ago by the group of Thomas Poulos (11Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). On the distal side of the heme, a water molecule is located 3.4 Å away from the iron. This water is displaced by the incoming H2O2. It is generally assumed that Glu-183 abstracts a proton from the hydrogen peroxide bound to heme, yielding a short-lived peroxo-anion species (compound 0) (13Wagenknecht H.A. Woggon W.D. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 367-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the next step Glu-183 is expected to protonate the terminal oxygen to facilitate the heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond. Subsequently, water is released and compound I, the oxoferryl(IV) porphyrin π cation radical, is formed. Compound I can oxidize a chloride anion and has been proposed to form an Fe(III)-hypohalite intermediate (14Libby R.D. Thomas J.A. Kaiser L.W. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5030-5037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a species has been detected spectroscopically at pH 4.4 (13Wagenknecht H.A. Woggon W.D. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 367-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been entirely resolved whether this hypohalite intermediate directly chlorinates the organic substrate (15Libby R.D. Beachy T.M. Phipps A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21820-21827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), or if HOCl is released upon protonation of the intermediate, and free HOCl or Cl2 perform the chlorination reactions (16Griffin B.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because CPO shows only low substrate specificity and chlorinates a wide range of substrates non-stereospecifically (17Ramakrishnan K. Oppenhuizen M.E. Saunders S. Fisher J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3271-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it might indeed be that free HOCl or Cl2 perform these reactions in solution. In contrast, it has been reported that glycals (18Liu K.K.C. Wong C.H. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 3748-3750Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and steroids (19Neidleman S.L. Diassi P.A. Junta B. Palmere R.M. Pan S.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1966; 44: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Levine S.D. Neidleman S.L. Oberc M. Tetrahedron. 1968; 24: 2979-2984Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are stereospecifically halogenated, indicating that there must be an interaction between the organic substrate and CPO. Binding of organic substrates at the active site is also supported by the observation that epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions (21Colonna S. Gaggero N. Manfredi A. Casella L. Gullotti M. Carrea G. Pasta P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10465-10468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) are catalyzed stereospecifically. Binding of the substrate cyclopentanedione (CPD) to CPO has been shown by NMR titration experiments (22Wang X. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structures of CPO bound with small diatomic or triatomic ligands, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, cyanide, and thiocyanate have been determined, but so far the soaking of organic substrates into CPO crystals has been unsuccessful (23Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 461-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore information on the structural basis of substrate binding and specificity has been limited. Here we present crystal structures of CPO bound to its substrate CPD and of a ternary complex of the enzyme with cyanide and Me2SO. We co-crystallized CPO with either bromide or iodide and could identify several binding sites, which suggest a pathway for halide access to the heme. Also described are the structures of CPO complexed with acetate, nitrate, and formate, which have been shown to bind to the enzyme (24Sono M. Dawson J.H. Hall K. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The implications of these structures for the mechanism of compound I formation are discussed. Co-crystallization with Halides—CPO was expressed and purified as described previously (25Blanke S.R. Yi S. Hager L.P. Biotechnol. Lett. 1989; 11: 769-774Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 20 °C. 1 μl of 15 mg/ml CPO in 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.8, was mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution. The reservoir solution for the iodide crystals contained 50 mm NaI, 20% PEG 3350, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 3.6, similar to previously published crystallization conditions (11Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Rod-like crystals grew within a few days. CPO crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after transfer into 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10% (w/v) xylitol, 50 mm NaI, 20% PEG 3350, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 3.6. Bromide-containing crystals were grown in a similar fashion as the iodide crystals in a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 3.6. The cryoprotectant solution for the bromide crystals consisted of mother liquor supplemented with 10% (w/v) sucrose and 10% (w/v) xylitol. Complexes with Cyclopentanedione and Me2SO—A 2 m CPD stock solution was prepared in Me2SO. Crystals grown in mother liquor containing KBr were transferred into a soaking solution containing 200 mm CPD, 10% Me2SO, 50 mm KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.6 and were incubated for 15 min at 20 °C. Crystals were then moved into the soaking solution supplemented with 15% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. A CPD-cyanide ternary complex was attempted by first soaking the crystals in 50 mm KCN, 50 mm KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 6 for 5 min at 20 °C. Crystals were then transferred to a solution containing 50 mm KCN, 200 mm CPD, 10% Me2SO, 50 mm KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 6 for 10 min at 20 °C. Crystals were subsequently moved into a cryoprotectant containing 15% ethylene glycol, 50 mm KCN, 200 mm CPD, 10% Me2SO, 50 mm KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 6 and cryogenically cooled. Nitrate-, Formate-, and Acetate-bound Complexes—The reservoir solution for the nitrate complex contained 50 mm Mg(NO3)2, 20% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.6. The cryoprotectant solution contained 30% ethylene glycol, 50 mm Mg(NO3)2, 20% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.6. The CPO formate crystals were grown in a solution containing 100 mm sodium formate, 24% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.6. The acetate complex was prepared by soaking CPO crystals grown in the presence of 50 mm KBr in a solution containing 300 mm acetic acid, 50 mm KBr, 22% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 2 for 10 min at 20 °C. Crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant consisting of mother liquor supplemented with either 15% ethylene glycol, or 10% (w/v) xylitol and 10% (w/v) sucrose, and then cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Solution—Diffraction data of cryo-cooled crystals were collected at 100 K with a Nonius FR591 rotating anode or at synchrotrons at beamlines X06SA, X10SA (Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland), and ID 14-4 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Data were processed with the XDS software package (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Structures were determined by molecular replacement with Amore (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) using the previously published CPO structure (pdb accession code: 1cpo) (11Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L.

CPO has been previously crystallized in the presence of 300 mm NaCl, but despite the high chloride concentration and good resolution of the data (1.9 Å) no chloride ions were included in the model (11Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We attempted to identify halide binding sites by making use of the anomalous signals of bromine and iodine (Fig. 1A). This approach was not feasible with chlorine, because the K-edge of this element is at 4.39 Å. Therefore, CPO was crystallized in the presence of either NaI or KBr. A 1.7-Å resolution data set of a CPO-iodide crystal was collected in-house (Table 1). Iodine shows a strong anomalous signal at the copper Kα wavelength. An anomalous bromine data set (K-edge) was measured at the synchrotron. Using anomalous difference electron density maps, a bromide/iodide binding site (I/Br1) was identified at the surface of CPO (Fig. 1, A and B). This binding site has occupancies of 60% for bromide and 30% for iodide and likely serves as a docking site for halide anions. The anion binds in a dent on the surface and is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ala-265, and by participation in a water network. This site is close to a narrow channel connecting the protein surface with the heme. In addition, there is a second channel with a larger diameter connecting the surface and active site but no halides bound in proximity to this channel. 8 Å away from the docking site I/Br1, a second binding site (I/Br2) is located within the narrow channel (Fig. 1B). The anions bound at this position do not interact directly with the protein but instead participate in a water network, which might explain the low occupancy observed for this site (20% for iodide and 30% for bromide). The channel has a radius of ∼2 Å. A third binding site specific for iodide (I3), occupancy 40%, is present at the end of the channel above the heme (Fig. 1, A-C). This site is located 6 Å from halide binding site 2 and 8.8 Å from the heme iron. The amide group of Asn-74 forms a hydrogen bond with the iodide (distance, 3.5 Å). The iodide also forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which are present in the middle of the wider channel (Fig. 1C). The other neighbors of I3 are hydrophobic with distances of ∼4 Å to the side chains of residues Leu-70, Phe-103, Ile-179, and Ala-267, respectively. These three sites suggest a pathway for halide access to the heme through the narrow channel. Although no binding sites of halides were observed in the wide channel, we cannot exclude diffusion of halide anions through the wider channel to the heme. Soaking crystals with high concentrations of bromide or iodide can be used to prepare heavy atom derivatives for phasing. The anions mainly bind in the ordered solvent region at the protein surface (35Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Also in CPO, four additional halide binding sites, showing different occupancies, are located at the surface of the molecule. At these sites, the anions replaced water molecules from the solvent shell. The halide anions form hydrogen bonds with side chains and amides of the protein backbone, and form ion pairs with positively charged basic residues. The iodide and bromide at binding site 4 also interact with a symmetry-related CPO molecule. These binding sites on the surface are far away from the channels leading to the heme and are unlikely to be of catalytic relevance. We obtained a 1.15-Å resolution data set from an exceptionally well diffracting CPO-iodide crystal at the synchrotron. The high resolution structure gives detailed insight into the location of water molecules at the active site (Fig. 1C). Near the heme, the wider channel is lined by mainly hydrophobic side chains with the exception of Glu-183 and Asn-74. A narrow water funnel is present in the center of this channel. The water molecules are arranged like pearls on a string within this funnel, although not at fixed positions. The side chains of Phe-186 and Phe-103 are located almost parallel atop of the heme plane and shield the active site from solvent. The distance between Phe-186 and Phe-103 is 6.2 Å. A water molecule is ∼3.5 Å away from both aromatic side chains and is stabilized at this position by a hydrogen bond with Glu-183. The distance between the iron and this water is 3.5 Å. Complexes of CPO with Organic Substrates—CPO has been proposed to catalyze the chlorination of CPD during biosynthesis of caldariomycin (1Beckwith J.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3091-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Beckwith J.R. Clark R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3086-3090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR titration experiments showed that CPO binds CPD with only low affinity (Kd = 33 mm) (22Wang X. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which might explain why diffusing organic substrates into CPO crystals was previously unsuccessful (23Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 461-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because CPD binds only weakly, crystals were soaked in solutions containing very high concentrations of CPD (200 mm). A data set was collected to a resolution of 1.8 Å. CPD binds above the heme and is sandwiched between Phe-103 and Phe-186, with a distance of ∼3.5 Å to both aromatic side chains (Fig. 2, A and B). The substrate displaces the heme water, with one carbonyl oxygen of CPD adopting the position of the water. The distance between this carbonyl oxygen and Glu-183 is 2.5 Å. The second carbonyl oxygen of CPD forms hydrogen bonds with two water molecules, one of which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with Asn-74, whereas the former participates in a network of water molecules (Fig. 2B). Only a small conformational change is observed in the protein upon substrate binding; the side chain of Phe-103 moves 0.5 Å away from the active site for steric reasons. The position of the bound substrate observed here seems unproductive with respect to the chlorination reaction for two reasons. First, the methylene group, which becomes halogenated, is in an unfavorable orientation. It points away from the active site, and the distance between the carbon and the iron is 5.8 Å. Second, the molecule binds too close to the active site, which would not permit formation of the hypohalite intermediate from hydrogen peroxide and chloride, because the distance between the CPD carbonyl oxygen and iron is only 3.4 Å. Nevertheless, the CPD-bound structure explains the results of NMR titration experiments (22Wang X. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). CPD binds with only low affinity (Kd = 33 mm), but when iodide was present the affinity between CPO and CPD decreased even further (Kd = 123 mm). When superimposing the iodide and the CPD-bound structure it became clear that CPD clashes with the iodide-specific binding site, because the distance between the second carbonyl oxygen and the iodide is only 1.9 Å. The dissociation constant of CPD binding in the presence of NaCl is 31 mm, very similar to the value observed in the absence of halides (22Wang X. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating that chloride does not bind at this site and further supports the idea that this binding site is specific for iodide. To force CPD to bind at a different, catalytically more sensible site, we tried to block the above described binding site by soaking the crystals first in cyanide, which coordinates to the iron, and then transfer the crystals into a CPD-containing solution. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 1.7 Å. A cyanide molecule bound at the heme iron is visible in the electron density map (Fig. 2C). The diatomic ligand binds in a slightly bent orientation with an Fe-C-N angle of 156°. The distance between the cyanide carbon and the iron is 1.9 Å (Fig. 2D). This differs significantly from the previously reported value of 2.6 Å for a CPO-cyanide complex (23Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 461-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The shorter distance is in agreement with previously reported values (36Fedorov R. Ghosh D.K. Schlichting I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Blair-Johnson M. Fiedler T. Fenna R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13990-13997Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, no CPD was observed in the CPO-cyanide complex. Instead, previously unobserved density was visible at the iodide binding site (Fig. 2C). This density corresponds to Me2SO, which was used to prepare the CPD stock solution. The final Me2SO concentration in the soaking solutions was 10% (v/v). It has been observed earlier that Me2SO is also a substrate of CPO (38Geigert J. DeWitt S.K. Neidleman S.L. Lee G. Dalietos D.J. Moreland M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

When the reaction is carried out with bromide or chloride, dimethyl sulfone remains the major product and ∼1% of either bromodimethyl sulfoxide or chlorodimethyl sulfone are formed (38Geigert J. DeWitt S.K. Neidleman S.L. Lee G. Dalietos D.J. Moreland M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The sulfoxide oxygen and the side-chain amide group of Asn-74 form a hydrogen bond (distance 2.9 Å). The Me2SO molecule is not in a favorable orientation for the sulfur to react with the compound I intermediate to form dimethyl sulfone, because the sulfur faces away from the active site. Also, the distance between sulfur and iron is too large (7.8 Å) for a direct interaction with a reactive oxygen species. Nevertheless, it is very likely that Me2SO binds transiently at this site when it diffuses through the channel to the heme. The distance between the methyl group of Me2SO and the nitrogen of the cyanide (3.3 Å) would permit a direct halogenation of Me2SO by the hypohalite iron intermediate. CPO Complexed with Acetate, Nitrate, and Formate—Nitrate, acetate, and formate all bind to the active site of CPO. The dissociation constants have been previously determined spectroscopically. The values reported at pH 3 are 0.55 mm for nitrate, 93 mm for acetate, and 0.135 mm for formate, respectively (24Sono M. Dawson J.H. Hall K. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At low pH, both nitrate and acetate bind at the distal site of the heme and are sandwiched between Phe-103 and Phe-186 (Fig. 3B). The acetate adopts two conformations (Fig. 3, A and B). In its first conformation, the acetate and also the nitrate are located in a similar orientation perpendicular to the heme plane but do not bind straight above the iron, because that would cause steric clashes with Phe-186 (Fig. 3, A-C). This aromatic residue also causes acetate to bind in a tilted orientation toward the heme in its second conformation. The angle between the planes spanned by the heme and the acetate molecule is ∼60°. The distance between the acetate oxygen and the iron is only 2.4 Å compared with 3.5 Å in the conformation further away, thus heme and the “closer” acetate can interact. The two conformations of acetate observed in the"

The recent demonstration that human α-defensins could prevent deleterious effects of anthrax lethal toxin in vitro and in vivo led us to examine the effects of θ-defensins on Bacillus anthracis (Sterne). We tested rhesus θ-defensins 1-3, retrocyclins 1-3, and several analogues of RC-1. Low concentrations of θ-defensins not only killed vegetative cells of B. anthracis (Sterne) and rendered their germinating spores nonviable, they also inactivated the enzymatic activity of anthrax lethal factor and protected murine RAW-264.7 cells from lethal toxin, a mixture of lethal factor and protective antigen. Structure-function studies indicated that the cyclic backbone, intramolecular tri-disulfide ladder, and arginine residues of θ-defensins contributed substantially to these protective effects. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that retrocyclins bound the lethal factor rapidly and with high affinity. Retrocyclin-mediated inhibition of the enzymatic activity of lethal factor increased substantially if the enzyme and peptide were preincubated before substrate was added. The temporal discrepancy between the rapidity of binding and the slowly progressive extent of lethal factor inhibition suggest that post-binding events, perhaps in situ oligomerization, contribute to the antitoxic properties of retrocyclins. Overall, these findings suggest that θ-defensins provide molecular templates that could be used to create novel agents effective against B. anthracis and its toxins. θ-defensins are cyclic octadecapeptides encoded by the modified α-defensin genes of certain nonhuman primates.

Under normal circumstances Bacillus anthracis causes human infections only in individuals exposed to infected farm animals or their spore-contaminated products. The virulence of B. anthracis primarily derives from the hardiness of its spores, an anti-phagocytic capsule that surrounds its vegetative cells (1Green B.D. Battisti L. Koehler T.M. Thorne C.B.

Both toxins contain protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa). LeTx also contains lethal factor (LF, 90 kDa), and EdTx contains edema factor (EF, 89 kDa). The genes for all three toxin components, PA, LF, and EF, reside on the pXO1 plasmid (2Okinaka R.T. Cloud K. Hampton O. Hoffmaster A.R. Hill K.K. Keim P. Koehler T.M. Lamke G. Kumano S. Mahillon J.

The PA20 diffuses away, and the residual receptor-bound PA63 molecules self-associate into ring-shaped heptamers (9Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol.

They are believed to be especially important as “first responders” to microbial and viral incursions and to play critical roles in defending the mucosal surfaces that line the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Humans express 6 different α-defensins and 30 or more β-defensins (24Scheetz T. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Schutte B.C. Casavant T.L. McCray Jr., P.B. Immunol.

Barnajian M. Maldonado-Arocho F.J. Sanchez A.M. Bradley K.A. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, B. anthracis was grown in Trypticase soy broth medium (T8907, Sigma) at 30 °C with constant shaking at 250 rpm for 5-7 days until sporulation. The culture was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in sterile water, and cultured at 30 °C for two more days with constant shaking to promote further sporulation and bacterial lysis. Complete spore formation was confirmed by light microscopy. Spores were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and washed five times with sterile water. Before use, the spores were heated at 65 °C for 30 min to kill any germinated or germinating spores. No intact bacilli were present at this stage. Serial dilutions of the spore preparation were plated on Trypticase soy agar plates to determine the concentration of colony forming units.Radial Diffusion AssayTwo-stage radial diffusion assays were used to test the antimicrobial activity of peptides against B. anthracis spores and vegetative cells (34Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).Stage 1—1-4 × 106 colony forming units were dispersed in a thin 1% agarose underlay gel containing 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Trypticase soy broth. A 6 × 6 array of wells, each with a 3-mm diameter and 9-μl capacity, was punched. Serially diluted peptide solutions containing 250, 79, 25, 7.9, 2.5, and 0.79 μg/ml peptides (8 μl each) were added to each set of 6 wells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow the peptides to diffuse into the underlay gel.Stage 2—An overlay gel containing 60 mg/ml Trypticase soy broth powdered medium plus 1% agarose was poured over the underlay gel, and the plate was incubated overnight to allow surviving bacteria to form micro-colonies. The clear zones around each well were measured 18-24 h later. To determine the minimal effective concentration (MEC), a linear regression function relating the adjusted diameter (zone diameter minus the well diameter) to the log10 peptide concentration was calculated. The X-intercept defined by this function gives the MEC. Typically, the correlation coefficient (r2) was >0.98.Enzymatic AssayThe enzymatic activity of anthrax lethal factor (LF), a zinc metalloprotease, was measured by monitoring cleavage of a specific substrate by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The substrate, purchased from Calbiochem, was an internally quenched, N-acetylated, C-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin derivative of a 14-mer mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated-kinase-2 (MEK-2) peptide. Its cleavage by recombinant LF (Calbiochem) resulted in increased fluorescence that was monitored kinetically with an fmax fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. Unless otherwise noted, 100 nm LF was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the specified amount of θ-defensin peptide before 50 μm substrate (final concentration) was added.Murine Macrophage IntoxicationMurine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 384-well plates at 4000 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The medium was replaced by 20 μl of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg (each) penicillin and streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum. The α- and θ-defensin peptides were serially diluted into the same medium, and 20 μl was added to appropriate wells. Peptide concentrations ranged from 0 to 60 μg/ml. LeTx (20 μl) diluted in fresh media was added to each well giving final concentrations of 100 ng/ml PA and 100 ng/ml LF. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cell viability was assayed with the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability kit per the manufacturer's (Promega, Madison, WI) instructions. IC50 values were obtained with GraphPad Prism Software.UltracentrifugationSedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 25 °C in 12-mm path length double sector cells on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorption was monitored at 228 nm for 0.1 mg/ml samples and 260 nm for 1.0 mg/ml samples. Peptide samples were in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and sedimentation equilibrium profiles were measured at 40,000 and 50,000 rpm. The data were initially fitted with a nonlinear least-squares exponential fit for a single ideal species using the Beckman Origin-based software (version 3.01). Preliminary analysis of the association behavior used the global analysis software (the “multifit” option of the abovementioned software) to analyze four scans simultaneously, corresponding to protein at 0.1 mg/ml at 40,000 and 50,000 rpm and protein at 1.0 mg/ml at 40,000 and 50,000 rpm. The partial specific volume (0.711 of RC-1 was calculated from its amino acid composition (35Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J. T Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York1943: 374-377Google Scholar).Surface Plasmon Resonance StudiesSPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins were immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip using the BIAcore amine-coupling protocol. Analytes were introduced into the flow cells in a running buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA. The running buffer also contained 0.005% polysorbate-20 to reduce nonspecific binding. Values were corrected for background binding to the CM5 chip. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.1 software, and curve fitting was done with an assumption of 1:1 binding.SPR results are expressed in resonance units (RUs). To calibrate the instrument, we synthesized [14C]RC-2, which contained [14C]glycine (Sigma) and purchased 125I-bovine serum albumin (BSA) from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). The [14C]RC-2 had a specific activity of 21.6 μCi/mg, and the 125I-BSA had a specific activity of 987 μCi/mg. To calibrate the system for BSA, we immobilized a mouse anti-BSA monoclonal antibody (U.S. Biological, Swampscott, MA) on a CM5 biosensor chip. After measuring the binding of 125I-BSA (1 μg/ml) to the biosensor chip, the bound analyte was recovered using the BIAcore Analyte Recovery Wizard®x program, and its radioactivity was measured in a Beckman liquid scintillation spectrometer. From seven such measurements, we determined that 1 RU of BSA was equivalent to 13.35 ± 0.55 pg (mean ± S.E.). We used this value to estimate the amount of immobilized LF on the biosensor chip in experiments with retrocyclins. To obtain a conversion factor for RC-2, we used a biosensor that contained immobilized recombinant gp120 (BioDesign International, Saco, ME). From these experiments, we determined that 1 RU corresponded to 4.41 ± 0.15 pg of RC-2 (mean ± S.E., n = 3). We used these values to estimate the stoichiometry with which retrocyclins bound to LF.Computational MethodsDocking was accomplished with the AutoDock 3.06 suite of programs (36Morris G.M.

The circular peptide backbone was kept fixed during docking. Open table in a new tab Van der Waals and electrostatic energy grid maps were prepared using AutoGrid (36Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8960) Google Scholar). These grid maps define the cubic space in the vicinity of receptor in which the search for the optimally binding ligand conformer is focused. The grid points were spaced 0.375 Å apart and based on the centers of L1 and L2, with the grid sized to allow a 5-Å clearance on either side of the ligands in the x, y, and z dimensions. For RC-2 and RTD-1 two grid sizes were used. The first grid was based on the N terminus MAPPK-2 peptide in complex with anthrax lethal factor (1JKY) (38Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which spans the entire active site. This grid was therefore centered on the MAPKK-2 peptide, also with a 5-Å clearance on either side in the x, y, and z dimensions and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. Later, when it was found that the RTD-1 and RC-2 docked only in a cavity close to the C-terminal end of the MAPKK-2 peptide in active site, the grid size was reduced to cover only that volume of space to improve the search efficiency. RC-1 was therefore docked using the smaller grid alone. The force-field parameters of AutoDock 2.4 were used to evaluate nonbonded interaction energies instead of using the parameters of AutoDock 3.0, which estimates free energies. This was because the presence of a large number of conformational degrees of freedom in the docked ligands presented challenges with the estimation of the torsional free energy term (36Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8960) Google Scholar). The reported binding energies are therefore representative of binding enthalpies and not binding free energies. Electrostatic interactions were evaluated using a distance-dependent dielectric constant to model solvent effects.For the global search using the LGA, the size of the initial random population was 200 individuals for the large grids and 50 individuals otherwise, the maximal number of energy evaluations was 2 × 107, the maximal number of generations was 500, the number of top individuals that survived into the next generation, the elitism, was 1, the probability that a gene would undergo a random change was 0.02, the crossover probability was 0.80, and the average of the worst energy was calculated over a window of ten generations.For a pure local search, the pseudo-Solis and Wets method was used, whereas the Solis and Wets method was used for the LGA part of the local search. The parameters used for local search in both cases were a maximum of 1000 iterations per local search, the probability of performing a local search on an individual was 1.0, the maximal number of consecutive successes or failures before doubling or halving the step size of the local search was 4, and the lower bound on the step size, 0.01, was the termination criteria for the local search. For RTD-1 and RC-2, a total of 50 dockings was performed using the large grid before switching to the smaller grid. For the root-mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) calculation of docked of L1 and L2, their crystal coordinates were used as reference.RESULTSActivity against Spores and Bacilli—We used the capsule-deficient Sterne strain of B. anthracis to examine the antimicrobial activity of retrocyclins. Radial diffusion and colony counting assays were performed in the presence of physiological NaCl concentrations. Table 2 summarizes the results of our radial diffusion assays, which showed that RC-1 and HNP-1 killed vegetative B. anthracis cells with an MEC < 1 μg/ml. Retrocyclin-1 also manifested this exceptional potency against B. anthracis spores, but HNP-1 did not (MEC 24.9 ± 0.49 μg/ml). Because RC-112, an all d-amino acid version of RC-1, and RC-110, a retroenantio version of RC-1 were as effective as the regular peptide, chiral interactions were apparently not required for antimicrobial activity. RC-111, the retro analog of RC-1, showed reduced activity against vegetative cells (MEC 13.6 ± 2.78 μg/ml)"
https://openalex.org/W2161560597,"Defensins are a family of secreted antimicrobial peptides proposed to directly interfere with bacterial membranes. Here we show a functional analysis of the novel beta-defensin DEFB123. A peptide comprising the beta-defensin core region was synthesized and used for our analysis. Like other beta-defensins, DEFB123 exerted antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which was assessed by microbroth dilution assay and radial diffusion zone assay. In addition, the peptide showed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding activity in a Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Moreover, DEFB123 prevented LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion in a murine monocyte cell line (RAW264.7). Accordingly, DEFB123 abolished LPS-mediated MAPK induction in these cells. Protection against LPS-mediated effects was then investigated in a murine model of acute sepsis. Our experiments show that synthetic beta-defensin DEFB123 prevents LPS-induced mortality in C57BL/6 mice in a therapeutic approach. We propose that the physiological role of beta-defensins may include interference with LPS-action on macrophages, a function formerly thought to be restricted to the family of cathelicidins, a structurally unrelated group of antimicrobial peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2061158065,"Many membrane receptors are made of a ligand binding domain and an effector domain mediating intracellular signaling. This is the case for the metabotropic glutamate-like G-protein-coupled receptors. How ligand binding leads to the active conformation of the effector domain in such receptors is largely unknown. Here, we used an evolutionary trace analysis and mutagenesis to identify critical residues involved in the allosteric coupling between the Venus flytrap ligand binding domain (VFT) and the heptahelical G-protein activating domain of the metabotropic glutamate-like receptors. We have shown that a conserved interdomain disulfide bridge is required for this allosteric interaction.

Many cell surface receptors are composed of multiple domains, one being involved in ligand recognition and another in signal transduction. Understanding how ligand binding leads to the activation of the effector domain is an important issue. Recently, models have been proposed for the coupling between ligand binding and channel opening in the GABAA and nicotinic receptors (1Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.-L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M.

These models took advantage of the known structure of the binding domain and were based on both modeling and mutagenesis studies performed on full-length receptors. However, for most membrane receptors, the molecular mechanism involved in the allosteric coupling between binding and effector domains is poorly understood.Among the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 4The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; HD, heptahelical domain; IP, inositol phosphate; PAM, positive allosteric modulator; VFT, Venus flytrap; mGlu, metabotropic glutamate; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DTT, dithiothreitol; Acc, active-closed-closed; Aco, active-closed-open. 4The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; HD, heptahelical domain; IP, inositol phosphate; PAM, positive allosteric modulator; VFT, Venus flytrap; mGlu, metabotropic glutamate; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DTT, dithiothreitol; Acc, active-closed-closed; Aco, active-closed-open. the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)-like receptors are such allosteric multidomain proteins. This receptor class (class C) includes the receptors for the two main neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, as well as the Ca2+-sensing, some taste (T1R), and pheromone (V2R) receptors (4Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prézeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These GPCRs possess an extracellular Venus flytrap domain (VFT) where agonists bind and a heptahelical transmembrane domain (HD) common to all GPCRs and responsible for G-protein activation. For most of these receptors, except the GABAB receptor, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) linked these two domains. Structural studies as well as functional analysis of receptor mutants indicated that the bilo-bate VFT adopts two major conformations, an inactive open conformation stabilized by competitive antagonists, and an active closed conformation stabilized by agonists (5Kunishima N.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression studies of receptors deleted of both the VFT and the CRD also indicated that the HD can fold alone in a unit oscillating between various active and inactive conformations stabilized by specific synthetic ligands (9Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Binet V. Brajon C.

Indeed, class C GPCRs are dimers, either homodimers like the mGlu and Ca2+-sensing receptors or heterodimers like the GABAB and T1R receptors, and this appears necessary for allosteric coupling between the VFT and the HD. As revealed by x-ray studies, isolated VFTs form dimers, and the stabilization of at least one VFT in a closed state with agonist is associated with a major difference in the relative orientation of these domains (5Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this major conformational change in the VFT dimer has been proposed to affect the general organization of the dimer of HDs leading to their activation (Fig. 1A). However, the detailed mechanism allowing the dimer of VFTs to affect the conformation of the HDs is not known.In the present study, we hypothesized that key residues of the VFT involved in the functional coupling between the VFT and HD domains in these receptors must be conserved during evolution. Using an evolutionary trace analysis associated with mutagenesis and functional studies, we identified a conserved disulfide bridge that cross-links the VFT with the CRD of the mGlu-like receptors and that is crucial for the intramolecular receptor signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Coldand[3H]LY341495 ((2S)-2-amino-2-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxy-cycloprop-1-yl]-3-(xanth-9-yl) propanoic acid) were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). 4-MPPTS (LY487379; 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-[4-(2-methoxyphenoxy) phenyl]-N-(3-pyridinylmethyl)-ethanesulfonamide) was a gift from ADDEX Pharmaceuticals(Geneva,Switzerland).CP-PHA (N-[4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl]-2-hydroxybenzamide) was a gift from Dr. J.

Human thrombin was obtained from CalBiochem.Construction of mGlu2 and mGlu5 Mutants—The plasmids encoding the wild-type mGlu2 or mGlu5 tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) or c-Myc epitope inserted just after the signal peptide, under the control of a cytomegalovirus promotor, were described previously (11Brabet I.

ΔmGlu2 encoding for the heptahelical domain of mGlu2 (fragment Pro-557-Thr-858) was generated by PCR from mGlu2 receptor expression vector and subcloned into pRK5-HA-mGlu2, replacing the MluI-XbaI fragment encoding the entire sequence of mGlu2.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (11Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Bockaert J. Acher F. Pin J.-P. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Ten million cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing mGlu2-WT (2 μg) or mutants (6 μg), mGlu5-WT (0.6 μg) or mutant (3 μg) and completed to a total amount of 10 μg of plasmid DNA with pRK5 empty vector.Inositol Phosphate and Intracellular Calcium Measurements— Measurement of IP accumulation and calcium signal in human embryonic kidney 293 transfected cells was performed in 96-well microplates as previously described (9Goudet C.

Radioligand was displaced by increased concentrations of either cold LY341495 or glutamate, in the absence or presence of positive allosteric modulator LY487379 at 10 μm. The curves were fitted according to the equation y = [(ymax - ymin)/(1 + (×/IC50)nH)) + ymin where the IC50 is the concentration of the compound that inhibits 50% of bound radioligand and nH is the Hill coefficient.Time-resolved FRET Measurements—Time-resolved FRET experiments were conducted as described (13Liu J.

This methodology is based on the non-radiative energy transfer between rare earth cryptates such as europium (Eu3+) cryptates and acceptor fluorophores such as AlexaFluor®647 (Molecular Probes). Briefly, COS-7 cells expressing the HA-tagged mGlu2 were incubated with 1 nm of two different monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies carrying either Eu3+-cryptate pyridine bipyridine or AlexaFluor®647 (provided by Cis Bio International, Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France). As negative control, cells were incubated with only fluorescence donor antibodies.Thrombin Digestion—For Western blot analysis, 20 h after transfection human embryonic kidney 293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) and harvested. The membranes were prepared as previously described (7Bessis A.-S. Rondard P. Gaven F. Brabet I. Triballeau N. Prézeau L. Acher F. Pin J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11097-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For each sample, 50 μg of total proteins were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of 25 units of human thrombin. After 4 h of digestion at 37 °C, each sample were incubated with 6× loading buffer (pH 8.0) in the absence or presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and was subjected to SDS-PAGE by using 6% polyacrylamide gels, containing 6% urea for the samples treated with DTT. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences), probed with anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution 1/400; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and then with anti-rabbit antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.25 μg/ml, and visualized by chemiluminescence (West Pico; Pierce, Rockford, IL).For ELISA analysis, 20 h after transfection COS-7 cells in 96-well microplates were incubated with Tris-Krebs buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin as previously described (13Liu J.

After digestion with thrombin, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Tris-Krebs buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. After DTT treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and an ELISA was performed.Molecular Modeling—A homology model of mGlu1 CRD was generated using the crystal structure of Protein Data Bank accession number 1EXT as template. Models were manually refined with ViTO (16Catherinot V. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3694-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the sequence alignment of the mGlu-like CRD. Final models were built using Modeler 7.0 (17Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10390) Google Scholar) and evaluated using dynamic evolutionary trace as implemented in ViTO.RESULTSEvolutionarily Conserved Areas in mGlu VFT—An evolutionary trace analysis of the surface of class C receptor VFTs was performed after aligning a number of sequences of mGlu, Ca2+-sensing, fish olfactory, taste T1R, and pheromone V2R receptors, including those from nematodes, insects, birds, fishes, and mammals (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The alignment generated with ClustalW was submitted to the ConSurf website server (Consurf.tau.ac.il) (18Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the mGlu1 VFT (PDB accession number 1EWK:B) (5Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) was used to visualize the conservation score of each residue (Fig. 1, B and C). These scores were calculated by taking into account the phylogenetic relationships among the sequences and the similarity between the amino acids in the alignment.A first analysis using the mGlu sequences only (62 sequences) revealed three highly conserved areas at the surface of the mGlu VFT, with most residues displaying a score higher than 8 within a range of 1 to 9 (Fig. 1B). The two larger areas are located on one side of the VFT, one on Lobe 1 and the other on Lobe 2. These two areas correspond to the dimerization interface as identified in the x-ray structures. The third conserved patch of residues is located at the bottom of Lobe 2 and is made of residues that do not make contact with the other protomer in the dimeric VFT structure. A second analysis conducted using the sequences of all mGlu-like receptors (125 sequences) shows the area at the bottom of Lobe 2 is the most conserved one, better conserved than the dimerization interface (Fig. 1C). This cluster includes Tyr-226, Cys-254, and Ala-256 in mGlu1. Electrostatic surface analysis shows this patch of conserved residues forms an apolar surface in mGlu1 (Fig. 1D), consistent with this area being buried in an interface contact with another domain of the receptor subunit.Conserved Cys-234 in Lobe 2 of mGlu2 Is Crucial for Agonist-induced Receptor Activation—We suspected that these residues are involved in the allosteric coupling between the VFT and the HD. In agreement with this proposal, the mutation of Cys-234 into Ala, Ser, Met, or Glu in mGlu2 (equivalent to Cys-254 of mGlu1) (Fig. 2A) completely abolishes agonist-induced responses (Fig. 2B). This clearly results from a loss of function of these receptors because they were correctly expressed at the cell surface as revealed by ELISA performed on intact cells (Fig. 2C). This loss of function does not also result from the absence of agonist binding on the mutated receptors, as verified by glutamate displacement of the antagonist [3H]LY341495 binding (Fig. 2D). Glutamate and LY341495 affinities on Cys-234 mutants are similar to those measured on the wild-type mGlu2 (Fig. 2D and data not shown), indicating that Cys-234 mutation prevents agonists from activating the receptor. However, mutation of Tyr-206 (equivalent to Tyr-226 of mGlu1) into Ala or Glu strongly impairs cell surface expression of the receptor, but it does not prevent agonist-induced activation (data not shown). All together, these results show that the highly conserved Cys in Lobe 2 plays a crucial role in receptor activation; meanwhile, the conserved Tyr likely has a structural role only.FIGURE 2Conserved Cys-234 in Lobe 2 of mGlu2 is crucial for receptor activation.

PAMs of mGlu receptors are known to bind in the HD, to further stabilize the agonist-induced active state, and to increase agonist but not antagonist affinity (21Goudet C. Binet V. Prézeau L. Pin J.-P. Drug Discov. Today Therap. Strat. 2004; 1: 125-133Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As observed for all mGlu receptor PAMs, 4-MPPTS displays no or little agonist activity on the full-length mGlu2 receptor (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, 4-MPPTS directly activated the Cys-234 mutants, like mGlu2 receptor deleted of its entire extracellular domain. This demonstrates that the HD of the mutated receptor retains its ability to reach an active state and stimulate G-proteins. This also shows that the inactive form of the VFT no longer prevents PAMs from acting as agonists in the Cys-234 mutants. As expected for an uncoupling between the VFT and the HD, the left shift of the glutamate displacement curve of [3H]LY341495 binding by 4-MPPTS on the wild-type mGlu2 receptor is not observed for the Cys-234 mutants (Fig. 4). All together, these results demonstrate the conserved Cys-234 plays a crucial role in the allosteric coupling between the VFT and the HD in mGlu-like receptors.FIGURE 3Cys-234 mutations in mGlu2 uncouple VFT from the effector domain.

FRET experiments were conducted on intact cells using anti-HA antibodies conjugated with either the energy donor fluorophore, europium cryptate pyridine bipyridine, or the fluorophore acceptor, AlexaFluor®647 (Fig. 5A). Such an approach enables the detection of receptor dimers at the cell surface only (15Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.-P. Ansanay H. Anal. Chem. 2004; 329: 253-262Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, when cells expressing the N-terminal HA-tagged version of the wild-type or Cys mutant mGlu2, large and similar FRET signals were measured. No such signal was observed between HA-GABAB1 subunits co-expressed with untagged GABAB2 despite a similar expression of the GABAB heterodimer (Fig. 5B, inset).FIGURE 5Cys-234 mutations do not prevent receptor dimerization. A, the schemes depict the experimental approach used to monitor receptor dimers at the cell surface using time-resolved FRET. The FRET signal is measured between an anti-HA antibody linked to a donor molecule (D) and an anti-HA antibody linked to an acceptor molecule (A). Nonspecific FRET signal is evaluated with cells expressing heterodimeric GABAB receptor where only GABAB1 subunit is HA tagged.

Introduction of the thrombin site does not impair receptor targeting to the cell surface (data not shown) or normal functioning of the receptor (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis revealed that the HA-tagged mGlu2 VFT remains covalently linked to the rest of the receptor after cleavage of the thrombin site under control conditions, but not after reduction with DTT (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the VFT can be cleaved of the rest of the receptor by thrombin in the C234A mutant containing the thrombin site, indicating that Cys-234 is involved in a covalent linkage between the VFT and another domain of the protein. When using this mGlu2THR-C234A mutant, thrombin cleavage releases a dimer of VFTs, as expected because of the known disulfide bridge that cross-links the VFTs in the dimer (Fig. 6A). VFT monomer of this mutant receptor can only be observed after DTT treatment.FIGURE 6Cys-234 of mGlu2 is involved in a disulfide bridge with the rest of the subunit.

We examined whether or not the HA-tagged VFT could be released from the cell surface after cleavage with thrombin. ELISA analysis showed that the VFT can be cleaved of the cell surface under non-reducing conditions in the mGlu2THR-C234A mutant only, but not in the wild-type mGlu2 or in mGlu2THR that still contains Cys-234 (Fig. 6D). In contrast, after DTT treatment, the HA-tagged VFT of both mGlu2THR-C234A and mGlu2THR can be released after thrombin.Cys-518 of mGlu2 CRD Is the Partner of Cys-234—We employed the above approach in an attempt to identify the possible partner of Cys-234 in mGlu2. Within the HD, only two conserved Cys can be identified that correspond to those highly conserved in nearly all GPCRs and involved in a disulfide bridge between the top of TM3 and the extracellular loop 2 (22Zhang P. Johnson P.S. Zöllner C. Wang W. Wang Z. Montes A.E. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Surratt C.K. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Fredriksson R. Lagerstrom M.C. Lundin L.G. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). The CRD is composed of nine highly conserved Cys, such that at least one of these cannot be involved in an intra-CRD disulfide bridge and may possibly be linked to the VFT. We mutated any of the nine Cys of the CRD into Ala in the mGlu2THR, and the release of HA-tagged VFT by thrombin at the cell surface was measured as previously (Fig. 7A). All of these mutants were correctly expressed at the cell surface, whereas their glutamate-induced stimulation were abolished (data not shown). Under non-reducing conditions, HA-tagged VFT was released only for the Cys-518 mutant, suggesting Cys-518 is the partner Cys involved in the disulfide bond with Cys-234. Under reducing conditions, HA-tagged VFT was released efficiently for all mGlu2THR CRD mutants, indicating thrombin digestions were efficient for all Cys mutants.FIGURE 7Cys-234 of mGlu2 VFT is involved in a disulfide bridge with the CRD domain. A, release of HA-tagged VFT by thrombin in mGlu2THR where the nine conserved Cys in CRD were changed into Ala in mGlu2THR and in wild-type mGlu2 expressed at the cell surface as in Fig. 6D. Values are means ± S.E. of triplicates from a typical experiment. B, pictogram of the dimeric HA-tagged mGlu2THR where the disulfide bond between Cys-234 and the third conserved Cys in CRD (Cys-518) is depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If Cys-518 is involved in a disulfide bridge formation with Cys-234, then one expects that a similar functional phenotype will be observed for both C234A and C518A mutants. As expected, mutation of Cys-518 into Ala resulted in a drastic decrease in receptor activation by glutamate, although in that case a small Glu-mediated response could still be seen (Fig. 8A). This may well result from the different environments of Cys-234 and Cys-518. Moreover, and as observed with the Cys-234 mutants, the mGlu2 PAM acts as an agonist,"

The enzyme is synthesized as a latent 65-kDa protein and is processed in the lysosomal compartment to an active 58-kDa heterodimer, where it is stored in a stable form. In contrast, its heparan sulfate substrate is localized extracellularly, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that trigger heparanase secretion. Here we show that secretion of the active enzyme is mediated by the protein kinase A and C pathways. Moreover, secretion of active heparanase was observed upon cell stimulation with physiological concentrations of adenosine, ADP, and ATP, as well as by the noncleavable ATP analogue adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Indeed, heparanase secretion was noted upon cell stimulation with a specific P2Y1 receptor agonist and was inhibited by P2Y receptor antagonists. The kinetics of heparanase secretion resembled the secretion of cathepsin D, a lysosomal enzyme, indicating that the secreted heparanase is of lysosomal origin. We suggest that secretion of active heparanase is initiated by extracellular cues activating the protein kinase A and C signaling pathways.

HSPG consist of a protein core to which HS side chains are covalently attached. These complex macromolecules are highly abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and are thought to play an important structural role, contributing to ECM integrity and insolubility (3Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). In addition, HS side chains can bind a variety of biological mediators, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, thus functioning as a readily available reservoir that can be liberated upon local or systemic cues. Moreover, HSPG on the cell surface participate in signal transduction cascades by potentiating the interaction between certain growth factors and their receptors (4David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5Ornitz D.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 6Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P.

HS-degrading activity is thus expected to affect several fundamental aspects of cell behavior under normal and pathological settings and should therefore be kept tightly regulated. Traditionally, heparanase activity was implicated in cellular invasion associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer metastasis (7Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M. Ariav Y. Schirrmacher V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2704-2711PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakajima M. Irimura T. DiFerrante D. DiFerrante N. Nicolson G.L.

This notion gained further support by employing small interfering RNA and ribozyme technologies, clearly depicting heparanase-mediated HS cleavage and ECM remodeling as critical requisites for metastatic spread (12Edovitsky E. Elkin M. Zcharia E. Peretz T. Vlodavsky I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Since the cloning of the heparanase gene and the availability of specific molecular probes, heparanase up-regulation was documented in an increasing number of primary human tumors, correlating with enhanced local and distant metastasis, increased microvessel density, and reduced postoperative survival of cancer patients. Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence for the clinical relevance of the enzyme, making it an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer drugs (1Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y.

Similar to several other classes of enzymes, heparanase is first synthesized as a latent enzyme that appears as a ∼65-kDa protein when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The 65-kDa latent enzyme is directed to the ER by a C terminal 35-amino acid signal peptide and is readily detected in the culture medium of transfected cells (14Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A.

Applying a polyclonal antibody (number 733) that preferentially recognizes the 50-kDa heparanase subunit versus the 65-kDa latent enzyme, we have demonstrated that the 50-kDa active heparanase subunit similarly resides in endocytic vesicles, assuming a perinuclear localization (16Zetser A.

More recently, we have demonstrated heparanase processing by endosomal/lysosomal preparation (22Cohen E. Atzmon R. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N.

We investigated this hypothesis by examining heparanase secretion and activity in the cell conditioned medium in response to exogenous stimuli. Here, we provide evidence that stimulation of tumor-derived cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and forskolin markedly enhances the secretion of active heparanase in a time- and dose-responsive manner. We further demonstrate that physiological concentrations of ATP and ADP similarly enhance the secretion of active heparanase and discuss the significance and possible implications of these findings. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibody 1453 was raised in rabbits against the entire 65-kDa latent heparanase isolated from the conditioned medium of heparanase-transfected 293 cells. This antibody was affinity-purified on immobilized, bacterially expressed 50-kDa heparanase-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (16Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y.

Monoclonal anti-cathepsin D antibody, forskolin, PMA, ATP, ATPγS, ADP, adenosine, 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate (2Me-SADP), pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), and 2′-deoxy-N6-methyladenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate (MRS 2179) were purchased from Sigma. The inhibitory compounds H89, U-73122, and bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis) were purchased from Calbiochem. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions, and Me2SO was added to cell cultures as control, without a noticeable effect. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma and HCT116 and HT29 colon carcinoma cells were purchased from the ATCC. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For stable transfection, subconfluent MDA-468, MDA-435, MDA-231, and HT29 cells were transfected with the pSecTag2 vector (Invitrogen) containing the full-length heparanase cDNA, using the FuGENE 6 reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The pSecTag2 vector is designed for efficient protein secretion driven by the IgGκ signal peptide and contains c-Myc and His tags at the protein C terminus. Transfection proceeded for 48 h, followed by selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Stable transfectant pools were further expanded and analyzed. Heparanase Secretion and Immunoblotting—Cells were grown to confluence, followed by incubation for 20 h in serum-free medium. Fresh serum-free medium was added, and the cells were incubated without or with the indicated reagent for an additional 20 h, unless stated otherwise. Conditioned medium was collected and applied onto 35S-labeled ECM-coated dishes to evaluate heparanase enzymatic activity (see below) or preabsorbed with concavalin A-Sepharose beads to concentrate the samples and reduce nonspecific reactivity, followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 10% gels.

Briefly, cells (5 × 105 to 2 × 106) were plated on 35-mm dishes coated with 35S-labeled ECM. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min, medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated (4-20 h, 37 °C) in the absence or presence of the indicated reagents. Alternatively, conditioned medium was applied directly onto 35S-ECM-coated dishes. The incubation medium containing sulfate-labeled degradation fragments was subjected to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column. Fractions (0.2 ml) were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and their radioactivity was counted in a β-scintillation counter. Degradation fragments of HS side chains were eluted at 0.5 < Kav < 0.8 (peak II, fractions 15-30). Nearly intact HSPG were eluted just after the Vo (Kav < 0.2, peak I, fractions 3-15). Cell Migration—Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 20 h and applied on top of fibronectin-coated cell inserts (8 μm; Costar). Growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the lower compartment, and the cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h. Inserts were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and cells remaining on the upper side of the filter were removed by a cotton swab. Migrating cells were stained with crystal violate, visualized, and counted under a light microscope. PMA and Forskolin Induce Secretion of Active Heparanase—Heparanase activity is strongly implicated in biological processes that require ECM remodeling, such as cancer metastasis, inflammation, and angiogenesis (1Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Interestingly, however, heparanase was noted to reside primarily intracellularly within endocytic vesicles identified as endosomes and lysosomes (16Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Nadav L. Eldor A. Yacoby-Zeevi O. Zamir E. Pecker I.

Vlodavsky I. Katz B.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, heparanase secretion from intracellular pools may be required in order to exert its enzymatic function extracellularly. We examined this possibility by exposing cells overexpressing heparanase to PMA, followed by immunoblot analysis of the culture medium. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, treatment of MDA-468 (Fig. 1A), MDA-435 (Fig. 1B), HT29 (Fig. 1C), and 293 cells (Fig. 1D) with PMA resulted in a marked increase of the 50-kDa active heparanase subunit in the culture medium. In contrast, the latent 65-kDa protein was readily detected in the culture medium of control untreated cells (Con) due to its secreted nature (1Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and its levels were not significantly changed upon PMA treatment. In order to confirm the immunoblotting results, conditioned medium from control and PMA-treated HT29 cells was applied onto 35S-labeled ECM, and heparanase enzymatic activity was evaluated. Heparanase activity was not detected in medium conditioned by nontransfected HT29 cells (data not shown) but was clearly evident in medium conditioned by heparanase-transfected cells (Fig. 1E, Con). Heparanase activity was markedly increased in the conditioned medium of heparanase-transfected HT29 cells in response to treatment with PMA (Fig. 1E, PMA), in agreement with the elevated levels of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Treatment of heparanase-transfected MDA-468, MDA-435, and HT29 cells with forskolin did not result in a significant increase of heparanase secretion (Fig. 1, A-C) and activity (data not shown). In contrast, treatment of heparanase-transfected 293 cells with forskolin stimulated a significant increase in secretion of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit (Fig. 1D), correlating with enhanced heparanase activity in the cell culture medium (Fig. 1F). Since PMA is a strong PKC inducer, we next examined the ability of PKC inhibitors to block heparanase secretion induced by PMA. To this end, heparanase-transfected HT29 (Fig. 1G, upper panel) and MDA-435 (Fig. 1G, lower panel) cells were left untreated (-) or stimulated with PMA in the absence or presence of PKC (Bis) or PKA (H89) inhibitors. Heparanase secretion was examined by immunoblotting. PMA treatment elicited a marked increase in secretion of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit, an increase that was practically blocked (Fig. 1G, top) or markedly reduced (Fig. 1G, bottom) in the presence of the PKC inhibitor Bis. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 only slightly reduced the effect of PMA, indicating, as expected, activation of PKC rather than of PKA. The inverse situation was noted upon treatment of heparanase-transfected 293 cells with forskolin. In these cells, forskolin was found to effectively induce secretion of active heparanase (Fig. 1D), and this effect was significantly inhibited by H89 but not by Bis (not shown). Next, we examined the kinetics of heparanase secretion elicited by PMA and forskolin (Fig. 2). Heparanase-transfected MDA-435 cells were incubated with PMA for the time indicated, conditioned medium was collected, and heparanase secretion was examined by immunoblotting. The 50-kDa heparanase subunit was first detected in the culture medium 1 h following PMA stimulation, peaked at 2 h, and gradually decreased (Fig. 2A, top). A similar kinetic was noted upon treatment of heparanase-transfected 293 cells with forskolin (Fig. 2B, top). The decline in extracellular heparanase levels at later time points following PMA or forskolin treatment is most probably due to HS-mediated heparanase uptake (14Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since the active 50-kDa heparanase subunit was mainly detected in endocytic vesicles (16Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we rationalized that the secreted heparanase found in the culture medium following treatment with PMA and forskolin originated from such an intracellular pool. In order to support this notion, we compared the secretion kinetics of the lysosomal protein cathepsin D with that of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit. Notably, secretion of the low molecular weight forms of cathepsin D, typically processed and residing in lysosomes, was not only induced by PMA and forskolin but also resembled the kinetics of heparanase secretion (Fig. 2, lower panels), suggesting that both proteins indeed originate from similar cellular compartments. Nucleotides Induce Secretion of Enzymatically Active Heparanase—The ability of PMA and forskolin to induce the secretion of enzymatically active heparanase as well as of a typical lysosomal enzyme, such as cathepsin D, supports the notion that heparanase is stored in the lysosomal compartment in a stable form (16Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Goldshmidt O.

Cell Res. 2002; 281: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and is secreted in response to local or systemic cues, thus maintaining its extracellular availability tightly regulated. Since both PMA and forskolin are not considered physiological, we sought inducers more relevant to biological systems in which heparanase activity is implicated, mainly cancer metastasis and inflammation. The intracellular role of ATP is well recognized as a key energy source utilized for cellular metabolism. In addition, purines and pyrimidines, mainly ATP, ADP, UTP, and adenosine, have the ability to function extracellularly and to initiate signal transduction cascades mediated by a family of purinergic receptor that appears to play important roles in development, differentiation, and cell proliferation (27Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 28Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 113-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The P1 and P2Y subgroups of the purinergic receptors family are G-protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C and modulate cAMP levels, leading to PKC- and PKA-mediated signal transduction (28Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 113-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Since PKA and PKC activation was noted to enhance heparanase secretion (Figs. 1 and 2), we examined the ability of nucleotides to elicit a similar response. All cell types included in this study responded to nucleotides by elevating the levels of active heparanase in the cell conditioned medium, yet each cell type exclusively responded to different nucleotides (Fig. 3). Thus, whereas 293 cells preferentially responded to ATP and ADP (Fig. 3A), MDA-435 cells responded to adenosine (ADO; Fig, 3B), and MDA-231 cells responded primarily to ADP (Fig. 3C), possibly reflecting different receptor profiles expressed by each cell line. Importantly, elevation of the 50-kDa heparanase subunit in the culture medium was accompanied by increased heparanase activity in the nucleotide-treated 293, MDA-435, and MDA-231 cells (Fig. 3, D-F, respectively). Next, we examined the effect of ATP on heparanase secretion as a function of concentration and incubation time. HEK293 cells stably overexpressing heparanase were left untreated (0) or stimulated with ATP at the indicated concentrations. Heparanase secretion into the culture medium was evaluated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, lowering the ATP concentration markedly enhanced secretion of the 50-kDa heparanase protein. A concentration of 1 μm was applied in subsequent experiments. Interestingly, low ATP concentrations were also more effective in stimulating the secretion of cathepsin D (Fig. 4A, bottom), further supporting endocytic vesicles and the lysosomal compartment as the primary source of these enzymes. Next, we examine the kinetics of heparanase secretion in response to ATP. To this end, heparanase-transfected 293 cells were left untreated or stimulated with 1 μm ATP for the indicated time, and heparanase secretion was evaluated. Whereas the 65-kDa latent heparanase was readily secreted by control, untreated cells (Fig. 4B, left, Con), secretion of the 50-kDa protein was restricted to cells treated with ATP (Fig. 4B, right, ATP). The 50-kDa heparanase subunit was first detected 20 min following ATP addition, peaked at 1 h, and declined thereafter to undetectable levels (16 h), possibly due to efficient cellular uptake of the secreted protein (14Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Importantly, secretion of the 50-kDa subunit precedes the secretion of the 65-kDa latent heparanase. These differences in secretion kinetics rule out the possibility that the 50-kDa subunit found in the cell culture medium is the result of extracellular processing of the 65-kDa latent heparanase, thus strongly implying that the 50-kDa form originated from an intracellular pool.FIGURE 4Dose- and time-responsive heparanase secretion upon ATP stimulation.

Neuronal nAChRs are generally formed from a combination of α and β subunits (α2-α10 and β2-β4) that can assemble into a diversity of nAChR subtypes with different pharmacological and functional properties (1Nicke A. Wonnacott S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2305-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Given their physiological importance, nAChRs are often targeted by venom peptides (2Lewis R.J. Garcia M.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2003; 2: 790-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Our current knowledge of the structure and function of nAChRs owes much to studies using snake toxins as biochemical or pharmacological tools to isolate and characterize this receptor (3Nirthanan S. Gwee M.C. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The “bungarotoxin” family of proteins in the venom of elapid and hydrophid snakes includes the κ- and α-neurotoxins, muscarinic toxins, cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, fasciculins, calciseptins, and mambins (4Grant G.A. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 239-260Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 5Gawade S.P. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2004; 23: 37-96Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The structurally related short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins and the “weak non-conventional” snake toxins are comprised of 60-74 amino acids, including 8 or 10 cystine residues and their structures have a three-fingered fold. The κ- and α-neurotoxins both inhibit nAChRs but differ in their specificity and binding kinetics (4Grant G.A. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 239-260Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptide toxins found in the venom of predatory marine snails from the genus Conus. These venom peptides generally target a variety of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels (6Lewis R.J. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Conotoxins acting at nAChRs include the α-conotoxin, αA-conotoxin, Ψ-conotoxin, and αS-conotoxin families. The α-conotoxins are a large family of well characterized competitive nAChR antagonists with diverse subtype selectivities that allow the pharmacological dissection of nAChR subtypes (1Nicke A. Wonnacott S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2305-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Arias H.R. Blanton M.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structurally different αA-conotoxins are competitive antagonists with specificity for muscle nAChRs but lack the selectivity for the α1/δ interface that is exhibited by the 3/5 subfamily of α-conotoxins (7Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), whereas the Ψ-conotoxins are non-competitive antagonists at the muscle nAChR subtype (7Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The recently described αS-conotoxin RVIIIA is a nAChR antagonist with broad subtype activity and a preference for the muscle subtype (9Teichert R.W. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these toxins for prey capture, not all species of cone snails possess detectable levels of all four of these classes of nAChR antagonists in their venom. For example, no toxins from these families have previously been described from the venom of Conus vexillum. It has been suggested that different clades of Conus species might utilize unique conotoxin families for particular purposes (10Teichert R.W. Rivier J. Dykert J. Cervini L. Gulyas J. Bulaj G. Ellison M. Olivera B.M. Toxicon. 2004; 44: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Espiritu D.J. Watkins M. Dia-Monje V. Cartier G.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M.

Post-translational modifications contribute to the rich diversity and heterogeneity of conotoxins (13Craig A.G. Bandyopadhyay P. Olivera B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Loughnan M.L. Alewood P.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2294-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and may confer unique structural and functional traits. Examples of post-translational modifications in conotoxins include proline hydroxylation and glutamic acid γ-carboxylation as in GID (15Nicke A. Loughnan M. Millard E. Alewood P. Adams D. Daly N. Craik D. Lewis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), tyrosine sulfation as in EpI (16Loughnan M.L. Bond T. Atkins A. Cuevas J.

The only multimeric protein described so far from Conus venoms is a phospholipase (17McIntosh J.M. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Dooley D.J. Stoehr S.J. Giordani A.B. Naisbitt S.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Additionally, κ-neurotoxins from snake venom can form homodimers in solution at physiological concentrations, raising implications for both the mechanism of polypeptide chain folding during biosynthesis of the toxins and for their interaction with nAChRs (4Grant G.A. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 239-260Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Neuronal nAChRs are of increasing interest in human medicine as therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (24Decker M.W. Rueter L.E. Bitner R.S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). To decipher the functions and locations of the different nAChR subtypes, additional subtype-specific ligands are required. Cone snail venoms have been a particularly rich source of new inhibitors of nAChRs. This study describes the discovery and characterization of three novel post-translationally modified conotoxins, VxXIIA, VxXIIB, and VxXIIC, which occur as dimers and produce a slowly reversing block of α7 and α3β2 nAChRs. These αD-conotoxins contribute to our growing knowledge of ligands interacting at nAChRs. Crude Venom Extraction—Specimens of C. vexillum (8Arias H.R. Blanton M.P. Int. J. Biochem.

Toxicon. 2004; 44: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Crude extracts were prepared from venom duct material using 30% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Soluble material was lyophilized and stored at -20 °C prior to use. The crude venom samples were tested for their ability to inhibit agonist-evoked currents of α7 and α3β2 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (see below). Crude Venom Enrichment—A portion of each crude venom extract (10 mg) was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex Peptide, HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) to generate two fractions containing peptides and proteins in the size ranges 5-15 and 0.5-5 kDa. The column was eluted with 30% acetonitrile, 0.048% trifluoroacetic acid, aqueous at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with detection at 214 nm. Only the 5-15-kDa fraction of each species inhibited oocyte-expressed α7 nAChRs. Purification of Proteins—To isolate the 5-15-kDa components active at the nAChR, a portion of the crude venom extract (10 mg) was fractionated by semi-preparative RP-HPLC (10 μm C18, Vydac) eluted at 3 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0-90% solvent B over 80 min, using a Waters 600 solvent delivery system (A, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid; B, 90% acetonitrile/0.09% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid). Each species contained ∼11-kDa proteins that inhibited α7 and α3β2 nAChRs. The active fractions from C. vexillum were further purified by analytical C18 RP-HPLC using 5-μm 4.6 × 250-mm Jupiter and Vydac columns eluted at 1 ml/min, or a 3.5-μm 300 SB-C18 2.1 × 150-mm Zorbax column eluted at 0.18 ml/min using 0.5 or 1% linear gradients from 0 to 50% B over 45 min at 65 or 23 °C. The activity of each of the three ∼11-kDa proteins isolated from C. vexillum venom was confirmed by retesting the purified material on oocyte-expressed nAChRs and an AChBP binding assay. LC/MS Analyses—LC/MS analysis of crude venom extract or a partly purified mixture of dimeric toxins was undertaken using an Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX QSTAR Pulsar electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI QqTOF) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source and linked to an upstream Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system. LC was performed with a Zorbax C3, 2.1 × 150-mm 5-μm RP-HPLC column eluted with 0-60% B for 60 min (A 0.1% formic acid, B 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% formic acid), at 180 μl/min and a temperature of 23 or 65 °C. Time of flight-MS scans were run in positive ion mode over a mass range of 500-2200 atomic mass units with an ion spray voltage of 5300 V. A positive mode “hi/lo” declustering LC/MS experiment as described previously (26Loughnan M.L. Nicke A. Jones A. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was conducted for additional verification of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Data processing of LC/MS data were performed using the software package Bioanalyst (PE-Sciex, Canada). Apex mass is defined as the mass of the isotope distribution at maximum intensity as identified by the mass reconstruction tool in the Bioanalyst software. Electrophoresis—Samples were solubilized in 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, and loaded onto IPG strips (Immobilin Dry Strips pH 6-11, 7 cm, Amersham Biosciences) using passive hydration. SDS-PAGE was run with either 16% polyacrylamide or Novex precast 10-20% Tricine mini-gels under standard non-reducing conditions. Gels were either stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 or proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using SDS/glycine buffers and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Reduction and Alkylation of Cystine Residues—The purified ∼11-kDa proteins (∼20 pmol) were reduced in the presence of 10 mm TCEP, 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.5), 10% acetonitrile (37 °C for 1 h) and subsequently alkylated in the added presence of 20 mm maleimide (37 °C for 1 h). The alkylated peptides were repurified by RP-HPLC. Proteolytic Digestion—Samples of reduced and alkylated peptides from C. vexillum were subjected to digestion with the proteolytic enzymes pepsin, trypsin (Sigma), or endoproteinase Arg-C (sequencing grade, Roche). Briefly, for pepsin digestion, ∼100 μg of reduced and alkylated peptide was suspended in 100 μl of a solution containing 50 mm formic and 50 mm acetic acid to which 2 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock solution of pepsin was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Digestion was terminated by storage at -20 °C. For trypsin digestion, ∼100 μg of reduced and alkylated peptide was suspended in 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.3) to which 2 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock solution of trypsin was added, and the reaction mixture incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Digestion was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (aqueous) and storage at -20 °C. Endoproteinase Arg-C digestion was achieved by dissolving ∼100 μg of reduced and alkylated peptide in an incubation buffer of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.6) to which 5 μl of an 0.1 mg/ml enzyme solution and 10 μl of activation solution (50 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA) was added and allowed to incubate for 3 h at 37 °C. The resulting fragments from proteolytic digestions were purified by analytical RP-HPLC and analyzed by Edman sequence chemistry as well as MS and MS/MS methods as described below. Sequencing by Edman Chemistry—Edman NH2-terminal sequence analysis was undertaken on purified material with disulfide bonds intact or with cysteine residues alkylated with maleimide after reduction with TCEP, as described above. Fragments generated by proteolytic digest reactions were similarly sequenced with an Applied Biosystems Procise Protein Sequencer (HT or 492cLC models). Sequence Determination by MS/MS Analyses of Peptide Fragments—Tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments were conducted using the QSTAR. Samples in 20-50% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid were continuously infused into the ion source at 40 μl/min in a carrier of 70% eluent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.05% formic acid). Data were acquired over 400-2000 atomic mass units for 5-10 min with an ion spray voltage of ∼9500 V and collision energy of 10-60 V, as required. Additional MS Experiments—An ES-MS pH titration experiment was conducted using solvents containing ∼60% acetonitrile and either 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.05% formic acid, 0.05% acetic acid, 20 mm ammonium acetate, or 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate to cover the pH range 1-9 in one pH unit increments. Samples of the ∼11-kDa proteins in these solutions were introduced into the QSTAR by infusion at low flow rates and analysis performed as described above. A voltage step experiment was conducted to assess stability of the dimer association by application of stepwise increases in sample cone voltage (10-70 V) in parallel with extraction cone voltage (4-25 V) and a capillary voltage of 3500 V using an Micromass LCT ESI-TOF instrument. Protein Quantitation—Crude venom extract was quantitated by BCA protein assay. VxXIIA was quantified initially by triplicate amino acid analysis, and used as an internal standard for quantitation of the other proteins. An extinction coefficient adjustment factor was determined for each protein (27Moffatt F. Senhans P. Ricketts D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 891: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and used to adjust HPLC peak area to quantify VxXIIB and VxXIIC. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with an x,y,z gradient unit. Protein concentration was ∼1 mm. Native VxXIIA was examined in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (pH 3.0), at temperatures ranging from 280 to 313 K and in 100% D2O (298 K). 1H NMR experiments recorded were NOESY (28Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 29Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4837) Google Scholar), with mixing time of 300 ms, TOCSY (30Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms, and TOCSY and NOESY in 100% D2O (31Griesinger C. Sorenson O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar). All spectra were run over 7184 Hz (600 MHz) with 4 K data points, 256-512 free induction decays, 8-80 scans, and a recycle delay of 2 s. The solvent was suppressed using WATERGATE (32Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging amides were detected by dissolving protein in D2O and recording a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra at 298 K. Amide protons remaining after 24 h were classified as slowly exchanging. Spectra were processed using XWIN NMR and Aurelia, and subtraction of background was used to minimize T1 noise. Chemical shift values of VxXIIA were referenced internally to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) at 0.00 ppm. The protein was assigned using the “sequential walk” (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Secondary Hα shifts were measured and compared with random coil shift values (34Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyason H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Expression of nAChRs in Xenopus Oocytes—RNA preparation, oocyte preparation, and expression of nAChRs in Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (15Nicke A. Loughnan M. Millard E.

Briefly, plasmids containing cDNA encoding rat α3, α4, α7, β2, and β4 nAChR subunits (kindly provided by J. Patrick, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2 (35Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). cDNAs for the rat α1, β1, γ, and δ subunits of the muscle nAChR were provided by Dr. V. Witzemann (Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (5-50 ng/μl), and kept at 19 °C in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter of gentamycin (Sigma). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings at a holding potential of -70 mV were performed in oocytes 1-10 days after cRNA injection. Assays were conducted using a custom-made manifold for rapid solution exchange (<300 ms) and a 50-μl funnel-shaped oocyte chamber as described previously (15Nicke A. Loughnan M. Millard E. Alewood P. Adams D. Daly N. Craik D. Lewis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3137-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or an automated OpusXpress™ 6000A work station (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). 100 μm ACh (Sigma) was used to activate α3β2, α3β4, α4β4, and α4β2 combinations, 1 μm ACh was used to activate α1β1γδ nAChRs and 100 μm nicotine (Sigma) was used to activate the α7 nAChRs. Agonist pulses were applied in 2-s pulses at 4- or 5-min intervals until consistent control responses were obtained. A 5.5-μl aliquot of a 10-fold concentrated toxin solution was added directly into the static bath, to conserve material and avoid potential losses of the toxin to tubing surfaces. Each concentration was tested on at least three different oocytes from two separate batches. Estimates of potency were obtained by fitting concentrationresponse curves to the data by the equation: % response = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH} using Prism software (GraphPad version 3.0, San Diego, CA). The IC50 values were considered significantly different if the 95% confidence intervals did not overlap. AChBP Binding Assay—Purified recombinant AChBP with a histidine tag was kindly provided by Titia Sixma and Angus Smit (Netherlands Cancer Institute and Vrije University, respectively, The Netherlands). An AChBP binding assay was performed according to the procedure of Smit et al. (36Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Briefly, toxins were dried and resuspended in 85 μl of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4), plus 10 μl of AChBP (0.2 ng/μl) (7Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), 10 μl of 125I-bungarotoxin (125I-BgTx), (Amersham Biosciences), and 20 μl TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). Assays were incubated for 1 h at 23 °Cand filtered through GFB filters using a Millipore manifold and a wash buffer of 20 mm HEPES and 125 mm NaCl (pH 7.2). Retained radioactivity on the filters was measured using a γ-counter (Wallac). Specific binding was determined by subtraction of nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 80 μm tubocurarine (Sigma). (Similar results were obtained with 3.2 μm α-BgTx (Sigma).) A saturation binding experiment was conducted by measuring specific 125I-BgTx binding in the absence or presence of toxin at a concentration of twice the toxin IC50. 125I-BgTx was added over the concentration range 0.5-75 nm. Nonlinear regressions were fitted to each experiment with Prism software (GraphPad). Protein Identification—Initial analyses of the crude venom from several vermivorous cone snail species indicated the presence of a number of ∼11-kDa proteins with inhibitory activity at α7 and α3β2 nAChRs (data not shown). Comparing the MS of intact and reduced material revealed that these proteins in C. mustelinus, C. miles, C. capitaneus, and C. vexillum occurred as dimers of two peptide subunits. The crude venom of C. vexillum was the least complex, containing three dominant and apparently homogeneous proteins of 10,300-11,400 Da (Fig. 1) that we named VxXIIA, VxXIIB, and VxXIIC. Each protein was purified to a single peak by RP-HPLC, however, varying levels of micro-heterogeneity were revealed by LC/MS analysis of crude venom (Fig. 1). The reduced subunits were half the size of the ∼11-kDa native toxins and for C. vexillum ranged in monoisotopic mass from 5135-5741 Da (Fig. 2, Table 1). SDS-PAGE of the native proteins indicated an apparent size of 10-12 kDa (data not shown), supporting the conclusion from SE-HPLC and MS data that the proteins occur as dimers. The LC/MS analysis of crude venom also detected ions for minor monomer forms of VxXIIB, whereas VxXIIA and VxXIIC occurred exclusively as dimers (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2LC/MS of VxXIIA. A, the total ion current (TIC) for intact VxXIIA is shown with the corresponding ion spectra shown in the inset. B, the total ion current for reduced VxXIIA shows two components. C, the ion spectra from peak 1 of reduced VxXIIA (mass 5150 Da, monoisotopic value), and the deconvoluted mass spectrum, inset, are shown. D, ion spectra from peak 2 of reduced VxXIIA (mass 5134 Da, monoisotopic value) and the deconvoluted mass spectrum, inset, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Comparison of deduced sequences for C. vexillum components VxXIIA, VxXIIB, and VxXIIC The sequences were derived from intact material by Edman chemistry, and from fragments generated by enzyme digestions, by both Edman chemistry and MS/MS.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms coupling the receptor VEGFR-2 to PI3K remain obscure. We observed that the Grb2-bound adapter Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and relocated to membrane fractions upon VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells. We could detect the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 in immunoprecipitates of endogenous Gab1, and vice versa, and measure a Gab1-associated lipid kinase activity upon VEGF stimulation. Furthermore, transfection of the Gab1-YF3 mutant lacking all p85-binding sites strongly repressed PI3K activation measured in vitro. Moreover, Gab1-YF3 severely decreased the cellular amount of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) generated in response to VEGF. Furthermore, adenoviral expression of Gab1-YF3 suppressed both Akt phosphorylation and recovery of wounded human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers, a VEGF-dependent process involving cell migration and proliferation under PI3K control. Transfection of other Gab1 mutants, lacking Grb2-binding sites or the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, also prevented Akt activation, further demonstrating Gab1 involvement in PI3K activation. These mutants were also used to show that interactions with both Grb2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 mediate Gab1 recruitment by VEGFR-2. Importantly, Gab1 mobilization was impaired by (i) PI3K inhibitors, (ii) deletion of Gab1 PH domain, (iii) PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) overexpression to repress PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production, and (iv) overexpression of a competitor PH domain for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding, which altogether demonstrated that PI3K is also an upstream regulator of Gab1. Gab1 thus appears as a primary actor in coupling VEGFR-2 to PI3K/Akt, recruited through an amplification loop involving PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and its PH domain.

Various intracellular signaling pathways have been proposed to mediate these biological activities of VEGF, including the phospholipase Cγ(PLCγ)/protein kinase C pathway and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway (see Ref. 1Cross M.J. Dixelius J. Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 488-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar for review). More recently, VEGFR-2 was found to activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its major downstream target, the kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). This PI3K/Akt-PKB pathway seems to mediate major biological responses of VEGF in endothelial cells, including the stimulation of their proliferation and migration (2Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A.

Further supporting these findings, studies based on gene targeting strategies demonstrated that PI3K/Akt constitutes a major axis of regulation of vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis (6Hamada K.

Akt also relays VEGF in the control of vascular permeability, by regulating the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (9Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). In addition, mice deficient for Foxo1, a transcription factor target of Akt, show fatal vascular remodeling due to alterations in the endothelial cell response to VEGF (11Furuyama T. Kitayama K. Shimoda Y. Ogawa M. Sone K. Yoshida-Araki K. Hisatsune H. Nishikawa S. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34741-34749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Despite the amount of data sustaining a role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in VEGF signaling, the mechanisms coupling VEGFR-2 to this pathway remain unclear. It is well established that PI3K activation is highly dependent upon the phosphorylation of a typical Tyr-X-X-Met sequence present in an “upstream” protein and specifically recognized by the SH2 domains of p85, the regulatory subunit of the growth factor-regulated PI3K subgroup. This motif is usually encountered within the sequence of receptors or docking proteins rapidly mobilized and phosphorylated by receptors (12Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 13Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). In the case of VEGFR-2, its sequence does not display this motif, and its known downstream adapters also fail to contain authentic p85 binding sites. This strongly suggests that an unidentified docking protein couples VEGFR-2 to PI3K activation.Gab1 (Grb2-adapter binder 1) is the prototype of a subfamily of large multiadapter proteins sharing an N-terminal PH domain, two proline-rich regions involved in constitutive binding to Grb2, and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This family includes Gab1, Gab2, and Gab3 in mammals, DOS in Drosophila, and Soc-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Whereas Gab1 is widely distributed, Gab2 and Gab3 are more specific of the hematopoietic lineage (see Refs. 14Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and 15Yart A. Mayeux P. Raynal P. Curr. Cancer Drug Target. 2003; 3: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for reviews). Gab1 plays a critical role in the early development of multiple organs in mice, because it is a crucial signaling intermediate of major regulators of cell fate in solid tissues represented by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met (16Itoh M.

Indeed, Gab1 supplies to these receptors the indispensable tyrosine phosphorylation motifs necessary to mobilize essential effectors, including PI3K, the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, and the PLCγ (18Holgado-Madruga M.

Other studies have suggested a role for Gab1 downstream of other growth factor or cytokine receptors, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor or the insulin receptor (14Gu H. Neel B.G.

However, these latter receptors can directly activate PI3K and Shp2 through intrinsic binding motifs or well known adapter proteins, respectively, and thus Gab1 function is considered much less essential for these receptors (14Gu H.

Cancer Drug Target. 2003; 3: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Gab1 sequence also displays a novel phosphotyrosine-binding domain called the Met-binding domain (MBD) that can recognize c-Met and possibly the EGFR (25Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M.

Moreover, PI3K can be also involved in Gab1 recruitment through its lipid product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) that can associate with Gab1 PH domain (26Rodrigues G.A.

We observed that Gab1 is rapidly phosphorylated and relocalized in response to VEGF stimulation, which led us to conduct a series of experiments indicating that Gab1 is most likely the primary mediator of PI3K activation downstream of VEGFR-2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant VEGF (catalog no.

Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).

The lysate was spun at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. The sample was then centrifuged again and washed once then dissolved in lysis buffer supplemented with 1.2% Triton X-100. The insoluble material was spun out, and the supernatant was taken as the solubilized membrane fraction.In Vitro Lipid Kinase Assay—Cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above using the following lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm each of MgCl2, CaCl2, and orthovanadate, 20 μm each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaF.

Pellets were then resuspended in 60 μl of lipid kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol, 6 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 n HCl, followed by lipid extraction with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (v/v). Lipids were then separated by TLC and revealed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of Phosphatidylinositol Polyphosphate—Subconfluent cells grown in 100-mm plates were serum-starved for 16 h upon reaching 80-90% confluence and then labeled for 5 h with 100 μCi of [32P]H3PO4 (Amersham Biosciences) per milliliter in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). Cells were then stimulated for the indicated time and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before addition of 3.75 ml of 2.4 n HCl solution. Then lipid extraction was performed as described previously (34Laffargue M. Raynal P. Yart A. Peres C. Wetzker R. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. J. Biol.

After centrifugation, the lower phase containing the lipids was collected, and the upper phase was re-extracted with 4.5 ml of chloroform. The lower phases were then combined and evaporated under nitrogen, and lipid extracts were solubilized in 150 μl of chloroform/methanol (v/v) and first resolved by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80/30/26/24/14, v/v). After autoradiography, the TLC spots corresponding to the PtdIns(4,5)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 area were scrapped off, then deacylated in a solution containing methylamine 40%/water/methanol/n-butanol (26.8/16.1/45.7/11.4, v/v), and finally analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a What-man Partisphere 5 SAX column as described (37Sultan C.

Cells were then washed and serum-starved overnight. A 1-mm-width cross-shaped lesion was produced by mechanical scraping across the cell monolayer as described (38Vincent L. Kermani P. Young L.M.

Wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove cellular debris, and cells were incubated with M199 supplemented with antibiotics, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and VEGF when indicated in the figure legends. After 48 h, recovery of each denuded area was observed with a digital camera connected to an inverted microscope and quantitated by a computer-assisted procedure based on the Adobe Photoshop software.RESULTSVEGF Stimulates Gab1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Relocalization in Endothelial Cells—To identify a possible role of Gab1 in VEGF signaling, we examined if Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in stimulated HUVECs. Gab1 immunoprecipitations were thus performed from control or VEGF-treated cells, followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis. Fig. 1A shows that VEGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. We confirmed this result using two antibodies recognizing Gab1 only if phosphorylated on Tyr-307 or Tyr-627. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows that both residues are phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation of HUVECs. Thus, Gab1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation under VEGF stimulation, suggesting a role for Gab1 in VEGFR-2 signaling. To test this implication, we turned to PAECs stably expressing the human VEGFR-2, the only cell line that can be selectively activated through this receptor upon incubation with VEGF (33Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAECs express a low level of VEGFR-2, which is hardly detectable using immunoblotting (data not shown), and the strength of VEGF-induced signals is comparable in HUVECs and PAECs (see below). Fig. 1D shows that VEGF also stimulates Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation in PAECs. In addition, VEGF was found to induce a rapid enrichment of Gab1 in membrane fractions prepared from this cell line, as displayed in Fig. 1E. Moreover, this redistribution seems to occur earlier than the VEGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Altogether, these results indicate that Gab1 is mobilized following VEGFR-2 stimulation and suggest that this could mediate PI3K/Akt activation. In addition, as a first approach to determine whether Gab1 was phosphorylated directly by VEGFR-2 or by downstream signaling relays such as Src family kinases, we studied Gab1 phosphorylation in the presence of SU1498 or PP2, pharmacological inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR-2 and Src family kinases, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 (F and G), each inhibitor suppressed the VEGF-induced Gab1 phosphorylation, both in HUVECs or PAECs. This suggests that VEGFR-2 kinase activity is not entirely accountable for Gab1 phosphorylation but requires a significant participation of Src family kinases.VEGF Induces the Physical Association of Gab1 with p85 and with PI3K Activity, through Gab1 Tyr-X-X-Met Motifs—To determine if Gab1 is actually involved in PI3K activation, we searched for evidence of a physical interaction between Gab1 and PI3K. This was tested in PAECs using coimmunoprecipitation experiments between endogenous Gab1 and p85, the PI3K regulatory subunit. Firstly, using immunoblotting, p85 was found to be strongly enriched in Gab1 immunoprecipitates prepared from VEGF-treated cells in comparison with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, we performed the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of Gab1 with p85 to further evaluate the association between these proteins. As displayed in Fig. 2B, Gab1 immunoblotting of p85 immunoprecipitates shows that the cell stimulation with VEGF induces a rapid increase of Gab1 amount in these fractions. Next, we determined if Gab1 immunoprecipitates contained a lipid kinase activity. An in vitro lipid kinase assay was thus performed on these immunoprecipitates using phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. Following the reaction, lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC and autoradiography. The results displayed in Fig. 2C show that PtdIns was converted into PtdIns 3-phosphate when Gab1 immunoprecipitates were prepared from VEGF-treated cells but not from unstimulated cells. We observed that PtdIns 3-phosphate production was suppressed when the cells were treated with wortmannin (W) before stimulation, which confirmed the kinase activity as being PI3K. Taken together, these results indicate that a physical interaction between endogenous Gab1 and p85 is st"

We investigated the role of the copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis by analyzing the early effects of SOD1 down-regulation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Through the use of small interference RNA, SOD1 was efficiently down-regulated at 48 h after transfection without any significant effect on cell viability. The steady-state concentration of superoxide was significantly increased after 12 h, when SOD1 was only slightly decreased, and progressively returned to values close to those observed in control cells. The superoxide increase was buffered by the enhanced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH); however, GSH increase was not sufficient to avoid damage to proteins in terms of carbonyls. GSH-depleting agents, such as BSO or diamide, further increased protein damage and committed SOD1 deficient cells to death, confirming the pivotal role played by this antioxidant. Although SOD1 declined mostly in the cytosolic compartment, mitochondria were significantly affected with impairment of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and a decrease in ATP production. Together with these effects carbonylation of mitochondrial proteins was detected and in particular a consistent carbonylation and decrease of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These conditions induced a high susceptibility of SOD1-depleted cells to treatment with the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species producing agent rotenone. Overall, the results demonstrate that loss of SOD1 leads to severe damage of mitochondria, suggesting an important biological role for this enzyme in the preservation of mitochondrial homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2031795383,"Voltage-gated calcium channels are multiprotein complexes that regulate calcium influx and are important contributors to cardiac excitability and contractility. The auxiliary β-subunit (CaVβ) binds a conserved domain (the α-interaction domain (AID)) of the pore-forming CaVα1 subunit to modulate channel gating properties and promote cell surface trafficking. Recently, members of the RGK family of small GTPases (Rem, Rem2, Rad, Gem/Kir) have been identified as novel contributors to the regulation of L-type calcium channel activity. Here, we describe the Rem-association domain within CaVβ2a. The Rem interaction module is located in a ∼130-residue region within the highly conserved guanylate kinase domain that also directs AID binding. Importantly, CaVβ mutants were identified that lost the ability to bind AID but retained their association with Rem, indicating that the AID and Rem association sites of CaVβ2a are structurally distinct. In vitro binding studies indicate that the affinity of Rem for CaVβ2a interaction is lower than that of AID for CaVβ2a. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies indicate that Rem association does not inhibit the interaction of CaVβ2a with AID. Instead, CaVβ can simultaneously associate with both Rem and CaVα1-AID. Previous studies had suggested that RGK proteins may regulate Ca2+ channel activity by blocking the association of CaVβ subunits with CaVα1 to inhibit plasma membrane trafficking. However, surface biotinylation studies in HIT-T15 cells indicate that Rem can acutely modulate channel function without decreasing the density of L-type channels at the plasma membrane. Together these data suggest that Rem-dependent Ca2+ channel modulation involves formation of a Rem·CaVβ·AID regulatory complex without the need to disrupt CaVα1·CaVβ association or alter CaVα1 expression at the plasma membrane.

Importantly, although the GK domain alone directs AID binding, both GK and SH3 domains are required for the regulation of Ca2+ channel activity. These studies suggest that α1 interaction(s) with CaVβ outside of the AID domain is critical for modulating channel function (9Cohen R.M. Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Shah V. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Am.

In addition to their ability to associate with β subunits, RGK GTPases have several unique characteristics that distinguish them from the majority of the Ras superfamily (25Colicelli J. Sci.

These include extended N and C termini, low rates of intrinsic GTPase activity, the lack of known lipid anchors, and the potential for distinct modes of regulation including phosphorylation-mediated 14-3-3 binding, calmodulin association, and transcriptional regulation (17Finlin B.S.

Res. 2004; 95: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), many issues remain concerning their mechanism of action. Although several recent studies have indicated that the expression of RGK GTPases inhibits the trafficking of co-transfected epitope-tagged CaVα1 subunits to the plasma membrane (21Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N.

Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9308-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we have shown that expression of Rem2 can modulate both endogenous Ca2+ channel activity and glucose-dependent insulin release in insulinoma cells without obviously altering membrane expression of the endogenous channel (23Finlin B.S. Mosley A.L. Crump S.M. Correll R.N. Ozcan S. Satin J. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41864-41871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Rem2 had no effect on the surface density of N-type Ca2+ channels stably expressed in tsA201 cells while potently inhibiting channel function (32Chen H. Puhl 3rd, H.L. Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9762-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, questions concerning the nature of the RGK-β-subunit association and its role in RGK-dependent regulation of Ca2+ channel activity and trafficking remain to be addressed. In the present study we define a region located within the conserved GK domain as being critically involved in the interaction of β subunits with Rem. Biochemical characterization indicates that the Rem-β-subunit interaction is of relatively low affinity, with competitive binding studies demonstrating that Rem fails to effectively compete with AID for β-subunit association. Moreover, Rem can enter into a CaVβ2a·AID complex, establishing that CaVβ·Rem binding is mechanistically and structurally distinct from CaVβ·AID binding. Taken together, these data indicate that Rem does not inhibit channel activity by competing with CaVα1 subunits for a limiting intracellular pool of uncomplexed CaVβ subunits. In support of this hypothesis, surface biotinylation studies indicate no change in the number of surface-exposed Ca2+ channels after Rem co-expression at a time when channel activity is greatly inhibited. These studies suggest that Rem-mediated regulation of Ca2+ channel activity involves direct regulation of the plasma membrane-located channel complex and can occur without the need to disrupt the steady-state levels of surface-expressed Ca2+ channels. Plasmids—Mammalian expression vectors for CaV1.2α-subunit, β2a-subunit, FLAG epitope-tagged β2a-subunit, and HA epitope-tagged Rem have been described previously (22Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). CaVβ2a was subcloned into pCite 4 (Novagen) for production of in vitro translated protein. Truncation mutations were generated by PCR using CaVβ2a as the template and fully sequenced. The CaVα1.2 loop I-II and loop II-III domains were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGex KG for production of recombinant proteins. Protein Production—GST Rem and thrombin-cleaved Rem were produced as described previously (17Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GST CaVα1.2 loop I-II (AID) was made in BL21DE3 and affinity-purified on glutathione beads (Sigma). The protein was then dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol and used in binding assays. When needed, thrombin was used to cleave the CaVα1.2 loop I-II from GST by washing GST-CaVα1.2AID immobilized on glutathione beads with thrombin cleavage buffer (17Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and then incubating with thrombin for 1 h with rotation. Thrombin was then removed with benzamidine-Sepharose (17Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. To ensure that thrombin was removed by benzamidine-Sepharose, GST immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with thrombin and then subjected to treatment with benzamidine-Sepharose. This treatment labeled Buffer in Fig. 2B indicates that thrombin was efficiently removed. In Vitro Pulldown Assays—Radiolabeled full-length CaV β2a-subunit or the indicated CaV β2a truncations were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine using the Single Tube Protein System 3 (STP3) kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. CaVβ2a or the indicated CaVβ2a truncation mutants cloned into the pCITE vector were used as the template. Binding of radiolabeled β2a to Rem was assessed as follows. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Ten μl glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed 2 times with 500 μl of EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of EDTA buffer, and either GST (10 μg) or GST·Rem (10 μg) was added. The beads were incubated for 5 min with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed 2 times with 1 ml of EDTA buffer and then with 1 ml of EDTA buffer or 1 ml of GDP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm GDP) or 1 ml GTP buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm GTPγS) as indicated to facilitate nucleotide exchange. The buffer was aspirated so that 20 μl of a 50% slurry was allowed to remain in the tube. EDTA, GDP, or GTP buffer (76 μl) was added as indicated, and binding was initiated by the addition of 35S-labeled β2a-subunit (4 μl). The reaction was incubated for 3 h with end-over-end rotation. The beads were then washed three times with the same buffer used in the assay. GST or GST Rem was eluted from the beads with two 20-μl washes of assay buffer supplemented with 25 mm glutathione. The eluted proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which were dried and exposed to film for 16–72 h. Competition Assays—The ability of Rem to compete with CaVα subunit intracellular loop I-II (AID) was assayed as follows. First, the minimal amount of GST·AID protein required to bind 35S-labeled β2a was determined by adding the indicated amount of GST·AID or unfused GST to 10 μl of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). GTP buffer (76 μl) was then added, and binding was initiated by the addition of 4 μl of 35S-labeled β2a subunit. The reaction was incubated for 3 h with end-over-end rotation. The beads were then washed 3 times with 500 μl of GTP buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the beads with two 20-μl washes of assay buffer containing 25 mm glutathione. The eluted proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which were dried and exposed to film for 16–72 h to examine β2a/AID association. The ability of Rem to compete with this interaction was determined by adding the indicated amount of thrombin cleaved Rem to the reaction. As a positive control, I-II loop that had been thrombin-cleaved from GST was used. Also, a mock cleavage buffer treatment was used to confirm that thrombin had been completely removed from the cleaved proteins. In Vivo GST Pulldown Assays—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids as described (35Andres D.A. Shao H. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm GTPγS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was harvested, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Cleared supernatant (1 mg) was incubated with GST (control) or GST·AID and 10 μl of glutathione-agarose (GE Healthcare) as indicated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation. The beads were then isolated by centrifugation for 10 s at 14000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and 5 μl of the supernatant was retained for analysis. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted with assay buffer containing 25 mm glutathione. The eluted fraction was then analyzed with the supernatant for the presence of FLAG-CaVβ2a as follows. The supernatant and pellet were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with either anti-FLAG or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies as indicated. Surface Biotinylation Studies—HIT-T15 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in F12-K media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 10% dialyzed horse serum (prepared by dialyzing horse serum in 14,000-kDa cutoff dialysis bags extensively versus 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C). Ten-cm dishes were seeded with cells the day before infection. Cells were either cultured alone (uninfected control) or incubated for 24 h with CsCl-purified adenovirus-expressing GFP (control) or co-expressing GFP and Rem or GFP and Rem1–265 (107 plaque-forming units/ml) (22Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14469-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This resulted in near complete HIT-T15 cell infection based on the analysis of GFP-positive cells (24 h post-infection). Monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and surface proteins were biotinylated using 1 mg/ml membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested on ice in 1 ml of Versene (Invitrogen), and pelleted by gentle centrifugation, and the Versene was aspirated. Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) was added to the cell pellet, which was sonicated twice for 10 s (Kontes). The soluble fraction was isolated after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by adding cleared cell lysates (500 μg) to 100 μl (50% slurry) of streptavidin beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The reaction was gently rotated end over end at 4 °C for 1.5 h, and resin was pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) containing 0.3 m NaCl (two times), twice with RIPA containing 0.15 m NaCl, and finally twice with wash buffer containing no detergent (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The released protein as well as 10 μg of the input was resolved using 6% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified L-type calcium channel α-subunit polyclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml and horseradish peroxidate goat anti-rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) secondary antibody at a 1:20,000 dilution. Super signal (Pierce) was used as the enhanced chemiluminescent reagent. For inhibition studies, immunoblotting was performed as above, but the α-subunit polyclonal antibody was preincubated for 1 h at 20°C with 10 μg/ml GST-fused CaV1.2 II-III loop protein. To assure that the cells remained intact throughout the surface labeling, biotinylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cytosolic protein, was analyzed by immunoblotting with GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Ambion) at 1:2000 dilution. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids 48 h before recordings using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. tsA201 cells were transiently transfected 48 h before recordings using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (35Andres D.A. Shao H. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression. HIT-T15 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes at 20,000 cells/well. The next day the cells were infected with the indicated adenovirus at 1 × 107 adenovirus per ml. Adenovirus-infected cells were identified by GFP expression, and recordings were made 22 h post-infection (23Finlin B.S. Mosley A.L. Crump S.M. Correll R.N. Ozcan S. Satin J. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41864-41871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to measure ionic current. Patch electrodes with resistances of 2–4 megaohms contained 110 (or 0) mm potassium gluconate, 40 (or 150) mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.36. The bath solution for HEK and tsA201 cells consisted of 112.5 mm CsCl, 30 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The bath solution for adenoviral infected HIT-T15 cells consisted of 102.5 mm CsCl, 40 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Signals were amplified with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and 333-kHz A/D system (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were analyzed with Clampfit 9 (Axon Instruments) and Origin statistical software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). All recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Identification of the Rem Binding Domain in β2a—We previously reported that Rem binds to a variety of CaVβ subunits, including CaVβ2a (22Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

J. 2005; 390: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we reasoned that RGK binding occurs via a conserved CaVβ-subunit sequence. Although previous work suggested that CaVβ binding to RGK GTPases may be GTP-dependent (21Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), in vitro CaVβ2a binding to Rem was found to be nucleotide-independent, with both GDP-bound and GTPγS-bound Rem displaying equivalent CaVβ-subunit binding (Fig. 1B). To identify the structural domain of CaVβ2a responsible for Rem association, we used 35S-labeled, in vivo translated wild-type and truncated CaVβ2a-subunit probes to examine the interaction between the various structural domains of CaVβ2a and both wild-type Rem and the loop I-II (AID) domain of CaV1.2 (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2045707271,"Nonmuscle myosin IIs play an essential role during cytokinesis. Here, we explore the function of an alternatively spliced isoform of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC) II-C, called NMHC II-C1, in the A549 human lung tumor cell line during cytokinesis. NMHC II-C1 contains an insert of 8 amino acids in the head region of NMHC II-C. First, we show that there is a marked increase in both the mRNA encoding NMHC II-C1 and protein in tumor cell lines compared with nontumor cell lines derived from the same tissue. Quantification of the amount of myosin II isoforms in the A549 cells shows that the amounts of NMHC II-A and II-C1 protein are about equal and substantially greater than NMHC II-B. Using specific siRNAs to decrease NMHC II-C1 in cultured A549 cells resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in the number of cells at 120 h, whereas decreasing NMHC II-A with siRNA does not affect cell proliferation. This decreased proliferation can be rescued by reintroducing NMHC II-C1 but not NMHC II-A or II-B into A549 cells, although noninserted NMHC II-C does rescue to a limited extent. Time lapse video microscopy revealed that loss of NMHC II-C1 leads to a delay in cytokinesis and prolongs it from 2 to 8-10 h. These findings are consistent with the localization of NMHC II-C1 to the intercellular bridge that attaches the two dividing cells during the late phases of cytokinesis. The results suggest a specific function for NMHC II-C1 in cytokinesis in the A549 tumor cell line. Nonmuscle myosin IIs play an essential role during cytokinesis. Here, we explore the function of an alternatively spliced isoform of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC) II-C, called NMHC II-C1, in the A549 human lung tumor cell line during cytokinesis. NMHC II-C1 contains an insert of 8 amino acids in the head region of NMHC II-C. First, we show that there is a marked increase in both the mRNA encoding NMHC II-C1 and protein in tumor cell lines compared with nontumor cell lines derived from the same tissue. Quantification of the amount of myosin II isoforms in the A549 cells shows that the amounts of NMHC II-A and II-C1 protein are about equal and substantially greater than NMHC II-B. Using specific siRNAs to decrease NMHC II-C1 in cultured A549 cells resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in the number of cells at 120 h, whereas decreasing NMHC II-A with siRNA does not affect cell proliferation. This decreased proliferation can be rescued by reintroducing NMHC II-C1 but not NMHC II-A or II-B into A549 cells, although noninserted NMHC II-C does rescue to a limited extent. Time lapse video microscopy revealed that loss of NMHC II-C1 leads to a delay in cytokinesis and prolongs it from 2 to 8-10 h. These findings are consistent with the localization of NMHC II-C1 to the intercellular bridge that attaches the two dividing cells during the late phases of cytokinesis. The results suggest a specific function for NMHC II-C1 in cytokinesis in the A549 tumor cell line. Nonmuscle myosin IIs belong to the conventional class II myosins, which form bipolar filaments at relatively low ionic strength and share a number of biological properties with skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle myosins (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Nonmuscle myosin IIs are expressed in both muscle and nonmuscle cells and are hexamers, consisting of a pair of heavy chains (200 kDa) and two pairs of light chains (20 and 17 kDa). They are one of the major motor proteins interacting with cytoskeletal actin and are involved in regulating cytokinesis, cell motility, and cell polarity in many eukaryotic cells (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 2Krendel M. Mooseker M.S. Physiology. 2005; 20: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).

In humans, the genes (MYH9, MYH10, and MYH14) encoding these myosin heavy chains are located on different chromosomes: 22, 17, and 19, respectively (7Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S.

For example, decreasing NMHC II-B in COS-7 cells results in multinucleation, a defect that can be rescued most efficiently by NMHC II-B but also to a significant extent by NMHC II-A and NMHC II-C (9Bao J.

On the other hand, studies from a number of laboratories have also revealed that the different isoforms of non-muscle myosin II have distinct tissue and subcellular distributions and apparently play different roles, particularly during development (10Maupin P.

Both NMHC II-B and II-C, but not NMHC II-A, undergo alternative splicing at homologous amino acids located in loop 1 and in loop 2 of their heavy chains. In the case of NMHC II-B, an exon encoding 10 amino acids is incorporated into loop 1 near the ATP binding region at amino acid 212 (NMHC II-B1), and an exon encoding 21 amino acids is inserted into loop 2 near the actin binding region at amino acid 622 (NMHC II-B2) (17Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14533-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These inserted isoforms are only expressed in neuronal tissues, and recently, the results of ablating each of them in mice have been reported (18Ma X. Kawamoto S. Uribe J. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2138-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For NMHC II-C, an alternative exon encoding 8 amino acids is incorporated into loop 1 (NMHC II-C1), and another alternative exon encoding 41 amino acids is introduced into loop 2 (NMHC II-C2) at locations homologous to the NMHC II-B inserts. Whereas the tissue distribution of NMHC II-C2 is similar to that of II-B1 and II-B2 in being confined to neuronal tissues, 3S. S. Jana, unpublished observation. NMHC II-C1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, such as liver, kidney, testes, brain, and lung (6Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R.

In a recent report, it was demonstrated that the presence of the C1 insert in NMHC II-C increases both the actin-activated MgATPase activity and the in vitro motility of heavy meromyosin derived from this isoform (19Kim K.Y. Kovacs M. Kawamoto S. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22769-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, at present, little is known about the function of NMHC II-C1 at the cellular level. In this study, we report that NMHC II-C1 expression is markedly increased in two different tumor cell lines and is the only NMHC II-C isoform present in a number of tumor cell lines. Our studies show that NMHC II-A and II-C1 are the major isoforms in the A549 lung tumor cell line, each contributing ∼45% of the total nonmuscle myosin II at the protein level. Decreasing nonmuscle myosin II isoforms using siRNA had a different effect on cytokinesis. Whereas decreasing non-muscle myosin II-A had no significant effect on cell proliferation, lowering NMHC II-C1 decreased the number of cells 5.5-fold at 120 h by prolonging cytokinesis from 2 to 8-10 h. Decreasing NMHC II-C1 slowed the rate of cell proliferation by delaying the formation and retraction of the intercellular bridge that connects the two nascent daughter cells. Expression of exogenous NMHC II-C1-GFP, but not GFP-NMHC II-A or GFP-NMHC II-B, in the NMHC II-C1-depleted cells rescued the decrease in cell proliferation. These findings suggest a specific function for NMHC II-C1 in cytokinesis in the A549 tumor cell line. Plasmid Constructs and siRNAs—The cytomegalovirus promoter from pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was inserted into the AseI/AgeI sites, replacing the pTRE promoter in the expression plasmids containing the GFP-tagged, full-length cDNAs of human NMHC II-A and NMHC II-B (9Bao J.

Expression of all four full-length cDNAs encoding NMHC IIs in cell lines was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and fluorescence microscopy.

A pool (SMARTpool) of siRNAs specific for human NMHC II-A (Ref Seq accession number NM_002473) or NMHC II-B (Ref Seq accession number NM_005964) was chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Fluorescein-labeled nonspecific siRNA from Qiagen was used to determine the efficiency of transfection and as a non-specific control for siRNA experiments. Duplex siRNAs obtained from Qiagen were as follows: II-C1 siRNA duplex, sense strand (5′-r(CGUCAGCACCGUGUCUUAU)d(TT)-3′) and antisense strand (5′-r(AUAAGACACGGUGCUGACG)d(GA)-3′); II-C siRNA duplex, sense strand (5′-r(GGACUGGAGCUACCUUGCU)d(TT)-3′) and antisense strand (5′-r(AGCAAGGUAGCUCCAGUCC)d(TT)-3′); nonspecific siRNA duplex, sense strand (5′-r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)d(TT)-3′) and antisense strand (5′-r(ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA)d(TT)-3′). Cell Lines—Human A549 (lung carcinoma), MCF-7 and HCC1569 (breast carcinoma), HepG2 (liver carcinoma), PC-3 (prostate carcinoma), PANC1 (pancreas carcinoma), NIH: OVCAR-3 (ovarian carcinoma), Beas-2B (nontumor lung), and MCF-10-2A (nontumor breast) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained following standard ATCC protocols. For growth curves, cells were trypsinized and harvested at the indicated times, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer. The (-)-enantiomer of blebbistatin was purchased from Sigma and dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO. 50 μm blebbistatin was added after 72 h of NMHC II-C1 siRNA treatment. Within 8 min after the addition of blebbistatin, time lapse imaging was started. Transfection—1 μg of plasmid DNA/ml of culture medium and 200 nm siRNA were transfected using Effectene® and RNAiFect™ transfection reagents (Qiagen), respectively. Efficiency of siRNA transfection (as detected by the fluorescein signal) was >90%, and that for plasmid DNA (detected by the GFP signal) was 70-80%. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Real Time RT-PCR— Total RNA from cell lines was isolated using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). 1μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and the GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ), and the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR for individual gene products using specific primers. The primer sets were as follows: 5′-AAGACCGATCTCCTGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-ACCTTGCCGGCATAGTGGATA-3′ for human NMHC II-A; 5′-GCTGTTCAACCACACCATGT-3′ and 5′-ACAGTTCCGCTGCAAGACCTT-3′ for human NMHC II-B; 5′-ATGCTGCAGGATCGTGAGGACC-3′ and 5′-ATGAATTTGCCGAATCGGGAGG-3′ for human NMHC II-C; 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′ for human β-actin. β-Actin was used to normalize the samples. PCR products were separated by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. For quantitation, real time RT-PCR was performed. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a Quantitect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) using the primers described above. The amount of cDNA from tumor and nontumor cell lines was normalized using β-actin. For each experiment, a standard curve was generated using 4-fold serial dilutions of plasmid containing each of the cDNAs. When PCR products fell within the range of the standard curve, the amount of cDNA of each gene was calculated relative to the standard curve using the Opticon Monitor program. Samples were run in triplicate using a PCR program with an initial cycle of 15 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 54 °C (or 60 °C for II-C), and 1 min (or 30 s for II-C) at 72 °C. After each run, a melting curve was examined to ensure that no primer dimers or secondary products were formed. S.E. was calculated from three independent experiments. Immunoblot Analysis—Extracts of various cell lines were prepared as described previously (6Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R.

Briefly, cells on tissue culture plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and directly lysed with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient Tris-glycine gels or 6% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Cambrex (Rockland, ME) or Invitrogen), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen), and blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The upper part of the blot was incubated with antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of NMHC II-C (1:10,000), the amino terminus of NMHC II-B (1:5,000 or 1:2,000), NMHC II-A (anti-platelet II-A, 1:100,000 or 1:50,000), or panmyosin (1:5,000; Covance Research Products, Inc., Berkeley, CA) at 4 °C overnight (6Golomb E.

Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The lower part of the blot was incubated with either anti-β-actin (1:10,000) (Sigma) or anti-α-tubulin (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibody. The blot was washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was treated with SuperSignal West Pico or Femto luminal enhancer solution (Pierce). Luminescence signal was captured on Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Films were scanned using a densitometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Band intensity was calculated using ImageQuant software after normalizing with actin band intensity. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—A549 cells grown on chamber slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. For antibody staining, the samples were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against NMHC II-C or NMHC II-A at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibody, Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was incubated with cells at room temperature for 1 h. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. After washing, chamber slides were mounted using a Prolong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). The images were collected using a Leica SP1 confocal microscope (Deerfield, IL). Time Lapse Imaging—Time lapse imaging of cytokinesis was performed using an Olympus IX-70 microscope supported by the Metamorph program (Molecular Devices). Images were recorded every 5 min for 2 h for nonspecific siRNA or every 10 min for 10 h for NMHC II-C1 siRNA-treated A549 cells using a Photometric Cool Snap Camera. Images of blebbistatin-treated cells were recorded every 2 min using an Olympus IX-70 microscope supported by the Andor iQ program and Andor iXon DV887 camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland). All time lapse imaging was performed under 5% CO2 and at 37 °C in a stage incubator. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested with a two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test. The differences were considered to be significant if p was <0.05. Expression of C1 Inserted mRNA in Human Epithelial Tumor Cell Lines—Golomb et al. (6Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that the gene encoding NMHC II-C contains an alternatively spliced exon that inserts 24 nucleotides encoding 8 amino acids into loop 1 of NMHC II-C near the ATP binding region of the NMHC. Here, we investigated the expression of this alternatively spliced isoform of NMHC II-C, NMHC II-C1, in human tumor and related nontumor cell lines by RT-PCR, using primers flanking the inserted C1 exon. Fig. 1A shows that NMHC II-C1 is expressed in a number of different tumor cell lines, as shown by the generation of a nucleotide fragment of 269 bp instead of 245 bp (for the noninserted isoform). Note also that the noninserted isoform of NMHC II-C (Fig. 1A, II-C0) is not expressed in any of these cell lines at the mRNA level. In contrast to the lung and breast tumor cell lines (denoted as T in Fig. 1B), which express significant amounts of NMHC II-C1, Fig. 1B shows that a nontumor cell line derived from the same tissue, Beas-2B (lung) and MCF-10-2A (breast, denoted as N in Fig. 1B), express very little mRNA encoding either the NMHC II-C1 or noninserted NMHC II-C (Fig. 1B, top). We also determined the relative amounts of mRNA encoding NMHC II-A and II-B using isoform-specific primers. Fig. 1B shows that mRNAs encoding both isoforms are expressed in all four cell lines with no major difference in expression between the nontumor or tumor cell lines. These data were confirmed using real time PCR (see Table 1).TABLE 1Ratio of NMHC II isoforms in tumor (T) versus nontumor (N) cell lines for RNA and protein Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments.IsoformLung (T:N)Breast (T:N)Real time PCR II-A0.69 ± 0.16:11.42 ± 0.29:1 II-B1.31 ± 0.01:10.66 ± 0.02:1 II-C130.8 ± 5.1:17.33 ± 1.22:1Immunoblot analysis II-A0.13 ± 0.01:10.33 ± 0.01:1 II-B0.03 ± 0.02:10.30 ± 0.01:1 II-C113.5 ± 0.8:14.16 ± 0.05:1 Open table in a new tab Immunoblot Analysis of NMH II-C in Tumor and Nontumor Cell Lines—We then quantified the relative difference in protein expression among the NMHC II isoforms in the lung and breast tumor and nontumor cell lines using antibodies specific for each of the isoforms. Fig. 2 shows immunoblots probed with antibodies to NMHC II-A, II-B, and II-C, and Table 1 quantifies the relative expression of each isoform, setting the quantity of NMHC II in the nontumor cell line as 1 for each isoform. We used a series of three different immunoblots and dilutions, one example of which is shown in Fig. 2. For NMHC II-C1 (third blot from the top), the protein expression analysis correlates with the increase in mRNA expression (Fig. 1B) and shows a 4-fold increase in the breast tumor cell line and a 13.5-fold increase in the lung tumor cell line over the respective nontumor cell lines. In contrast, the immunoblots detecting NMHC II-A and II-B show a marked reduction in each of the isoforms at the protein level in the tumor cell lines, differing from the mRNA results, which showed no significant change between the tumor and nontumor cell lines for both lung and breast (Fig. 1B and Table 1). These results suggest that expression of NMHC II-A and II-B protein was decreased at the translational level or due to protein instability, whereas NMHC II-C1 expression was increased transcriptionally or due to increased mRNA stability or both in the tumor epithelial cell lines. NMHC II-A and NMHC II-C1 Are the Major Isoforms in Lung Tumor A549 Cells—To compare the percentage of each NMHC II isoform at the protein level in the A549 lung tumor cell line, we made use of specific siRNAs and a panmyosin II antibody. As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” we lowered the mRNA encoding each NMHC II isoform using the appropriate siRNA and then analyzed the NMHC II protein levels using antibodies specific to each isoform as well as a pan-myosin antibody. We correlated the change in the immunoblot seen following siRNA treatment with that seen following detection with the panmyosin antibody. Fig. 3 shows that siRNA targeting NMHC II-A specifically lowered the II-A protein (II-A, compare control lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4) and also significantly reduced the amount of total NMHC as detected in the panmyosin immunoblot (Pan-Myosin, lanes 3 and 4). On the other hand, lowering II-B protein with siRNA (II-B, lanes 5 and 6) had little effect on the panmyosin blot (Pan-Myosin, compare control lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6). Lowering NMHC II-C1 (see Fig. 4A, II-C) also significantly lowered the total NMHC signal on the panmyosin blot (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). Quantification of the panmyosin blot for three different immunoblots revealed that NMHC II-B is less than 8% of the total NMHC II, and NMHC II-A and II-C1 comprise about 45% each of the total NMHC II.FIGURE 4Decreasing the NMHC II-C1 isoform reduces cell proliferation. A, immunoblot confirming that siRNA specifically inhibits only NMHC II-C1 protein expression and not II-A or II-B. Two different amounts of sample were loaded on the gel. B, an equivalent number (2.5 × 104) of A549 cells were seeded and transfected with either nonspecific (NS) or NMHC II-C1 siRNA, and cell numbers were counted at 24-h time intervals until 120 h. Each assay was performed in triplicate, and the entire experiment was repeated three times. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001 for siRNA II-C1 and II-A cell number versus nonspecific siRNA cell number.

D, quantification of NMHC II-C1 protein expression using immunoblots (not shown) from passage 1 and passage 2 cells (see C).

Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Effect of Lowering NMHC II Isoforms on Cell Proliferation— Since myosin II-A and II-C1 are the major nonmuscle myosin II isoforms in the A549 lung tumor cell line, we were interested in exploring the effect of lowering each of these two isoforms on cell proliferation. We found that lowering NMHC II-A had only a small effect (although statistically significant) on cell proliferation compared with the effect of transfecting nonspecific siRNA (quantified in Fig. 4B, hatched bars compared with the black bars for nonspecific siRNA). In contrast, using siRNA directed specifically against the NMHC II-C1 mRNA lowered NMHC II-C1 protein (Fig. 4A) and markedly decreased cell proliferation (open bars) compared with the effect of nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4B). At 120 h, there was almost a 5.5-fold difference in the number of NMHC II-C1 siRNA-treated cells compared with nonspecific siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4B). When NMHC II-C1 siRNA-treated cells and nonspecific siRNA-treated cells were replated at 156 h after siRNA transfection and the cells were counted at 24, 48, and 72 h after replating, there was no longer a difference in the rate of cell proliferation between them (see Fig. 4C, Passage 2). This correlated with increased expression of NMHC II-C1 protein following replating, which was most likely due to the loss of siRNA. Fig. 4D quantifies the expression of NMHC II-C1 protein in the siRNA-treated cells compared with nonspecific siRNA-treated cells at the times indicated as determined by scanning immunoblots. It demonstrates that by 180 h after siRNA transfection, the effects of siRNA have decreased, resulting in increased expression of NMHC II-C1 to about 40% of control cells and restoring proliferation of NMHC II-C1 siRNA-treated cells to that found for nonspecific siRNA-treated cells. This shows that the effects of siRNA treatment are reversible and account for the decrease in cell proliferation. Of note is that there was no evidence for binucleation in the siRNA-treated cells. Rescuing the siRNA-induced Decrease in Cell Proliferation Using GFP NMHC IIs—We then assessed the ability of each NMHC II isoform to rescue the decrease in cell proliferation caused by down-regulation of NMHC II-C1. Each full-length NMHC II isoform tagged with GFP was introduced into the cells that had been previously treated with NMHC II-C siRNA for 24 h. For this experiment, siRNAs to lower NMHC II-C were targeted to the 3′-untranslated region of NMHC II-C mRNA to prevent the siRNA from lowering mRNA derived from the NMHC II-C1-GFP construct (see “Experimental Procedures”). We previously reported (9Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that, unlike NMHC II-A and II-B, it was necessary to fuse GFP to the carboxyl terminus of the NMHC II-C molecule to prevent aggregation and for it to localize properly. Following transfection of the GFP-tagged NMHC II constructs into the NMHC II-C siRNA-treated cells, the cells were cultured for an additional 96 h, and the cell number was counted every 24 h after cDNA transfection. These experiments were carried out under conditions that normalized the transfection efficiency of all four GFP-tagged NMHC II constructs to 70% of the cells transfected, using the GFP signal viewed by fluorescence microscopy as an indicator. Fig. 5A shows a plot of cell numbers of the NMHC II-C siRNA-treated cells that were transfected with GFP-tagged NMHC II isoforms. Control cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA displayed the same rate of proliferation as did cells that were not transfected at all (data not shown). In contrast, NMHC II-C siRNA-treat"
https://openalex.org/W2036794960,"In prokaryotes and yeast, the general mechanism of biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters involves activities of several proteins among which IscS and Nfs1p provide, through cysteine desulfuration, elemental sulfide for Fe-S core formation. Although these proteins have been well characterized, the role of their mammalian homolog in Fe-S cluster biogenesis has never been evaluated. We report here the first functional study that implicates the putative cysteine desulfurase m-Nfs1 in the biogenesis of both mitochondrial and cytosolic mammalian Fe-S proteins. Depletion of m-Nfs1 in cultured fibroblasts through small interfering RNA-based gene silencing significantly inhibited the activities of mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II) of the respiratory chain, as well as aconitase of the Krebs cycle, with no alteration in their protein levels. Activity of cytosolic xanthine oxidase, which holds a [2Fe-2S] cluster, was also specifically reduced, and iron-regulatory protein-1 was converted from its [4Fe-4S] aconitase form to its apo- or RNA-binding form. Reduction of Fe-S enzyme activities occurred earlier and more markedly in the cytosol than in mitochondria, suggesting that there is a mechanism that primarily dedicates m-Nfs1 to the biogenesis of mitochondrial Fe-S clusters in order to maintain cell survival. Finally, depletion of m-Nfs1, which conferred on apo-IRP-1 a high affinity for ferritin mRNA, was associated with the down-regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin.

Finally, depletion of m-Nfs1, which conferred on apo-IRP-1 a high affinity for ferritin mRNA, was associated with the down-regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin. Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are metalloprosthetic groups incorporated into proteins that serve a wide range of vital cellular functions (1Johnson M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Beinert H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These include electron transfer in oxidative phosphorylation of the respiratory chain, enzymatic catalysis of dehydratases, and stabilization of protein structure. Another important function ascribed to Fe-S clusters is the regulation of gene expression (3Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 4Bouton C. Drapier J.C. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : pe17Google Scholar). This role is well illustrated by the [4Fe-4S] cluster in fumarate nitrate reduction, which is an oxygen sensor controlling the synthesis of proteins required for anaerobic respiration in Escherichia coli (5Unden G. Schirawski J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The [2Fe-2S] cluster of the bacterial transcription factor SoxR is also a good example of a gene regulator through its redox status or dinitrosyl iron conversion in response to oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), respectively (6Demple B. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In mammals, Fe-S clusters can also be used to regulate expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. When holding a [4Fe-4S] cluster, IRP-1 3The abbreviations used are: IRP-1, iron-regulatory protein-1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IRE, iron-responsive element; ISC, iron-sulfur cluster; complex I, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase; complex II, succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase; mt-aconitase, mitochondrial aconitase. acts as a cytosolic aconitase, whereas the apoprotein regulates translation of ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNAs by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) located in their 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively (4Bouton C. Drapier J.C. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : pe17Google Scholar). Consequently, the IRP-1 [4Fe-4S] cluster, which has the ability to sense cellular iron status and the level of NO or reactive oxygen species, is the key regulator allowing the protein to commute between its two (aconitase/IRE binding) activities (7Bouton C. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Fillebeen C. Pantopoulos K. Redox. Rep. 2002; 7: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These numerous examples clearly show that Fe-S clusters are critical regulatory factors in controlling the functions of many proteins involved in various cellular metabolisms, and therefore it is essential to understand their de novo biogenesis. The first insights into Fe-S cluster biogenesis have emerged from elegant studies on the metallocluster formation of A. vinelandii nitrogenase (9Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, Fe-S clusters are assembled in vivo through three multiprotein systems, referred to as ISC, NIF, and SUF (10Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Within the ISC system, the proteins IscS and IscU are essential for the construction of the Fe-S core. The cysteine desulfurase IscS provides inorganic sulfide from l-cysteine, which is subsequently transferred to a nascent Fe-S cluster on the scaffold protein IscU (11Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This ISC machinery also exists in yeast and is exclusively localized in the mitochondria (13Craig E.A. Marszalek J. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2002; 59: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Once synthesized in this compartment, Fe-S clusters are incorporated into mitochondrial apoproteins. A mitochondrial ABC transporter, named Atm1p, probably exports assembled Fe-S clusters or at least components required for Fe-S assembly in the cytosol (15Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 16Schueck N.D. Woontner M. Koeller D.M. Mitochondrion. 2001; : 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on knowledge gained in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, the first human and mouse genes homologous to the ISC machinery have recently been cloned (17Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Tong W.H. Jameson G.N. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9762-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Among these, mouse m-Nfs1, which presents 57% identity with the E. coli IscS and yeast Nfs1p, was the first IscS-like protein identified in a mammalian system. m-Nfs1, which has a typical mitochondrial targeting presequence in its N-terminal end, has been found in the matrix of mouse liver mitochondria (17Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the pyridoxal phosphate binding site and the cysteine residue essential for cysteine desulfuration have been conserved, which makes m-Nfs1 a plausible candidate for assembling Fe-S clusters in mouse proteins. Functional studies of ISC machinery components in mammals have only recently begun (21Stehling O. Elsasser H.P. Bruckel B. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 3007-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Seznec H. Simon D. Bouton C. Reutenauer L. Hertzog A. Golik P. Procaccio V. Patel M. Drapier J.C. Koenig M. Puccio H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the murine system, we have previously shown that Fe-S clusters of both cytosolic IRP-1 and mitochondrial aconitase (mt-aconitase), which are completely disassembled in cells exposed to NO, are rapidly repaired after shutting off NO flux (24Bouton C. Chauveau M.J. Lazereg S. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31220-31227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, Fe-S cluster reassembly/insertion into these two proteins is dependent on mitochondria. The fact that bacterial IscS and yeast Nfs1p are among the most essential proteins in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is an exciting development for functional studies of the mammalian m-Nfs1. As yet, to our knowledge, no functional studies have linked the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters to any mammalian cysteine desulfurase in living cells. To address this issue, we took advantage of siRNA technology to deplete m-Nfs1 in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). After achieving m-Nfs1 silencing, we observed an overall decrease in the activity of several mitochondrial Fe-S enzymes of the respiratory chain and the Krebs cycle without change in their protein levels. In addition, specific loss of Fe-S protein activities was also detected in the cytosol, and the siRNA-derived phenotype occurred even earlier in this compartment than in mitochondria. Moreover, depletion of m-Nfs1, which activated apo-IRP-1 for ferritin IRE binding, led to the down-regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin. Materials—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against complex I subunit NDUFS3 (NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone Fe-S protein) and complex II subunit b (the Fe-S subunit of complex II) were from MitoSciences (Eugene, OR). Antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. R. B. Franklin (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) (mt-aconitase), Dr. J. Brock (Glasgow University, Glasgow, UK) (l-ferritin), and Dr. S. A. Anderson (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) (IRP-1). The rabbit anti-mouse m-Nfs1 affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide sequence AQQEMEYDHKRISKL, corresponding to the amino acid residues 312–327 (Agro-Bio, La Ferté Saint-Aubin, France). All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. siRNA Preparation—The targeting sequences of m-Nfs1 (accession number NM_010911), corresponding to the coding regions 589–610 AAGAGCGGGATCATTGACTTA referred to as m-Nfs1-1, 727–748 AAGGTGTACTTCCACACTGAT referred to as m-Nfs1-2, 768–789 AATCCCACTTGACGTCAATGA referred to as m-Nfs1-3, and 1008–1029 AAGCGGATCTCAAAGTTAGCA referred to as m-Nfs1-4, were designed using the Qiagen algorithm. Negative control siRNA, which has no homology with any mammalian sequence (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT), was from Qiagen-Xeragon. Annealed and deprotected double-stranded siRNAs were resuspended in 30 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate (Qiagen-Xeragon) to obtain a 20 μm solution. Cell Culture and Transfection—Murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC clone CRL-1658) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Weil (Institut André Lwoff, Villejuif, France) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. NIH3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with siRNAs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Weil D. Garcon L. Harper M. Dumenil D. Dautry F. Kress M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus), respectively. The absence of cellular damage after 48 h of transfection was monitored by flow cytometry using the nucleic acid dye propidium iodide. A titration experiment using m-Nfs1-specific siRNA (5, 15, 25, 50, 100 nm) was performed. Silencing was effective (∼50% reduction) from 5 nm and was maximum at 100 nm. Negative control siRNA had no effect on m-Nfs1 expression under the same experimental conditions. Preparation of Mitochondria-enriched Fractions and Cytosolic Extracts—RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (5 × 106/ml) were harvested at the indicated times after transfection and resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the presence of an anti-protease mixture (1:100 final dilution; Calbiochem). Cells were then treated with 0.007% digitonin, and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After several washes in sucrose/HEPES buffer, the resulting mitochondria-enriched pellet was lysed in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was either immediately tested for mitochondrial aconitase activity or aliquoted and kept at –80 °C for further measurements. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from digitonin-treated cells. The supernatant from lysate that was centrifuged at 10,000 × g was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove any particulate material. The cytosolic extracts were aliquoted and kept at –80 °C for further measurements. Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Specific proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Super Signal; Pierce). The protein content in the samples was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunofluorescence—NIH3T3 cells grown on microscopy slides were labeled with a mitochondrion-specific probe (Mito-Tracker Red® CMXRos; Molecular Probes). Cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized in acetone for 10 min at 4 °C. After rehydration in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 10 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse m-Nfs1 antibody (1:100) and then with an fluorescein isothiocyanate mouse anti-rabbit antibody (1:20). Microscopy slides were mounted in Citifluor mounting medium (Citifluor, London, UK). Immunofluorescence was imaged on a Nikon TE 2000-E coupled with a Nikon digital camera DXM 1200 F. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler System and the FastStart DNA master DNA SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). cDNAs were prepared from 2 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. m-Nfs1 sequence-specific primers were designed to be upstream and close to the m-Nfs1 siRNA putative binding site (forward, CATTCGCCTGTTCACTCAGA; reverse, TGCATGAGTCCGAGAATGAG). In addition, ferritin (forward, TCTGGGCGAGTATCTCTTTG; reverse, TGCCTAGTGGCTTGAGAGG) and IRP-1 primers (forward, CAGCCACCCAAGTCCAATAGT; reverse, GCGTCGAATACATCAAGGGT) were designed to span intron-exon boundaries to generate around 100-bp amplicons. The generation of specific PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Values were normalized to the relative amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (forward, ACAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAA; reverse, CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA). Enzyme Activities—Enzyme activities were measured in cytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions. Complex I and complex II activities were measured as described by Rustin et al. (27Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gerard B. Rotig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Briefly, complex I activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by following the reduction of NADH at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 200 μm KCN. A sample containing 0.3 μm rotenone, a specific inhibitor of complex I, was used as the negative control. Complex II activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm by following the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 37 °C in the presence of inhibitors of complexes I, III, IV, and V. A sample containing 10 mm malonate (a specific inhibitor of complex II) was used as the negative control. Malate dehydrogenase activity was assessed according to Siegel and Englard (28Siegel L. Englard S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 64: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitases were measured as described by Drapier and Hibbs (29Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were determined using the Amplex® Red xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen) and the LD-L 10 kit (Sigma), respectively. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—IRP-IRE interactions were analyzed as described (30Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 31Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Two μg of cytosolic proteins were incubated with an excess of [α-33P]UTP-labeled ferritin IRE probe in 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. In parallel experiments, samples were treated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol to allow full expression of the IRE binding activity. The IRP·IRE complexes were resolved on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Carbonylated Proteins—Oxidized proteins were detected with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to derivatize protein carbonyl groups followed by immunoblot analysis using primary polyclonal antibodies to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl moiety (Chemicon International). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed using Excel (Microsoft). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was defined as significant, and asterisks are used to denote significance as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Localization of m-Nfs1 in Murine NIH3T3 Fibroblasts—Like the yeast Nfs1p homolog, m-Nfs1 possesses a typical mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N terminus, which predicts a mitochondrial localization (17Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, to assess its localization in our cellular model, m-Nfs1 protein levels were examined in different cellular fractions of murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts by immunoblot analysis. We found that m-Nfs1 was present in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas no labeling was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). The single band identified at 47 kDa in the immunoblot corresponded to the mature protein size described in the literature (17Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reliability of the subcellular fractionation was assessed by using mitochondrial aconitase and vinculin as mitochondrial and cytosolic markers, respectively (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom panels). In addition, NIH3T3 cells were costained with an anti-m-Nfs1 antibody and the mitochondrion-selective dye MitoTracker Red® and were subsequently evaluated by using fluorescence microscopy. We showed that m-Nfs1 staining presented a distinct punctate distribution similar to that of mitochondria and colocalized with the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1B, left panels). Importantly, immunostaining of the same cell line with preimmune IgGs showed no mitochondrial labeling, thus confirming the specificity of staining for m-Nfs1 (Fig. 1B, right panels). siRNA Silencing of m-Nfs1 Expression in NIH3T3 Cells—To investigate the participation of m-Nfs1 in assembling Fe-S clusters in mammalian cells, four siRNAs (m-Nfs1-1, m-Nfs1-2, m-Nfs1-3, and m-Nfs1-4) directed against distinct regions of the m-Nfs1 coding sequence were synthesized. To test the specificity of silencing, a negative control siRNA with no homology to any mammalian sequence was used. The double-stranded siRNAs at a concentration of 100 nm were transfected into cells that were subsequently cultured for 48 h. After this incubation time, both total RNAs and mitochondrial fractions were isolated and analyzed by quantitative PCR and immunoblot, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, all four m-Nfs1 siRNAs were effective in reducing m-Nfs1 mRNA levels by at least 50%, the third being the most potent with a 75% reduction. m-Nfs1 protein was also efficiently depleted by the four specific siRNAs (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 6 with lanes 2–5). The lower level of mitochondrial aconitase (taken here as loading control) seen in lane 6 by comparison with that of lane 1 illustrates the fact that loading was not equal but does not preclude the conclusion that cells treated with control siRNA (lane 6) and nontransfected cells (lane 1) exhibited a similar level of m-Nfs1 (see also supplemental Fig. S2). The m-Nfs1 level was reduced by at least 95% after 48 h of specific siRNA treatment, corresponding to the 95% transfection efficiency measured by flow cytometry using a rhodamine-labeled negative control siRNA (Fig. 2C). The lack of m-Nfs1 did not negatively influence the viability of the cells at least for 48 h, as determined by propidium iodide exclusion flow cytometry experiments (data not shown). Taking all of these data into consideration, all subsequent experiments were performed using m-Nfs1-3 siRNA to achieve the best m-Nfs1 silencing. Role of m-Nfs1 in the Activity of Mitochondrial Fe-S Cluster-containing Enzymes—We then asked whether m-Nfs1 has a functional role in assembling mitochondrial Fe-S clusters. We thus performed an efficient silencing of m-Nfs1 over 7 days by transfecting NIH3T3 cells with m-Nfs1-3 siRNA every 48 h. Mitochondrial fractions of cells were obtained after 2, 4, and 5 or 7 days of siRNA treatment and analyzed by immunoblot for m-Nfs1. We first checked that cell transfection with control siRNA did not have any detectable effect on m-Nfs1 expression or on mitochondrial aconitase activity (used as an Fe-S protein reporter) when compared with untransfected cells (supplemental Fig. S3). After 7 days of m-Nfs1 silencing, cell density was lower, indicated by a consistent half-decrease in protein concentration in lysates from m-Nfs1-deficient cells as compared with control cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), m-Nfs1 silencing was strong and constant over the 7-day period, whereas no effect was observed using negative control siRNA. The activity of several mitochondrial Fe-S cluster-containing proteins was subsequently measured. We observed a significant decrease in the specific activities of three Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes: complex I by 32% (p < 0.05), complex II by 57% (p < 0.01), and mt-aconitase by 27% (p < 0.01) from 4 days of m-Nfs1 deficiency (Fig. 4). These activities were kept low or even declined (42%, p < 0.05; 39%, p < 0.001; and 40%, p < 0.01, respectively) after 5 or 7 days of silencing. Importantly, no change was detectable in the activity of malate dehydrogenase, which does not contain Fe-S clusters, upon m-Nfs1 depletion. The loss of activity of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster-containing proteins did not result from impaired synthesis or import of these proteins into mitochondria, since no changes in Fe-S protein levels were observed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, lower panels).FIGURE 4Mitochondrial Fe-S cluster-containing enzyme activities in m-Nfs1-depleted cells. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with m-Nfs1-3 or negative control siRNA at the times indicated. Then, mitochondria-enriched fractions were prepared, and specific activities (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of complex I, complex II, aconitase, and malate dehydrogenase were measured.

Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that mitochondria are crucial for repairing the Fe-S cluster of the cytosolic IRP-1 (24Bouton C. Chauveau M.J. Lazereg S. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31220-31227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential role of m-Nfs1 in the biosynthesis of cytosolic Fe-S-containing proteins was carefully examined in our mammalian cell model. To address this question, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with negative control or m-Nfs1-siRNAs and maintained in culture for 2 and 4 days. Cytosolic fractions were prepared, and activities of [4Fe-4S]-containing aconitase (IRP-1) and [2Fe-2S]-containing xanthine oxidase were measured spectrophotometrically and fluorometrically, respectively. Our results show a rapid and dramatic decrease in aconitase activity of IRP-1 (by 71% after 2 days of m-Nfs1 depletion), which continued to decline by 79% after 4 days (Table 1). Likewise, xanthine oxidase activity was inhibited by 40 and 65% in m-Nfs1-deficient cells after 2 and 4 days, respectively. Protein levels were also analyzed to determine whether loss of cytosolic Fe-S-containing protein activities was dependent on protein loss or defective Fe-S cluster assembly. Intriguingly, whereas the xanthine oxidase level was not significantly lower in specific m-Nfs1-siRNA treated cells as compared with its respective control, a 50% decrease in IRP-1 protein content was observed in m-Nfs1-silenced cells, as compared with the protein level in nonsilenced cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Nevertheless, despite the fact that IRP-1 protein level diminished, a significant increase in the RNA-binding capacity of IRP-1 was detected upon m-Nfs1 depletion, which positively signifies that IRP-1 was deprived of its Fe-S cluster (Fig. 6A). We also observed that IRE-binding activity of IRP-2, the second iron-regulatory protein that does not contain an Fe-S cluster, was low in NIH3T3 cells and did not change in cytosolic extracts from negative control and m-Nfs1-siRNA-treated cells. Finally, we observed no alteration in the activity of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase, which does not contain an Fe-S cluster, upon m-Nfs1 deficiency (Table 1). We also performed efficient m-Nfs1 silencing in a macrophage cell line, another cell type that expresses m-Nfs1 in the mitochondrial compartment with no trace detectable in the cytosol, and examined cytosolic aconitase activity (Fig. 7, A and B). As shown in Fig. 7C, cytosolic aconitase activity declined in m-Nfs1-deficient macrophages after 48 h and was still low after 72 h of silencing, whereas no change in this activity was observed in nontransfected and control siRNA-transfected cells.TABLE 1Effect of m-Nfs1 silencing on activities of cytosolic Fe-S cluster-containing enzymesFirst transfection (2 days after first transfection)Second transfection (4 days after first transfection)Negativem-Nfs1-3Negativem-Nfs1-3units/mgIRP-124 ± 37 ± 4ap < 0.01.29 ± 16 ± 3bp < 0.001.XO15 ± 19 ± 0.4ap < 0.01.17 ± 0."
https://openalex.org/W2062119365,"Aminopeptidase A (APA) is a type II membrane-bound protein implicated in the regulation of blood pressure in the brain renin-angiotensin system. In this study, a recombinant soluble form of APA was expressed in a baculovirus system, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. By using synthetic substrates, it was shown that although the enzyme has a rather broad substrate specificity in the absence of Ca2+, the preferential release of acidic amino acid residues was observed in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, Ca2+ up- or down-regulated the enzymatic activity depending on the substrate. By searching for natural substrates of APA, we found that peptides having acidic amino acids at their N terminus (angiotensin II, neurokinin B, cholecystokinin-8, and chromogranin A) were cleaved by the enzyme efficiently in the presence but not in the absence of Ca2+. Moreover kallidin (Lys-bradykinin) was converted to bradykinin effectively only in the absence of Ca2+. These results suggest that Ca2+ increases the preference of the enzyme for the peptide substrates having N-terminal acidic amino acids. In addition, we found that angiotensin IV could bind to APA both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and inhibited the enzymatic activity of APA competitively, suggesting that angiotensin IV acts as a negative regulator of the enzyme once generated from angiotensin II by the serial actions of aminopeptidases. Taken together, these results suggest that there exists a complex regulation of the enzymatic activity of APA, which may contribute to homeostasis such as regulation of blood pressure, maintenance of memory, and normal pregnancy by controlling the concentrations of peptide substrates.

Aminopeptidases hydrolyze N-terminal amino acids of proteins and peptide substrates. They are distributed widely in animal and plant tissues as well as in bacteria and fungi, suggesting that they play important roles in protein maturation, activation, modulation, the degradation of bioactive peptides, and the determination of protein stability (1Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The zinc-containing M1 family of aminopeptidases (gluzincins) shares the consensus GAMEN and HEXXH(X)18E zinc-binding motifs essential for enzymatic activity (2Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). So far, 11 enzymes belonging to this family have been identified, although the enzymatic activity of laeverin has not been reported (3Tsujimoto M. Hattori A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates the biological significance of aminopeptidases belonging to the M1 family. For instance, placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP) 2The abbreviations used are: P-LAP, placental leucine aminopeptidase; A-LAP, adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase; Ang, angiotensin; APA, aminopeptidase A; CCK8, cholecystokinin-8; IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; NA, β-naphthylamide; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; sAPA, soluble APA. /insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) plays a role in controlling the concentration of uterotonic and vasoactive hormones, such as oxytocin and vasopressin, possibly derived from the fetus at the interface between the fetus and mother and thus preventing premature delivery and pre-eclampsia (4Nomura S.

It has been reported that adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP)/endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase is a multifunctional aminopeptidase with roles in the regulation of blood pressure, angiogenesis, the shedding of cytokine receptors, and the presentation of antigens to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (3Tsujimoto M. Hattori A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, several physiological and/or pathological functions in the brain, including the regulation of blood pressure and apoptosis, are carried out by aminopeptidases such as aminopeptidase A (APA), aminopeptidase N, and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (5Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6Reaux A.

It was also reported that puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase gene-deficient mice exhibited dwarfism and increased anxiety and analgesia (9Osada T. Ikegami S. Takiguchi-Hayashi K. Yamazaki Y.

Because of the pathophysiological significance of M1 family members, it is important to characterize their enzymatic properties and regulatory mechanisms in detail. Aminopeptidase A (EC 3.4.11.7) is a homodimeric membrane-spanning zinc-metallopeptidase that preferentially cleaves N-terminal acidic amino acids from peptide substrates such as angiotensin (Ang) II and cholecystokinin-8 (CCK8) in vivo (5Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 10Migaud M. Durieux C.

Reports by several groups showed that Ca2+ up-regulates the enzymatic activity of APA toward synthetic substrates (such as Glu-β-naphthylamide (NA)) (11Danielsen E.M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Ingram J. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Nanus D.M. Engelstein D. Gastl G.A. Gluck L. Vidal M.J. Morrison M. Finstad C.L. Bander N.H. Albino A.P. Proc.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). APA is expressed in many areas, including the brush border of intestinal and renal epithelial cells and the vascular endothelium. It has also been identified as a murine B lymphocyte differentiation antigen (BP-1/6C3) and a human kidney (gp160) differentiation antigen (12Nanus D.M. Engelstein D. Gastl G.A. Gluck L. Vidal M.J.

By employing highly selective APA and aminopeptidase N inhibitors, Reaux et al. (6Reaux A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. David C. Zini S. Roques B. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13415-13420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) elucidated the important roles of these two enzymes in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS). APA is responsible for the conversion of brain Ang II to Ang III and Ang III then mediates the increase in blood pressure. These results indicate that brain APA is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension. The structural features and mode of enzymatic action of APA have been extensively characterized by molecular modeling and mutational analysis (16Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14785-14793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the extracellular domain of porcine APA was divided into two subdomains by proteolytic fragmentation, a 107-kDa domain containing an HEXXH(X)18E motif and a 45-kDa C-terminal domain (21Hesp J.R. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3000-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was shown that the C-terminal domain is required for the dimerization of the enzyme and acts as an intramolecular chaperone necessary for the correct folding, intracellular trafficking, and activity of the enzyme (22Ofner L.D. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Rozenfeld R. Muller L. Messari S.E. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43285-43295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the enzymatic properties of APA have been poorly characterized because of the limited availability of purified enzyme. In this paper, we established a system for the production of a recombinant soluble form of APA and elucidated the enzymatic properties of the protein in detail. Our data indicate that depending on the substrates tested Ca2+ up- or down-regulates the enzymatic activity of APA and increases the specificity of the enzyme for acidic amino acids. By searching for natural substrates, we found that peptides having acidic amino acids at their N terminus, such as Ang II, neurokinin B, CCK8, and chromogranin A, were good substrates of APA in the presence of Ca2+, whereas kallidin, a peptide hormone with N-terminal nonacidic amino acid, was converted to bradykinin efficiently only in the absence of Ca2+. Moreover, we found that Ang IV can act as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The results presented in this study provide new insight into the regulation of APA that plays an important role in brain functions such as the regulation of blood pressure and pain perception. Expression and Purification of a Soluble Form of Human APA in a Baculovirus System—cDNA encoding human APA starting at Ala72 with the human trypsin II signal peptide (MNLLLILTFVAAAVAA) at its N terminus and a His6 tag at its C terminus was generated by PCR (24Matsumoto H. Rogi T. Yamashiro K. Kodama S. Tsuruoka N. Hattori A. Takio K. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Hattori A. Kitatani K. Matsumoto H. Miyazawa S. Rogi T. Tsuruoka N. Mizutani S. Natori Y. Tsujimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was cloned into the vector pDONR (Invitrogen) by recombination with BP Clonase™ (Invitrogen). After confirmation of the nucleotide sequence with an ABI 377 DNA sequencer, the cDNA for a soluble form of APA was transferred into a baculovirus transfer vector, pDEST8 (Invitrogen). The plasmid was then introduced into DH10Bac cells to produce recombinant bacmid DNA containing the cDNA for the soluble form of APA. Next Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the bacmid using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), and after 72 h, recombinant baculoviruses were harvested. For the expression of the soluble form of APA, Sf9 cells (2.0 × 106/ml) infected with the recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = ∼1–3) were cultured for 72 h in 650 ml of SFM-900 II medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. The conditioned medium was collected by centrifugation, concentrated in an ultrafiltration system, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and then applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl. The APA-containing fractions obtained from the DEAE-Toyopearl column were pooled, applied to a chelating-Toyopearl (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column (1.0 × 10 cm) preloaded with Co2+, and then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The active fractions were collected, concentrated, and subjected to further characterization. De-glycosylation of sAPA—Purified sAPA (100 μg/ml) was incubated with either peptide:N-glycosidase F (30 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing aprotinin (0.1 TIU/μl) or leupeptin (100 μm) at 4 °C for 2 h. Cleavage of the sugar moiety was monitored by periodic acid-Schiff staining using GelCode glycoprotein staining kit (Pierce). Heat-denatured proteins were prepared by boiling for 5 min. Measurement of Aminopeptidase Activity of APA—The aminopeptidase activity of the recombinant human APA was determined with various fluorogenic substrates, aminoacyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amides (aminoacyl-MCAs). The reaction mixture containing various concentrations of aminoacyl-MCA and the enzyme in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) with or without 1.0 mm Ca2+ ion was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The amount of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released was measured by spectrofluorophotometry (F-2000; Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The kinetic parameters were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The results are represented by Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Cleavage of Peptide Hormones by APA—Peptide hormones (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) (25 μm) were incubated with the enzyme (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was terminated by adding 2.5% (v/v) formic acid. The peptides generated were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (AT-10; Shimazu) on a COSMOSIL (4.6 × 250 mm) column (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The buffers used for the isocratic separation of the peptides were as follows: for the peptides from Ang II or kallidin, 19% acetonitrile containing 0.086% trifluoroacetic acid; for the peptides from CCK8 or neurokinin B, 35% acetonitrile containing 0.083% trifluoroacetic acid; and for the peptides from chromogranin A, 21% acetonitrile containing 0.086% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular masses of peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS with a REFLEX mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik) using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole as the matrix. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The molecular mass of recombinant APA was measured by the sedimentation equilibrium method using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Prior to the analysis, the sample was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KCl. The enzyme solution (absorbance at 280 nm = 0.6) and reference buffer were loaded into double-sector centerpieces and mounted in an An-50 Ti rotor. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and at 20 °C with the absorbance of the sample monitored at 280 nm every hour for 12 h. The data obtained were analyzed with Origin 6.0 software. The partial specific volume of the soluble form of APA calculated by the SEDNTERP program is 0.7345. Materials—Asp-, Gln-, Glu-, Gly-, Ile-, Val-, and S-benzyl-Cys-MCAs were purchased from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Ala-, Arg-, Leu-, Lys-, Met-, and Phe-MCAs were from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Aprotinin and p-(4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). Amastatin, bestatin, and E64 were purchased from Sigma. Leupeptin, pepstatin, and all peptide hormones were from the Peptide Institute. Peptide:N-glycosidase F was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Production of a Recombinant Soluble Form of APA—To characterize the enzymatic properties of APA in detail, we established a method to produce a recombinant form of the protein using a baculovirus system. To facilitate purification, a His tag sequence was attached at the C-terminal end of the enzyme. The soluble form of APA (sAPA) was transiently expressed in the baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity from the culture medium by serial chromatography on columns of DEAE-Toyopearl and Co2+-chelating Toyopearl. From 650 ml of culture medium, 1.46 mg of sAPA was obtained with ∼40% recovery and 22-fold purification. As shown in Fig. 1A, the purified protein gave a single band with a molecular mass of 115 kDa on SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The purified sAPA was sensitive to peptide:N-glycosidase F and shifted to 103 kDa, after treatment, which was exactly expected from the amino acid sequence of sAPA (expected molecular weight is 103,079.3). De-glycosylation of the enzyme by peptide:N-glycosidase F had little effect on the enzymatic activity of sAPA toward Glu-MCA (Fig. 1B). Because it was shown that native APA forms a dimer via a disulfide bond (15Shipp M.A. Look A.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1052-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ofner L.D. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we next performed an ultracentrifuge-based analysis to measure the molecular weight of purified sAPA exactly. The molecular weight of sAPA measured by the sedimentation equilibrium method was calculated as 237 kDa (data not shown). These results indicate that sAPA is a nonsulfide-linked homodimeric protein. Fig. 1C shows the pH profile of the enzymatic activity. The optimal pH of the enzyme was 7.0 with relatively broad pH dependence. Characterization of Aminopeptidase Activity of APA—We then measured the aminopeptidase activity of sAPA toward various synthetic substrates with special reference to the effects of Ca2+ on the enzymatic activity because it was reported that Ca2+ up-regulated the activity of APA toward acidic amino acids (Fig. 2) (11Danielsen E.M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Ingram J. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Nanus D.M. Engelstein D. Gastl G.A. Gluck L. Vidal M.J. Morrison M. Finstad C.L.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As expected, in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+, the enzyme hydrolyzed 2.3- and 5.4-fold more Glu-MCA and Asp-MCA, respectively. In addition, we found that the substrate specificity of sAPA measured in the presence of Ca2+ is indeed fairly restricted and limited to Glu-MCA and Asp-MCA. Little activity was detected toward other substrates tested with the exception of Gln-MCA. On the other hand, in the absence of Ca2+, the substrate specificity was rather broad, and Gln-MCA and Glu-MCA were hydrolyzed equally by the enzyme. Moreover, although at fairly low levels, the cleavage of neutral amino acids (i.e. Ala, Leu and Met) and basic amino acids (i.e. Lys and Arg) was clearly detected. Intriguingly, Ca2+ modulated the hydrolytic activity of sAPA differently depending on the substrate. In contrast to the Ca2+-mediated up-regulation of the enzymatic action toward acidic amino acids (i.e. Glu and Asp), Ca2+ caused a 76.7% decrease in the hydrolytic activity toward Gln-MCA. Hydrolytic activities toward Ala-, Leu-, Met-, Lys-, and Arg-MCA were barely detectable in the absence of Ca2+. Taken together, these results indicate that Ca2+ modulates the substrate specificity of sAPA and increases its preference for the acidic amino acids. Table 1 shows the enzymatic parameters of sAPA measured in the presence or absence of 1.0 mm Ca2+. With Glu-MCA or Asp-MCA as the substrate, Ca2+ caused an enhancement of the hydrolytic activity by decreasing the Km value and increasing the kcat value. Conversely, when Gln-MCA was used, Ca2+ caused a decrease in the hydrolytic activity by increasing the Km value and decreasing the kcat value.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of sAPA toward various aminoacyl-MCASubstrateCaCl2KmaThe values are mean ± S.D.

(n = 3). Open table in a new tab We next examined the effects of various divalent cations on the enzymatic activity of sAPA (Fig. 3). When Glu-MCA was employed as a substrate, it was observed that although Ca2+ enhanced the hydrolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner as expected, Zn2+, which is known to be an effective inhibitor of various M1 aminopeptidases, suppressed the activity dose-dependently. Cu2+ and Co2+ also suppressed the activity although moderately, whereas Mg2+ and Mn2+ had little effect up to 2.5 mm. However, when Gln-MCA was employed, Zn2+ suppressed the enzymatic activity most effectively. Other cations, including Ca2+, moderately suppressed the activity. Even Mg2+ and Mn2+ exerted suppressive effects on the Gln-MCA-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme. These results indicate that among the cations tested, Ca2+ is unique in its ability to enhance the hydrolytic activity of sAPA toward Glu-MCA and Asp-MCA.

Fig. 4 shows the effects of various inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes on the hydrolytic activity of sAPA measured in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+. As for known aminopeptidase inhibitors, whereas amastatin was effective at a concentration as low as 1.0 μm (IC50 = 0.157 ± 0.057 μm), bestatin had little activity up to 1 mm. As is the case with other aminopeptidases, 1,10-phenanthroline, a metal chelator, inhibited sAPA activity at 0.1–1 mm (IC50 = 60.2 ± 5.2 μm). Leupeptin (serine/cysteine protease inhibitor), pepstatin A (aspartic acid protease inhibitor), p-(4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride (serine protease inhibitor), and E64 (cysteine protease inhibitor) had little inhibitory effects at 1 mm. Nearly the same results were obtained when enzymatic activity was measured in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Although an inhibitory effect of bestatin was barely detectable, we concluded that the overall inhibitor profile of sAPA is consistent with that of the M1 aminopeptidases characterized to date (7Constam D.B.

To identify possible substrates of the enzyme, the binding of various peptides was assessed by measuring the competition from each peptide for the hydrolysis of Glu-MCA because sAPA hydrolyzes Glu-MCA both in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+. Table 2 shows the effects of various peptides on the sAPA-mediated hydrolysis of Glu-MCA. Based on previous works (11Danielsen E.M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Ingram J. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Nanus D.M. Engelstein D. Gastl G.A. Gluck L. Vidal M.J. Morrison M. Finstad C.L. Bander N.H. Albino A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we initially estimated that only peptides having N-terminal acidic amino acids could bind to the enzyme. Quite unexpectedly, however, Ang III, Ang IV, kallidin, and substance P, which have N-terminal nonacidic amino acids, inhibited (>50%) the hydrolysis of the substrate in the absence of Ca2+ at 10 μm, suggesting the binding of these peptides to the enzyme. These peptides (with the exception of Ang IV) were less inhibitory at the same concentration in the presence of Ca2+. At 100 μm, a variety of peptides could inhibit the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. On the other hand, in the presence of Ca2+, >50% inhibition was only observed at 100 μm of peptides such as Ang II, Ang IV, neurokinin B, CCK8, and chromogranin A. These peptides (with the exception of Ang IV) have acidic amino acids at their N-terminal ends. From these results, we speculated that peptides with N-terminal acidic amino acids that inhibited the enzyme efficiently in the presence of Ca2+ might be cleaved and therefore are candidates for the substrates. On the other hand, in the absence of Ca2+, a relatively wide range of peptides may bind to the enzyme without cleavage. However, it should be noted that in contrast to other peptides having N-terminal acidic amino acids, chromogranin A prevented the hydrolysis of Glu-MCA only in the presence of Ca2+ in this assay. Because of its cluster of N-terminal glutamic acids, chromogranin A may be unique and bind to the enzyme only in the presence of Ca2+. It is also noteworthy that although parathyroid hormone has glutamic acid at its N-terminal end, it showed only a marginal inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis, suggesting that not all peptides with N-terminal amino acids are good substrates of the enzyme. Taken together, it is conceivable from these results that Ca2+modulates the binding and hydrolytic activities of the enzyme depending on the peptides tested and thus may regulate its enzymatic action. However, as shown below, although Ang IV clearly inhibited the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, its cleavage by the enzyme was detectable only after a long incubation period. In addition, despite an efficient inhibitory activity (especially in the absence of Ca2+), Ang III was a poor substrate of the enzyme both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Therefore, we concluded that it is difficult to estimate the possible physiological substrates by this inhibition assay, which is often performed for the estimation (12Nanus D.M. Engelstein D.

Members of this family share four distinct structural domains: an N-terminal cross-linking domain, a collagenous domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. In this study, the function of the collagenous domain was evaluated by expressing a SP-D collagen deletion mutant protein (rSftpdCDM) in wild type and SP-D null mice (Sftpd-/-). rSftpdCDM formed disulfide-linked trimers that further oligomerized into higher order structures. The mutant protein effectively bound carbohydrate and aggregated bacteria in vitro. Whereas rSftpdCDM did not disrupt pulmonary morphology or surfactant phospholipid levels in wild type mice, the mutant protein failed to rescue the emphysema or enlarged foamy macrophages that are characteristic of Sftpd-/- mice. Moreover, rSftpdCDM partitioned with small aggregate surfactant in a manner similar to SP-D, but rSftpdCDM did not correct the abnormal surfactant ultrastructure or phospholipid levels observed in Sftpd-/- mice. In contrast, rSftpdCDM completely corrected viral clearance and the abnormal inflammatory response that occurs following pulmonary influenza A challenge in Sftpd-/- mice. Our findings indicate that the collagen domain of SP-D is not required for assembly of disulfide-stabilized oligomers or the innate immune response to viral pathogens.

Members of this family include surfactant protein A (SP-A), SP-D, mannose-binding protein, conglutinin, and CL-43. SP-A and SP-D contribute to the innate immune system of the lung by binding and enhancing the clearance of a variety of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens (1Hawgood S. Poulain F.R. Annu. Rev.

The collectins are defined by four structural domains shared by all family members: a short amino-terminal cross-linking domain, a triple helical collagenous domain, a neck domain, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (4Rust K.

Three neck domains associate to form a triple coiled-coil structure that facilitates the assembly of the remaining domains into a trimer (9Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Final assembly of the trimer, thought to be the minimal functional unit of collectins, occurs through disulfide bonds between the cysteine-rich amino-terminal domains (10Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D.

Trimers further combine into larger multimeric complexes through disulfide-stabilized, noncovalent interactions. Although larger structures are commonly observed, SP-D exists predominantly as a tetramer of trimeric subunits (dodecamer) assembled into a cruciform structure (10Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D.

Mice with a targeted deletion of the Sftpd gene (Sftpd-/-) survived normally but developed gradually worsening pulmonary inflammation, emphysema, and surfactant phospholipid accumulations (13Ikegami M.

Sftpd-/- mice accumulate apoptotic alveolar macrophages as well as enlarged, lipid-laden, macrophages that release metalloproteinases and reactive oxygen species (15Clark H. Palaniyar N. Strong P.

Uptake and clearance of viral pathogens, including influenza A and respiratory syncitial virus, were deficient in Sftpd-/- mice (20LeVine A.M. Elliott J. Whitsett J.A. Srikiatkhachorn A. Crouch E.

However, oxygen radical release and production of the proinflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, and IL-6, were increased in Sftpd-/- mice when exposed to either viral or bacterial pathogens (19LeVine A.M.

The roles of the various domains of SP-D in its complex functions have been studied by expressing SP-D point mutants, deletion mutants, or chimeric proteins of SP-D and other collectins. For example, whereas expression of the fulllength rat Sftpd gene (rSftpd) fully rescues the Sftpd-/- mouse phenotype, expression of a fusion protein that included the N-terminal and collagen domains of SP-A fused to the neck and CRD of SP-D (rSftpa/d) was not sufficient to correct the emphysema or lipid accumulations characteristic of Sftpd-/- mice, indicating that the collagenous and N-terminal domains of SP-D are essential for these functions (22Zhang L. Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. McCormack F.X. Yoshida M. Senior R.M. Shipley J.M. Shapiro S.D. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L181-L190Google Scholar). Substitution of serine for cysteine at positions 15 and 20 of the N-terminal domain (rSftpdSer15,20) results in a protein that corresponds to a single trimeric arm of the SP-D dodecamer but fails to correct the abnormal macrophages, emphysema, or lipid accumulations in Sftpd-/- mice, suggesting that oligomers induced by the SP-D collagenous and N-terminal domains are required for complete function (23Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, intranasal administration of a truncated SP-D trimer (consisting of only the CRD and neck domains) into Sftpd-/- mice partially corrects the apoptotic macrophages, lipid accumulations, and elevated inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the collagen domain is not essential for these activities (15Clark H. Palaniyar N. Strong P. Edmondson J. Hawgood S. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Clark H. Palaniyar N. Hawgood S. Reid K.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since most collectins form sulfhydryl-stabilized oligomers, the relatively large collagen domain of SP-D suggests that this domain serves a purpose that is beyond facilitating oligomerization of the SP-D CRD. Comparisons of SP-D, mannose-binding protein, and conglutinin fusion proteins suggest the large collagen domain promotes proper spacing of trimeric subunits in order to facilitate cross-linking of separate microorganisms and microbial aggregation (25Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 6129-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further investigate the function of the SP-D structural domains, we genetically introduced into wild type and Sftpd-/- mice lungs an SP-D collagen deletion mutant protein (rSftpdCDM) that formed multimers via an intact N terminus. Whereas expression of rSftpdCDM elicited a protective response to influenza virus, the protein failed to correct the abnormal macrophage activation, emphysema, or lipid abnormalities in Sftpd-/- mice, indicating that the SP-D collagenous domain is critical for normal regulation of lipid homeostasis, macrophage activity, and the structural integrity of peripheral airspaces. Animal Husbandry—Mice were handled in accordance with approved protocols through the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All mice had been maintained in the vivarium in barrier containment facilities. Sentinel mice in the colony were serologically negative for common murine pathogens. Generation of Transgenic Mice—rSftpdCDM cDNA was generated using recombinant PCR to delete a 177-amino acid sequence (Gly26-Pro202) corresponding to the complete collagen domain from rat SP-D (Fig. 1). The rSftpdCDM cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of 3.7hSPC/SV40 expression vector and sequenced (26Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The transgene was microinjected into FVB/N oocytes fertilized with Sftpd-/- sperm by the Children's Hospital Transgenic Core facility, and founders were identified by transgene-specific PCR using upstream primer 5′-GGAGACAAAATCTTCAGGGCG-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TTCGGATGGTGGCAGCATAG-3′. Transgenic animals were crossed with either Sftpd-/- mice to generate rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftptd-/- mice or wild type mice to generate rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftpd+/+ mice (16Korfhagen T.R. Sheftelyevich V. Burhans M.S. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Wert S.E. Stahlman M.T. Jobe A.H. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Fisher J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28438-28443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Animals were weighed, anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, and exsanguinated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed five times with 1 ml of normal saline. Typically, >90% of the instilled volume was recovered. For each lane, 40 μl of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was dried, reconstituted in 15 μl of Laemmli buffer with or without sulfhydryl reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, and resolved on 10-20% SDS/Tris/glycine/polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). After separation and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, protein was detected with rabbit anti-mouse SP-D or guinea pig anti-rat SP-A antiserum (Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH) diluted 1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline as previously described (27Zhang L. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22453-22459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SP-D Purification—Previous studies demonstrated that inactivation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene (Gmcsf-/-) in mice impaired SP-D clearance and increased SP-D levels in BALF severalfold (28Reed J.A. Ikegami M. Robb L. Begley C.G. Ross G. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1164-L1171PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to increase the amount of starting material for protein purification, rSftpdCDM was purified from rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftptd-/-/Gmcsf-/- mice. Wild type mouse SP-D was purified from Sftpd+/+/Gmcsf-/- mice that also carried a deletion of the two expressed Sftpa genes in order to minimize the potential of SP-A contamination. A similar Sftpa deletion was not possible in the rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftptd-/-/Gmcsf-/- mice; however, contaminating SP-A was not detectable by silver stain gels in rSftpdCDM preparations. SP-D- or rSftpdCDM-containing BALF was applied to a maltosyl-Sepharose (Sigma) column and selectively eluted with manganese as previously described (29Strong P. Kishore U. Morgan C. Lopez Bernal A. Singh M. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were diluted 10-fold in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 30 mm CaCl2 and applied to a 1-ml bed volume maltosyl-Sepharose column. The column was stripped of lipopolysaccharide with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml polymyxin and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Under the conditions employed, lipopolysacharide concentration was typically ≤0.1 endotoxin units/μg of protein. SP-D Sizing and Detection—The size of rSftpdCDM multimers was determined by gel filtration chromatography using Sepharose CL-6B equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide. Purified rSftpdCDM was diluted in the same buffer and applied to the column (1.5 × 90 cm). rSftpdCDM protein concentration was determined in each fraction using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plates were washed five times between incubations, and all washes and dilutions were carried out with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. A mouse anti-SP-D monoclonal antibody was developed by exposing Sftpd-/- mice to purified, full-length, human SP-D and selecting cell lines that demonstrated a high affinity for SP-D and minimal cross-reactivity with SP-A (Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH). ELISA plates were coated with this monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed, and appropriate dilutions of standards and protein samples were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antiserum (100 μl/well diluted 1:750) for 1 h. This was followed by washing and incubation with donkey horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (100 μl/well diluted 1:10,000) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. After washing plates again, TMB substrate (100 μl/well) (BioFx Laboratories, Owings Mills, MD) was added. The color reaction was stopped after 10 min with 2 m H2SO4, and plates were read at 450 nm. Typically, this assay results in absorbance changes that are equal, parallel, and linear for mouse SP-D, rSftpdCDM, and human SP-D concentrations between 10 and 150 ng/ml. Carbohydrate Binding—Direct binding of SP-D to carbohydrate was detected by mixing BALF from 6-8-week-old mice with maltosyl-Sepharose-linked beads at 4 °C for 2 h in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm CaCl2 (23Zhang L. Ikegami M. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding specificity and calcium dependence were confirmed by the addition of 100 mm maltose and 10 mm EDTA to the binding reaction, respectively. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were removed. The amount of unbound SP-D in the supernatant was determined by Western blot analysis. Selective carbohydrate binding was performed as described previously (30Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml mannan at 4 °C overnight, washed, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. BALF was incubated with increasing concentrations of maltose, glucose, galactose, or GlcNAc. Samples were subsequently added to the coated plate and incubated with rabbit anti-SP-D antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After washing, o-phenylenediamine was added to each well, and the A490 nm was measured. The concentration of sugar that inhibited 50% of SP-D binding to the mannan-coated plate was defined as the IC50. Bacterial Aggregation—Bacterial aggregation was assessed by measuring light transmission through a bacterial suspension after the addition of SP-D. Purified rSftpdCDM, mouse SP-D (150 nm based on the monomer molecular weight), or a control reaction that contained protein buffer without SP-D was mixed with 600 μlof Escherichia coli Y1088 (OD700 nm ∼ 1) grown the previous night and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline plus 5 mm CaCl2 (31Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E. White M.R. Colamussi M.L. Kakkanatt A. Tauber B. Shepherd V. Sastry K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L958-L969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OD700 nm was measured every 2.5 min, and all values were reported as relative to the absorbance at t = 0. The extent of aggregation was determined by the decrease in the optical density of the bacterial suspension. Calcium dependence was confirmed by the inhibition of aggregation in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. Lung Morphology—Lungs from 12-week old mice were fixed at 25 cm of water pressure with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and processed into paraffin blocks. Sections (5 μm) from each lobe were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry for SP-D was performed at dilutions of 1:200 by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated to murine SP-D. Immune complexes were detected using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Metalloproteinase Activity—Alveolar macrophages (5 × 105) were isolated by centrifuging BALF and cultured for 24 h in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). Proteinases in the conditioned media were assayed by zymography as described previously (32Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Phospholipid Analysis—Saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) was measured in homogenized lung tissue and BALF from 6-8-week-old mice (n = 6-8 mice for each genotype) as previously described (33Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Isolation of Large and Small Aggregate Sufactant—Large and small aggregate surfactant lipids were isolated from rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftpd+/+ mice (n = 6) as previously described (14Ikegami M. Na C.L. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288: L552-L561Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed five times with 1 ml of normal saline. BALF was centrifuged at 40,000 × g over a 0.8 m sucrose cushion for 15 min. Small aggregate surfactant was collected from the supernatant. Large aggregate surfactant was collected from the interface, diluted with normal saline, and centrifuged again at 40,000 × g for 15 min. The large aggregate pellet was dissolved in normal saline. An equal volume of each material was dried, diluted in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Ultrastructure of lipid aggregates was determined in pooled BALF samples (n = 5/pool) by electron microscopy from 6-8-week-old mice as previously described (14Ikegami M. Na C.L. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288: L552-L561Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, large and small aggregate surfactant was isolated from BALF; fixed with glutaraldehyde, paraformaldehyde, and CaCl2 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at 4 °C; and stained with osmium tetroxide, potassium ferrocyanide, and uranyl acetate. After dehydration, it was embedded in Embed812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and ultrathin sections (90 nm) were obtained. Random electron micrographs were taken, and ultrastructure was evaluated. Influenza A Virus—Experiments utilized influenza A virus strain H3N2 A/Phillipines/82 (IAV) and were performed as previously described (34Hartshorn K.L. Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L90-L98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IAV was grown in chorioallantoic fluid of 10-day-old embryonated hen eggs. Virus was purified and stored frozen in PBS until use. Six-week-old (n = 6-8) mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and inoculated intratracheally with 5 × 105 fluorescent foci in 80 μl of PBS. Quantitative IAV cultures were performed 3 days after inoculation. Lungs were removed and homogenized in 2 ml of PBS, and aliquots were frozen. IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ concentrations were determined by ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). IAV titers were determined by incubating lung homogenates with Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers for 7 h at 37°C. Monolayers were washed, fixed, and incubated with monoclonal antibody against IAV nucleoprotein followed by a rhodamine-labeled goat antimouse IgG. Fluorescent foci were counted, and the resulting viral titer was expressed as fluorescent foci/g lung weight. SP-D binding to IAV was monitored by hemagglutination inhibition assays (n = 3). Purified mouse SP-D and rSftpdCDM were compared. Sample protein was serially diluted in 96-well round bottom plates with IAV in PBS with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2. After incubating the protein/IAV mixture at room temperature for 10 min, fertilized chicken egg erythrocytes were added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 2 h. The minimal amount of SP-D or rSftpdCDM needed to fully inhibit agglutination was observed, and the number of hemagglutination units inhibited per pmol of SP-D or rSftpdCDM was reported. Data Analysis—Where appropriate, either a representative experiment from one mouse line was shown, or results from each line were averaged, and data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t tests. Transgenic Mouse Lines—rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftpd-/- transgenic mice were produced by nuclear injection of the rSftpdCDM gene into FVB/N mice and backcrossed to Sftpd-/- mice. The rat Sftpd gene is 92% identical (based on nucleotide and mature protein amino acid sequence) to the mouse Sftpd gene, and multiple studies indicate that mouse and rat SP-D have nearly identical properties. Four founder mice were identified using transgene-specific PCR on tail clip DNA. Germ line transmission was demonstrated in all four lines, and the transgene was inherited as an autosomal gene following Mendelian inheritance. Survival and breeding were not influenced by the rSftpdCDMTg+ transgene. Expression and secretion of transgenic protein rSftpdCDM was confirmed in all four mouse lines by Western blot analysis of mouse BALF using a rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antibody (data not shown). Two mouse lines with similar levels of rSftpdCDM protein expression were selected for further breeding and analysis. Experiments were done in parallel with both lines, and results were similar. Expression of rSftpdCDM Protein—As determined by ELISA assays, levels of SP-D in BALF from wild type mice were 1.2 μg/ml compared with rSftpdCDM levels of 11 μg/ml in rSftpdCDMTg+/Sftpd-/- mice. Rabbit anti-mouse SP-D antibody was used to detect SP-D and rSftpdCDM in BALF (Fig. 2). The monomeric form of the mutant protein migrated under reducing conditions at the predicted molecular mass of 22 kDa. rSftpdCDM migrated slightly slower than the 60-kDa standard under nonreducing conditions, indicating that the disulfide linkages normally observed between monomeric chains in the wild type N-terminal domain also formed in the mutant protein. To determine the ability of the rSftpdCDM to form high order complexes, the protein was analyzed by Sepharose column chromotography. Under these conditions, the majority of rSftpdCDM migrated between apoferritin and β-amylase (molecular masses of 443 and 200 kDa, respectively) at a position equaling 270 kDa, which is the molecular mass expected if adding the N-terminal domain to the CRD trimer promoted noncovalent interactions between four trimeric subunits (dodecamer). Smaller peaks were observed at the expected positions of molecules composed of 1, 2, 30, and more trimers, suggesting that the purified mutant protein consists of a heterogeneous population of multimers. Whereas the mutant protein effectively self-assembled to higher order structures, it did not form intermediate molecular weight heteropolymers of mutant and wild type protein when expressed in a wild type SP-D background (data not shown). RSftpdCDM Binds Carbohydrate—To compare the carbohydrate binding properties of wild type SP-D and rSftpdCDM, binding to maltosyl-Sepharose was evaluated (Fig. 3). Protein from both wild type and mutant BALF bound maltose. Binding was inhibited by the addition of EDTA, indicating that rSftpdCDM maintained calcium-dependent lectin activity. In addition, binding to maltosyl-Sepharose was reversed by the addition of free maltose, confirming the specificity of maltose interactions. The saccharide binding preference of SP-D and rSftpdCDM was assessed using BALF and inhibition of binding to yeast mannan by competing saccharides (Table 1). Under the conditions utilized, a higher binding affinity for the competing saccharide was indicated by a lower concentration of saccharide needed to disrupt protein-mannan interactions. Maltose was the preferred"

We show that expression of the C-terminal domain of human polycystin-1 (PKD1-CT) triggers spreading of isolated inner medullary collecting duct cells, a process mediated by Erk. As inner medullary collecting duct cells spread, PKD1-CT localizes to cell-extracellular matrix contacts, interacts with focal adhesion proteins Fak and paxillin, and stimulates Fak phosphorylation, paxillin phosphorylation, Fak-paxillin association, and formation of small focal complexes. PKD1-CT-mediated spreading requires membrane localization and the integrity of the C-terminal protein binding sites. We additionally show that Pkd1 null proximal tubule cells generated from Pkd1flox/-:TSLargeT mice by in vitro Cre recombinase transfection demonstrate diminished spreading when compared with Pkdflox/- heterozygous parental cells. These findings suggest that membrane-bound PC1 has a central role in regulating morphogenic protein signaling at cell-matrix interfaces in non-confluent cells.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADPKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PAX, paxillin.2The abbreviations used are: ADPKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PAX, paxillin. is one of the most common inherited monogenic disorders, occurring in ∼1 in 600-1000 live births. It is a systemic disorder characterized by the development of multiple renal cysts that arise along the proximal and distal tubules and collecting ducts. Large fluid-filled cysts develop and disrupt the normal architecture, leading to loss of kidney function. In Western countries, ADPKD accounts for 5-10% of end stage kidney failure (1Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). ADPKD is caused by mutations in the PKD1 gene (85% of families) (2Hughes J. Ward C.J. Peral B. Aspinwall R. Clark K. San Millan J.L. Gamble V. Harris P.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) or in the PKD2 gene (10-15% of families) (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), which encode the polycystin 1 (Pc-1) and 2 (Pc-2) proteins, respectively. Pc-1 is a membrane-spanning glycoprotein with a large N-terminal extracellular region, multiple transmembrane domains, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 226 amino acids that has been found to be the site of major signaling interactions via its coiled-coil domain and putative phosphorylation sites. Pc-2 is an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic N and C termini. Pc-1 and -2 are able to interact and can function together as a Ca2+ cation channel with ion selectivity similar to other transient receptor potential family members (4Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A.

Biol. 2001; 11: R356-R360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, the Pc-1/Pc-2 complex has been located in the primary cilium at the apical pole of the cell (6Yoder B.K. Hou X. Guay-Woodford L.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), where it may act as a mechanoreceptor (7Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar), and Pc-1 has been located at cell-cell junctions, where it could modulate adhesion of adjacent cells (8Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Bukanov N.O. Donohue L.C.

Typically, these subcellular localizations of polycystins require the cells to be grown to complete confluence and to become fully polarized (10Boletta A. Germino G.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 484-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Ong A.C. Wheatley D.N. Lancet. 2003; 361: 774-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In subconfluent cells, Pc-1 has been located at sites of cell-matrix interactions, where it associates with several focal adhesions proteins, such as integrins, vinculin, paxillin, and Fak (12Wilson P.D. Geng L. Li X. Burrow C.R. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1311-1323PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional role of Pc-1 at focal adhesions has yet to be fully elucidated. Currently, more than 50 proteins have been reported to be associated with focal contacts and related extracellular matrix adhesions, forming a dense, heterogeneous, and dynamic protein network at the cytoplasmic face of the adhesion site that regulates integrin adhesion, signaling, and the actin cytoskeleton (13Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion regulation and signaling ultimately control many cellular behaviors, including cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and proliferation (14Wozniak M.A. Modzelewska K. Kwong L. Keely P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). To study the role of Pc-1 at focal adhesions, we used murine inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells overexpressing a heterologous integral membrane protein fused to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Pc-1 (PKD1-CT). This approach has been used to show heterodimeric interaction between Pc-1 and Pc-2 and to delineate the role of the Pc-1 cytoplasmic domain in signaling through the Wnt (15Kim E. Arnould T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We report that expression of PKD1-CT triggers spreading in isolated IMCD cells plated on fibronectin in a MEK-dependent manner. We also show that during the initial phase of cell spreading, PKD1-CT localized at the cell membrane is necessary for regulating interactions of paxillin and Fak as well as activating Erk, paxillin, and Fak. The role of the endogenous protein in mediating normal cell spreading is addressed by experiments demonstrating decreased spreading in PKD1 null cells. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Experiments were conducted using immortalized mIMCD-3 cells of ureteric bud origin (referred to as IMCD cells) (17Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High efficiency retroviral transfer of CD16-, CD7-, and PKD1-containing plasmids has been described (18Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CD16.7 denotes the extracellular domain of CD16 and the transmembrane domain of CD7; PKD1-CT denotes the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human polycystin-1 (amino acids 4077-4302). The C-terminal domain of PKD1 was expressed as a CD16.7 fusion protein (referred to as CD16.7-PKD1). These cells represent a mixture of thousands of individual cells that originally were stably transduced with the retrovirus rather than an individual clone of cells. In a subset of experiments, we used a patient-derived truncation mutation of the cytoplasmic domain of Pc-1, lacking amino acids 4077-4227 (CD16.7-R4227X). The same technique was used to generate IMCD cells expressing the FLAG epitope (F-) or FLAG fused to the N terminus of amino acids 4077-4227 of PKD1 (F-PKD1). Anti-phospho-p42/44 and p42/44 MAPK antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling; anti-phospho-Pkcα and antiphospho-397 Fak (α-p-FAK) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology; and anti-Fak was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-paxillin was from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-GAPDH was from Chemicon. Polyclonal anti-phospho-paxillin antibody (p-S83) was generated as described previously (19Ishibe S. Joly D. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Anti-BD3, directed against the C terminus of polycystin 1, was a kind gift of Dr Oxana Ibraghimov (Genzyme Corp.) (20Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Dackowski W.R. Foggensteiner L. Coleman N. Thiru S. Petry L.R. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Van Raay T. Bradley J. Qian F. Onuchic L.F. Watnick T.J. Piontek K. Hakim R.M. Landes G.M. Germino G.G. Sandford R. Klinger K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Immunocytochemistry—Quiescent cells were detached with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed three times with PBS, resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium, and plated on fibronectin (20 μg/ml)-coated coverslips for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and permeabilized with -20 °C methanol. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum in PBS, immunostaining was performed with anti-BD3 (4 °C overnight, 1:500), anti-paxillin (1 h at room temperature, 1:1000), or anti-Fak (30 min at room temperature, 1:100), and cells were probed at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was included in the mounting medium as a counterstain (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent signals were visualized and acquired using a Zeiss epifluorescence confocal microscope. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Quiescent cells were detached with cell dissociation buffer, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium; cells were then either kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin (20 μg/ml)-coated tissue culture dishes for the indicated times (15-60 min) and washed gently to remove non-adherent cells. For Erk and Pkcα inhibition, cells were preincubated for 20 min with the MEK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm, Promega) or the Pkcα inhibitor Gö6976 (100 μm). In a subset of experiments, 70-80% confluent cells were made quiescent by serum starvation overnight directly followed by stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, 40 ng/ml) for the indicated times. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.16 m NaCl, 20 mm Trizma (Tris base), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The protein content was determined using the Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (0.16 m NaCl, 20 mm Trizma base, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and 1 mg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated by the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C, collected by adding the appropriate Sepharose-coupled protein, and washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To compare individual conditions, the level of phosphorylation of the protein in question was quantitated by density scanning using NIH Image software and normalized to an internal control (either the non-phosphorylated protein or GAPDH), and the maximal signal detected was arbitrarily defined as 100% phosphorylation. Statistical significance (mean ± S.D.) was determined using the Student's t test. Cell Spreading Assay—Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to harvesting with cell dissociation buffer, washed three times with PBS, plated on fibronectin (20 μg/ml)-coated coverslips ± HGF (40 ng/ml), and left to adhere and spread for 1 or 3 h. Spreading of individual cells was quantitated after imaging by using the PhotoShop 7 software to determine the individual surface area (in square pixels) of 200 different single cells per condition. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical significance (mean ± S.D.) was determined using the Student's t test. PKD1 Null Cells—For some experiments, PKD1 null cells isolated from the proximal tubule were used to assess cell spreading. Microscopically dissected and then dissociated proximal tubules from Pkd1flox/-:TSLargeT (ImmortoMouse) mice were cultured under permissive conditions (33 °C with γ-interferon) and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were evaluated at full confluency under non-permissive conditions (37 °C, no γ-interferon for >7 days) for epithelial properties including tight junction formation (ZO1), E-cadherin and β-catenin expression, primary cilia formation, and expression of the proximal tubule marker NHE3, and only clones meeting these criteria were utilized. Parental Pkdflox/- cell clones showing epithelial properties were then transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase and cloned again by limiting dilution, giving rise to daughter cells that either expressed Cre and therefore had undergone transformation to Pkd-/- or that had not expressed Cre and retained the parental Pkdflox/- genotype. To minimize the chance that differences in cell responses could be due to derivation from different original cells, the present experiments were performed using Pkd-/- clones PN18 and PN24 and Pkdflox/- clones PH2 and PH3, all of which were derived from the same original parental Pkdflox/- clone. The epithelial properties of the newly derived cell clones were evaluated, and they were found to have robust lateral localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin and formation of tight junctions and cilia (data not shown). Expression of the Membrane-anchored C-terminal Cytoplasmic Domain of Polycystin-1 Stimulates Spreading of IMCD Cells—To examine the role of polycystin signaling in regulating cell-matrix interactions, IMCD cells overexpressing the membrane-anchored PKD1-CT were utilized. This construct has been shown to mediate interactions with Pc-2 (21Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Tsiokas L. Cohen H.T. Kim E. Walz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3423-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and has been used previously in our laboratory to show that Pc-1 stimulates in vitro branching tubulogenesis in three-dimensional gels (18Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), consistent with findings seen following expression of full-length Pc-1 (22Boletta A. Qian F. Onuchic L.F. Bhunia A.K. Phakdeekitcharoen B. Hanaoka K. Guggino W. Monaco L. Germino G.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1267-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To specifically focus on Pc-1 function at the cell-matrix interface, IMCD cells expressing either the cytoplasmic tail of polycystin-1 (CD16.7-PKD1) or the control construct (CD16.7) were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes at single cell density. Under these conditions, neither intercellular junctions nor primary cilia would be expected to form. To determine whether PKD1-CT has a potential role in regulating signaling at cell-matrix interaction sites, we assessed individual cell spreading (see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression of the cytoplasmic tail of Pc-1 stimulates cell spreading of quiescent IMCD cells at both 60 and 180 min (Fig. 1). Stimulation of the cells with HGF, a well known stimulant of epithelial renal cell spreading (23Liu Z.X. Yu C.F. Nickel C. Thomas S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10452-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), demonstrated that both cell types were able to reach equivalent levels of maximal spreading at 180 min. These results demonstrate that expression of PKD1-CT is able to accelerate IMCD cell spreading on fibronectin. PKD1-CT Transiently Colocalizes with Focal Adhesion Proteins Fak and Paxillin—Cell spreading requires the dissolution of existing focal adhesions and the formation of new focal adhesions at the leading edge of the lamellipodia, a process known as focal adhesion turnover. Focal adhesion turnover requires the recruitment of activated Fak to focal adhesions, a process that is at least partially mediated by the interaction of Fak with the scaffolding protein paxillin (24Ishibe S.

To determine whether PKD1-CT-induced spreading could be mediated by interactions with focal adhesion proteins, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cells plated on fibronectin for 60 min. These experiments revealed association of PKD1-CT with both Fak and paxillin in Triton X-100 cell lysates. This interaction was not supported under the harsher conditions of a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (Fig. 2A), suggesting that it might be an indirect interaction. To determine whether the PKD-CT localized at sites of newly forming focal contacts, immunocytochemistry was performed on cells plated for 30 min, and the localization of the C terminus of Pc-1 was visualized using confocal microscopy. PKD1-CT-overexpressing IMCD cells stained with anti-BD3 antibody (specific for the C terminus of PKD1) indicate that PKD1-CT localized to discrete peripheral structures of isolated spreading cells (Fig. 2B). A similar staining pattern was observed in untransfected cells when the confocal signal intensity was increased sufficiently, suggesting that at least a fraction of endogenous polycystin 1 distributes in a similar subcellular localization. Confocal examination of cells immunostained with BD3 as well as anti-paxillin demonstrates that PKD1-CT colocalizes with paxillin at sites of newly forming focal contacts during the early stages of cell spreading (Fig. 2C, 30′). These results are in agreement with those published by Wilson et al. (12Wilson P.D. Geng L. Li X. Burrow C.R. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1311-1323PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that endogenous Pc-1 can colocalize with α2β1-integrin and the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin at sites of cell-matrix focal contacts. In the present work, we failed to detect PKD1-paxillin interaction or colocalization at focal adhesions after cells were maximally spread (Fig. 2C, 180′), suggesting that PKD1-CT may interact with focal adhesion proteins selectively during the initial stages of focal contact formation when focal adhesion turnover is required but not with the more mature focal adhesion complex seen in stable focal adhesions. Focal contact formation and dissolution allows cells to alter their attachment to the basement membrane and thus promotes cell morphogenesis and migration, events that occur in vivo during renal tubule development and in the early phase of repair after tubular injury. During tubulogenesis and tubule repair, cell confluency can range from individual cells to cell sheets, with the cells exhibiting a flattened phenotype due to the large proportion of the surface area that is in contact with the underlying matrix. As tubules mature, cell density increases, and the cells become more vertically oriented with a lesser amount of cell-matrix interactions and the formation of extensive cell-cell adherens junctions at the lateral borders. These fully confluent, differentiated cells develop an apical brush border and primary cilium. The present results suggest that under the less confluent, less differentiated conditions of the immature or injured tubule, PKD1 can localize to focal contacts rather than primary cilia and thus may play a role in the regulation of cell morphogenesis. The fate of the PKD1-CT construct in maximally spread, non-confluent cells remains to be determined. By careful confocal microscopy examination, no CD16-stained subcellular cluster could be detected other than within the endoplasmic reticulum. In CD16.7-PKD1 cells plated on fibronectin for more than 12 h, we observed a fibrillar CD16 staining pattern (not shown), which was very similar to the one reported by Xu et al. (26Xu G.M. Sikaneta T. Sullivan B.M. Zhang Q. Andreucci M. Stehle T. Drummond I. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46544-46552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in a work where the same construct was reported to interact with the intermediate filament network. The functional significance of PKD1-CT translocating from focal adhesions to other subcellular structures such as the intermediate filament network remains to be elucidated. Spreading Induced by PKD1-CT Is Mediated by Erk—To further delineate the mechanisms involved in PKD1-CT-induced spreading, we focused on two signaling pathways previously studied in our laboratory: Erk1/2 MAP kinase, which has been determined as an important pathway for regulating focal adhesion turnover (23Liu Z.X. Yu C.F. Nickel C. Thomas S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10452-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and Pkc, which was shown to be activated by PKD1-CT (16Arnould T. Kim E. Tsiokas L. Jochimsen F. Gruning W. Chang J.D. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and to regulate PKD1-CT-induced branching morphogenesis (18Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Untransfected quiescent IMCD cells or control cells overexpressing CD16.7 were plated on fibronectin for 15, 30, and 60 min, resulting in a weak and transient Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells overexpressing CD16.7-PKD1 displayed an enhanced anchorage-dependent Erk activation at 15, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 3A, and quantitated in Fig. 3B). In these three cell lines, significant and comparable Pkcα phosphorylation could be detected in suspension, with no modification during the first hour after plating. To study the functional role of Erk and Pkcα pathways during PKD1-CT-induced cell spreading, we used the MEK-specific inhibitor UO126 to prevent Erk activation and Gö6976 for Pkc inhibition. UO126 and Gö6976 efficiently abrogated Erk1/2 and Pkcα phosphorylation, respectively, in control and PKD1-CT-overexpressing cells plated for 15 min (Fig. 3C). Neither inhibitor had a significant effect on control cell spreading at 1 h, whereas PKD1-CT-induced spreading was inhibited by U0126 but not by Gö6976 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that Pc-1 expression up-regulates anchorage-dependent Erk activation and that signaling by this pathway is required for Pc-1-mediated cell spreading. Anchorage-dependent Erk activation has been found to be mediated, at least in part, by integrin-dependent Fak and p21-associated kinase (Pak) activation followed by Pak-mediated Mek-Erk association (27Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 28Eblen S.T. Slack-Davis J.K. Tarcsafalvi A. Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2308-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Erk-MAPK pathway can be activated by growth factor-dependent recruitment of Grb2-Sos to the membrane followed by Ras activation. To begin to define the mechanism of Erk activation in PKD1-CT-expressing cells, we examined the activation of both the Erk-MAPK and the Pkc pathways in stably adherent cells following growth factor stimulation with HGF. In contrast to the increase in anchorage-dependent Erk activation demonstrated in Fig. 3A, stably adherent CD16.7-PKD1-expressing cells displayed a basal and HGF-stimulated level of Erk activation that was indistinguishable from the control cells (Fig. 3E, and quantitated in Fig. 3F). As reported previously, Pkcα phosphorylation was more pronounced in CD16.7-PKD1 cells (18Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the enhanced Erk activation seen in newly plated PKD1-CT-overexpressing cells appears to be specifically dependent on signaling pathways that are transiently activated during the initial stages of cell spreading, supporting a role for integrin-dependent MAPK activation in this process. As opposed to the Erk-dependent cell spreading shown here, PKD1-CT overexpression has been reported to stimulate other morphogenic events, such as haptotactic migration and branching morphogenesis, in a largely Erk-independent and Pkcα-dependent manner (18Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on our current studies, it is possible that transient localization of PKD1-CT to newly forming focal contacts stimulates Erk-dependent cell spreading, whereas different subcellular localization in stably adherent cells may result in distinct interacting partners and thus promote directed migration and branching tubulogenesis that are dependent on alternate signaling pathways. PKD1-CT Stimulates Fak and Paxillin Phosphorylation, Fak-Paxillin Association, and Small Focal Complex Formation—Previous studies have shown that recruitment of paxillin and Fak to focal adhesions is critical for cell spreading, independent of their role in cell adhesion (29Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). This process requires Fak and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and Fak activation (30Burridge K.

Commun. 2001; 285: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that both growth factor-dependent and cell adhesion-dependent cell spreading are accelerated in the setting of Erk-MAPK pathway activation (24Ishibe S. Joly D. Zhu X. Cantley L.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and that this effect of MAPK activation involves Erk-dependent paxillin phosphorylation on serine 83 and subsequent recruitment and activation of Fak signaling (19Ishibe S.

https://openalex.org/W2017906821,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a 38-kDa secreted protein, a prototypic member of the CCN family, which is up-regulated in many diseases, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and diabetic nephropathy. We previously showed that CTGF can cause actin disassembly with concurrent down-regulation of the small GTPase Rho A and proposed an integrated signaling network connecting focal adhesion dissolution and actin disassembly with cell polarization and migration. Here, we further delineate the role of CTGF in cell migration and actin disassembly in human mesangial cells, a primary target in the development of renal glomerulosclerosis. The functional response of mesangial cells to treatment with CTGF was associated with the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and resultant phosphorylation of a number of Akt/PKB substrates. Two of these substrates were identified as FKHR and p27(Kip-1). CTGF stimulated the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of p27(Kip-1) on serine 10. Addition of the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 abrogated this response; moreover, addition of the Akt/PKB inhibitor interleukin (IL)-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2(R)-2-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate prevented p27(Kip-1) phosphorylation in response to CTGF. Immunocytochemistry revealed that serine 10 phosphorylated p27(Kip-1) colocalized with the ends of actin filaments in cells treated with CTGF. Further investigation of other Akt/PKB sites on p27(Kip-1), revealed that phosphorylation on threonine 157 was necessary for CTGF mediated p27(Kip-1) cytoplasmic localization; mutation of the threonine 157 site prevented cytoplasmic localization, protected against actin disassembly and inhibited cell migration. CTGF also stimulated an increased association between Rho A and p27(Kip-1). Interestingly, this resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of LIM kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of cofilin, suggesting that CTGF mediated p27(Kip-1) activation results in uncoupling of the Rho A/LIM kinase/cofilin pathway. Confirming the central role of Akt/PKB, CTGF-stimulated actin depolymerization only in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to Akt-1/3 (PKB alpha/gamma) knockout MEFs. These data reveal important mechanistic insights into how CTGF may contribute to mesangial cell dysfunction in the diabetic milieu and sheds new light on the proposed role of p27(Kip-1) as a mediator of actin rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1967903500,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) constitute important signaling molecules in the central nervous system. They regulate a number of different functions both under physiological conditions and under pathological conditions. Here we tested the hypothesis that in the immature hippocampus ATP, the most diffuse neurotransmitter in the brain, modulates synaptic transmission via ROS. We show that ATP, acting on metabotropic P2Y1 receptors, increased the frequency of GABAA-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents (SPSCs) in CA3 principal cells, an effect that was prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine or by catalase, an enzyme that breaks down H2O2. The effect of ATP on SPSCs was mimicked by H2O2 or by the pro-oxidant, Fe2+, which, through the Fentol reaction, catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. MRS-2179, a P2Y1 receptor antagonist, removed the facilitatory action of Fe2+ on SPSCs, suggesting that endogenous ATP acting on P2Y1 receptors is involved in Fe2+-induced modulation of synaptic transmission. Imaging ROS with the H2O2-sensitive dye DCF revealed that ATP induces generation of peroxide in astrocytes via activation of P2Y1 receptors coupled to intracellular calcium rise. Neither N-acetyl-cysteine nor catalase prevented Ca2+ transients induced by ATP in astrocytes.

Growing evidence suggests that, in physiological conditions, ROS regulate neuronal signaling both in the central and in the peripheral nervous system. Although at the periphery, ROS contribute to the inhibitory effect of ATP on quantal acetylcholine release from motor nerve endings (5Giniatullin A.R. Grishin S.N. Sharifullina E.R. Petrov A.M. Zefirov A.L. Giniatullin R.A. J. Physiol.

In pathological conditions, increased amounts of ROS are involved in apoptosis and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease (3Duchen M.R. Mol.

In the nervous system, ROS are produced mainly by microglia (11Eder C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 81: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and by astrocytes (10Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J.

Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In cultured astrocytes, activation of metabotropic P2Y receptors by extracellular ATP induces ROS via membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (10Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J. Wientjes F. Hothersall J. Canevari L.

However, it is unclear whether a similar mechanism also occurs in situ and whether ATP-induced ROS production in astrocytes can reach target neurons and affect synaptic transmission. In the present study, electrophysiological and imaging techniques were combined to investigate ROS effects on GABAergic transmission in principal cells on acute hippocampal slices from newborn rats. Early in postnatal life, spontaneous activity in the hippocampus is characterized by network-driven membrane potential oscillations, the so-called giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs (13Ben-Ari Y. Cherubini E. Corradetti R. Gaiarsa J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 416: 303-325Crossref Scopus (1090) Google Scholar)), and spontaneous ongoing postsynaptic potentials (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both types of activity are required for proper wiring of developing circuits (15Kasyanov A.M. Safiulina V.F. Voronin L.L. Cherubini E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3967-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). During this period, ROS signaling should be more pronounced because of the relative deficiency of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (16Buonocore G. Perrone S. Bracci R. Biol. Neonate. 2001; 9: 180-186Google Scholar), known as powerful scavengers of ROS. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that GDPs and GABAA-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic potentials are modulated by ATP, which is endogenously released during neuronal activity (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since ATP may induce ROS production in glial cells (12Murakami K. Nakamura Y. Yoneda Y. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is important to test whether ROS induction is involved in the action of ATP. We found that ATP, via metabotropic P2Y1 receptor, excites astrocytes and induces the release of diffusible ROS, which in turn facilitate GABA release onto CA3 pyramidal cells in the immature hippocampus. Slice Preparation—Experiments were performed on hippocampal slices obtained from postnatal day 1 (P1)–P6 Wistar rats as described (17Maggi L. Sher E. Cherubini E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 89-100Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were decapitated after being anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (2 g/kg). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Community Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609EEC) and were approved by local authority veterinary service. The brain was removed from the skull and placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 130 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm glucose and then saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.3–7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (500 μm thick) were cut with a vibratome and stored at room temperature in a holding bath containing the same solution as above. After a recovery period of at least 1 h, an individual slice was transferred to the recording chamber, where it was continuously superfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2–3 ml/min at 33–34 °C. Electrophysiological Recordings—Electrophysiological experiments were performed from CA3 pyramidal cells using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique in voltage clamp mode. Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hingelberg, Malsfeld, Germany). They had a resistance of 5–7 megaohms when filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 NaCl, 1 EGTA, 2 HEPES, and 2 K2ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. Recordings were made with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 1D; Axon Instruments). The whole-cell capacitance was fully compensated, and the series resistance (10–20 megaohms) was compensated at 75–80%. The stability of the patch was checked by repetitively monitoring the input and series resistance during the experiment. Substances and drugs used were ATP and DPCPX (purchased from Tocris Cookson; Bristol, UK) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), iron sulfate heptahydrate, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), catalase, and H2O2 (purchased from Sigma, Milan, Italy). Solutions of NAC and Fe2+ were prepared immediately before use. All drugs were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid; DNQX was dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO in the bathing solution was 0.1%. At this concentration, Me2SO alone did not modify the shape or the kinetics of synaptic currents. Drugs were applied in the bath via a three-way tap system, by changing the superfusion solution to one differing only in its content of drug(s). The ratio of flow rate to bath volume ensured complete exchange within 1.5–2 min. Analysis of Electrophysiological Data—Data were stored on magnetic tape and transferred to a computer after digitization with an A/D converter (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz. Acquisition and analysis were performed with Clampex 7 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The analysis of SPSCs was performed with the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft Inc., Decatur, GA). General principles and details on the analysis of synaptic currents can be found elsewhere (18Poisbeau P. Rene F. Egles C. Felix J.M. Feltz P. Schlichter R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of spontaneous synaptic currents was performed on sequences with at least 100 events each. Signals were repeatedly averaged for at least 15 min before infusion of agonists or antagonists to ensure stable baseline conditions. Spontaneous events were detected using amplitude thresholds set as a multiple (4–5 times) of the standard deviation of the noise. The cumulative amplitude and interevent plots obtained for cells in control and after drug application were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Values are given as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences was assessed by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney test. The significance level is p < 0.05. Imaging of Calcium and ROS—Hippocampal slices were incubated for 1 h in continuously oxygenated ACSF containing 30 μm of the cell-permeable H2O2-selective fluorescent dye carboxy-2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF, Molecular probes, Eugene, OR). After cleavage by cell esterases and oxidation, this probe was monitored using excitation sources and filters appropriate for fluorescein. Cells were imaged with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 laser scanning confocal microscope using the 488-nm laser line. Emitted green fluorescence was collected through a 520 long-pass filter. Bio-Rad software was used for image acquisition. Some of the major artifacts when DCF is used are photo-oxidation and photo-damage (19Arbogast S. Reid M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R698-R705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To prevent these artifacts (see also Ref. 20Peng T.I. Jou M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1011 (–112): 112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we used multiphoton excitation of DCF with Mai-Tai pulsed infrared laser (Spectra Physics). Excitation wavelength was set to 800 nm, and emission was collected through the same long-pass filter as in the single-photon confocal imaging mode. Another artifact that is not often taken into account in long-lasting experiments is leakage of the dye from cells (21Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Therefore, we kept the dye constantly present in bath solution at the same concentration as that used during incubation. Prior to Ca2+ imaging experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h in oxygenated ACSF containing 4 μm fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes). An additional period of 30 min was allowed for de-esterification of the dye. Under these incubation conditions, astrocytes were loaded preferentially, whereas the dye uptake by neurons was minimal (22Stosiek C. Garaschuk O. Holthoff K. Konnerth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 23Hirase H. Qian L. Bartho P. Buzsaki G. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E96Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Images were acquired every 5 s using the same filters as indicated above. Fluorescence intensity in background-subtracted frame averages was normalized and presented as (ΔF/F) = [(intensity-basal)/(basal)]*100%. The Antioxidant NAC Prevents the Facilitatory Action of ATP on GABAergic Transmission—During the first postnatal week, whole-cell recordings from CA3 pyramidal neurons revealed two types of spontaneous activity: GDPs and SPSCs. Although GDPs are network-driven events generated by the synergistic action of glutamate and GABA (13Ben-Ari Y. Cherubini E. Corradetti R. Gaiarsa J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 416: 303-325Crossref Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), SPSCs are almost exclusively driven by GABA released from GABAergic terminals since they were unaffected by DNQX (20 μm) and completely blocked by GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline or picrotoxin (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Hosokawa Y. Sciancalepore M. Stratta F. Martina M. Cherubini E. Eur. J. Neurosi. 1994; 6: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A, B, and E, bath application of ATP (50 μm) in the presence of the adenosine receptor antagonist DPCPX (10 μm) to prevent the activation of adenosine receptors (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Giniatullin R. Cherubini E. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) increased the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (SPSCs) from 4.8 ± 1.0 to 9.4 ± 0.4 Hz (n = 6, p < 0.01). ATP application did not affect the amplitude of SPSCs (the peak amplitude was 32.8 ± 7.9 and 29.9 ± 6.8 pA before and during ATP application, respectively; n = 6, p > 0.05; Fig. 1F). Moreover, the potentiating effect of ATP was prevented by the P2Y1-selective antagonist MRS-2179 (10 μm, see Fig. 4 of Ref. 14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that it was mediated by metabotropic P2Y1 receptors. To test whether the potentiating effect of ATP on GABAergic SPSCs was mediated by ROS, we used the antioxidant NAC, which is a widely used ROS scavenger (5Giniatullin A.R. Grishin S.N. Sharifullina E.R. Petrov A.M. Zefirov A.L. Giniatullin R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 229-242Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ferrari G. Yan C.Y. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of ATP on SPSCs was prevented by NAC (Fig. 1, C, D, and E). In the presence of NAC (100 μm), ATP failed to increase the frequency of SPSC (the frequency was 5.1 ± 1.1 and 5.9 ± 1 Hz before and during ATP, respectively, p > 0.05, n = 6). NAC per se did not significantly modify the frequency (this was 5.8 ± 1.2 and 5.1 ± 1.1 Hz, before and during NAC, respectively, n = 6; p > 0.05) or the amplitude of SPSCs (this was 16.7 ± 3.6 and 14.8 ± 3.2 pA before and during superfusion of NAC, respectively; p > 0.05). Similar results were obtained with NAC (1 mm, data not shown). Consistent with the data obtained with NAC, catalase, an enzyme known to specifically break down H2O2 (28Gilgun-Sherki Y. Rosenbaum Z. Melamed E. Offen D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 29Dringen R. Pawlowski P.G. Hirrlinger J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), prevented the potentiating action of ATP on SPSCs (Fig. 2). Thus, in the presence of catalase (1200 units/ml), the frequency or amplitude of SPSCs was not modified by ATP (50 μm; the frequency of SPSCs was 6.3 ± 1.3 and 7.5 ± 1.7 Hz in the absence or presence of ATP, respectively; n = 7; p > 0.05, whereas the amplitude was 21.7 ± 4.8 and 26.2 ± 6.1 pA in the absence or presence of ATP, respectively; n = 7; p > 0.5). Altogether, these results suggest that the action of ATP on spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents is mediated by reactive oxygen species. H2O2 Mimics the Potentiating Effects of ATP on Spontaneous GABAergic Events—To further explore the involvement of ROS in ATP action, we tested the effect of exogenous H2O2, a cell-permeant form of ROS, on SPSCs. Similarly to ATP, a low concentration of H2O2 (30 μm) enhanced the frequency of SPSCs from 4.0 ± 0.6 to 5.8 ± 0.8 Hz (n = 5, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and C) without significantly altering their amplitude (on average, the peak amplitude of SPSCs was 39.6 ± 8.3 and 44.8 ± 11.8 pA before and during H2O2, respectively (p > 0.05; Fig. 3D). The effects of H2O2 on SPSCs were prevented by NAC (1 mm; the frequency of SPSCs was 4.2 ± 0.6 and 4.6 ± 0.6 Hz in NAC and in the presence of NAC plus H2O2, respectively; n = 6; p > 0.05; Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that they were mediated via ROS (30Giniatullin A.R. Giniatullin R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 283-293Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Endogenously Released ATP Affects Synaptic Release of GABA from GABAergic Interneurons—It is known that, in the presence of Fe2+, H2O2 is readily converted via the Fenton reaction into the hydroxyl radical (OH•), which is the strongest oxidant among other ROS (31Winterbourn C.C. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1995; 82: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In this set of experiments, we tested whether Fe2+ can enhance synaptic activity via endogenous ROS. Fe2+ in a relatively low concentration (10 μm) increased the frequency of SPSCs from 6.0 ± 0.7 to 8.7 ± 1.0 Hz (n = 7; p < 0.05; Fig. 4, B and C). Iron did not change the amplitude of SPSCs (the peak amplitude of synaptic currents was 35.8 ± 9.5 and 32.9 ± 9.5 pA before and during application of Fe2+, respectively; p > 0.05 (Fig. 4C)). The potentiating effect of iron on SPSCs was prevented by NAC (1 mm), indicating that it was mediated by ROS (Fig. 4, A and C). Thus, the frequency of SPSCs was 7.9 ± 0.9 and 8.6 ± 1.0 Hz in the presence of NAC and NAC plus iron, respectively (n = 6; p > 0.05), whereas the amplitude was 13.4 ± 3.6 and 13.8 ± 3.8 in the presence of NAC and NAC plus iron, respectively (n = 6; p > 0.05). To test whether Fe2+-induced enhancement of synaptic activity was mediated by endogenously released ATP, we tried to antagonize the effect of Fe2+ with the selective P2Y1 receptor blocker MRS-2179. Indeed, MRS-2179 at the concentration of 10 μm, which per se did not significantly modify the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), strongly antagonized the facilitatory action of Fe2+ on spontaneous GABAA-mediated synaptic currents (Fig. 4, B and C). The frequency of SPSCs was 9.5 ± 0.8 and 6.9 ± 0.9 Hz in the presence of Fe2+ and Fe2+ plus MRS-2179, respectively, whereas the amplitude was 45.5 ± 16.2 and 39.5 ± 11.1 pA in the presence of Fe2+ and Fe2+ plus MRS-2179, respectively. These data indicate that endogenous ATP acting on P2Y1 receptors is involved in iron-induced modulation of synaptic transmission. Ca2+ Imaging in Astrocytes and the Action of NAC—The increase in intracellular calcium in astrocytes has been shown to be an important step in the generation of ROS via NADPH oxidase (10Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J. Wientjes F. Hothersall J. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9176-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Previous experiments from acute hippocampal slices obtained from adult rats have revealed calcium transients in astrocytes following activation of P2Y1 receptors (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura M. Gachet C. Inoue K. Kato F. J. Neurosi. 2004; 24: 10835-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether, in immature hippocampal slices, ATP was able to induce calcium transients in astrocytes, slices were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye fluo-4AM. Consistent with previous studies (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura M. Gachet C. Inoue K. Kato F. J. Neurosi. 2004; 24: 10835-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), application of ATP (100 μm) elicited large Ca2+ transients in astrocytes (Fig. 5A; for astrocyte identification, see the section below). ATP-induced calcium transients were blocked by MRS-2179 (50 μm; Fig. 5, A and D), indicating that they were mediated by P2Y1 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, the application of NAC at the same concentration used to prevent the effects of ATP on SPSCs (1 mm) did not modify ATP-induced Ca2+ responses (Fig. 5, B and D). Similarly, catalase (2000 units/ml) failed to modify ATP-induced Ca2+ transients in astrocytes (Fig. 5, C and D). These data indicate that the blocking effect of NAC or catalase on GABAergic synaptic transmission occurs downstream of P2Y1 receptor-mediated Ca2+ rise. ROS Imaging—The above mentioned experiments clearly indicated that ATP is able to induce calcium transient in astrocytes via P2Y1 receptors. To directly test whether ATP triggers ROS generation in astrocytes, we performed imaging of ROS in brain slices using the fluorescent dye DCF (5Giniatullin A.R. Grishin S.N. Sharifullina E.R. Petrov A.M. Zefirov A.L. Giniatullin R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 229-242Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J. Wientjes F. Hothersall J. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9176-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In the CA3 stratum radiatum region of newborn rat hippocampal slices, bath application of ATP (100 μm) produced a fast and reversible increase in the DCF fluorescent signal of identified astrocytes but not in adjacent interneurons or pyramidal cells (Fig. 6, A, C, and D). Astrocytes were identified on the basis of the lack of action potential generation in response to depolarizing current pulses (Fig. 6B) and on the basis of their morphology (33Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To calibrate the ATP-induced increase in the DCF fluorescence, H2O2 (100 μm) was applied at the end of the experiments. As shown in Fig. 6D, H2O2 induced an increase in DCF fluorescence similar to that produced by ATP. These data confirm that in immature hippocampal slices, astrocytes are the primary source of ATP-induced free oxygen radicals. The main finding of the present study is that in the immature hippocampus, ATP, a widely distributed transmitter and neuromodulator, controls GABA release onto CA3 principal cells via induction of ROS. Imaging experiments with the selective ROS-sensitive dye DCF have clearly demonstrated that ROS are produced by glial cells following activation of P2Y1 receptors by ATP. Thus, purinergic modulation of synaptic transmission in the brain involves cross-talk between glia and neurons mediated by ROS acting as diffusible messengers. ROS Are Involved in ATP-induced Modulation of GABAergic Transmission—During the first postnatal week, when associative commissural fibers are still poorly developed (34Tyzio R. Represa A. Jorquera I. Ben-Ari Y. Gozlan H. Aniksztejn L. J. Neurosi. 1999; 19: 10372-10382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hennou S. Khalilov I. Diabira D. Ben-Ari Y. Gozlan H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), CA3 pyramidal cells receive a strong GABAergic innervation from the mossy fibers and GABAergic interneurons (36Safiulina V.F. Fattorini G. Conti F. Cherubini E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, during this period, spontaneous synaptic activity recorded from CA3 principal cells is mediated mainly by GABA acting on GABAA receptors, as demonstrated by the observation that in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonists, spontaneous glutamatergic events are merely detectable (24Hosokawa Y. Sciancalepore M. Stratta F. Martina M. Cherubini E. Eur. J. Neurosi. 1994; 6: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In previous work, we have demonstrated that either endogenously released or exogenously applied ATP, via the activation of metabotropic P2Y1 receptors, exerts a powerful excitatory action on spontaneous GABAA-mediated synaptic events (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present data provide evidence that ATP-induced increase in GABA release is mediated by ROS because: (i) the effect of ATP was prevented by NAC, a precursor of the most efficient endogenous antioxidant glutathione (27Ferrari G. Yan C.Y. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the potentiating effect of ATP was abolished by catalase, an enzyme that specifically breaks down H2O2 (28Gilgun-Sherki Y. Rosenbaum Z. Melamed E. Offen D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 29Dringen R. Pawlowski P.G. Hirrlinger J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); (iii) the effect of ATP on GABA release was mimicked by low concentrations of H2O2, a mild oxidant that, unlike other ROS, is relatively stable and capable of diffusing at relatively long distances (4Adam-Vizi V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar); and (iv) a similar facilitatory effect was produced by the pro-oxidant Fe2+, which, via the Fenton reaction, catalyzes the transformation of H2O2 into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (31Winterbourn C.C. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1995; 82: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In addition, imaging experiments with a selective ROS-sensitive dye have provided direct evidence that ROS production is triggered by ATP via activation of P2Y1 receptors. However, the present experiments do not allow excluding the possibility that other radicals are involved in ATP action on synaptic transmission. It has been recently demonstrated that ATP can induce in astrocytes the production of nitric oxide (37Li N. Sul J.Y. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10302-10310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may interact with ROS (38Warner D.S. Sheng H. Batinic-Haberle I. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 3221-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thus, nitric oxide, either alone or in cooperation with superoxide (to produce highly aggressive ONOO– (28Gilgun-Sherki Y. Rosenbaum Z. Melamed E. Offen D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 39Wang J.Y. Shum A.Y. Ho Y.J. Wang J.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 72: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)), can control GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus. Altogether, our data reveal that, in the immature hippocampus, ATP controls the local network through ROS production. Endogenous ATP Contributes to ROS Generation—ATP is the most ubiquitous molecule stored at high concentrations (mm range) in synaptic vesicles from which it can be released in an activity-dependent manner (40Edwards F.A. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Nature. 1992; 359: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 41Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 42Fabbro A. Skorinkin A. Grandolfo M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 505-517Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that, in the immature hippocampus, synchronized network activity such as GDPs enhances the level of endogenous ATP, which in turn regulates GDP induction (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Endogenous ATP can also be released in a Ca2+-dependent way from astrocytes (Fig. 7), which abundantly express purinergic receptors (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura M. Gachet C. Inoue K. Kato F. J. Neurosi. 2004; 24: 10835-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 43Haydon P.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 44Pascual O. Casper K.B. Kubera C. Zhang J. Revilla-Sanchez R. Sul J.Y. Takano H. Moss S.J. McCarthy K. Haydon P.G. Science. 2005; 5745: 113-116Crossref Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Accumulation of endogenous ATP in the extracellular space may lead to ROS production by astrocytes and facilitation of GABA release from interneurons. Consistent with this view, Fe2+-induced facilitation of synaptic transmission was prevented when the action of endogenous ATP on P2Y1 receptors was reduced by MRS-2371, a specific P2Y1 antagonist (Fig. 7). It should be mentioned that P2Y1 receptor can also be activated by ADP, the breakdown product of ATP (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura M. Gachet C. Inoue K. Kato F. J. Neurosi. 2004; 24: 10835-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 45He M.L. Gonzalez-Iglesias A.E. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46270-46277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Illes P. Ribeiro A.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 483: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that endogenous ADP acting on P2Y1 receptors contributes to ROS generation by astrocytes. In turn, the contribution of ADP would be dependent on the activity of ectoATPases, which control the rate of ATP breakdown (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 45He M.L. Gonzalez-Iglesias A.E. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46270-46277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our experiments also reveal facilitation of GABA release by endogenous H2O2, which is more evident in the presence of Fe2+. It is worth noting that in newborns, there is an excess of free iron (16Buonocore G. Perrone S. Bracci R. Biol. Neonate. 2001; 9: 180-186Google Scholar), which is a cofactor for the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Sources of ROS in the Hippocampus—What are the cellular sources of ROS? Possible candidates are astrocytes and interneurons since both of these cells express metabotropic P2Y1 receptors (25Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kawamura M. Gachet C. Inoue K. Kato F. J. Neurosi. 2004; 24: 10835-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the present work based on DCF imaging from brain slices combined with electrophysiological recordings has clearly identified astrocytes as the main cellular source of ROS. In the present study, we did not analyze the molecular mechanism of ROS generation. Nevertheless, recent studies on cultured astrocytes have shown that ATP-induced ROS are generated mainly by membrane NADPH oxidase (10Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J. Wientjes F. Hothersall J. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9176-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Physiological Implication of ROS in the Immature Hippocampus—The present data demonstrate that the hippocampus of newborn rats is very sensitive to ROS since H2O2 at low concentrations was effective in enhancing the frequency of spontaneous GABAA-mediated synaptic events. It is known that in particular situations such as reperfusion after ischemia, endogenous H2O2 can reach in certain brain regions a local concentration up to 150 μm (47Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Such high concentrations of H2O2 may have a variety of adverse effects or even kill the neurons (48Bal-Price A. Brown G.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6480-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high sensitivity of newborns to ROS may result not only from the relative deficiency of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the immature brain, known as the main scavengers of ROS, but also from the excess of free iron (16Buonocore G. Perrone S. Bracci R. Biol. Neonate. 2001; 9: 180-186Google Scholar). Consistent with this, in the present work, even low micromolar concentrations of Fe2+ were able to modulate the action of endogenous ATP, promoting facilitation of GABA release into pyramidal cells. As already mentioned, at early developmental stages, GABAergic transmission provides the major excitatory drive to pyramidal cells (14Safiulina V.F. Kasyanov A.M. Sokolova E. Cherubini E. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 565: 981-992Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Safiulina V.F. Fattorini G. Conti F. Cherubini E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 49Cherubini E. Gaiarsa J.L. Ben-Ari Y. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that ATP released from astrocytes induces peroxide via activation of P2Y1 receptors coupled to intracellular calcium rise. In the presence of Fe2+, H2O2 is converted in hydroxyl radicals, which in turn facilitate GABA release from mossy fibers and GABAergic interneurons onto principal cells. It is worth noting that ROS act mainly presynaptically without modifying postsynaptic responsiveness. At the neuromuscular junction, ROS were found to affect acetylcholine release, probably interfering with the vesicle fusion protein SNAP25 (50Giniatullin A.R. Darios F. Shakirzyanova A. Davletov B. Giniatullin R. J. Neurochem. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, this protein is not expressed in hippocampal GABAergic synapses (51Verderio C. Pozzi D. Pravettoni E. Inverardi F. Schenk U. Coco S. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Galli T. Rossetto O. Frassoni C. Matteoli M. Neuron. 2004; 41: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting another target for modulation of GABAergic synaptic currents by ROS. Considering that a single astrocyte may control ∼140,000 synapses (33Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that neighboring astrocytes communicate by means of intercellular Ca2+ waves (43Haydon P.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), the release of ROS from astrocytes may result in a widespread and synchronized synaptic modulation. In the immature hippocampus, synaptic GABAergic activity is required for proper wiring of developing circuits (15Kasyanov A.M. Safiulina V.F. Voronin L.L. Cherubini E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3967-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This implies that any change in pro-oxidant levels may interfere with ATP-induced ROS production and synaptic transmission, thus contributing to information processing at the network level. R.

https://openalex.org/W2090313936,"Although we have previously demonstrated the functional significance of excitatory amino acid transporters as well as glutamate (Glu) receptors (GluRs) expressed by chondrocytes, little attention has been paid to the possible expression of the cystine/Glu antiporter responsible for the bi-directional transmembrane transport of Glu in chondrocytes to date. In organotypic cultured mouse embryonic metatarsals isolated before vascularization, the chondral mineralization was significantly decreased in the presence of Glu at a high concentration. Apoptotic cells were detected within the late proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytic layers in metatarsals cultured in the presence of Glu. A group III metabotropic GluR (mGluR) antagonist partially, but significantly, prevented the inhibition of mineralization by Glu in metatarsals without affecting the number of apoptotic cells. Both decreased mineralization and apoptosis by Glu were significantly prevented by the addition of the cystine/Glu antiporter inhibitor homocysteic acid, as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) and cystine. Expression of mRNA for xCT and 4F2hc subunits, which are components of the cystine/Glu antiporter, was seen in both cultured mouse metatarsals and rat costal chondrocytes. In chondrocytes cultured with Glu, a significant decrease was seen in intracellular GSH levels, together with increases in the number of apoptotic cells and the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that Glu could regulate chondrogenic differentiation toward mineralization through a mechanism associated with apoptosis mediated by the depletion of intracellular GSH after the retrograde operation of the cystine/Glu antiporter, in addition to the activation of group III mGluR, in chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2142436212,"The yeast Hog1 protein is both functionally and structurally similar to the mammalian p38, belonging to the same family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and responding to extracellular changes in osmolarity. Since p38 mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects in mammalian cells, we now tested the responsiveness of Hog1 upon exposure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to bacterial LPS. In the presence of Escherichia coli LPS (100 ng/ml) and an endotoxically active, hexaacylated, synthetic lipid A (compound 506; 100 ng/ml), Hog1 becomes phosphorylated with a maximum of phosphorylation between 3 and 6 h, whereas a tetraacylated, inactive form of lipid A (compound 406) did not cause any modification in the phosphorylation state of Hog1. A triple labeling immunocytochemical study showed that phosphorylated Hog1 translocates into the nucleus after a 90-min incubation and becomes sparsely located in the cytoplasm. The translocation of the phospho-Hog1 is preceded by an increased expression of the HOG1 gene and concomitant with the expression of the Hog1 target gene, GPD1. We also observed that cells unable to synthesize Hog1 do not resist LPS as efficiently as wild-type cells. We conclude that the yeast S. cerevisiae is able to respond to the presence of Gram-negative bacteria endotoxin and that Hog1 is involved in this response. The yeast Hog1 protein is both functionally and structurally similar to the mammalian p38, belonging to the same family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and responding to extracellular changes in osmolarity. Since p38 mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects in mammalian cells, we now tested the responsiveness of Hog1 upon exposure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to bacterial LPS. In the presence of Escherichia coli LPS (100 ng/ml) and an endotoxically active, hexaacylated, synthetic lipid A (compound 506; 100 ng/ml), Hog1 becomes phosphorylated with a maximum of phosphorylation between 3 and 6 h, whereas a tetraacylated, inactive form of lipid A (compound 406) did not cause any modification in the phosphorylation state of Hog1. A triple labeling immunocytochemical study showed that phosphorylated Hog1 translocates into the nucleus after a 90-min incubation and becomes sparsely located in the cytoplasm. The translocation of the phospho-Hog1 is preceded by an increased expression of the HOG1 gene and concomitant with the expression of the Hog1 target gene, GPD1. We also observed that cells unable to synthesize Hog1 do not resist LPS as efficiently as wild-type cells. We conclude that the yeast S. cerevisiae is able to respond to the presence of Gram-negative bacteria endotoxin and that Hog1 is involved in this response. In response to stress, cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to give a specific and adaptative response. The stress responses rely on the recognition of the specific stress through a cellular sensor followed by a signal transduction pathway that often involves one or more chains of enzymatic activities, leading to several coordinated intracellular actions, which ultimately results in a modification of gene expression and in the production of proteins aimed to alleviate the consequences of stress. The cellular response to stress generally involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, MAP kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinases; HOG pathway, high osmolarity glycerol pathway; LPS, bacterial lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. cascades, which are common and highly conserved signaling modules found in both higher and lower eukaryotic cells (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). A prototype of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) family is the yeast Hog1 MAP kinase, which specifically responds to increased extracellular osmolarity and is essential for cell survival under these conditions (Ref. 2Brewster J.L. de Valoir T.

Upon phosphorylation by the dual specific kinase Pbs2, Hog1 is translocated into the nucleus (7Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A.

A portion of activated Hog1 is apparently also present in the cytoplasm to mediate post-transcriptional and translational effects (14Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F.

Lately, it was described that Hog1 modulates the activity of membrane transporters, i.e. acting directly in cytoplasmic targets (17Proft M. Struhl K. Cell. 2004; 118: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was generally accepted that Hog1 was just involved in the response to increased extracellular osmolarity, but recent reports showed that it is also activated by heat stress (18Winkler A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3307-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Hog1 homologue in mammalian cells is p38, which is structurally related, sharing a Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) dual phosphorylation motif (22Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p38 has the ability to rescue a S. cerevisiae hog1Δ mutant in a hyperosmotic environment (22Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 23Böhm M. Gamulin V. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G.

Med. 2000; 29: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There is also a functional homology between yeast Hog1 and p38 since p38 is a central mediator of the hyperosmotic (Ref. 24Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Sheikh-Hamad D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, and for review, see Ref. 25Sheikh-Hamad D. Gustin M.C. Am. J.

It has also been reported that the human MTK1 can complement the MAPKKK mutants, ssk2Δ ssk22Δ (28Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown whether the functional homology between Hog1 and p38, in S. cerevisiae, can be extended to other stress situations besides osmolarity and oxidative stress. In particular, it is well established that one of the main roles of p38 is the regulation of the inflammatory response (27Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 29Saklatvala J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The prototypical activator of cells of the immune and inflammatory systems is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the component of the outer leaflet of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS activates macrophages, a pivotal cell type in LPS response, triggering the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (29Saklatvala J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) through the activation of the p38 kinase pathway (30Han J. Lee J.-D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). The inflammatory activity of LPS is due to the lipid moiety of the molecule, termed lipid A, and usually referred as the bacterial endotoxin. Situations where lipid A, an amphiphilic compound, is exposed result in the immunostimulation of the host (31Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). Thus, the present study was designed to test whether the p38 MAP kinase yeast homologue, Hog1, is also activated upon exposure of S. cerevisiae to bacterial endotoxin. Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were wild-type W303-1A (Mata ade 2-1 can 1-100 his 2-11,15 leu 2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1), provided by Professor Johan Thevelein (Katholieke University of Leuven, Belgium), and its derivative YSH 444 (hog1Δ:: TRP1) mutant, obtained from Professor Stefan Hohmann (32Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium supplemented with the appropriate selective amino acids and bases and 2% glucose. Growth was assessed by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 640 nm (A640 nm). The cells were grown to midlog phase, divided, and incubated with 100 ng/ml (33Nahas N. Molski T.F. Fernandez G.A. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma), lipid A compound 506 or 406 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) or with NaCl 0.8 m (as a control) (34Tamás M.J. Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were obtained using the urea/SDS method as described previously (35Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were boiled at 95 °C for 10 min and then separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm, from Amersham Biosciences), which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline medium (200 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) with 5% bovine serum albumin. Dual phosphorylation of Hog1 was detected using a rabbit antibody against the dually phosphorylated (Thr-174 and Tyr-176) form of p38 (Cell Signaling), 1:250 in TBS-T with 3% bovine serum albumin) in which the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washing periods with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences; 1:10,000) during 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS-T and incubation with enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF, Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min, the membranes were analyzed using the VersaDoc 3000 (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed for total Hog1 protein. Briefly, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3, to strip the previous antibodies and probed using a goat anti-C-terminal Hog1p antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:500) as described above, using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Calbiochem, UK; 1:5,000). Immunocytochemistry—10 ml of cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and washed twice with PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 15 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were spheroplasted by resuspension in phosphate buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5), with 0.17% β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mg/ml zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku, Japan) and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 45 min. Spheroplasts were washed once with PBS and resuspended in phosphate buffer. Then, the spheroplasts were added to the coverslips, previously coated with poli-l-lysine, allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C, and blocked with PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 30 min. The spheroplasts were then incubated for 2 h with the primary antibodies, rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling; 1:100) and goat anti-Hog1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:400), prepared in the blocking solution. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated, in the dark, for 2 h, with the secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled donkey anti-goat antibodies, Molecular Probes). As a control, spheroplasts were incubated only with secondary antibodies, without previous incubation with primary antibodies. The coverslips were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with 15 μg/μl Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and mounted on Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope, with a ×100 objective equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and analyzed with MetaFluor 5.0 software. The final figures were prepared using Paint Shop Pro 7 without further manipulation. Gene Expression—Total mRNA was extracted from yeast cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) in control conditions (no stress) or after exposure to 100 ng/ml LPS, using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Izasa, Portugal) according to the manufacturer's instructions for yeast cells. mRNA samples (3 μg) were reverse transcribed using Transcriptor first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR (Roche Diagnostics, Lisbon, Portugal). After denaturation at 65 °C for 10 min in a Whatman Biometra thermocycler, in the presence of 60 μm random hexamer primer, mRNA samples were incubated with 20 units of Protector RNase inhibitor, 1 mm dNTPs, and 10 units of transcriptor reverse transcriptase, at 25 °C for 10 min and 55 °C for 30 min. The real-time PCR reactions were performed in a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics), using a LightCycler® Fast Start DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). The PCR reaction was based on the SYBRGreen method, according to the manufacturer's instructions, which relies on primer specificity and requires no detection probes. The primers used in the real-time LC protocols were for HOG1, forward primer 5′-GATGCCTTGGCTCATCCTTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACTGTATGGCCTGGTTACCG-3′; for GPD1, forward primer 5′-TTTTGCCCCGTATCTGTAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGTTGTTACCCCAGCCTAGA-3′; and for the reference gene 18S, forward primer 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′. These primers were designed using OLIGO6® software (Cambio, Cambridge, UK). The selected sets of primers were checked against GenBank™ using BLAST to confirm their gene specificity. Every test run included RNase-free water as a negative control. The amplification and detection were performed using the following parameters: a preincubation at 95 °C for 10 min for FastStart TaqDNA polymerase activation followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 17 s. After the 45 cycles, melting curve analysis was performed to confirm product specificity. The melting curve analysis was achieved by heating the mixture up to 95 °C and then cooling to 65 °C for 15 s and then slowly (0.1 °C/s) heating back to 95 °C. Raw data were analyzed by relative quantification using the 2-ΔCT method (36Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Viability Assay—The sensitivity to LPS was evaluated in pregrown cells at 30 °C until an A640 nm of 0.8-1. The cells were then divided and incubated without or with 100 ng/ml LPS or, as a control, with 0.8 m NaCl. To quantify the number of viable cells during the incubation period, 100-μl aliquots were taken and plated into Petri dishes. The number of colonies was counted after 3 days at 30 °C. Under these conditions, each colony represents a viable cell. For the spotting experiments, 10-fold serial dilutions of an exponentially growing culture were spotted onto YNB agar plates supplemented without or with 100 ng/ml LPS or as a control, with 0.8 m NaCl. Plates were incubated 48 h at 30 °C before being photographed. Hog1 Protein Is Phosphorylated upon Exposure to Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide—To determine whether the exposure of yeast cells to bacterial LPS results in the activation of Hog1 protein, we quantified the activation of Hog1 by measuring the formation of its activated form, the dually phosphorylated form (Thr-174/Tyr-176) of Hog1, using a selective antibody (34Tamás M.J. Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hog1 was investigated by Western blot analysis of cells incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS, a concentration able to trigger p38 activation/phosphorylation in human neutrophils (33Nahas N. Molski T.F. Fernandez G.A. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation with LPS, it was possible to detect the phosphorylated form of Hog1 (Fig. 1A). The levels of phosphorylated Hog1 then increased continuously up to 180-360 min (Fig. 1A), when the maximal phosphorylation was observed. The levels of phosphorylated Hog1 continuously decreased up to 12 h of incubation with LPS (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, we evaluated the degree of phosphorylation of Hog1 under osmotic stress (0.8 m NaCl) (34Tamás M.J. Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As observed in previous studies (34Tamás M.J. Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), after 5 min of exposure to 0.8 m NaCl, Hog1 became phosphorylated, reaching a transient maximal phosphorylation at 10-30 min and remaining detectable until 90 min (Fig. 1A). To ascertain that the increase in phosphorylated Hog1 levels does not represent a possible increase in Hog1 expression but rather of its phosphorylation, we followed the total levels of Hog1. As illustrated in the reprobed membranes using an anti-C-terminal Hog1p antibody, we found an increase in the density of Hog1 upon exposure to LPS (Fig. 1A). Thus, we calculated the ratio between the relative density of phosphorylated Hog1 and total Hog1 for the cells exposed to LPS or NaCl 0.8 m (Fig. 1B) to adequately compare the level of phosphorylation induced by hyperosmolarity and by LPS, irrespective of changes in the total levels of Hog1. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, hyperosmolarity induced a faster Hog1 phosphorylation (reaching a maximum of phosphorylation at 10-30 min) than that observed upon incubation with LPS (reaching a maximum of phosphorylation at 180-360 min), which displayed a delay of 30 min. This ratio analysis also indicated that the degree of phosphorylation was higher in cells exposed to LPS than in cells incubated with NaCl 0.8 m (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the phosphorylation kinetics, taken together, these data clearly show that LPS exposure induces Hog1 phosphorylation. Since there are reports showing that commercial LPS contains several bioactive contaminants (37Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 38Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) that could confound the interpretation of our observed LPS-induced effects, we went on to study whether lipid A (the LPS component that ultimately binds the TLR4 receptor and induces activation of p38) is able to stimulate, in yeast, the phosphorylation of Hog1p. We used two different kinds of lipid A, a proinflammatory, hexaaacylated, synthetic E. coli-like lipid A, the compound 506 (39Mueller M. Lindner B. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J.

Kataoka M. Hashimoto M. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a tetraacylated lipid A that antagonizes the inflammatory response, the compound 406, which is endotoxically inactive (41Kovach N.L. Yee E. Munford R.S. Raetz C.R.H. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 42Loppnow H. Brade H. Dürrbaum I. Dinarello C.A. Kusumoto S. Rietschel E.T.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We observed that only compound 506, but not its endotoxically inactive analogue, compound 406, results in an active phosphorylation of the Hog1 protein (Fig. 1C). The methodology used by us in the preparation of suspensions of both forms of lipid A results in the formation of pure aggregates of each form of lipid A, according to the results described by Mueller et al. (39Mueller M. Lindner B. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26307-26313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Also, according to these authors, the stimulation of mononuclear cells with pure aggregates results in a lower production of tumor necrosis factor-α, i.e. activation, whereas a mixture of several compounds results in a higher stimulation, a result mimicked by suspensions of natural LPS. In our experiments, we also found that incubation with similar concentrations of compound 506 and E. coli LPS, during 6 h, results in a lower level of Hog1 phosphorylation in the presence of the synthetic lipid A (Fig. 1C). The difference between the two forms of lipid A now described by us also excludes the hypothesis that the effect observed upon exposure to LPS or lipid A could be due to a disturbance of the cell membrane by hydrophobic substances since the biologically inactive synthetic lipid A compound 406 does not induce Hog1 phosphorylation. Besides, compound 406 incorporates more efficiently with phospholipid cell membranes than other amphiphilic substances, a process mediated by the LPS-binding protein (40Seydel U. Schromm A.B. Brade L. Gronow S. Andrä J. Müller M. Koch M.H.J. Fukase K. Kataoka M. Hashimoto M. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that the effects triggered by LPS are not due to a nonspecific but are likely to be receptor-mediated, although this still remains to be fully established. Expression of HOG1 Gene Is Increased upon Exposure to LPS— The observation that the total levels of Hog1 increased during exposure to LPS (Fig. 1A, right panel) led us to study whether LPS modified the relative levels of expression of the HOG1 gene. After a 90-min exposure to 100 ng/ml LPS, the levels of HOG1 mRNA were increased 6-fold when compared with the control (without incubation with LPS), as evaluated by SYBR Green real-time PCR (Fig. 2). This increased level of expression of HOG1 was maintained until a 3-h incubation with LPS (Fig. 2). However, at 6 h of incubation, the relative expression of this gene decreased to control levels (Fig. 2). These results show that upon LPS exposure, in addition to an increase in Hog1 phosphorylation, there is an up-regulation of the expression of HOG1. Furthermore, the comparison of the kinetics of the LPS-induced changes in HOG1 mRNA and of phosphorylated Hog1 indicates that the up-regulation of HOG1 mRNA levels precedes the maximal levels of phosphorylated Hog1. Hog1p Is Translocated to the Nucleus upon LPS-induced Phosphorylation—Upon activation by hyperosmotic stress, Hog1 translocates into the nucleus, from where it coordinates the expression of numerous genes (7Ferrigno P.

To monitor the subcellular localization of the inactive/dephosphorylated and the active/phosphorylated forms of Hog1 protein, we performed a triple labeling immunocytochemical assay. We labeled phosphorylated Hog1 (green) and total Hog1 (red) using the same antibodies used in the Western blot analysis. To evaluate the nuclear localization of the phosphorylated form of the Hog1 protein, we labeled yeast genomic DNA using the fluorescence probe Hoechst 33342 (blue). Triple co-localization (white) shows the presence of phosphorylated Hog1 in the nucleus. We performed this immunocytochemical assay in unstressed yeast cells, in yeast cells exposed to 100 ng/ml LPS for different time periods, or in yeast cells exposed to 0.8 m NaCl, as a positive control (Fig. 3). As described previously for hyperosmotic stress conditions (7Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and now demonstrated by us using an immunocytochemistry assay with specific antibodies for both total and phospho-Hog1, after phosphorylation, Hog1 transiently accumulates in the nucleus, with a time course matching its phosphorylation status (compare the effects of hyperosmotic stress in Figs. 1 and 3). Likewise, exposure to LPS (100 ng/ml) for 30 min led to an increase in the levels of the phosphorylated form of Hog1, which was solely located in the cytoplasm. After 90 min of incubation with LPS, the phosphorylated form of Hog1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although there was already some phospho-Hog1 located in the nucleus (Fig. 3). Only between 3 and 6 h of incubation with LPS was it possible to find a clear accumulation of phosphorylated Hog1 protein in the nucleus, albeit some phosphorylated Hog1 remained in the cytoplasm. After 12 h of incubation with LPS, the levels of phosphorylated Hog1 decreased, in agreement with the data obtained in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). The remaining phosphorylated Hog1 was restricted to the cytoplasm, which indicates that its nuclear localization is a transient event. This suggests that upon exposure to LPS, Hog1 is translocated into the nucleus in a transient manner that correlateswithitstimecourseofphosphorylation, as observed in yeasts under hyperosmotic stress.

K., George, D., Freilich, L., Miljan, E. J., Mania-Farnell, B. J., McLone, D. G., and Bremer, E. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 49299-49309). Here we report that Pax3 directly regulates TGFβ2 transcription by binding to cis-regulatory elements within its promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Pax3 bound to the cis-regulatory elements on the TGFβ2 promoter (GenBank™ accession number AF118263). Both TGFβ2 promoter-luciferase activity measurements in transient cotransfection experiments and electromobility shift assays supported the idea that Pax3 regulates TGFβ2 by directly binding to its cis-regulatory regions. Additionally, by using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that the TGFβ2 cis-regulatory elements between bp 741-940 and bp 1012-1212 bind acetylated Pax3 and are associated with p300/CBP and histone deacetylases. The cis-regulatory elements between bp 741 and 940 in addition to associating with acetylated Pax3 and HDAC1 also associated with SIRT1. Whole mount in situ hybridization and quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR showed diminished levels of TGFβ2 transcripts in Pax3-/- mouse embryos (whose phenotype is characterized by neural tube defects) as compared with Pax3+/+ littermates (embryonic day 10.0; 30 somite stage), suggesting that Pax3 regulation of TGFβ2 may play a pivotal role during early embryonic development. Previously our laboratory identified TGFβ2 as a potential downstream target of Pax3 by utilizing microarray analysis and promoter data base mining (Mayanil, C. S.

Pax3 encodes a paired homeobox containing transcription factor that is expressed in neuroepithelium, neural crest, and presomitic mesoderm (1Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl.

More recently, Pax3 has been shown to function at the nodal point in melanocyte stem cell differentiation (4Lang D. Lu M.M. Huang L. Engleka K.A. Zhang M. Chu E.Y. Lipner S. Skoultchi A. Millar S.E. Epstein J.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 884-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Heterozygous embryos (Pax3+/-) are viable but exhibit white patches on their bellies caused by defective development of neural crest-derived melanocytes. This suggests that disruption of the Pax3-dependent developmental program may cause defects in the development of neural crest-derived structures.Two main Pax3-binding sites have been identified and are found in most Pax3 target elements as follows: (i) a binding site derived from the Drosophila Paired (ATTA N5 GTTCC), and (ii) a Pax3 paired domain binding site (CGTCAC(G/A)(C/G)TT) identified by Epstein et al. (5Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y.P. Maas R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Google Scholar) by CASTing (DNA-binding site selection assays) in the c-Met promoter region. In addition several paired domains, such as GTTCC, CAGTGT, GTTAT, GTGTGA, and CAAGG (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L. Miljan E.J. Mania-Farnell B. McLone D.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49299-49309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), as well as the homeodomain ATTA, have been suggested to be “putative Pax3-binding motifs” (7Phelan S.A.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). More recently, Corey and Underhill (9Corey G.N. Underhill D.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 427-438PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Pax3 can regulate target genes through alternative modes of DNA recognition. They observed that although the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor element is characterized by suboptimal recognition motifs for the paired domain and homeodomain, it sustains a higher level of Pax3 binding than TRP-1, which contains a canonical paired domain site. The basis for this difference involved a context-dependent cooperative binding event requiring both the paired and homeodomain, whereas the paired domain alone was sufficient for TRP-1 recognition.Since Pax3 is important in diverse cellular functions during development, we wanted to identify additional genes regulated by Pax3. To accomplish this we utilized oligonucleotide arrays and RNA isolated from Pax3-transfected cell lines and promoter-based data mining (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L. Miljan E.J. Mania-Farnell B. McLone D.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49299-49309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on the putative Pax3-binding motif score (motif score is defined as the total number of times a paired or a homeodomain appears in the promoter sequence of a given gene) in the promoter regions of the genes whose expression was changed by Pax3 transfection, we postulated 17 new genes that may be direct Pax3 downstream targets and another 17 genes (whose promoter sequences are not known) as putative Pax3 downstream targets (6Mayanil C.S.K.

The expression of one of these genes, human TGFβ2, was increased in two of the three Pax3 transfectants studied, and this gene showed the highest putative Pax3-binding motif score, making it a likely gene regulated by Pax3.The importance of TGFβ2 in the process of neural tube closure was first demonstrated by Sanford et al. (10Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Sariola H. Friedman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that TGFβ2 knock-out mice had spina bifida occulta and unfused neural arches at the midline of neural tube along with other developmental abnormalities. In this paper, we demonstrate the following: (i) Pax3 regulates TGFβ2 by binding to cis-regulatory elements of the promoter; (ii) acetylated Pax3 is associated with p300/CBP, HDAC1, and SIRT1; and (iii) TGFβ2 transcript levels are diminished in the Pax3-/- embryos. Thus our microarray data (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L. Miljan E.J. Mania-Farnell B. McLone D.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49299-49309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), along with the present findings in this paper in combination with the results of Sanford et al. (10Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Sariola H. Friedman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that TGFβ2 is regulated by Pax3 and could be involved in early embryonic development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGenotyping—The C57BL/6J-Pax3Sp/J (stock = 2469) male and C57BL/6J breeding pairs were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Genotyping of Pax3+/+, Pax3+/-, and Pax3-/- embryos was performed by isolating genomic DNA from embryonic membranes of embryos and performing PCR with a wild type Pax3+/+- or Pax3-/--specific reverse primer and a common forward primer in separate PCRs as described by Epstein et al. (5Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y.P. Maas R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed according to the procedure described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, E10.0 (30 somite stage) Pax3+/+ embryos were fixed in formalin (1% final concentration) for 4 h at 4°C, quenched in 0.125 m glycine, sonicated, and then processed according to manufacturer's protocol using a rabbit polyclonal Pax3 antibody (lot number D20123-1, catalog number CA1010-50UL, Oncogene Sciences), rabbit polyclonal antibody to HDAC1 (catalog number ab7028, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal antibody to acetylated proteins (catalog number ab193, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal antibody against amino acids 448-747 of SIRT1 of human origin (catalog number sc-15404, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and IgG from rabbit serum (catalog number I-5006, Sigma). PCR was performed with primers to murine TGFβ2 promoter region between bp 1 and 200 (primer set A-(forward), 5′-ggatccctgcttgtcacatg-3′; (reverse), 5′-ttatatacagcaatgaacat-3′); bp 121 and 321 (primer set B-(forward), 5′-tgtatgccagctatatcatt-3′; (reverse), 5′-tggccacgatgactacacag-3′); bp 481 and 681 (primer set C-(forward), 5′-agtttgagcaagttgaagta-3′; (reverse), 5′-ctctgtatcactgctttgaa-3′); bp 741 and 941 (primer set D-(forward), 5′-acagggctggattgtaaaca-3′; (reverse), 5′-aggcgtgtacacacacacac-3′); bp 1012 and 1212 (primer set E-(forward), 5′-tagaaacgggatgcttagct-3′; (reverse), 5′-gaacaaagtgacgcgctagg-3′); bp 1091 and 1291 (primer set F-(forward), 5′-atgccagtcgccctccctta-3′; (reverse), 5′-aaacctgctgccagcagata-3′), which amplified a 200-bp fragment in each case. All ChIP samples were tested for false-positive PCR amplification by sequencing the 200-bp amplified product to ascertain the specificity of the Pax3 binding to the cis-regulatory elements. Additionally, false positive PCR amplification was ruled out by amplifying the sequence from the murine β-actin gene, which failed to give any PCR product in the immunoprecipitates.Analysis of TGFβ2 Promoter Activity—Plasmids containing TGFβ2 promoter sequences (11Wilder P.J. Desler M.M. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Angie Rizzino (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha). The plasmid pPGB11, which contains a luciferase reporter gene (12Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30167-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. S. Tsuji (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan). TGFβ2 promoter sequences (GenBank™ accession number AF118263) were subcloned into the pPGB11 plasmid and labeled as TG1 (bp 1226-1290), TG2 (bp 1191-1290), TG3 (bp 1143-1290), TG4 (bp 950-1290), TG6 (bp 734-1290), and TG7 (bp 1-1290), which is the full-length promoter sequence (11Wilder P.J. Desler M.M. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Deletion and site-directed mutations of “putative Pax3-binding sites” were initially made in the TG4 and TG7 promoter constructs, with the QuickChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutated sequences are identified in Fig. 2. Plasmids (5 μg) with the mutated sequences were transiently co-transfected with Pax3-pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 vector control into wild type DAOY cell line (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L. Miljan E.J.

Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-null (0.5 μg) (dual luciferase system, Promega), was simultaneously transfected as an insertional control for transfection efficiency. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/60-mm diameter dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h prior to transfection. Both plasmids were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB). Luciferase activity was measured using a Vector 2 Luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Pax3-GST Fusion Protein Expression and Isolation—The Pax3-GST fusion cDNA was provided by Dr. Mary R. Loeken (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The Escherichia coli was transformed with Pax3-GST fusion protein construct in pcDNA3, and the cells were grown overnight in LB medium. Pax3-GST fusion protein expression and isolation were performed as described previously (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L. Miljan E.J. Mania-Farnell B. McLone D.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49299-49309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Probes were prepared for EMSA by annealing complementary oligonucleotides representing selected regions of murine TGFβ2 promoter, followed by 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. For EMSA experiments, 0.5 μg of purified Pax3-GST fusion protein was incubated in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 15 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 6.5% glycerol, 90 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm pyrophosphate, 300 ng of salmon sperm DNA as a competitor to reduce nonspecific DNA binding, and 30,000 dpm per nmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. Double-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotide probes covered the following regions: ON-a (bp 175-204) (5′-ataataatgttcattgctgtatataatgta-3′); mON-a (atgaaatgttcattgctgtatatgatgta-3′); ON-b (bp 211-240) (5′-ctatatcattacatatcattacagctccct-3′); mON-b (5′-ctatatcagtacatatcagtacagctccct-3′); ON-c (bp 504-533) (5′-aatgtcaagttatgatccttgtgtgaagga-3′); mON-c, (5′-aatgtcaagctatgatactgtttgacagga-3′); ON-d (bp 647-676) (5′-ataaagaaggcaacagttcctttattcaaa-3′); mON-d (5′-ataaagaaggcaacagtacctttattcaaa-3′); ON-e (bp 751-780) (5′-attgtaaacaggctaatgaaaaacaacctg-3′); mON-e (5′-attgtaaacaggctgatgaaaaacaacctg-3′); ON-f (bp 793-822) (5′-gaactcaagagttaggtcagcagtctcaga-3′); mON-f (5′-gaactcaagagtctaggtcagcagtctcaga-3′); ON-g (bp 1039-1070) (5′-ctccacacagacccttggtgatcacaga ca-3′); mON-g (5′-ctccacacagaccattggtgatcacaga ca-3′). The underlined sequences indicate the putative Pax3-binding sites. The boldface nucleotide in each probe was mutated to obtain the mutant oligonucleotides, for electromobility shift assays. The labeled oligonucleotides were incubated at room temperature with Pax3-GST fusion protein in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar excess cold oligonucleotide. After a 20-min incubation, free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 8% polyacrylamide gels using 0.25× TBE as the running buffer. Electrophoresis was performed in the cold room at 300 mV and 30 mA for 3 h. The gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis to view the shifted bands.Co-immunoprecipitation—Pax3 transfectants, B9 (6Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Freilich L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49299-49309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), were treated with or without 2 μm trichostatin A in serum-free DMEM for 4 h at 37 °Cand then washed three times with cold PBS. The washed cells were collected in cold PBS and then lysed on ice for 30 min in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) were added just before lysis. Immunoprecipitations were carried our by using polyclonal HDAC1 (Abcam) and acetylated protein antibody (Abcam) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitates were collected by 50 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). The precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min. The proteins in the supernatant were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Pax3 monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) and with p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was done according to the method described previously (14Wilkinson D.G. Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-22Google Scholar). Washes were performed at 65 °C. The plasmid pmTGFβ2 containing mouse TGFβ2 (442 bp) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Azhar (University of Cincinnati, Department of Molecular Genetics, Cincinnati, OH). The antisense digoxigenin labeled TGFβ2 riboprobe was synthesized by linearizing the PCR products with EcoRI and using SP6 polymerase. The sense digoxigenin-labeled TGFβ2 riboprobe was synthesized by linearizing the PCR products with XhoI and using T7 polymerase. Embryos were stained and photographed with a Spot Camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.).RESULTSPax3 Binds to cis-Regulatory Regions of Murine TGFβ2 Promoter—An unbiased survey of the entire murine TGFβ2 promoter (GenBank™ accession number AF118263) to ascertain putative Pax3-binding elements was done by employing chromatin immunoprecipitation on E10.0 (30 somite stage) Pax3+/+ embryos using rabbit polyclonal Pax3 antibody. The forward and reverse primer sets A-F amplified 200-bp fragments from the input sample (Fig. 1, lane 1) and immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, lane 3). No amplification was observed when β-actin forward and reverse primers were used. Immunoprecipitation reactions using IgG from normal rabbit serum did not show any amplification of the TGFβ2 promoter in the immunoprecipitated DNA (Fig. 1, lane 2). All ChIP samples were tested for false-positive PCR amplification by sequencing the 200-bp amplified product to ascertain the specificity of the Pax3 binding to the cis-regulatory elements. Additionally, false-positive PCR amplification was ruled out by amplifying the sequence from murine β-actin gene, which failed to give any PCR product in the immunoprecipitates. With the exception of primer set A, all other primer sets (B-F) amplified a 200-bp fragment from the DNA extracted from the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, lane 3). It is important to note that even though the primers to probe specific regions are spaced at 200-bp intervals, the level of resolution is determined by the fragment DNA length following sonication. This is generally on the order of 200-600 bp, depending on the conditions of the sonication.FIGURE 1ChIP assays using E10.0 Pax3+/+ embryos (30 somites) show that Pax3 binds to cis-regulatory elements of TGFβ2 promoter. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Pax3 was used to immunoprecipitate the Pax3-DNA complex. Lane 1 is input sample; lane 2 is immunoprecipitated DNA using IgG from normal rabbit serum; and lane 3 is immunoprecipitated DNA using rabbit polyclonal antibody against Pax3. The 200-bp amplified product using mTGFβ2 primer sets A-F (see “Experimental Procedures”) is shown. The bottom panel shows the schematic representation of the primer sets A-F. Murine β-actin primers were used as negative controls, and the amplified product is present only in the input and not in the control IgG control or the immunoprecipitate. Each ChIP experiments (n = 4) was performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Analysis of Murine TGFβ2 Promoter Activity— To determine the functional interaction of Pax3 with murine TGFβ2 promoter and the effect on the promoter activity, we employed transient co-transfection experiments using luciferase-reporter plasmids containing different murine TGFβ2 promoter sequences as described by Wilder et al. (11Wilder P.J. Desler M.M. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with Pax3 expression plasmids. Murine TGFβ2 promoter plasmids were subcloned into the pPGB11 plasmid and labeled as TG1 (bp 1226-1290), TG2 (bp 1191-1290), TG3 (bp 1143-1290), TG4 (bp 950-1290), TG6 (bp 734-1290), and TG7 (bp 1-1290) (11Wilder P.J. Desler M.M. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A full-length promoter sequence and each construct are shown in Fig. 2. The promoterless luciferase gene in pPGB11 (13Mayanil C.S.K. George D. Mania-Farnell B. Bremer C.L. McLone D.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23259-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the plasmid constructs containing murine TGFβ2 promoter sequences were assayed for promoter activity by transient co-transfection of Pax3-pcDNA3 into wild type DAOY cells (Fig. 3). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity by cotransfecting an internal control plasmid, pRL-null, carrying cDNA encoding the Renilla luciferase gene. Our results showed that the promoter constructs TG4 and TG7 displayedmaximumluciferaseactivity with TG4 showing slightly higher activity than TG7 construct. These observations suggest that these constructs contain transcriptional activating elements that may be responsive to Pax3 binding. The promoter constructs TG1, TG2, TG3, and TG6, on the other hand, displayed no increase in luciferase activity. It is intriguing to know that TG6 promoter construct did not show any increase in promoter activity, although it encompassed the TG4 construct promoter region. This observation suggests that the TG6 promoter construct may contain silencing elements 5′ to the boundary of the TG4 promoter construct that significantly decreases promoter activity. One plausible explanation for this latter observation could be due to the presence of a dinucleotide (GT)32 repeat region in this promoter sequence (Fig. 2).

Lett. 2003; 345: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have identified a functional and polymorphic (GT)n repeat in the 5′-regulatory region of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2A subunit (GRIN2A) gene that resulted in the length-dependent inhibition of transcriptional activity. Similarly, Yamada et al. (16Yamada N. Yamaya M. Okinaga S. Nakayama K. Sekizawa K. Shibahara S. Sasaki H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 187-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) suggested that the larger the size of a (GT)n repeat in the hemoxygenase-1 gene promoter, the greater the transcriptional inhibition. In sum, the observations from our promoter-luciferase study concluded that TG7 and TG4 promoter constructs may be having Pax3 responsive regions between bp 1-734 and bp 950-1143, respectively.FIGURE 3Pax3 regulation of murine TGFβ2 promoter. Pax3-pcDNA3 and murine TGFβ2 promoter-luciferase constructs TG1, TG2, TG3, TG4, TG6, and TG7 (refer to Fig. 2) or pcDNA3 and murine TGFβ2 promoter constructs and pPGB11 (promoter-less luciferase gene) were co-transfected into wild type DAOY cells. The luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values of pPGB11 were subtracted from the TGFβ2 promoter-luciferase values. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate with each data point in duplicate. Note the region of (gt)32 and the region between bp 1-734 and bp 950-1143 that may have contributed to increased TG4 and TG7 construct activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pax3 Regulates Murine TGFβ2 Promoter—The above study prompted us to look for the paired or the homeodomain binding sequences within bp 1-734 (TG7) and bp 950-1143 (TG4) that contributed to the maximum activity. Therefore, we made several promoter-luciferase constructs on the TG7 backbone with point mutations, either in a paired domain binding site (PDBS) or homeodomain-binding site (HDBS) between bp 1-734 and bp 950-1143, representing the regions in TG7 and TG4 that showed highest luciferase activity in Fig. 3. The results (Fig. 4) show that point mutations T514 (Tgm6) in the PDBS “gttat” and T664 (Tgm10) in the PDBS “gttcc” showed a decrease in promoter activity with T1056 (Tgm14) in the PDBS “ccttg” showing a marginal decrease in promoter activity. The Tgm6 and Tgm10 mutants gave the maximum reduction in promoter activity followed by Tgm14. By contrast, a point mutation T526 (Tgm7) in the PDBS “gtgtga” did not show any decrease in promoter activity. Except for point mutation in the HDBS A178 (Tgm4), point mutations in HDBS represented by A569 (Tgm8) and A766 (Tgm11) showed no appreciable decrease in promoter activity. These results suggest that not all paired domains or homeodomain-binding sites contribute equally to TGFβ2 promoter activity by Pax3. Thus, our data show that the PDBS “gttat” (bp 512-516) and ccttg (bp 1053-1057) and HDBS “atta” (bp 176-179) contribute maximally to promoter activity.FIGURE 4Identification of Pax3 response regions in murine TGFβ2 promoter; point mutants of TGFβ2 promoter. Point mutations in paired-(P) or homeodomain (H)-binding sites within the TG7 promoter construct included Tgm4 (A178)-H, Tgm6 (T514)-P, Tgm7 (T526)-P, Tgm8 (A569)-H, Tgm10 (T664)-P, Tgm11 (A766)-H, and Tgm14 (T1056)-P. These promoter constructs and pPGB11 (promoter-less luciferase gene) were co-transfected into wild type DAOY with Pax3-pcDNA3 or vector alone and assayed for luciferase activity 48 h after transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The luciferase activity values for pPGB1, pcDNA3 transfected cell, and DAOY wild type were subtracted from TGFβ2 promoter-luciferase construct values. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate with each data point in duplicate. The ▾ in the left-hand panel denotes the point mutation in either the paired domain (P) or homeodomain (H)-binding sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above results as well as our chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggested that there may be more than one Pax3-response elements in the TG7 promoter construct. To evaluate how different regions may combine to influence promoter activity, we introduced several deletion as well as point mutations into the TG7 promoter construct (as outlined in Fig. 5). Deletion and point mutation locations were based on the mutation studies mentioned above. These studies defined maximal promoter activation located in the PDBS gttat (bp 512-516) and ccttg (bp 1053-1057). We also chose another PDBS gtgtga (bp 523-528) adjacent to gttat. This PDBS was described by Epstein and co-workers (16Yamada N. Yamaya M. Okinaga S. Nakayama K. Sekizawa K. Shibahara S. Sasaki H. Am. J. Hum.

Given the importance of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis to early pregnancy, it is of interest to understand the mechanisms regulating vascular development at this stage. We previously demonstrated that VEGF and receptors are up-regulated during embryo implantation in an unique animal model, the mink, a species displaying obligate embryonic diapause. Herein we examined the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a regulator of VEGF during early pregnancy and established the mechanisms of this regulation. We demonstrate that activated embryos secrete PGE2 and that expression of PGE synthase protein in the uterus is dependent upon direct contact with invading trophoblast cells during implantation. Using mink uterine stromal cells transfected with mink VEGF promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene, we show that PGE2 induces promoter transactivation and that this response can be eliminated by blockade of protein kinase A. Treatment with antagonists to PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 eliminated the PGE2-induced response in transfected cells. Deletional studies of the promoter revealed that a region of 99 bp upstream of the transcription start site is required for PGE2-induced transactivation. Mutation of an AP2/Sp1 cluster, found within the 99 bp, completely eliminated the PGE2 response. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed binding of the AP2 and Sp1 transcription factors to the endogenous mink VEGF promoter in uterine cells. PGE2 stimulated acetylation of histone H3 associated with the promoter region containing the AP2/Sp1 cluster. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PGE2 plays an important role in regulating uterine and thus placental vascular development, acting through its receptors EP2 and EP4, provoking protein kinase A activation of AP2 and Sp1 as well as acetylation of histone H3 to transactivate the VEGF promoter.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 2The abbreviations used are: PGE, prostaglandin E; COX, cyclooxygenase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PKA, protein kinase A; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. is a prostanoid synthesized through the cyclooxygenase pathway characterized by the initial step of formation of prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid, catalyzed by the cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and -2). Formation of PGE2 follows formation of prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid and is dependent on the presence of prostaglandin E synthase (PGE synthase). Two isoforms of PGE synthase have been identified; one is a cytosolic form that acts mostly on COX-1-derived prostaglandin H2. The second is a microsomal form, preferentially coupled with the inducible COX-2 induction of PGE2 generation (1Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M.

PGE2 exerts its effects following binding to specific receptors containing seven transmembrane domains (2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Four receptor subtypes have been identified to date: EP1, -2, -3, and -4, each activating different intracellular pathways. Knock-out models for each subtype have been investigated, and mice deficient for EP2 presented impaired ovulation and fertilization (3Tilley S.L. Audoly L.P. Hicks E.H. Kim H.S. Flannery P.J. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The role of prostaglandins in reproductive processes has been extensively investigated. COX-2-deficient mice have impaired ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization (4Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

In mice, both microsomal PGE synthase mRNA and protein were localized in the subluminal stroma surrounding the implanting blastocyst (11Ni H. Sun T. Ding N.Z. Ma X.H. Yang Z.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The authors suggested embryonic induction of local PGE synthase, since expression of the enzyme was absent in pseudopregnant females as well as at interimplantation sites in the uterus. Early pregnancy in mammals is associated with morphological and functional changes in uterine cells, accompanied by vascular remodeling. These changes are required for both placental and embryonic development (12Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klauber N.

Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) and is an important factor in regulation of the events of early implantation and establishment of the placenta (17Matsumoto H.

VEGF is a homodimeric glycoprotein of 40-45 kDa, and, while best known for its potent endothelial cell-specific mitogenic activity, it also plays a role in increasing vascular permeability (18Ferrara N.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). VEGF effects on angiogenesis are dependent upon binding to tyrosine kinase receptors, Flt-1 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase, also known as VEGFR-1) and KDR (kinase domain region, also known as VEGFR-2) (23Jussila L. Alitalo K. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that VEGF and its receptors are up-regulated during peri-implantation stages of gestation in the mink uterus (24Lopes F.L. Desmarais J. Gevry N.Y. Ledoux S. Murphy B.D. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1926-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Earlier, Kennedy (25Kennedy T.G. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 20: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that PGE2 is a regulator of increased vascular permeability at implantation sites in rats. Since then, PGE2 has been shown to up-regulate VEGF in a number of tissues, including umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells (26Abdel-Majid R.M. Marshall J.S. J.

There are few investigations of PGE2 modulation of VEGF transcription, and there are no such investigations pertinent to uterine expression. In the present report, we have established the pattern of expression of PGE synthase in the uterus during early pregnancy and investigated the role of PGE2 in implantation in an unique mammalian model. We provide the first demonstration that local PGE2 regulates transcriptional activity of the VEGF gene as well as new information bearing on the mechanism of this activation. Animals and Sample Collection—All treatment protocols involving the use of animals were approved by the Comité de Déontologie, Faculté de Médecine Vétérinaire, Université de Montréal in accordance with regulations of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Mink of the Dark and Pastel varieties were purchased and maintained on a commercial farm (A. Richard, St. Damase, Canada). Females were mated twice, 7 days apart, during the first 2 weeks of March, according to standard husbandry procedures. We and others have shown that prolactin injections terminate obligate embryonic diapause and induce embryo activation and implantation in the mink (32Papke R.L. Concannon P.W. Travis H.F. Hansel W. J. Anim. Sci. 1980; 50: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Murphy B.D. Concannon P.W. Travis H.F. Hansel W. Biol.

Fertil. 1981; 29: 119-130Google Scholar), and a standard protocol consisting of daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg/kg prolactin (Sigma) was employed beginning 1 week following last mating and continuing for 12 days. Implantation takes place approximately on the 13th day after the initiation of prolactin injections, verified by the presence of uterine swellings and histological evidence of trophoblast invasion. Pseudopregnancy was induced in nonmated females by two injections of GnRH (10 μg/kg Factrel; Ayerst, Guelph, Canada) 7 days apart. Uterine tissues were collected at the early stages of implantation from randomly selected females at days 13 and 15 following the first prolactin injections as well as from pseudopregnant animals. As we have previously shown (35Murphy B.D. Rajkumar K. Gonzalez Reyna A. Silversides D.W. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 47: 181-188Google Scholar), the natural increases in prolactin and consequent progesterone synthesis take place in pseudopregnant animals, and samples were therefore collected and collected at 30 days after induction of the first ovulation. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C until analyzed. Cell Culture—An immortalized mink uterine stromal cell line (36Moreau G.M. Arslan A. Douglas D.A. Song J. Smith L.C. Murphy B.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used for the in vitro experiments described herein. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), containing 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 0.5% of Fungizone (Invitrogen). A naturally immortalized cell line from an ovarian tumor of the mink 3D. A. Douglas and B. D. Murphy, unpublished results. was also used for transfection experiments. This cell line was maintained in Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics, as above. A human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, kindly made available by Dr. Wilson Miller was also employed. MCF-7 cells were maintained in the same medium as the mink ovarian cells described above. Embryo Collection and Radioimmunoassay for PGE2—Embryos were collected by repeated flushing of the uterine horns of females in diapause and 9 days following initial embryo activation (37Desmarais J.A. Bordignon V. Lopes F.L. Smith L.C. Murphy B.D. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with TC-199 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Embryos (in groups of five) were incubated in 500 μl of INRA Menezo B2 medium (Pharmascience, Paris, France) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 48 h in the presence or absence of mink uterine cells. For radioimmunoassay, 100 μl of embryo or cell culture medium were employed. The radioimmunoassay for PGE2 was performed according to Xiao et al. (38Xiao C.W. Murphy B.D. Sirois J. Goff A.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-serum from Assay Design (Ann Arbor, MI) was used with reactivity of 100% with PGE2 and of 70, 1.4, 0.7, and 0.6% with PGE1, prostaglandin F1α, prostaglandin F2α, and ketoprostaglandin F1α, respectively. Assay sensitivity was 4 pg/100 μl, and the intra-assay coefficient of variation, calculated between duplicates ranged from 0.04 to 6.1%. Extraction of RNA, Purification, and Reverse Transcription— Uterine tissues were homogenized in buffer RLT (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) with 0.12 m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Purification of RNA was performed using an RNeasy Protect Mini kit (Qiagen), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Total RNA was measured by spectrophotometry at 260 nm, and 1 μg/sample of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with the Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR for PGE Synthase and Receptors in the Mink Uterine Samples—Homologous sequences of rat (accession numbers: PGEs, NM_021583; EP-1, NM_013100; EP-2, NM_031088; EP-4, D28860), mouse (PGEs, NM_022415; EP-1, NM_013641; EP-2, NM_008964; EP-3, NM_011196), and human (EP-1, NM_000955; EP-2, NM_000956; EP-3, NM_000957; EP-4, NM_000958) were used to design primers for PGE synthase and for PGE receptors (Table 1). PCR products of the expected size were excised and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNA was ligated into a pDrive vector (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions and further transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue. Plasmids were isolated with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by automated DNA sequencing for verification (Service d'Analyze et de Synthèse d'Acides Nucléiques de Université Laval, Québec, Canada). PCRs were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl using Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). PCR products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotides used to amplify PGE synthase and the EP receptorsOligonucleotide nameSequence (5′-3′)PGEs forwardGCTGCGGAAGAAGGCTTTTGPGEs reverseAGGTAGGCCACGGTGTGTACEP1 forwardGGCGGCTGCATGGTCTTCTTEP1 reverseCAGCAGATGCACGACACCACEP2 forwardGCCACGATGCTCATGCTCTTEP2 reverseGAATGAGGTGGTCCGTCTCCEP3 forwardGGAGAGCAAGCGCAAGAAGTEP3 reverseCTGATGAAGCACCACGTCCEP4 forwardATCTTCGGGGTGGTGGGCAAEP4 reverseTTGATGGCCAGGTAGCGCTC Open table in a new tab Cloning and Sequencing of the Mink VEGF 5′-Untranslated Region and Promoter Regions—The 5′-flanking region of the mink VEGF gene was cloned by PCR using the Universal Genome Walker Kit (Clontech) from a library constructed from mink genomic DNA. The Expand High Fidelity kit served for amplification. The PCR products were cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Qiagen) for sequencing, which was performed by automated DNA sequencing (Service d'Analyze et de Synthèse d'Acides Nucléiques de Université Laval). Sequence analysis was undertaken using MatInspector (Abteilung Genetek, Braunschweig, Germany) and TF Search (Yukata Akiyama; TF Search: Searching TF Binding Sites). The transcription start site of the VEGF gene was predicted using the program for promoter prediction of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (University of California, Berkeley, CA). To confirm prediction, we employed the 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Applied Science) to identify the site of transcription initiation from 2.9 kb of the mink 5′-flanking region. Primers for amplification are described in Table 2.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides employed for 5′-RACE and ChIPOligonucleotide nameSequence (5′-3′)5′RACE-Sp1TTGACCCTGTCCCTGTCGTTGC5′RACE-Sp2CTCTGACCCCGTCTCTCTCTCT5′RACE-Sp3GGGGAAGTAAAGGAGCGATCTCChIP-forwardCAGGGGTCACGCCAGTATTCCAChIP-reverseCCTCTGCGCTCCCTACCACTA Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemical Analysis of Microsomal PGE Synthase— Tissues fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution were used to demonstrate expression of PGE synthase during the early implantation stages. Sections were rehydrated and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline. Blocking was performed for 1 h using 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human PGE synthase (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) diluted 1:150 in 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. A conjugated Cy3 anti-rabbit second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was employed for 1 h to localize PGE synthase. Tissues were counterstained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Roche Applied Science). Normal rabbit serum was used as negative control. Plasmid Constructions—The 1.7-kb sequence of the mink VEGF gene was cloned into a pGL2 basic vector (Promega). All deletions were derived from the original construct by PCR using KPNI and XHOI insertions for directional cloning. Mutation of the predicted AP2 and Sp1 sites was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids used for transient transfection were prepared using the Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced prior to transfection. Transfections, Luciferase Reporter Assays, and Treatments— Just prior to transfection, culture medium was changed to Opti-MEM lacking fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics in all cell lines were used. Transfection and treatments were carried out in 24-well plates in this medium. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with 400 ng/well of the pGL2 basic vector, containing the mink VEGF promoter constructs, for 5 h prior to the addition of treatments. Medium was changed following the 5 h of transfection, and treatments were added 1 h following transfection. Cells were cotransfected with the SV40 Renilla luciferase control vector pRL.SV40 (Promega) to normalize the results for transfection efficiency. Control transfections received equal amounts of the pGL2 basic vector (Promega) devoid of promoter constructs. Treatments comprised the addition of doses of PGE2 (Sigma) from 10 to 100 μm for 6-24 h. To test the role of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, some cultures were treated with 100 μm and 1 mm dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma) and chlorophenylthio-cAMP (Sigma) for 12 h or the PKA inhibitor H89 (Sigma) at a dose of 10μm beginning 1 h prior to PGE2 treatment. To establish which of the PGE2 receptors were involved, antagonists for PGE2 receptors EP1 (SC19220; 10 μm; Sigma), EP2 (AH6809; 20 μm; Sigma), and EP4 (AH2384B; 30 μm; Sigma) were added to transfected cells 1 h prior to treatment with PGE2. Luciferase activity was evaluated using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega), and chemiluminescence was measured with a Berthold 9501 luminometer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described by Kuo and Allis (39Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mink uterine stromal cells were plated in a 10-cm plate and treated after confluence with 75 μm PGE2 for 6 h. Prior to treatment, cells were serum-starved for 20 h. Following treatment, DNA and protein were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde to the medium at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 200 μl of ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitors), and sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 450 (Danbury, CT) at power setting 2 with 10-s pulses at duty cycle 90. ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 16.7 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors) was used to dilute the chromatin solution 10-fold. Total DNA used for controlling the amount of DNA/sample was purified from one-tenth of the lysate. Each sample was precleared by incubating with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% gel slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 30 min at 4 °C. Anti-acetyl histone H-3 (5 μg; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-AP2 (5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Sp1 (5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit IgG (as negative controls) were added and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitate was collected using salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose and washed once with buffers in the following order: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1); TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The DNA-protein or histone cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h followed by proteinase K treatment. DNA was then recovered and purified with the Qiaquik PCR purification column (Qiagen). PCR was carried with an annealing temperature of 61 °C. The primers used for the PCR are depicted in Table 2. Primers derived from the open reading frame of the gene were employed as controls. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and ethidium bromide was used for visualization. Statistical Analysis—The relative luciferase activity throughout this study was analyzed using the least squares analysis of variance and the general linear model procedures of SAS (Cary, NC). When significant differences in treatments were found, comparisons of means were further performed by the methods of orthogonal contrasts and the Duncan multiple range test. A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Embryonic Production of PGE2—Embryos collected during the diapause and activation stages were incubated in the presence or absence of mink uterine cells to determine their capability to produce PGE2. Embryos in diapause failed to produce and/or secrete detectable levels of PGE2. The embryos collected following activation by prolactin treatment and that were therefore in active growth (37Desmarais J.A. Bordignon V. Lopes F.L. Smith L.C. Murphy B.D. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) produced copious quantities of PGE2 (Fig. 1A), either alone or in co-culture with uterine cells. Uterine cells alone failed to produce this prostaglandin. Expression of PGE Synthase and EP Receptor mRNA in the Uterus— Uterine tissues collected from implantation and interimplantation sites as well as uteri collected from pseudopregnant females contained mRNA for PGE synthase. The abundance of mRNA for this enzyme was ∼7-fold greater in tissues collected from the implantation sites, composed of both embryonic and uterine components, at 3-4 days following implantation compared with all other uterine samples studied (Fig. 1B). EP1 receptor expression was negligible, whereas the receptors of the EP2 and EP4 subtypes were expressed at all stages and locations collected, with no apparent difference among the samples (Fig. 1B). The EP3 receptor mRNA was not detected at any of the sites or stages investigated (data not shown). Immunohistochemical Localization of PGE Synthase in the Pregnant Mink Uterus—Given the increased expression of the PGE synthase observed at implantation sites (Fig. 1B), we were interested in establishing whether it was of uterine or embryonic origin. We found the PGE synthase protein to be present in the myometrium of all stages evaluated (Fig. 2E). In the endometrium, PGE synthase was localized in the stromal layer immediately surrounding the implanting embryo (Fig. 2, A-C), whereas no significant localization was observed in the uterine tissue opposite to the invading trophoblasts (Fig. 2D). Histological sections from interimplantation sites further confirmed that pattern, in that endometrial cells in these regions, lacking direct contact with embryonic tissue, did not express this protein (Fig. 2, E and F). Cloning and Sequencing of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Mink VEGF Gene—A 2.9-kb sequence upstream of the ATG triplet was identified by means of the Genome Walker kit (Clontech) (accession number DQ381737). The transcription initiation site at 1058 bp upstream of the ATG triplet was predicted by means of the promoter prediction program of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and confirmed by 5′-RACE using the RNA of three different mink samples, two of uterine and one of ovarian origin. The VEGF proximal promoter region in the mink bears a high homology to the human (81%) and mouse sequences (72%) (accession numbers AF095785 and U41383, respectively). Matinspector analysis of the mink promoter sequence identified several potential response element sequences previously identified in the human and mouse VEGF promoters, AP1, AP2, and Sp1, among others. Concurring with the human and mouse counterparts, there was no consensus TATA box motif present, whereas an important GC-rich region was found in the proximal promoter region, about 70 bp upstream of the transcription start site. PGE2 Induces VEGF Transcription—We employed the reporter gene luciferase driven by the mink VEGF proximal promoter in mink uterine stromal cells. We observed that PGE2 was capable of inducing a 3-fold induction in transcription of the reporter gene, in response to the doses of 75 and 100 μm (p < 0.05), and a 2-fold induction to the dose of 50 μm, whereas 10 μm resulted in a modest but nonsignificant 50% elevation (Fig. 3A). Similar levels of induction were observed at the three different times tested, 6, 12, and 24 h of PGE2 treatment (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we tested transfection of other cell types and consequent response to prostaglandin treatment in the form of in"
https://openalex.org/W2026387468,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNR52 gene is unique among the snoRNA coding genes in being transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The primary transcript of SNR52 is a 250-nucleotide precursor RNA from which a long leader sequence is cleaved to generate the mature snR52 RNA. We found that the box A and box B sequence elements in the leader region are both required for the in vivo accumulation of the snoRNA. As expected box B, but not box A, was absolutely required for stable TFIIIC, yet in vitro. Surprisingly, however, the box B was found to be largely dispensable for in vitro transcription of SNR52, whereas the box A-mutated template effectively recruited TFIIIB; yet it was transcriptionally inactive. Even in the complete absence of box B and both upstream TATA-like and T-rich elements, the box A still directed efficient, TFIIIC-dependent transcription. Box B-independent transcription was also observed for two members of the tRNAAsn(GTT) gene family, but not for two tRNAPro(AGG) gene copies. Fully recombinant TFIIIC supported box B-independent transcription of both SNR52 and tRNAAsn genes, but only in the presence of TFIIIB reconstituted with a crude B″ fraction. Non-TFIIIB component(s) in this fraction were also required for transcription of wild-type SNR52. Transcription of the box B-less tRNAAsn genes was strongly influenced by their 5′-flanking regions, and it was stimulated by TBP and Brf1 proteins synergistically. The box A can thus be viewed as a core TFIIIC-interacting element that, assisted by upstream TFIIIB-DNA contacts, is sufficient to promote class III gene transcription.

RNA polymerase (Pol) 3The abbreviations used are: Pol, RNA polymerase; TF, transcription factor; ICR, internal control region; TSS, transcription start site; wt, wild type; nt, nucleotides; r, recombinant. III synthesizes tRNA, 5 S rRNA, and a variety of other types of small nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs. In general, the transcription of class III genes is under the control of internal control regions (ICR) characterized by discontinuous structures, with essential boxes separated by non-essential nucleotides (1Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In the case of tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes, the ICRs are highly conserved and comprise the binding sites for the general transcription factor TFIIIC (box A and box B) and for the 5 S-specific factor TFIIIA (box C). Once assembled, TFIIIC recruits TFIIIB upstream of the transcription start site (TSS); TFIIIB in turn recruits Pol III for transcription initiation. The strong conservation of the ICRs likely reflects their dual function as both nucleation sites for transcription complex assembly and key determinants of tRNA and 5 S rRNA structure. An indication of the constraints imposed on ICR by their overlapping structural and functional roles comes from the variability of promoter organizations displayed by the minority of class III genes not coding for tRNA and 5 S rRNA. In some of these genes, the TFIIIC-interacting control regions (box A and box B) have been maintained within the transcribed region, and adapted to the structure of the small RNA without losing the transcriptional function. For example, in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SCR1 gene, coding for the 7SL RNA, box A and box B are both intragenic and involved in transcription, yet their sequences display distinguishing features as compared with the consensus of the tDNA box A and box B (2Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the S. cerevisiae SNR6 gene, coding for the U6 snRNA, a non-canonical, yet transcriptionally relevant box A has been maintained within the transcribed region, whereas the box B is located downstream of the transcription termination site (3Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Burnol A.F. Margottin F. Schultz P. Marsolier M.C. Oudet P. Sentenac A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other class III genes entirely rely for transcription on upstream promoter elements, an organization that completely removes the need for the reciprocal adaptation of transcription control elements and RNA structure. One group of such genes, exemplified by the metazoan U6 snRNA and the human 7SK RNA genes, exploits upstream promoter elements similar to those of Pol II-transcribed genes (5Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other genes, such as RPR1, coding for the RNA component of S. cerevisiae RNase P (6Lee J.Y. Evans C.F. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6986-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the 7SL RNA genes of Trypanosomatidae (7Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Beja O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), have adopted a promoter strategy that places a tRNA gene-like promoter, containing box A and box B, upstream of the mature 5′-end of the RNA. Such a strategy has recently been found to be employed for box C/D snoRNA expression in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, where some snoRNAs are synthesized as tRNA-snoRNA precursors originated by Pol III transcription of tRNA-snoRNA dicistronic genes (9Kruszka K. Barneche F. Guyot R. Ailhas J. Meneau I. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Echeverria M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, recent studies of the genome-wide localization of the Pol III transcription machinery in S. cerevisiae have identified the snoRNA-encoding SNR52 gene as a new class III gene, and sequence analysis has revealed the presence, upstream of the snoRNA coding sequence, of box A and box B elements that could together act as an external, tRNA gene-like promoter (10Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M. Lefebvre O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Roberts D.N. Stewart A.J. Huff J.T. Cairns B.R. Proc.

TFIIIC can specifically associate to target genes characterized by very different promoter configurations. This is because of the remarkable adaptability of this DNA-binding protein, which is related to the complexity and modular organization of its molecular structure. In particular, TFIIIC can bind to, and promote transcription of, templates characterized by very different box A-box B distances, from 20 to several hundred bp (13Baker R.E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8768-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Fabrizio P. Coppo A. Fruscoloni P. Benedetti P. Di Segni G. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc.

A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This property, together with the results of limited proteolysis (16Marzouki N. Camier S. Ruet A. Moenne A. Sentenac A. Nature. 1986; 323: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy studies (17Schultz P. Marzouki N. Marck C. Ruet A. Oudet P. Sentenac A. Camier S. Moenne A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3815-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggests that TFIIIC consists of two DNA binding modules separated by a flexible linker that can accommodate variously spaced A and B boxes. The TFIIIC-box B interaction gives the major contribution to the stability of the TFIIIC-DNA complex, while TFIIIC-box A contacts promote TFIIIB assembly and precise transcription initiation (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A completely different mode of DNA binding by TFIIIC is that involved in 5 S rRNA gene transcription. In this case, TFIIIC is recruited to the target gene essentially through protein-protein interaction with 5 S DNA-bound TFIIIA (19Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity of TFIIIC action, DNA-bound TFIIIC has recently been shown to be involved in Pol III-facilitated recycling in the yeast system (15Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Dieci G. Sentenac A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 202-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In some cases, discrepancies have been observed between box A/box B requirements for class III gene transcription in vitro and in vivo. Such discrepancies could be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that suboptimally bound TFIIIC can efficiently recruit TFIIIB in vitro, but is impaired in its ability to counteract repressive chromatin assembly in vivo (2Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Marsolier M.C. Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Grunstein M. Thoma F. Sentenac A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro, a defective interaction between TFIIIC and its split binding site can be tolerated and may result in only a moderate transcriptional impairment, provided that such interaction is stable enough to allow the formation of long lived (kinetically trapped) TFIIIB-DNA complexes (22Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek P.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 23Cloutier T.E. Librizzi M.D. Mollah A.K. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9581-9586Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This mainly occurs for mutations of the box A that do not reduce dramatically the affinity of TFIIIC for the promoter (1Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Though highly variable in sequence, the 5′-flanking region of A box- and B box-containing genes constitutes the binding site for TFIIIB, and may thus exert a strong influence on transcription efficiency (see Ref. 24Giuliodori S. Percudani R. Braglia P. Ferrari R. Guffanti E. Ottonello S. Dieci G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and references therein). In some eukaryotic genomes, the upstream regions of ICR-containing class III genes are characterized by the presence of a TATA box, starting at around -30, which strongly contributes to transcription efficiency as an essential component of the promoter (25Yukawa Y. Sugita M. Choisne N. Small I. Sugiura M. Plant J. 2000; 22: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Hamada M. Huang Y. Lowe T.M. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In some cases, the upstream TATA element can even allow for TFIIIC-independent in vitro transcription (27Margottin F. Dujardin G. Gerard M. Egly J.M. Huet J. Sentenac A. Science. 1991; 251: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whatever the mode of TFIIIC assembly, this factor acts in concert with TFIIIB to promote transcription of both TATA-less and TATA-containing class III genes. On TATA-less tRNA genes, TFIIIC binding initiates a series of protein-protein interactions ultimately resulting in TFIIIB assembly onto upstream DNA, with a key interaction taking place between the Tfc4 subunit of TFIIIC and the Brf1 component of TFIIIB (29Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Moir R.D. Willis I.M. Adv. Protein. Chem. 2004; 67: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we have carried out an extensive in vitro an in vivo analysis of SNR52 promoter architecture. Unexpectedly, we found that box B is dispensable whereas box A is essential for in vitro transcription of SNR52. This finding prompted us to re-evaluate the contribution of TFIIIC-box B interaction to promoter strength and its actual requirement for tRNA gene transcription. Amplification and Cloning of DNA Templates—The S. cerevisiae SNR52 gene was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA (strain S288C) using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and gene-specific pairs of oligonucleotide primers: SNR52_fw 5′-CTTTGAAAAGATAATGTATGATTATGC and SNR52_rev 5′-GCGTTCCATACTGTCAGAGGT. The amplified fragment (415 bp) contained the SNR52 transcribed sequence (260 bp) plus 110 bp of 5′-flanking and 45 bp of 3′-flanking sequences. The SNR52 Adown, Bdown, Tdown mutant variants were obtained by recombinant PCR (31Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, NY1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Two overlapping PCR primary products were generated using the SNR52_fw oligonucleotide in combination with 5′-GCGCACCTTTAGGGCTAGCCCAAGAAG and the SNR52_rev oligonucleotide in combination with the oligonucleotide 5′-CCTCCTGGGCTAGCCCTAAAGGTGCGC (mutagenic bases underlined). After gel purification, primary amplification products were mixed and used as templates in a subsequent amplification reaction, employing SNR52_fw and SNR52_rev as “outside” primers, which yielded the desired full-length secondary product. The same strategy was employed for the Bdown and the T down variants, using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: 5′-GGAGAAGTTTCCAACGCCGAAACATGC and 5′-GCATGTTTCGGCGTTGGAAACTTCTCC for the Bdown mutation; 5′-GTAGGGTGTGAACGAATGCGCACC and 5′-GGTGCGCATTCGTTCACACCCTAC for the Tdown mutation. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the SmaI site of the pUC-derived plasmid pNEB193 (New England Biolabs). For yeast transformation, all the inserts were subcloned into the shuttle vector pFL45S (32Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). 5′-mutated forms of SNR52 were obtained through amplification using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides as forward primers: SNR52 5′Δ-58, 5′-TGATGTTTTCTTTCGAGTATATAC; SNR52 5′Δ-58mut, 5′-TGATGTTCTCTCTCGAGTATGTGC; SNR52 5′Δ-7, 5′-CAACTCTAGATTTTGTAGTGCCC; and SNR52_rev as reverse primer, and the proper plasmid template. 3′-Truncated forms of SNR52 constructs (3′Δ+60) were obtained through PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAAAAAAAAATTGTAGGGTGTG as a reverse primer in combination with the different forward primers. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into pNEB193. The plasmids containing the S. cerevisiae tRNA genes tN(GTT)CR, tN(GTT)NR, tP(AGG)CR, and tP(AGG)NR have been described (24Giuliodori S. Percudani R. Braglia P. Ferrari R. Guffanti E. Ottonello S. Dieci G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Their 3′Δ+64 truncated versions were prepared using the following reverse primers: 5′-GGAAAAAAAACACGATCTTGCGATTAAC for tDNAAsn(GTT) and 5′-GGAAAAAAAAACGGGACCTCC for tDNAPro(AGG). All the constructs were sequence-verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. DNA Binding Assays—For DNase I footprinting analysis, a 415-bp SNR52 fragment, 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP on the sense strand, was generated by PCR using 5′-labeled SNR52_fw and unlabeled SNR52_rev oligonucleotides as primers, and the wt, Adown, Bdown, or Tdown versions of SNR52 as templates. 4 fmol (∼20000 cpm) of the purified fragment were incubated with 0.6 μg of TFIIIC, partially purified up to the DEAE Sephadex A-25 step following a previously described procedure (34Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in 18-μl binding reaction mixtures containing 160 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml supercoiled pBlueScript-KS plasmid DNA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The complex was treated with 0.5 ng (0.05 units) of pancreatic DNaseI (Amersham Biosciences, E2215Y type) for 1 min at 25 °C. The digestion was stopped with 20 mm EDTA. Footprinting mixtures were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel, sided by products obtained from a dideoxy chain termination sequencing reaction conducted on wt SNR52 using the 5′-labeled SNR52_fw oligonucleotide. The gel was phosphorimaged with a Personal Imager FX (Bio-Rad). For gel retardation assays, 445-bp DNA fragments, containing the wt or mutated SNR52 transcription unit, were prepared by BamHI-SacI digestion of the corresponding pNEB193 plasmids. The fragments were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega), gel-purified, and quantified by ethidium bromide staining. 3 fmol of DNA fragment (15,000 cpm) were then incubated 15 min at 25 °C with 0.6 μg of partially purified TFIIIC in a final volume of 15 μl. The standard binding reaction mixture contained 90 mm (NH4)2SO4, 13 μg/ml supercoiled pBlueScript-KS plasmid DNA, 1.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/HCl pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA. In TFIIIB-containing reactions, DNA was first incubated with TFIIIC, then recombinant TFIIIB components (prepared as described below) were added in amounts ranging from 20 to 160 ng (see legend to Fig. 4). The complexes were loaded on a pre-equilibrated native polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide, 0,048% bisacrylamide) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. The running buffer contained 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After loading, the gel was run 4-6 h at 4 °C, with frequent changes of running buffer. The gels were then dried and phosphorimaged. In Vitro Transcription Assays—Transcription of class III genes was reconstituted in vitro essentially as described (15Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19551-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All reactions contained 0.6 μg of TFIIIC partially purified up to the DEAE Sephadex A-25 step (34Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that yeast nuclear extract (35Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a starting material; 40 ng of recombinant TBP and 80 ng of recombinant Brf1, both purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli cells (34Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 10 ng of highly purified RNA polymerase III (15Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a source of Bdp1 protein, required to reconstitute TFIIIB activity, we used either 1.5 μg of B″ fraction, partially purified from chromatin pellets generated during yeast nuclear extract preparation (36Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), or 30 ng of recombinant 8His-Bdp1 protein purified from baculovirus-infected cells (15Ferrari R. Rivetti C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fully recombinant TFIIIC was expressed and purified as described (38Ducrot C. Lefebvre O. Landrieux E. Guirouilh-Barbat J. Sentenac A. Acker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11685-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the preparation of recombinant Nhp6A protein used in the experiment in Fig. 7C, the S. cerevisiae NHP6A open reading frame was cloned into a modified version of pET28b containing an engineered PmeI restriction site into the polylinker to facilitate cloning of PCR products (39Bolchi A. Ottonello S. Petrucco S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2005; 42: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The construct was transformed into BL21 Rosetta™(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen). Nhp6A expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) and incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. The His6-Nhp6A protein in the soluble fraction was purified by chromatography on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) under non-denaturing conditions, following the manufacturer's instructions. The template of in vitro transcription reactions (100-200 ng of class III gene-containing plasmid) was preincubated at 20 °C for 20′ in a 45-μl reaction mixture (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 8% (v/v) glycerol, 8 units of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion)) in the presence of transcription proteins (except Pol III). Pol III was then added together with cold NTPs (500 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP; 25 μm UTP) and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and multiple rounds of transcription were allowed to take place for 20 min at 20 °C. Radiolabeled transcripts were separated on 6% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels, and visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging using a Personal Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Primer extension analysis of in vitro produced transcripts was performed essentially as described (28Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions were carried out under the above described conditions, except that radiolabeled UTP was not included. Reaction products were then purified and used for primer extension analysis with Superscript III RNase H- (Invitrogen) as a reverse transcriptase (200 units/reaction) and the 5′-end-radiolabeled oligonucleotide primer: 5′-GTATCAGAGATTGTTCACGCTAATG. In Vivo RNA Analyses—The SNR52-null strain used for in vivo analyses is yM4585 (MATa his3Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3,2-112 trp1-901 tyr1-501 URA3 ADE2 CANS ΔSNR52-HIS3) (40Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), in which the 92-bp sequence corresponding to the mature snR52 RNA, plus ∼10 bp of upstream and downstream flanking sequences, have been deleted and substituted with the HIS3 marker gene. RNA extraction was performed as described (41Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) from cells grown to an A600 of 0.8-1 in the appropriate selective medium. 15 μg of total RNA were fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide/7 m urea minigel, then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filter was hybridized 15 h at 42 °C with a 5′-end-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-CAGAAGGAAGGCAACATAAGT) in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, followed by two 10-min washing at 30 °C with 0.1% SDS and SSC 2× and then SSC 1×. The U3-specific oligonucleotide probe used for normalization was 5′-CTTTGCCGTTGCATTTGTAGTTTTTTCCTTTGGAAGT. Mutational Analysis of the SNR52 Promoter—The S. cerevisiae SNR52 gene has recently been identified as a novel class III transcription unit in which a snoRNA coding region is preceded by a leader region containing putative box A and box B control regions, as well as a TATA element located ∼60-bp upstream of the box A (10Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M. Lefebvre O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The sequence and organization of the SNR52 transcription unit are reported in Fig. 1A. Both the box A and box B upstream of the snoRNA coding sequence can be easily recognized by analysis with the Pol3scan program (42Pavesi A. Conterio F. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and have been recently found to be conserved in hemiascomycetes (43Marck C. Kachouri-Lafond R. Lafontaine I. Westhof E. Dujon B. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1816-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The distance between the two putative control elements (86 bp) is considerably higher than the average distance found in the yeast tRNA gene complement (37 bp). A curious feature of the transcription unit is the presence of a run of 6 consecutive T residues located a few bp downstream of the box A. Even though the T6 sequence is a strong termination signal for Pol III, we have recently shown that it behaves as an unusually weak terminator in the SNR52 context (33Braglia P. Percudani R. Dieci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19551-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The T6 element might be relevant for SNR52 expression, because it is also present in this position in the genomes of at least two other Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus and S. mikatae). To start to characterize the SNR52 promoter, we amplified the SNR52 transcription unit from yeast genomic DNA, and we introduced mutations into the different putative control elements: box A, box B, and the T run between them. The wt and mutant templates were assayed for their ability to support Pol III transcription both in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro assays, we used a Pol III-specific in vitro transcription system containing balanced amounts of recombinant TBP and Brf1 proteins, partially purified B″ and TFIIIC fractions and highly purified RNA polymerase III (34Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vivo analysis, mutagenized SNR52 derivatives were inserted into the multicopy pFL45S vector (32Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and transformed into a snr52::HIS3-null mutant strain (kindly provided by Lowe and Eddy (40Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar)). The results of in vitro transcription analysis are shown in Fig. 1B. Transcription of the wt template produced a 250-nt long primary transcript and two smaller RNAs of 44-45 nt (lane 1). The shorter RNAs correspond to transcripts terminated at the internal T6 sequence; indeed, transcription of a mutant template in which the T run was interrupted produced higher levels of the full-length transcript, whereas the short RNAs disappeared (lane 4). Transcript quantification, conducted by taking into account the different number of radiolabeled U residues incorporated into RNAs of different sizes, revealed only a slight decrease in transcription of the T-run mutant with respect to wt. In contrast, a double point mutation in the box A (CC in place of the universally conserved GG at positions +29, +30) abolished specific in vitro transcription (lane 2). Surprisingly, a G to C replacement in the box B, predicted to abolish TFIIIC binding and transcription (see for example (2Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. C"
https://openalex.org/W1983293287,"Src protein-tyrosine kinase contains a myristoylation motif, a unique region, an Src homology (SH) 3 domain, an SH2 domain, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail contains a Tyr residue, Tyr527. Phosphorylation of Tyr527 triggers Src inactivation, caused by Tyr(P)527 binding to the SH2 domain. In this study, we demonstrated that a conformational contribution, not affinity, is the predominant force for the intramolecular SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding, and we characterized the structural basis for this conformational contribution. First, a phosphopeptide mimicking the C-terminal tail is an 80-fold weaker ligand than the optimal phosphopeptide, pYEEI, and similar to a phosphopeptide containing three Ala residues following Tyr(P) in binding to the Src SH2 domain. Second, the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding is largely independent of the amino acid sequence surrounding Tyr(P)527, and only slightly decreased by an inactivating mutation in the SH2 domain. Furthermore, even the unphosphorylated C-terminal tail with the sequence of YEEI suppresses Src activity by binding to the SH2 domain. These experiments demonstrate that very weak affinity is sufficient for the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding in Src inactivation. Third, the effective intramolecular SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding is attributed to a conformational contribution that requires residues Trp260 and Leu255. Although the SH3 domain is essential for Src inactivation by Tyr(P)527, it does not contribute to the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding. These findings suggest a conformation-based Src inactivation model, which provides a unifying framework for understanding Src activation by a variety of mechanisms.

Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), cytokine receptors and antigen receptors (2Mustelin T. Kerkaporta C. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-55Google Scholar), and G-protein-coupled receptors (3Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the cell, Src normally exists in the inactivated form and can be activated by numerous mechanisms in response to upstream signals (4Brown M.T. Copper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Activated Src phosphorylates a large number of proteins to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, regulate the cell cycle, stimulate DNA synthesis, and trigger cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration (4Brown M.T. Copper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of Src results in cell transformation (5Kato J.Y. Takeya T. Grandori C. Iba H. Levy J.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and is associated with numerous human cancers (6Levin V.A. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 119: 89-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), making Src an important proto-oncogene and target for drug discovery (7Parang K. Sun G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2004; 7: 617-629PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidating the regulatory structure-function relationships of Src is important for understanding physiological and oncogenic signal transduction.The foundation for Src regulation is its complex multidomain organization and domain-domain interaction (4Brown M.T. Copper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). It has an N-terminal myristoylation motif responsible for association with the plasma membrane, followed by a unique region, an SH3 domain that binds to Pro-rich peptide sequences, an SH2 domain that binds to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, a catalytic domain responsible for phosphorylating substrates, and a C-terminal regulatory tail. Phosphorylation of a Tyr residue (Tyr527) on the C-terminal tail by a pair of cytosolic PTKs, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or Csk homologous kinase, inactivates Src (8Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-Tyr527 on the C-terminal tail (Tyr(P)527) binds to the SH2 domain, stabilizing a compact and inactive conformation (9Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527 results in Src activation because of SH2-tail dissociation. The crystal structures of the inactivated Src (10Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 11Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) and an active form of Src (12Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have been determined.In the inactivated structure (10Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 11Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), the SH3 and the SH2 domains are located in the backside of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1). The SH2 domain binds to Tyr(P)527 of the C-terminal tail. The SH2-catalytic linker (2-C linker) is sandwiched between the SH3 domain and the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. The linker binds to the SH3 domain and also forms hydrophobic interactions with the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In the catalytic domain, the α-helix C and the activation loop assume conformations that are consistent with inactive kinases. The structure of one active form of Src has been determined (12Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), in which the SH3 and SH2 domains and the 2-C linker act as one structural unit and flip to the other side of the kinase domain. In the active structure, the SH3 domain still binds to the 2-C linker, and the α-helix C and the activation loop assume conformations characteristic of active kinases.Kinetic studies (13Wang D. Esselman W.J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40428-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Src phosphorylated on Tyr527 (p-Src) exists in equilibrium between a closed form where the SH2 domain binds to Tyr(P)527 (∼98%) and an open form where the SH2 domain is not occupied by Tyr(P)527 (∼2%). The inactivated Src is subject to activation by numerous mechanisms that can be divided into two broad categories. The first category, including dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527 (14Shenoy S. Chackalaparampil I. Bagrodia S. Lin P.H. Shalloway D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or an SH2 domain ligand displacing the C-terminal tail from the SH2 domain (1Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), directly disrupts the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding. The second category, including the SH3 domain binding to a proline-rich protein motif (16Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 17Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation in the activation loop on Tyr527 (18Sun G. Sharma A.K. Budde R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or Src binding to the activated α-subunit of G-proteins (19Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), does not directly disrupt the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding. It is not clear if the second category of mechanisms indirectly destabilize the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding, and if so, how the disruption is achieved. For either category of activation mechanisms, the molecular dynamics of the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding likely provides the foundation for the activation.To understand the molecular dynamics of Src inactivation and activation, we characterized the basis for the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding. Our results demonstrated that the SH2 domain and the phosphorylated C-terminal tail had very low intrinsic affinity, and their binding largely depended on a conformational contribution that resulted in an effective SH2/tail concentration of 59 mm. Furthermore, the conformation-driven binding is dependent on 2-C linker residues, Trp260 and Leu255, but independent of the SH3 domain. These results provide structural insights into the conformational basis for the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding in Src inactivation and a unifying framework for understanding Src activation by a variety of mechanisms.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Chemicals—All reagents used for bacterial culture and protein expression were purchased from Fisher. Chromatographic resins were purchased from Sigma. DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Phosphopeptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Their molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry.Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The construction of human Csk expression plasmid (pGEX-Csk) (20Sun G. Budde R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), kdSrc expression plasmid (pRSET-kdSrc) (21Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was previously described. The inserted DNA fragments were sequenced to ensure that the sequences were correct. Site-specific kdSrc mutants were generated by introducing specific mutations into pRSET-kdSrc. For expression of the kdSrc-ΔSH3, the fragment encoding the SH3 domain was deleted from the kdSrc coding region in pRSET-kdSrc. For expression of the fusion proteins, bacterial cells containing recombinant plasmids were used to inoculate 600 ml of Luria-Bertani culture medium. Bacterial cell culture, induction of fusion protein expression, cell lysis, and protein purification were performed as described previously (22Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Preparation of kdSrc and Mutants Phosphorylated on Tyr527—For kdSrc and most kdSrc mutants used in this study, the phosphorylated form was prepared by co-expressing kdSrc with Csk in Escherichia coli. A separate plasmid pCDF-Csk was introduced to BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the Src expression plasmid. The pCDF-Csk plasmid directs the synthesis of Csk that is not affinity-tagged. kdSrc and kdSrc mutant proteins purified from such cells were phosphorylated on Tyr527 and could not be further phosphorylated by Csk in vitro. Exceptions to this general pattern were kdSrc-W260A and kdSrc-L255A, which were not fully phosphorylated upon purification and could be further phosphorylated by Csk. These two proteins were further phosphorylated in vitro by excess amounts of Csk and then repurified. Such in vitro phosphorylated proteins were used for binding analyses. The lack of full phosphorylation in bacteria by Csk for these two proteins was likely because of the fact that Tyr(P)527 did not bind to the SH2 domain and thus exposed to dephosphorylation by general phosphatase activities in bacterial cells.Expression of Active Src Kinase—Active human Src kinase was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and protein-Tyr phosphatase 1B as described elsewhere (36Wang Y.-H. Ayrapetov M.K. Lin X. Sun G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant expression of active Src in bacteria causes extensive degradation to Src and very low yield of expression and purification. Such a problem is associated with the intrinsic kinase activity of Src, likely because of Src phosphorylation of bacterial proteins. Addition of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase to the expression construct helps stabilize the plasmid and Src protein during expression and purification. A thrombin cleavage site was incorporated between the protein-tyrosine phosphatase and Src. Upon purification of the fusion protein, Src was separated from MBP and the phosphatase by thrombin digestion and purification on fast protein liquid chromatography.Fluorescence Polarization Assay and Kd Determination—The binding of a fluorescent phosphopeptide, Flu-GpYEEI, to kdSrc and kdSrc mutants was determined by the fluorescence polarization assay as described previously (23Ayrapetov M.K. Nam N.H. Ye G. Kumar A. Parang K. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25780-25787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To determine the binding of an unlabeled phosphopeptide to the SH2 domain, fluorescence polarization of 80 nm Flu-GpYEEI as the probe in the presence of 80 nm SH2 domain and variable concentrations of the unlabeled phosphopeptide was determined. Fluorescence polarization as a function of the total unlabeled phosphopeptide concentration was curve-fitted using the following equation: fluorescence polarization = A × ([SH2]t × [probe]t × Kd,2)/(Kd,1 × Kd,2 + Kd,1 × [peptide]t + [SH2]t × Kd,2), where Kd,1 was the dissociation constant of Flu-GpYEEI binding to the SH2 domain, which was pre-determined by the direct binding assay, and Kd,2 was the dissociation constant of unlabeled peptide binding to the SH2 domain. A is a conversion factor between the concentration of probe-SH2 complex and the fluorescence polarization value. [SH2]t, and [probe]t were total concentrations of the SH2 domain and the fluorescent probe, Flu-GpYEEI, respectively. [Peptide]t was the total concentration of the unlabeled phosphopeptide. All binding assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice with similar results.Kinase Activity Assay—To quantify the kinase of Csk and Src, poly(E4Y) (1 mg ml-1) was used as the phosphate-accepting substrate at 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 dpm pmol-1). The kinase reactions included both substrates and appropriate amounts of the kinase in the kinase assay buffer (75 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, 12 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.005% Triton X-100) (19Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was for 20 min, and the reaction was linear with reaction time and enzyme concentration under these conditions. To determine the inactivation of Src by Csk phosphorylation, the indicated amounts of Src or Src mutants were preincubated with varying amounts of Csk in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP in the kinase assay buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. At the end of the preincubation, poly(E4Y) and [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 dpm pmol-1) were added to the reaction. After an incubation at 30 °C for another 20 min, the reaction mixtures were spotted onto filter paper strips, which were then washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid (three times for 10 min each time). Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated poly(E4Y) was precipitated onto the filter paper, and the phosphate precipitated onto the filter paper was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The residual Src activity was determined by subtracting the Csk activity from the total kinase activity.Relationship between the Fraction of p-Src in the Closed Form and the Affinity between the Src SH2 Domain and Tyr(P)527—The following outlines the derivation of the quantitative relationship between the fraction of p-Src in the closed form and the affinity between the Src SH2 domain and Tyr(P)527. According to the binding equation, Ka-intra = (closed form)/(open form)2. If the fraction of Src in the closed form is C, then Ka-intra = ([Src] × C)/([Src] × (1-C))2. Because Ka-intra = Ka-inter × CEF, and CEF = 0.059/[Src], then Ka-inter × 0.059/[Src] = [Src] × C/([Src] × (1-C))2. This equation can be simplified as the following: Ka-inter = C/(0.059 × (1-C)2) (m-1).RESULTSA Phosphopeptide Mimicking the Phosphorylated C-terminal Tail of Src Has Weak Affinity for the Src SH2 Domain—The C-terminal tail of Src has the sequence of Pro-Gln-Tyr527-Gln-Pro-Gly, which is significantly different from the optimal phosphopeptide ligand for the Src SH2 domain, pYEEI (15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the phosphorylated C-terminal tail binds to the SH2 domain in the closed form of Src (10Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) and Hck (11Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), only Tyr(P)527 interacts with the SH2 domain, whereas the other tail residues have very little contact with the SH2 domain. These observations suggest that the phosphorylated C-terminal tail is not a high affinity ligand for the SH2 domain. We characterized this interaction by measuring the binding of the phosphopeptide, Pro-Gln-Tyr(P)527-Gln-Pro-Gly, to the SH2 domain in a kinase-defective mutant of Src (kdSrc). kdSrc contains an inactivating point mutation (K295M) and also lacks the myristoylation motif and the unique region at the N terminus. It retains the structural dynamics related to Tyr(P)527-triggered inactivation (13Wang D. Esselman W.J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40428-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding between the phosphopeptide and kdSrc was determined by a fluorescence polarization competition assay using fluoresceinated GpYEEI (Flu-GpYEEI) as a probe (Kd = 25 nm). The unfluoresceinated GpYEEI bound to the kdSrc SH2 domain tightly with a Kd value of 321 nm (Fig. 2). The phosphopeptide PQpYQPG bound to kdSrc with a Kd value of 167 ± 19 μm, weaker than GpYEEI by a factor of 500. To confirm the lack of contribution by the three side chains following Tyr(P)527,we determined the binding of PQpYAAA to the SH2 domain in kdSrc, which yielded a Kd of 87 ± 7 μm. To determine whether the additional three Src residues following PQpYQPG might contribute to the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding, we determined the binding of GpYEEIENL and PQpYQPGENL to kdSrc. GpYEEIENL had a Kd of 0.3 ± 0.02 μm, identical to that of GpYEEI. PQpYQPGENL had a Kd of 24 ± 1 μm, ∼6 times better than PQpYQPG but still ∼80-fold worse than GpYEEI. These data demonstrated that the Src C-terminal tail phosphopeptide represented a very weak ligand for the Src SH2 domain.FIGURE 2Binding of GpYEEI, PQpYQPG, and PQpYAAA to the SH2 domain in kdSrc. The binding of these phosphopeptides to kdSrc (80 nm) was determined by a fluorescence polarization competition assay. Flu-GpY-EEI at 80 nm was used as the probe, whose displacement by the unlabeled phosphopeptides resulted in a decrease in its fluorescence polarization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inactivated Src Exists in Equilibrium between the Closed and Open Forms—By two independent methods, Wang et al. (13Wang D. Esselman W.J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40428-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) determine that about 98% of p-Src exists in the closed form and 2% in the open form. To confirm this finding in our hands, we prepared kdSrc that was phosphorylated by Csk on Tyr527 and compared the accessibility of the SH2 domain before and after Tyr527 phosphorylation. In the unphosphorylated kdSrc, the SH2 domain was readily accessible to Flu-GpYEEI, with an apparent Kd of 25 ± 4nm (Fig. 3). In contrast, in kdSrc that was phosphorylated on Tyr527, the SH2 domain was much less accessible with an apparent Kd of 1.25 μm. This indicated that Tyr527 phosphorylation reduced the accessibility of the SH2 domain by a factor of 50. This difference in the SH2 domain accessibility was in a good agreement with the previously (13Wang D. Esselman W.J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40428-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) determined ratio of closed versus open forms at ∼98 to 2.FIGURE 3Binding of Flu-GpYEEI to unphosphorylated and Csk-phosphorylated forms of kdSrc and mutants. Accessibility of the SH2 domain in different forms of kdSrc and mutants was determined by its binding to the Flu-GpYEEI. A higher polarization value correlated to more binding between the probe and the SH2 domain. The proteins used in each panel are indicated as follows: 3A, kdSrc-3A; 6A, kdSrc-6A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The weak affinity between the SH2 domain and the tail phosphopeptide and the high portion of p-Src in the closed form indicated that the SH2-Tyr(P)527 affinity could not possibly account for the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding in Src. For example, at 1 μm concentration for both the SH2 domain and the phosphopeptide, the Kd of 24 μm would dictate that only 4% of the SH2 domain would be bound to the phosphopeptide, whereas 96% would be free. This large disparity of 4 versus 98% indicated that the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding was not accounted for by the affinity and suggested that a conformational contribution played a predominant role in the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding.Intramolecular Binding of Tyr(P)527 to the SH2 Domain Is Largely Independent of the Amino Acid Sequence of the C-terminal Tail—To test the finding that the C-terminal residues following Tyr(P)527 did not contribute to the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding, we generated two kdSrc mutants: kdSrc-3A and kdSrc-6A. kdSrc-3A had the three residues following Tyr527 mutated to Ala, and kdSrc-6A had three residues on each side of Tyr527 mutated into Ala. We determined whether the phosphorylated tails in these mutants could still bind to the SH2 domain intramolecularly. The SH2 domain in the unphosphorylated form of both mutants was readily accessible, with an apparent Kd for Flu-pYEEI of 80 nm (Fig. 3, B and C). Although the mutations decreased the rate of phosphorylation by Csk somewhat, Csk could still phosphorylate both mutants on Tyr527 to completion (24Lee S. Ayrapetov M.K. Kemble D.J. Parang K. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8183-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by Csk significantly reduced the accessibility of the SH2 domain in both mutants, increasing the apparent Kd to 2 μm for kdSrc-3A and 1.3 μm for kdSrc-6A. This result demonstrated that the intramolecular SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding was largely independent of the C-terminal residues surrounding Tyr(P)527.Inactivating Mutation to the SH2 Domain Does Not Abolish Src Inactivation by Tyr527 Phosphorylation—The above data suggested that the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding was largely not driven by affinity. To test the idea further, we introduced an inactivating mutation to the SH2 domain of kdSrc and determined how the mutation affected the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding. Arg175 is a highly conserved residue as part of the Tyr(P) binding pocket in all SH2 domains. R175A mutation in the Src SH2 domain is reported to decrease its affinity for pYEEI by a factor of 200 (25Bradshaw J.M. Mitaxov V. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When this mutation was introduced to kdSrc SH2 domain, the Kd value of the mutant kdSrc for Flu-GpYEEI was increased to 1.28 μm, ∼50-fold higher than that of kdSrc. In the competition fluorescence polarization assay, this mutant kdSrc displayed undetectable binding for the Src tail phosphopeptide, PQpYQPGENL. Assuming that the mutation decreased the SH2 domain affinity for the tail phosphopeptide also by 50-fold, the mutant would have a Kd of 1.2 mm for PQpYQPG. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of kdSrc-R175A by Csk further reduced its affinity for Flu-GpYEEI, indicating that the mutant SH2 domain was still able to bind to Tyr(P)527.FIGURE 4Effect of R175A mutation on the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding and Src inactivation. A, effect of the Arg175 mutation on the SH2-Tyr(P)527 binding.

The mutant, side by side with WT Src and an Src mutant with no C-terminal tail (Src-NT), was incubated with different concentrations of Csk in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 in the kinase assay buffer for 30 min, and the residual activity of Src was determined (Fig. 4B). As expected, WT Src was inactivated with increasing amounts of Csk, although Src-NT was not inactivated, indicating that phosphorylation on Tyr527 was responsible for the inactivation. Src-R175A was also inactivated by incubation with Csk. Although WT Src was inactivated to ∼15% of Src incubated without Csk, the inactivated Src-R175A mutant displayed ∼30% of the control activity. The difference in the residual Src activity suggested either that a higher portion of the phosphorylated Src-R175A was in the open form or the closed form"

Building on previous studies, results reveal that collapse of the DNA from the downstream end of the bubble is a major contributor to the characteristic instability of abortive complexes. Furthermore, transcription from a novel DNA construct containing a nick between positions –14 and –13 of the nontemplate strand suggests that the more flexible promoter reduces somewhat the strain inherent in initially transcribing complexes, with a resulting decrease in abortive product release. Finally, as assessed by exonuclease III footprinting and transcription profiles, a DNA construct defective in bubble collapse specifically from the downstream end exhibits less abortive cycling and little perturbation of the final transition to elongation, including the process of promoter release.

DNA-dependent RNA polymerases carry out de novo transcription from duplex DNA templates and ternary complexes are characteristically very stable as the melted bubble in an elongation complex translocates along the DNA with the transcribing RNA polymerase. However, in early stages of transcription, the complex is relatively unstable, releasing short transcripts 2–8 bases in length and restarting transcription, in a process known as abortive cycling (1Carpousis A.J.

After synthesis of about 10–14 bases, RNA polymerases escape from abortive cycling, at the same time losing sequence-specific contacts with the promoter DNA, and forming a processive elongation complex, in which the RNA chain is extended in a sequence-independent manner (5Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It carries out all of the fundamental features of transcription, including abortive cycling and the transition to a stable elongation complex. In early stages of the transition process, growth of the DNA-RNA hybrid is believed to provide the driving force for an initial movement of the N-terminal region (residues 1–266) of the polymerase (8Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and for the eventual disruption of initial promoter DNA contacts. At later stages, loss of the promoter contacts releases the topological constraint on the system, allowing the final protein conformational change establishing the elongation configuration (10Theis K. Gong P. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12709-12715Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Understanding the individual contributions of protein, DNA, and RNA to the stability of intermediate complexes is essential to understanding the mechanism of abortive cycling and the transition to elongation.Our recent data characterizing the relationship between initial bubble collapse and initial RNA displacement have led to a more detailed model in the late stages of the transition (11Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Martin C.T. Esposito E.A. Theis K. Gong P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In particular, we have proposed that only those complexes having proper initial RNA displacement are competent to accomplish the transition to a bona fide elongation complex. Complexes that do not properly displace the 5′-end of the nascent RNA can add only a few more nucleotides before dissociation, resulting in the release of 11–13 mer dead-end products.More traditional 2–8 mer abortive products are also produced in early stages of the transition process, but arise from the inherent instability of the initially transcribing complex (8Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence has recently come forth that retention of promoter contacts might compete with forward progression of the enzyme along the template toward elongation (14Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14956-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), as proposed in much earlier studies of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (1Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The instability brought on by this competition may lead to the release of abortive products, ending transcription, but simultaneously might also trigger promoter release, allowing productive elongation (17Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, noting that the polymerase adopts a very similar conformation either as the free enzyme, in a promoter-bound complex, or in an initiation complex with a three base transcript (18Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), one can conclude that this initial conformation must be energetically favorable. In the transition process and prior to the establishment of the elongation mode protein-nucleic acid interactions, the intermediate polymerase conformations are expected to be less favorable. Hence, the competition between the lengthening hybrid pushing a structural change and the tendency of an unstable intermediate to fold back to the initial conformation could also be a major factor contributing to abortive cycling (8Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These models all focus on forces that can lead to the observed release of abortive RNA products.Another important contributor, however, is the collapse of the transcription bubble. Although some evidence indicates that DNA constructs lacking the nontemplate strand in the transcribed region (and so unable to undergo collapse) have similar abortive profiles to those of the corresponding duplex constructs (4Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the lower turnover in stalled transcription at position +6 obtained from a similar partially single-stranded construct suggest the involvement of bubble collapse in abortive complex instability (21Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In this study, we explore in more detail the role of bubble collapse in the stability of intermediate transcription complexes. In particular, we show that collapse from the downstream end of the bubble is the major contributor to instability. This mechanism is distinct from the promoter release-induced collapse from the upstream end of the bubble, which assists the initial displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA on translocation beyond position +8. In the latter case, displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA (upstream) is a natural part of the transition to elongation. In contrast, displacement of the 3′-end of the RNA (downstream) prior to position +8 effectively halts transcription and facilitates dissociation of the abortive product.By characterizing abortive cycling from DNA constructs with a physical perturbation in the duplex binding region, we also show that weakening promoter contacts enhances the stability of initially transcribing complexes throughout the transition to elongation. As this enhancement in stability can occur in promoter-bound complexes, it provides direct evidence to suggest that the constraint provided by promoter contacts contributes to the instability of the intermediate complexes.Finally, exonuclease III footprinting data presented here suggest that preventing bubble collapse at positions +7 and +8 by the introduction of a small 2-base mismatch stabilizes the abortive complex, while not interfering with the final transition to elongation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—His-tagged wild-type T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from E. coli strain BL21, carrying the plasmid pBH161 (kindly supplied by William T. McAllister), and purified and characterized as described previously (11Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol.

Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the nicked construct utilized a 3′-spacer C3 CPG column (Glen Research). Single-stranded DNAs were stored in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) at –20 °C. For radioactive labeling at the 5′-end, DNA was incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled DNA was then purified from the kinase using a QIA Quick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen) and stored in TE buffer. Single-stranded DNA was combined in equimolar concentrations, incubated at 75 °C for 5 min, and then cooled slowly to room temperature for annealing. Annealed DNA constructs were stored in TE buffer at –20 °C.Transcription Assays—Transcription was carried out in a total volume of 16 μl at 37 °C for 5 min before being quenched with an equal volume of stop solution (90% formamide, 40 mm Na2EDTA, 0.02 (w/v) bromphenol blue). DNA and enzyme were combined at final concentrations of 0.125 μm each in a reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 15 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. After a 1-min incubation, reactions were initiated by addition of GTP to a final concentration of 800 μm and other NTPs (as noted) to a final concentration of 400 μm each and labeled with [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel, visualized, and quantified on a Storm 840 or a Typhoon 9210 Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). For comparison of the stability of complexes stalled at positions +6 to +8 on ds 2The abbreviations used are: ds or DS, double-stranded; MM, mismatch; nt, nucleotides; pss, partially single-stranded. and pss constructs (Fig. 1), transcription reactions were initiated and allowed to proceed for 1 min by addition of GTP, ATP, and CTP to a final concentration of 400 μm each (without radiolabel), and then 2 μl of TE buffer containing trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was quenched 1 min following the addition of the radiolabel. For the runoff transcription assay comparing ds and nicked constructs (Fig. 4), 0.25 μm each enzyme and DNA were incubated 4 min prior to the addition of NTPs.FIGURE 4A nick in the promoter region causes reduction of 4–13 mer products.

After allowing transcription for 1 min, 2 μl of 20 μm sink DNA (resulting in a 20-fold excess relative to promoter) containing trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP was added (controls contained only radiolabel). Fractions of the solution were then withdrawn and quenched with an equal volume of stop solution at 1, 2, and 5 min. RNA transcripts were resolved, visualized, and quantified as described above.Exonuclease III Footprinting Assays—Single-stranded DNA was 5′-labeled as described above and then annealed to its unlabeled complement. Transcription complexes were formed at room temperature by addition of NTPs as noted, to final concentrations of 400–800 μm for each regular NTP and 100 μm for each 3′-deoxy NTP, to a solution of 1.0 μm RNA polymerase and 0.25 μm DNA. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min (for complexes stalled at positions +6 and +8 on the control construct, transcription was reduced to 5 min procession to reduce NTP consumption) before digestion was initiated by addition of exonuclease III (Promega) to a final concentration of 20 units·μl–1. After 20 min, digestion was quenched by addition of an equal volume of above-noted stop solution. The resulting DNA products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% acrylamide/7 m urea gel, and visualized with a Typhoon 9210 phosphorimager. Compared with those at 37 °C, reactions at room temperature usually show less than 65–80% consumption of the NTPs. Therefore, during the period of exonuclease digestion, NTP substrates were not reduced sufficiently to perturb the assay.RESULTSBubble Collapse from the Downstream End Contributes to the Instability of the Abortive ComplexDNA reannealing has been proposed to be a contributor to the instability of an abortive complex (13Mentesana P.E.

Our recent results suggest that collapse from the upstream end of the bubble does not contribute to this instability (11Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the observations presented here reveal that reannealing likely occurs from the downstream end of the bubble.Collapse from the Upstream End of the Transcription Bubble Does Not Contribute to the Instability of the Abortive Complexes—Here we assess the instability of complexes stalled at positions +6 to +8 on five sets of constructs with different capabilities for bubble collapse (Fig. 1A) by transcription turnover. The results suggest that allowing collapse only at the upstream and middle regions of the transcription bubble in partially single-stranded constructs yields complexes with stability similar to the more extensively single-stranded (bubble collapse impossible) constructs. Transcription is initiated by addition of GTP, ATP, and CTP, and allowed to proceed for 1 min, establishing steady state turnover. Radioactively labeled ATP is then added (for turnover measurement) and transcription is allowed to continue for an additional minute. In this assay, complexes stalled on fully double-stranded DNA show substantial turnover, reflecting an inherent instability in the stalled complex (Fig. 1B, ds). Consistent with previous results (21Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), removing the nontemplate strand downstream of the duplex recognition element allows transcription but reduces turnover, and the stalled complexes are more stable (pss[–5]). This result is also expected (and observed) for constructs extending the nontemplate strand downstream to positions –3 and –1, because collapse of the bubble cannot directly displace the RNA (pss[–3] and pss[–1]). Surprisingly, extension of the nontemplate strand into the transcribed region to position +3 also does not lead to increased instability (pss[+3]), indicating that collapse of the bubble from the upstream end does not lead to dissociation of the RNA from the complex.Complexes Stalled at Position +8—Introducing a small mismatch into the DNA can prevent local DNA reannealing, and therefore can help to localize the region of the bubble in which collapse leads to instability. To map relative contributions of bubble collapse, we first compare the stability of the complexes stalled at +8 in the presence of GTP, ATP, and 3′-deoxy CTP in a transcription assay. Although transcription elongation is halted after incorporation of 3′-deoxy CMP at position +7, the presence of the incoming NTP ensures the translocation of the polymerase to position +8 (23Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3In this study, if the incoming NTP (or 3′-dNTP) is present, we assign the stall site one position downstream of the 3′-end of the transcript. Controls with either a fully complementary double-stranded control construct (Fig. 2A, Control (DS)) or with a 12-base mismatched bubble (MM[–4,+8], abbreviated as 12MM) are expected to provide normal and minimal levels of bubble collapse in a complex stalled at position +8, respectively. The stabilities of the complexes formed on these two constructs are compared with those of complexes formed on a set of constructs with a 4-base mismatch window centered at various positions from –4 to +20 (Fig. 2A). As above, transcription turnover is used to assess the stability of the complexes on all constructs. As expected, construct MM[–4,+8] produces about 50-fold lower turnover than does the control (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Preventing bubble collapse at the downstream end of the bubble increases the stability of the abortive complex. A, constructs used to localize the important region around the downstream end of the bubble. All constructs include T7 ϕ10 sequence from position –19 to +20. For nontemplate strands, only the bases mismatch to the template strand are shown. B–D, transcripts (highlighted by the dashed boxes) corresponding to complexes stalled at position +8(B and C) or +6 (D) were quantified. Each data series was taken from two individual experimental sets. Average number, range, and a transcription gel from one set are shown. Constructs with a 4-base (B) or a 2-base (C) mismatch window at various positions are compared with a fully complementary control construct and a construct with a 12-base mismatch window in the entire bubble region. Three constructs with a 2-base mismatch window around the downstream end of the bubble are compared with the control construct (C). The mismatched region relative to the transcription bubble in each construct is indicated in the picture above the bar chart.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Placing the mismatch window at the upstream edge of the bubble or far downstream of the bubble does not stabilize the complex (Fig. 2B, compare MM[–4,–1], MM[+13,+16], and MM[+17,+20] to the control). As the mismatch window is placed closer to the downstream end of the bubble, the complexes become more stable (MM[+1,+4] and MM[+9,+12]). The highest stability is observed for a construct containing a mismatch window at the downstream edge of the bubble (MM[+5,+8]).To refine the region of the bubble where collapse contributes most to the instability, we next performed a similar mismatch scan using a set of constructs with a 2-base window centered at various positions from –4 to +14 (Fig. 2A). The results show a trend similar to that observed from the 4-base mismatch set, but elucidate a finer pattern (Fig. 2C). The closer the mismatched window is to positions +7 and +8, the more stable the complex. Remarkably, the 2-base mismatch construct MM[+7,+8] shows a stability similar to that of the 12-base mismatch construct MM[–4,+8], demonstrating that bubble collapse at the very downstream end plays a critical role in destabilizing the stalled abortive complex.Complexes Stalled at Position +6—To test the generality of the contribution of bubble collapse at the downstream end to the instability of the abortive complex, the above experiment was repeated but with a stall at position +6 (transcription from constructs MM[+5,+6], MM[+6,+7], and the control in the presence of only GTP and ATP provides a stall at position +6, while a new construct, MM[+4,+5], was prepared to complete the set). As shown in Fig. 2D, the complex formed on construct MM[+5,+6] shows the highest stability among the four. Therefore, we conclude that collapse of the bubble at positions N and N-1 is most responsible for instability of a complex stalled at position N (at least for complexes stalled at positions +6 and +8).Positional Mapping of Instability Derived from Bubble Collapse—To test whether bubble collapse from the downstream end plays a similar role throughout the transition process, we compared complex stability on pairs of constructs paused at every position from +4 to +15 (Fig. 3A, family I). For each measurement pair, we plot in Fig. 3B the ratio of turnover on the construct with mismatches at positions N and N-1 (MM) to turnover on the fully complementary double-stranded construct (DS), to assess the effect brought by the 2-base downstream mismatch on the stability of the stalled complex (this ratio is indicated as MM/DS in Fig. 3, B and C and below). As shown in Fig. 3B, the data reveal that an overall large increase in the stability of the complex (MM/DS ratios of about 0.2 or lower, equal to an 80% or more decrease in turnover) is produced by the introduced mismatch at the immediate downstream end of bubble in complexes stalled at positions +4 through +11. These data strongly suggest that the tendency of bubble collapse from the downstream end is generally high throughout the transition process. However, at stall positions +14–15, only a very small effect is observed (MM/DS ratios are greater than 0.8, corresponding to 20% or less decrease in turnover), suggesting that in elongation, collapse from the downstream end of the bubble no longer contributes to complex instability.FIGURE 3Bubble collapsefromthedownstreamendsignificantlycontributestocomplexinstabilityonlyinthetransitionprocess.Constructsusedtotestthe generality of bubble collapse from the downstream end. The first A base introduced in the encoding region of each template strand is shown in bold (which directs transcriptional stalls at different positions with the NTP combinations noted above. Both family I and family II constructs contain the consensus T7 promoter sequence from position –17 to +4 in the template strand. For each MM (with mismatches at positions N and N-1) and DS (double-stranded complementary control) pair, because the nontemplate strands differ only in sequence at positions N and N-1, only the sequences at these two positions are shown. B and C, transcripts (highlighted by the dashed boxes with length underneath) corresponding to complexes stalled at position N on each pair of constructs were quantified to give the ratio of turnover with and without the 2-base mismatch (MM/DS ratio in B and C). For n =+4, +5,..., +15 (B), data were taken from two individual experimental sets. Average number, range, and a transcription gel from one set are shown. For n =+15, +17, and +20 (C), only a single set was performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm this prediction, we carried out a similar analysis on constructs stalled at positions +15, +17, and +20. As shown in Fig. 3C, the introduction of the 2-base mismatch at positions N and N-1 has only a small effect (MM/DS ratios are greater than 0.8) on the stability of stalled elongation complexes. Taken together, bubble collapse from the downstream end contributes to the instability of the complex in the transition to elongation, but not after the transition to elongation.Weakening Promoter Contacts in an Initially Transcribing Complex Reduces Abortive Cycling and Facilitates the Final Transition to ElongationTo accommodate the lengthening hybrid, conformational changes in the enzyme must start to occur on translocation beyond position +3 (8Tahirov T.H.

However, because of topological restrictions, the enzyme likely does not achieve the final elongation configuration prior to promoter release (10Theis K. Gong P. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12709-12715Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and must adopt what are likely to be energetically unfavorable intermediate conformations, causing accumulation of strain in the complex. Release of abortive products is therefore expected to be energetically favorable at this stage, mediated by bubble collapse from the downstream end (results shown above) and by the enzyme reverting back to the more stable initial conformation (8Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this mode, the constraint provided by retention of promoter contacts contributes substantially to the overall strain in the initially transcribing complex. Hence, weakening promoter contacts at this stage is expected to reduce the strain and lead to less abortive products (15Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).To test the contribution of promoter contacts to the stability of an abortive complex, we compared runoff transcription from a construct with a covalent nick between positions –14 and –13 in the nontemplate strand of the promoter recognition element and from a ds control construct (Fig. 4A). To minimize the perturbation introduced by the loss of the phosphodiester, a phosphate propanediol ester group was introduced 3′ of the –14 nontemplate base. The nick is expected to weaken promoter contacts, thereby decreasing the barrier to promoter release, or reducing the strain within the complex prior to promoter release, or both. As shown in Fig. 4B, the nicked construct produces runoff products at levels similar to the control, but yields relatively less 4–8 mer abortive products and 11–13 mer products compared with runoff products, as indicated by the fall off relative to runoff ratios in Fig. 4C. The reduction in 4–8 mer abortives is in agreement with that retention of promoter contacts contributes to instability (strain) in initially transcribin"

This study has used perivascular gene transfer of a truncated platelet-derived growth factor PDGF receptor (PDGFXR) to investigate whether antagonism of PDGF signaling alters adventitial cell migration after balloon injury in rat carotid arteries. Adenoviruses coordinating expression of beta-galactosidase (LacZ) and PDGFXR or LacZ and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were applied to the perivascular surface of arteries and balloon injury performed 4 days later. Vessels were excised at 3, 7, and 14 days to determine morphology and gene expression. Uninjured arteries only expressed LacZ positive cells in the adventitial compartment; however, after injury in LacZ and GFP transfected arteries, LacZ positive cells contributed to the population of cells within the media and neointima at 7-14 days. Overexpression of PDGFXR and LacZ resulted in a significant reduction in the number of LacZ labeled cells in the neointima after vascular injury, concomitant with reduced remodeling, collagen content, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and increased levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -2. We provide evidence that perivascular antagonism of PDGF attenuates remodeling and contribution of adventitial fibroblasts to neointima formation after balloon angioplasty. Perivascular gene transfer may represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce the incidence of restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2132878711,"Myosin VI, a ubiquitously expressed unconventional myosin, has roles in a broad array of biological processes. Unusual for this motor family, myosin VI moves toward the minus (pointed) end of actin filaments. Myosin VI has two light chain binding sites that can both bind calmodulin (CaM). However unconventional myosins could use tissue-specific light chains to modify their activity. In the Drosophila testis, myosin VI is important for maintenance of moving actin structures, called actin cones, which mediate spermatid individualization. A CaM-related protein, Androcam (Acam), is abundantly expressed in the testis and like myosin VI, accumulates on these cones. We have investigated the possibility that Acam is a testis-specific light chain of Drosophila myosin VI. We find that Acam and myosin VI precisely colocalize at the leading edge of the actin cones and that myosin VI is necessary for this Acam localization. Further, myosin VI and Acam co-immunoprecipitate from the testis and interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. Finally Acam binds with high affinity to peptide versions of both myosin VI light chain binding sites. In contrast, although Drosophila CaM also shows high affinity interactions with these peptides, we cannot detect a CaM/myosin VI interaction in the testis. We conclude that Acam and not CaM acts as a myosin VI light chain in the Drosophila testis and hypothesize that it may alter the regulation of myosin VI in this tissue."

Its expression profiles have suggested that it plays a role in the differentiation of blood cells during early human embryonic development and the pathogenesis of leukemia. To gain additional insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the ZNF268 gene and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of leukemia, we have mapped the 5′-end of the human ZNF268 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and primer extension assays. We then cloned the 5′-flanking genomic DNA containing the putative ZNF268 gene promoter and analyzed its function in several different human and mouse tissue culture cell lines. Interestingly, our studies show that the ZNF268 gene lacks a typical eukaryotic promoter that is present upstream of the transcription start site and directs a basal level of transcription. Instead, the functional promoter requires an essential element that is located within the first exon of the gene. Deletion and mutational analysis reveals the requirement for a cAMP response-element-binding protein (CREB)-binding site within this element for promoter function.

KRAB-containing zinc finger genes represent a subfamily within a large family of zinc finger genes, and they typically act as transcriptional repressors (2Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell.

They make up approximately one-third (290) of the 799 different zinc finger proteins present in the human genome, and as a result, this group of proteins is the largest single subfamily of transcriptional regulators in mammals. Many genes encoding KRAB-containing proteins are arranged in clusters, but others occur individually throughout the genome (3Rousseau-Merck M.F. Koczan D. Legrand I. Moller S. Autran S. Thiesen H.J.

By studying the molecular basis of human embryonic development, we have previously constructed a cDNA library from RNA isolated from 3- to 5-week-old human fetuses. Screening of this library led us to isolate the human zinc finger 268 protein gene, which is a typical KRAB-containing zinc finger protein gene (10Gou D.M. Chow L.M. Chen N.Q. Jiang D.H. Li W.X.

Interestingly, extensive screening of cDNA libraries and various approaches to clone genomic DNA fragments of the ZNF268 homolog in mouse failed to isolate a mouse homolog of the ZNF268 gene (data not shown). Data base search after the completion of mouse and human genome confirmed that ZNF268 is present in the human genome but not mouse genome (data not shown). Thus, ZNF268 may play a unique role in higher mammals, making it particularly interesting to study the regulation and function of this gene in human development and pathogenesis. By studying how the human ZNF268 gene is regulated during development and pathogenesis, we have previously isolated the genomic DNA up to 2400 bp upstream of the 5′-end of the longest published ZNF268 cDNA sequence and demonstrated that it contained a functional promoter (15Peng X. Sun Y. Liu H. Gou D.M. Li W.X. Yi Chuan Xue Bao. 2004; 31: 221-226PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, as the transcription start site was not mapped and detailed mutational analysis was not carried out, it was unclear whether the region represents the promoter or a regulator region of the gene. Here we describe the identification and characterization of the human ZNF268 gene promoter. Interestingly, unlike the vast majority of mammalian RNA polymerase II promoters, the human ZNF268 gene promoter requires a promoter element located intragenically in the first exon that contains a critical cAMP response-element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor-binding site. Materials—A 5-week-old human embryo was obtained from therapeutic termination of pregnancy, with appropriate advice and consent at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China, and was used for RNA isolation as described previously (10Gou D.M.

Cell Culture—HEK293, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells (a mouse cell line with no endogenous ZNF268 expression as the homolog of ZNF268 is absent in mouse genome) (CCTCC, Wuhan, China) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn/fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. K562 and Jurkat cells (CCTCC, Wuhan, China) were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA contamination was removed by digestion of RNA samples with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and samples were stored at -80 °C. RT-PCR and PCR Analysis—Total RNA (1 μg) from a human embryo and various cell lines were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) adaptor as primer and Takara RNA PCR kit (Takara). Various combinations of ZNF268 gene-specific primers (sense, PECS5, PECS4, PECS3, PECS2, and PECS11; antisense, PE41 and PD2; see Table 1) were used for PCR amplification (35 cycles) with Taq polymerase. The amplified products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and photographed.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study The boldface letters indicate mutated residues.OligonucleotideOligonucleotide sequence (5′-3′)aRegions of oligonucleotide not derived from the gene are underlined, and lowercase letters indicate mutated residuesLocationbShown are the oligonucleotide positions, where +1 is the transcription start site of the ZNF268 geneZ5S1ACAACAACAACGAAACCCAAATAATCCC-1858 to -1831Z5A1AACATGCTATAAATGACGATCCAGTTGC+1432 to +1405CSS1CAGAAGCTTAGAAGACATACAAATGGCCAAC-1790 to -1769PDT8ΔCAGAAGCTTCTCTGTGAATGTCACCTC-37 to -201.8A1GCGCGTCGACAATTACTTACTTTTGCACCAACG+45 to +23CSA3ATATGTCGACCCCTACGGTCAGTTTTGTGTGC+1255 to +1234PECS5ACTGAGTATCTACCCAAAGG-584 to -565PECS4GTGAAACAACTCAGGCACAG-352 to -333PECS3GCAGATATGAGAATCCAGCT+287 to +306PECS2GCAGGGACTAGAACACTTGT+480 to +499PECS11ACCTGGCCAGGAAGGCCTGAG+594 to +614PECS1GCCTCTGGGAGTTGTAGTTT+694 to +713PES1GCATATAACGTACTATAGGGCG-190 to -169PECATGAAGGGGCAGCAGAATAGA+925 to +906PE41GCTACGTATGTCGCACAGGAATTG+761 to +738PE11GCACCAACGGAAAATATCCAC+31 to +11PE12CGTAACATCATGTATTGGCCAGTTGG+104 to +79PUCGAGGTACCAGAAGACATACAAATGGCCAAC-1790 to -1769PUΔGTTAAGCTTAGAAGACATACAAATGGCCAAC-1790 to -1769PDT1AGAGGGTACCTCTTACATCAGTCACAGTAG-1400 to -1381PDT1ACTACTGTGACTGATGTAAGA-1381 to -1400PDT2ATGTGGTACCTAAGGTCGGGAGTTTGC-978 to -962PDT3GCGCGGGTACCGAAATTAGTATAACCTATGG-669 to -650PDT4CAGCGGTACCGAGCTAAAGGATATGTACAC-301 to -282PDT5CGAGGTACCATGATAGACAATGAAG-263 to -248PDT6CGAGGTACCACTGGTACAATGCATATAACG-201 to -181PDT7CGAGGTACCCACCACTACACAACTGATG-144 to -126PDT8CGAGGTACCCTCTGTGAATGTCACCTC-37 to -20PDT9ATATGGTACCCAGGGACCTGGCCAGGAAG+589 to +607PD1GGAAAGCTTAATTACTTACTTTTGCACCAACG+45 to +23PD2T4GTTAAGCTTGTACAATCTGAAACCACG+205 to +188PD2T3GTTAAGCTTGACACCAATGGCTCAACG+540 to +523PD2T2dGTTAAGCTTAGCTCCCGCGCTTGCAGG+588 to +571PD2T2cGTTAAGCTTGATGACCCGGAAGCTCAG+627 to +610PD2T2bGTTAAGCTTGCCAAGGGCCACCGGGAG+657 to +640PD2T2GTTAAGCTTCTACGTATGTCGCACAGG+760 to +743PD2T1GTTAAGCTTCTCCTCCAAACCCTGAAG+938 to +921PD2GTTAAGCTTCCTCGCTGGAAGTGACAGGACG+1234 to +1213PD2ΔCGAGGTACCCCTCGCTGGAAGTGACAGGACG+1234 to +1213p53-wt-FCTGGCCAGGAAGGCCTGAGCTTCCGG+596 to +621p53-mut-FCTGGCCAGGAAGtaagGAGCTTCCGGcData are from Refs. 22 and 23+596 to +621Ets-wt-FAGGCCTGAGCTTCCGGGTCATCTTAG+606 to +631Ets-mut-FAGGCCTGAGCTgaaGGGTCATCTTAGdData are from Refs. 25 and 27+606 to +631CREB-wt-FGCCTCTCCATGACGCAATTCCTGTGC+724 to +749CREB-mut-FGCCTCTCCATGcatCAATTCCTGTGCeData are from Refs. 21 and 26+724 to +749AP1-wt-FTTGCCTCTCCATGACGCAATTCCTG+722 to +746AP1-mut-FTTGCCTCTCCAgtcCGCAATTCCTGfData are from Ref. 21+722 to +746C/EBP-wt-FCTCCATGACGCAATTCCTGTGCGAC+728 to +752C/EBP-mut-FCTCCATGACGCccTTCCTGTGCGACgData are from Refs. 20 and 24+728 to +752a Regions of oligonucleotide not derived from the gene are underlined, and lowercase letters indicate mutated residuesb Shown are the oligonucleotide positions, where +1 is the transcription start site of the ZNF268 genec Data are from Refs. 22el-Deiry W.S.

Primers for the 3290-bp 5′-flanking region were Z5S1 (sense) and Z5A1 (antisense) (Table 1), which were designed based on the sequence of Homo sapiens chromosome 12 clone CTD-2140B24 (GenBank™ accession number AC026786). The PCR fragment was inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to generate pGEM-T-3290 plasmid and then verified by DNA sequencing. To study the potential promoter activity, a 3045-bp PCR fragment (amplified with primer pair CSS1/CSA3; see Table 1), a 1835-bp PCR fragment (CSS1/1.8A1), and a 1292-bp PCR fragment (PDT8Δ/CSA3) were generated by direct PCR amplification, using pGEM-T-3290 plasmid as the template, and were inserted into pEGFP-1 vector, which contained the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and no known eukaryotic promoter or enhancer element, to generate pEGFP(-1790/+1255), pEGFP(-1790/+45), and pEGFP(-37/+1255) plasmids, respectively. To map the promoter region, different fragments of the 5′-flanking regions of the ZNF268 gene that differed in length were inserted into the firefly luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega). The strategy for cloning of the fragments of the ZNF268 gene promoter into a pGL3-Basic vector was as follows, with the numbers indicating the nucleotide positions relative to the transcription start site. The PCR fragment of 3024 bp (amplified with primer pair PU/PD2; see Table 1) and the same fragment but in opposite orientation (with primer pair PUΔ/PD2Δ) were generated by direct PCR amplification, using pGEM-T-3290 plasmid as the template. The fragments were then inserted into pGL3-Basic, to generate pGL3(-1790/+1234) plasmid, in which the expected promoter would drive the expression of the luciferase reporter and pGL3(+1234/-1790) plasmid, in which the promoter fragment is in the opposite orientation and thus would drive the expression away from the luciferase reporter, respectively.The PCR fragments of 1835 bp (amplified with primer pair PU/PD1; see Table 1), 1445 bp (PDT1/PD1), 1023 bp (PDT2/PD1), 714 bp (PDT3/PD1), 346 bp (PDT4/PD1), 308 bp (PDT5/PD1), 246 bp (PDT6/PD1), 189 bp (PDT7/PD1), and 82 bp (PDT8/PD1) were generated by direct PCR amplification using pGEM-T-3290 plasmid as the template. The fragments were then inserted into pGL3-Basic to generate pGL3(-1790/+45), pGL3(-1400/+45), pGL3(-978/+45), pGL3(-669/+45), pGL3(-301/+45), pGL3(-263/+45), pGL3(-201/+45), pGL3(-144/+45), and pGL3(-37/+45) plasmids, respectively.Similarly, the PCR fragments of 242 bp (amplified with primer pair PDT8/PD2T4; see Table 1), 577 bp (PDT8/PD2T3), 625 bp (PDT8/PD2T2d), 664 bp (PDT8/PD2T2c), 694 bp (PDT8/PD2T2b), 797 bp (PDT8/PD2T2), 975 bp (PDT8/PD2T1), and 1271 bp (PDT8/PD2) were generated by direct PCR amplification using pGEM-T-3290 plasmid the template. The fragments were then inserted into pGL3-Basic to generate pGL3(-37/+205), pGL3(-37/+540), pGL3(-37/+588), pGL3(-37/+627), pGL3(-37/+657), pGL3(-37/+760), pGL3(-37/+938), and pGL3(-37/+1234) plasmids, respectively.The PCR fragments of 1429 bp (amplified with primer pair PDT3/PD2T2; see Table 1), 1257 bp (PDT3/PD2T2d), and 172 bp (PDT9/PD2T2) were generated by direct PCR amplification using pGEM-T-3290 plasmid as the template. The fragments were then inserted into pGL3-Basic, to generate pGL3(-669/+760), pGL3(-669/+588), and pGL3(+589/+760) plasmids, respectively.pGL3(-37/+938)-p53-mut (+596 to +621), pGL3(-37/+938)-Ets-mut (+606 to +631), pGL3(-37/+938)-CREB-mut (+724 to +749), pGL3(-37/+938)-AP1-mut (+722 to +746), and pGL3(-37/+938)-C/EBP-mut (+728 to +752) were constructed by the overlap extension PCR method with pGL3(-37/+938) plasmid as the template according to a published methodology (17Sambrook J.

The correct orientation and sequences of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primer Extension Assays—Primer extension assay was done as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Briefly, an antisense primer PE11 (Table 1) corresponding to the position from +31 to +11 (relative to ZNF268 transcription start site) was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and 5000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP, and the unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passage through a G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled primer was hybridized to 30 μg of DNase I-treated (Takara) total RNA prepared from a 5-week-old human embryo, HeLa cells, HEK293 cells, NIH3T3 cells, K562 cells, or Jurkat cells in 1.25 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 1.5 h. The RNA and oligonucleotide were precipitated, resuspended in 1× Reverse Transcriptase buffer (25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dGTP/dATP/dTTP/dCTP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated with 100 units of SuperScript™ RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. The same oligonucleotide that was used for the primer extension experiment, and the pGEM-T-3290 plasmid, was used to obtain a sequencing ladder by using the SequiTherm EXCEL™ II DNA sequencing kit (Epicenter) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sequencing and primer extension reactions were electrophoresed on an 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel in 1× Tris-buffered EDTA. After autoradiography for 24-72 h, the size of the primer extension product and the transcription start site was determined by direct comparison to the sequencing ladder. Transient Transfection and Functional Analysis of the ZNF268 Gene Promoter with the Green Fluorescent Protein Reporter—HEK293, HeLa, and NIH3T3 Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 75% confluence and transfected with 0.6 μg of pEGFP(-1790/+1255), pEGFP(-1790/+45), or pEGFP(-37/+1255) plasmid using Sofast™ transfection reagent (Sunma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. K562 and Jurkat cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected at about 1 × 105 cells/well using DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Phytohemagglutinin (final concentration 1 μg/ml; Sigma) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (final concentration 50 ng/ml; Sigma) per well were added after 4 h of transfection for Jurkat cells, whereas only phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was added for K562 cells to enhance promoter activity. The plasmid pEGFP-C1, which contained the CMV promoter upstream of the green fluorescent protein gene, was used as a positive control, and pEGFP-1, which contained no eukaryotic promoter or enhancer element, was used as a negative control. Transient Transfection and Dual Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection was done with the indicated 0.6 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct and the internal control Renilla luciferase reporter construct, pRL-TK (Promega) (firefly luciferase reporter construct and pRL-TK in a ratio of 20:1), which contains the Renilla luciferase gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. When indicated, the expression vector for the transcription factor CREB-1 or CREB-2, pcDNA-CREB-1 or pcDNA-CREB-2, respectively, was co-transfected into HeLa cells. In addition, the parental vector, pGL3-Basic, was used as a promoterless negative control, and pGL3-CMV containing the firefly luciferase gene driven by the CMV promoter was used as a positive control. The cells were cultured as above, and luciferase activity was analyzed 48 h post-transfection with the Turner BioSystems TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Triplicate samples were measured for each construct, and the average values of the ratio of firefly luciferase light units to Renilla luciferase light units were used for data analysis. The results show the mean values of three independent experiments with standard errors. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were obtained from Promega and were stored at -80 °C. EMSAs were done based on the gel shift assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Oligonucleotide probes CREB-wt and CREB-mut, specific for region +724/+749, used for EMSA were CREB-wt-F/CREB-wt-R and CREB-mut-F/CREB-mut-R (Table 1). The sense and antisense strands were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and end-labeled with 5000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), with the unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP removed by passage through a G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). 35 fmol (5-8 × 103cpm) of each oligonucleotide probe was incubated with 5-10 μg of nuclear extract in 5× Gel Shift Binding Buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was size-fractionated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for 18-24 h. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was added to the binding reaction just before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—HeLa cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 15 min. Chromatin extracts were prepared as described previously (30Ballas N. Battaglioli E.

Sonication was performed 20 times for 10 s each using a Sonic Dismembrator model 100 (Fisher), resulting in DNA fragments between 150 and 600 bp in size. Immunoclearing was performed for 6 h at 4°C using 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry in dilution buffer) (Sigma). Supernatants were collected and submitted to immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of polyclonal anti-p-CREB-1 and anti-CREB-2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. In parallel, supernatants were incubated without antibody as controls. Then 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. Precipitates were washed and extracted with 1% SDS (v/v), 0.1 m NaHCO3, and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links. DNA fragments were precipitated with 3 volumes of 100% ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 m ammonium acetate and resuspended in 25 μl. Finally, 1.5 μl were amplified by PCR for 35 cycles with the primers PECS11/PECA for the promoter region and PU/PDT1A for an upstream region as a negative control (Table 1). Similar ChIP assays were performed with anti-RNA polymerase II and anti-TFIID (TBP) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) except that the precipitated DNA was amplified with the primer set PES1/PE12 for the region containing the transcription start site or PECS1/PD2T1 for the region containing the intragenic element. Computer Analysis—To identify the putative binding sites of transcription factors, the 3-kb 5′-flanking region of the human ZNF268 gene was analyzed by the MatInspector program (32Quandt K. Frech K.
