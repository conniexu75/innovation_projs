https://openalex.org/W2053935424,"When the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway of quiescent cells is stimulated with growth factors or phorbol esters, the early response genes c-fos and c-myc are rapidly induced, and concurrently there is a rapid phosphorylation of histone H3. Using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser-10 of H3, we show that Ser-10 of H3 is phosphorylated, and we provide direct evidence that phosphorylated H3 is associated with c-fos and c-myc genes in stimulated cells. H3 phosphorylation may contribute to proto-oncogene induction by modulating chromatin structure and releasing blocks in elongation. Previously we reported that persistent stimulation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway in oncogene-transformed cells resulted in increased amounts of phosphorylated histone H1. Here we show that phosphorylated H3 is elevated in the oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblasts. Further we show that induction of ras expression results in a rapid increase in H3 phosphorylation. H3 phosphatase, identified as PP1, activities in ras-transformed and parental fibroblast cells were similar, suggesting that elevated H3 kinase activity was responsible for the increased level of phosphorylated H3 in the oncogene-transformed cells. Elevated levels of phosphorylated H1 and H3 may be responsible for the less condensed chromatin structure and aberrant gene expression observed in the oncogene-transformed cells.

Modification of the N- and C-terminal tails of H1 by phosphorylation or the N-terminal tail of H3 by acetylation and/or phosphorylation could destabilize higher order chromatin structure (6Tse C.

H1 phosphorylation may relax chromatin by interfering with its action in chromatin folding and intermolecular fiber-fiber interactions (3Hansen J.C. Chemtracts: Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 10: 56-69Google Scholar). Continuous stimulation of the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 signaling pathway in mouse fibroblasts transformed with oncogenes ras, fes, mos, and c-myc elevates the level of phosphorylated H1 (9Chadee D.N.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway of quiescent fibroblasts treated with growth factors or phorbol esters results in the phosphorylation of H3 (12Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J.

Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Thus, persistent activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway in oncogene-transformed cells may also increase the level of phosphorylated H3, contributing to the destabilization of the higher order compaction of chromatin. The N-terminal domain of H3 can be phosphorylated on Ser-10 and/or Ser-28 (15Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6056-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, the site of mitogen-induced phosphorylation remains unknown. Phosphorylation of H3 happens concurrently with the transcriptional activation of the immediate early response genes, e.g. c-fos (12Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, inhibition of transcription does not prevent mitogen-activated H3 phosphorylation (12Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It was proposed that phosphorylated H3 (pH3) is associated with the immediate early genes and may be a prerequisite to the expression of these genes (13Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the extensive mitosis-specific phosphorylation, which occurs on all H3 molecules (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), this mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation is targeted to a small, hyperacetylation-sensitive nucleosomal fraction (18Barratt M.J. Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To study H3 phosphorylation in growth factor- or phorbol ester-stimulated quiescent and oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblasts, we used an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser-10 of H3. We show that mitogenic stimulation, oncogene transformation, or induction of oncogenic ras expression is accompanied with increases in Ser-10 phosphorylation of H3. We provide direct evidence that pH3 is associated with the induced c-fos and c-myc genes in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts. The elevated levels of phosphorylated H3 in ras-transformed cells were not a consequence of a decrease in the activity of PP1, which was identified as the H3 phosphatase. The cell line Ciras-3 was derived from 10T½ cells by transfection with the T-24 Ha-ras oncogene (19Egan S.E. McClarity G.A. Jarolim L. Wright J.A. Spiro I. Hager G. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines transformed with human c-myc, v-mos, and v -fes were NIH/myc1, Mos 1, Fes 1, and NIH/9IV#5, respectively (20Egan S.E. Wright J.A. Jarolim L. Yanagihara K. Bassin R.H. Greenberg A.H. Science. 1987; 238: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 2H1 cell line was derived from 10T½ cells by transfection with the T-24 Ha-ras oncogene under the control of a metallothionein promoter (21Haliotis T. Trimble W. Chow S. Bull S. Mills G. Girard P. Kuo J.F. Hozumi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell lines were grown in plastic tissue culture plates in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2 in medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). Cell lines were grown in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Cells were plated in 15 ml of the above medium at 5 × 105 cells per 150-mm diameter plastic tissue culture dish and grown for 72 h. The proportion of cells in the different cell cycle phases was determined by flow cytometry (9Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 10T½ cells were grown as described above and then serum starved in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were then either untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 100 nm TPA for 5 or 30 min. 2H1 cells (21Haliotis T. Trimble W. Chow S. Bull S. Mills G. Girard P. Kuo J.F. Hozumi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were grown as described above, and then the medium was changed to fresh medium for the control cells or medium containing 100 μmZnSO4 (to induce the ras oncogene) for 24 h. After treatment, the medium was removed and the monolayer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and trypsinized. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. For the isolation of histones, approximately 4 × 107 to 1 × 108cells were used. Cells were homogenized in 5 ml of nuclear preparation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF) in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). For some experiments, the protein phosphatase inhibitors were omitted; we did not observe changes in the relative levels of pH3 in samples isolated with and without these inhibitors. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min. All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in 3 ml of RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and protein phosphatase inhibitors). Nuclei were extracted with 0.4 N H2SO4 to isolate total histones. The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in double distilled H2O. Chromatin was fractionated by a procedure described previously (22Rocha E. Davie J.R. Van Holde K.E. Weintraub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8558-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ciras-3 mouse fibroblasts (1.35 × 108 cells) resuspended in RSB buffer were homogenized several times and then passed through a syringe with a 22-gauge needle. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation. Nuclei were resuspended in 5 ml of RSB buffer to 10 A260units/ml. CaCl2 and micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) were added to 1 mm and 15 A260 units/ml, respectively. Digestion at 37 °C was for 7.5 min and then stopped by addition of EGTA to 10 mm. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant, which did not contain chromatin fragments, was discarded. The nuclei were sequentially incubated at 0 °C for 30 min with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 1% thiodiglycol, 1 mm PMSF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) that had an increasing concentration of sodium chloride (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4m). The supernatants SS0.05, SS0.10, SS0.20, and SS0.40 were collected following centrifugation. The residual nuclear material (P) remaining after the final extraction was saved. Proteins and DNA fragments were isolated and resolved on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels and 1% agarose gels, respectively, as described previously (22Rocha E. Davie J.R. Van Holde K.E. Weintraub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8558-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (9Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The anti-pH3 was isolated as described (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). The membrane containing the histones was immunochemically stained with anti-pH3 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) using the ECL (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative amount of pH3 in each sample was determined by scanning the stained gel and the autoradiogram obtained from Western blots using a PDI 325IE (PDI, Huntington Station, New York) and performing densitometric analysis using the Imagemaster 1-D software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The loading of each H3 sample was corrected by dividing the value obtained for pH3 by the value obtained for the amount of total H3 (from the Coomassie Blue stained gel). The relative increase in pH3 in each of the preparations isolated from the oncogene-transformed cell lines was divided by the value obtained for the parental cell line as described previously (9Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine specificity of the antibody, total cellular protein from Ciras-3 cells resolved on an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a membrane, which was subsequently immunochemically stained with anti-pH3 antibody. Only one band corresponding to pH3 was detected on the immunoblot (results not shown). This result is in agreement with previously published results (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). The anti-pH3 antibody will detect pH3 in uncondensed and condensed (e.g. centromeric heterochromatin) chromatin regions (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Centromeric heterochromatin is associated with unacetylated histones. Fixation and staining of cells was carried out as described (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). In addition, cells were co-stained with DAPI. Digital optical sectioning and deconvolution microscopy of nuclei was performed as described (24Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 10T½ cells were serum starved and either not treated or stimulated with TPA for 30 min. The cells were then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min (final concentration in the medium) to cross-link histones to DNA. The cells were collected, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then washed for 10 min in solution 1 (0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and 10 min in solution 2 (0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and sonicated for 4 min in 15-s bursts. DNA fragments isolated from the lysate are referred to as input. Typically 90% of the nuclear DNA is present in the lysate. The lysate was diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer, and anti-pH3 antibody was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by adding protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40), once in high salt wash (500 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0), once in LiCl wash (250 mm LiCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The beads were then treated with RNase (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and then proteinase K overnight. The cross-links were reversed by heating the sample at 65 °C for 6 h, and the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and was ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was then labeled using the DIG DNA nonradioactive labeling system (Boehringer Mannheim). The various genes of interest were slotted onto a nylon membrane and probed with the immunoprecipitated or input labeled DNA. Hybridizations were done at 68 °C overnight. The development times ranged from 4 to 8 h. Note that the development times for blots probed with immunoprecipitated DNA from nonstimulated and stimulated cells were identical. The same protocol was applied for blots probed with input DNA from nonstimulated and stimulated cells. The four cloned DNA sequences used were immunoglobulin κ matrix attachment region (IGκ MAR), c-fos, c-myc, and prolactin. All clones are mouse genomic sequences except for the prolactin clone, which has a mouse cDNA insert. For IGκ MAR, a 2.85-kb Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment from the recombinant plasmid pG19/45 was isolated (25Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). A 2.6-kb Bgl I fragment from the recombinant pSVfos plasmid carrying mouse genomic c-fos was isolated (26Schonthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Cell. 1988; 54: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A 2.1-kb Pvu II fragment from the mouse genomic c-myc DNA sequence containing a segments of exon 2 and extending into exon 3 was isolated (27Bernard O. Cory S. Gerondakis S. Webb E. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2375-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A 0.8-kb mouse prolactin cDNA insert which is subcloned into the Gem 2 plasmid was isolated (28Colosi P. Talamantes F. Linzer D.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A cell pellet containing 4 × 106 10T½ or Ciras-3 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet-P40, and 1 mm PMSF). The cellular extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the pellet discarded. Okadaic acid was added (at a final concentration of either 2 nm or 100 nm) to 20 μg of cellular-extracted protein in a 50-μl volume of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Five μg of total histone (isolated by sulfuric acid extraction of 10T½ cells that were treated with 0.06 μg/ml colcemid in media for 16 h) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. For the zero min time point, the reaction was immediately stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. For comparison of phosphatase activity from 10T½ and Ciras-3 cell extracts, the extracts were incubated with phosphorylated H3 for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min at 37 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting with the anti-pH3 antibody was performed. To determine the level of phosphorylated H3 in each sample, densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed. The assays were typically done in triplicate. To determine whether Ser-10 of H3 is phosphorylated in response to mitogen stimulation, we used an antibody that was generated against Ser-10 pH3; henceforth called anti-pH3 antibody. Serum-starved 10T½ cells were treated with either EGF or TPA for 5 or 30 min, and the level of pH3 was analyzed in immunoblotting experiments. We observed a 7.1–10.3-fold increase in the level of pH3 in the EGF- or TPA-treated cells in comparison with the untreated 10T½ cells (Fig.1). These results show that Ser-10 of H3 is phosphorylated in response to EGF or TPA stimulation. In murine cell lines, AT-rich centromeric heterochromatin can be seen as regions of intense DAPI staining. These regions colocalize with the domains of intense H3 phosphorylation observed in G2/M phase cells, reflecting G2 phosphorylation of centromeric heterochromatin (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). In TPA-induced 10T½ cells, a second pattern is seen. The pH3 was located in numerous small foci scattered throughout all interphase nuclei (Fig.2, panel A). The pH3 foci shown in Fig. 2 were found not to colocalize with centromeric heterochromatin in three-dimension reconstructions. 2M. J. Hendzel, unpublished observations. In the vast majority of the cells, all of the foci were located outside of condensed regions of chromatin (Fig. 2, panel B). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that pH3 of mitogen-stimulated cells is associated with less condensed chromatin. The CHIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay was used to test directly if pH3 was associated with immediate early genes, the expression of which is stimulated in mitogen-stimulated cells (12Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 29Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that pH3 of TPA-stimulated cells was associated with c-fos and c-myc DNA sequences (coding regions). In three separate experiments, the c-fos DNA probe reproducibly gave a stronger signal than did the c-myc DNA probe. Note, however, that both probes generated a comparable signal when hybridized to the input DNA (from TPA-treated cells). In contrast to expressed genes, transcriptionally inactive DNA sequences (immunoglobulin κ MAR DNA and prolactin DNA) did not hybridize to the DNA bound to pH3. As expected, the CHIP assay with chromatin from serum-starved cells, which had low levels of pH3, failed to show an association of pH3 with any of these DNA sequences. These observations provide direct evidence that pH3 of TPA-treated cells is associated with the induced c-myc and c-fos genes. We have shown previously that the levels of phosphorylated H1 were elevated in ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts in which the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway is persistently activated (9Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether persistent activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway would elevate the steady state levels of pH3 in ras-transformed Ciras-3 cells. In immunoblotting experiments with anti-pH3 antibody, we observed that the level of pH3 was elevated in Ciras-3 cells (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 2 with lane 1). As H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 is high during mitosis (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), it was necessary to compare the cell cycle distribution of the Ciras-3 and 10T½ cells. Using flow cytometric analysis of the cell populations, we found that the distributions of cells in different phases of the cell cycle were not significantly different (TableI). We conclude that the observed differences in pH3 levels are not simply because of a higher number of cells in G2/M phase from one cell line.Table ICell cycle distribution of parental and oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblastsCell LineCell cycle phase (% distribution)G1SG2/M10T½651421Ciras-3621325NIH/3T3621226fes551431mos621222myc6211272H1(control)5512332H1(24h)511425 Open table in a new tab To provide further evidence that elevated pH3 in Ciras-3 cells was not a mitosis-related event, we studied the distribution of pH3 in Ciras-3 cells by indirect immunofluorescence. The distribution of pH3 in Ciras-3 was similar to that of the TPA-stimulated 10T½ parental cells (compare Fig. 5 with Fig.2). Most pH3 did not colocalize with regions of intense DAPI staining in Ciras-3 nuclei, with the exception of nuclei in a minor population of G2 phase cells. For the G2 phase cells, we did observe pH3 associated with centromeric heterochromatin (see arrows in Fig. 5 A), in agreement with previous results (17Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that pH3 of most ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts is associated with relaxed chromatin regions. Nuclei isolated from Ciras-3 cells were digested with micrococcal nuclease, and the chromatin fragments were sequentially solubilized with buffers of increasing ionic strength. As the ionic strength of the extracting buffer increased so did the lengths of the chromatin fragments, in agreement with our previous results (22Rocha E. Davie J.R. Van Holde K.E. Weintraub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8558-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Fractions SS 0.05, SS 0.10, and SS 0.20 accounted for approximately 30% of the chromatin, with 70% of the chromatin being present in fractions SS 0.40 and the residual nuclear pellet (P). Histones isolated from these chromatin fractions were electrophoretically resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were stained with India ink (Fig. 6 B). Fig.6 C shows that pH3 levels were higher in the chromatin fractions SS 0.05, SS 0.10, and SS 0.20 than in fractions SS 0.40 and P. This result provides evidence that the pH3 observed outside of condensed chromatin regions (Fig. 5) is associated with less condensed regions of chromatin in Ciras-3 cells. Increased phosphorylation of H3 in the ras-transformed cells may be a consequence of increased H3 kinase activity and/or decreased H3 phosphatase activity. Histones incubated with cellular extracts isolated from 10T½ and Ciras-3 cells were electrophoretically resolved on SDS gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis with anti-pH3 antibodies determined the amount of pH3 remaining following incubation with the cellular extracts, providing a measure of the H3 phosphatase activity. Fig. 7 shows that the H3 phosphatase activities were similar in the cellular extracts. The activities of the two major protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, in mammalian cells can be distinguished by their sensitivity to okadaic acid (30Paulson J.R. Patzlaff J.S. Vallis A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP2A activity is completely inhibited at 1 nmokadaic acid, whereas 50% inhibition of PP1 activity is observed at 10–15 nm okadaic acid. A cellular extract from 10T½ cells was incubated with histones and 2 or 100 nm okadaic acid and incubated for various times. Fig.8 shows that for control and 2 nm okadaic acid dephosphorylation of pH3, 29 and 39%, respectively, of the pH3 remained after 60 min. However, when 100 nm okadaic acid was added to the cellular extract, dephosphorylation of pH3 was not observed following 60 min of incubation. These observations suggest that PP1 is the major H3 phosphatase. To test if altered levels of pH3 are an early event in cellular transformation, which occurs upon expression of oncogenic ras, we used the mouse fibroblast cell line, 2H1, which is a 10T½ cell line transfected with an inducible -ras oncogene (21Haliotis T. Trimble W. Chow S. Bull S. Mills G. Girard P. Kuo J.F. Hozumi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these cells, ras oncogene expression is controlled by a metallothionein promoter, which can be induced by treating the cells with 100 μm ZnSO4. Fig.9 shows the levels of Ras and pH3 at different times after the induction of the ras oncogene. One h after the addition of zinc, Ras levels were increased severalfold, diminishing over 18 h. The amount of pH3 increased rapidly for 2 h and then increased at a much slower rate. These observations show the rapidity and sustained phosphorylation of H3 in response to the expression of the oncoprotein Ras. Treatment of parental 10T½ cells with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 0, 8, or 24 h did not result in increased levels of phosphorylated H3, and therefore phosphorylation of H3 was not affected by ZnSO4 treatment alone (data not shown). Previously we reported that mouse fibroblasts transformed with oncogenes (e.g. fes, mos, c-myc) whose products stimulate the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway have elevated levels of phosphorylated H1 (9Chadee D.N.

The relative level of pH3 in the control NIH-3T3 cells was compared with the pH3 level in the oncogene-transformed cells. There was an increase in the level of pH3 in the fes-, mos-, and myc- transformed cells in comparison with the NIH-3T3 parental cells (Fig.10). Table I shows that the cell cycle distributions of parental and oncogene-transformed NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were closely matched. These results show that cells transformed with various different oncogenes have increased levels of pH3. In this study, we show that activation of Ras-MAPK pathway in quiescent murine fibroblasts treated with phorbol esters or growth factors results in the phosphorylation of Ser-10 of H3. We demonstrate that pH3 is located with chromatin that is not highly condensed, and we provide direct evidence that pH3 is associated with the induced c-fos and c-myc genes. The c-fos gene is transcribed in quiescent cells; however, elongation of the gene is blocked approximately 100 nucleotides from the site of initiation (33Pinaud S. Mirkovitch J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway results in the release of this block in elongation. It is possible that phosphorylation of H3 associated with the c-fos gene allows the chromatin fiber to be less compact, favouring elongation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the c-fos chromatin becomes more DNase I sensitive following activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway (34Feng J. Villeponteau B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of H3 may release the block within the c-myc gene (35Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Increased c-myc expression is seen later than that of c-fos (29Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), concurrent with the induced expression of these genes is the appearance of unfolded nucleosomes along the coding region of the c-fos and c-myc genes (29Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dynamically acetylated H3 is the target of mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation (18Barratt M.J. Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As the H3 tail contributes to the folding and inter-association of chromatin fibers, modification of the H3 tail by acetylation and phosphorylation may destabilize higher order compaction of the chromatin fiber and contribute to maintaining the unfolded structure of the transcribing nucleosome (2Moore S.C. Ausio J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the H3 that is the target of mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation is dynamically acetylated, it should be noted that acetylation does not predispose H3 to phosphorylation (18Barratt M.J. Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further, the anti-pH3 antibody will not bind to hyperacetylated H3 unless it is phosphorylated (42Espinos E. le Van Thai A. Pomies C. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3474-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In stimulated mouse fibroblasts, most newly phosphorylated H3 is non-, mono-, and diacetylated (18Barratt M.J. Hazzalin C.A. Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Murine fibroblasts transformed with ras have elevated levels of Ser-10 pH3. Increased levels of pH3 are seen soon after Ras expression is elevated. Either an increased H3 kinase and/or decreased H3 phosphatase activity would result in an elevated level of pH3. The activity of PP1, which our studies indicate is the H3 phosphatase, is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdc2/cyclin A; cdc2/cyclin B) (43Dohadwala M. Da Cruz E Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Increased activity of these kinases in the ras-transformed cells may decrease the activity of PP1. However, we found that the activities of H3 phosphatase in parental and ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts were similar. We conclude that the increased levels of pH3 in the ras-transformed cells are due to increased activity of the H3 kinase. An increased level of pH3 is also observed in cells transformed with fes, mos, and myc oncogenes. Several of these oncogenes code for serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases that act upon the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (31Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells transformed with c-myc have a stimulated Ras-MAPK pathway (11Amundadottir L.T. Leder P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Further, we found that the MAPK (ERK-1 and -2) activity was higher in cellular extracts from the ras-, fes-, mos-, and myc-oncogene transformed cells than in the parental cellular extracts (data not shown). By persistent activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, the phosphorylated isoforms of H3 would remain elevated, resulting in the destabilization of chromatin observed in oncogene-transformed cells (8Laitinen J. Sistonen L. Alitalo K. Holtta E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1998; 242: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea is the observation that pH3 of ras-transformed cells is associated with less condensed chromatin regions. The increased steady state levels of pH3 may result in deregulation of transcription at the level of transcriptional elongation, resulting in aberrant gene expression observed in cancer cells (45Lengyel E.

During formation of the active oxidase complex at the membrane, the GTP-bound Rac appears to interact with the N-terminal region of p67phox, another indispensable activator that translocates from the cytosol upon phagocyte stimulation. Here we show that the p67phox N terminus lacks the CRIB motif, a well known Rac target, but contains four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs with highly α-helical structure. Disruption of any of the N-terminal three TPRs, but the last one, results in defective interaction with Rac, while all the four are required for the NADPH oxidase activation. We also find that Arg-102 in the third repeat is likely involved in binding to Rac via an ionic interaction, and that replacement of this residue with Glu completely abrogates the capability of activating the oxidase both in vivo and in vitro. Thus the TPR motifs of p67phox are packed to function as a Rac target, thereby playing a crucial role in the active oxidase complex formation.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Rac serves as a molecular switch cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound states. In the active state, Rac interacts with a variety of target (effector) proteins to elicit cellular responses (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar,2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). For example, the protein kinase PAK is activated by interacting with Rac in a GTP-dependent manner (3Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated via binding of Rac to a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB)1 motif within the N-terminal regulatory region of PAK, a motif that is present in a variety of targets of Rac and Cdc42 (4Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Although more than 10 targets of Rac have been discovered (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar), molecular natures of the interactions, except the CRIB motif, remain largely unknown. It is thus considered important to study Rac-target interactions especially in functionally well defined systems. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase, dormant in resting cells, is activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants (5Chanock S.J. El Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M.

Although the NADPH oxidase is originally discovered in phagocytes because of its abundance, it has recently been proposed that the enzyme is expressed in a variety of cells and reactive oxygen species derived from superoxide that play a role in several signal transduction systems (6Jones O.T.G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The redox core of the oxidase is a membrane-spanning flavocytochrome, cytochrome b558, comprising the two subunits gp91phox and p22phox. Upon cell stimulation three cytosolic proteins, namely p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, translocate to membranes, where they interact with the cytochrome to form an active oxidase complex. All the five polypeptides are required for activation of the NADPH oxidase in vitro, and CGD is caused by defect of any of the genes encoding these proteins except Rac (5Chanock S.J. El Benna J.

In assembly and activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, protein-protein interactions between the oxidase factors play a crucial role (5Chanock S.J. El Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

Both p47phox and p67phox harbor two SH3 domains, which mediate specific interactions between the factors: the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox interacts with p47phox, while the N-terminal one of p47phox does with p22phox (11Finan P.

At least two events elicited during intracellular signal transduction in stimulated cells appear to function as a switch of the oxidase activation. One of the two is a conformational change of p47phox: the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox is normally inaccessible, and, upon cell stimulation, becomes unmasked to interact with p22phox, an induced interaction that is required for the oxidase activation (12Sumimoto H.

The final conclusion that Rac-p67phox interaction is required, however, has awaited studies using mutant proteins of the target p67phox. Here we demonstrate that the p67phox N-terminal region of about 200 residues is not only sufficient but also required for fully interacting with Rac. Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the region reveals that it contains highly α-helical structure, and comparison between human and mouse p67phox supports the idea that the required region contains four TPR motifs, the first three of which are tandemly arranged. TPR motifs, each comprising a pair of antiparallel α-helices (24Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), are initially identified as a tandemly repeated degenerate 34-amino acid sequence in the nuclear protein Nuc2p (28Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and the cell cycle division genes cdc16, cdc13, and cdc27 (29Sikorski R.S.

It is now realized that the motif occurs in a wide variety of proteins present in organisms as diverse as bacteria, archaea, and eukarya (31Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 32Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Trends Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Little is, however, known about molecular nature of TPR-mediated interactions. Based on the crystal structure of the TPRs of the protein phosphatase PP5 (24Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we have introduced mutations that are expected either to disrupt or to unaffect packing of the TPR helices of p67phox. The present findings show that the N-terminal three TPRs, but the last one, are packed to interact with Rac, and that Arg-102 in the third TPR is likely involved in binding to Rac via an ionic interaction. The results obtained here also provide evidence that the interaction between p67phox and Rac is required for the NADPH oxidase activation both in vivo and in vitro. Although the fourth TPR is dispensable for the interaction, it appears to play a essential role in the oxidase activation. The DNA fragments encoding various forms of human Rac2 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis, all of which contained the C189S substitution to avoid being modified by isoprenylation (35Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G.M. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Constitutively active and dominant negative forms of Rac2 carried the Q61L and T17N substitutions, respectively. Mutations in the effector loop (D38K and D38R substitutions) were introduced into the active Rac2 to obtain Rac2 (D38K/Q61L) and Rac2 (D38R/Q61L). The DNA fragments encoding mutant forms of p67phox were also constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity. In the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate interaction between Rac and p67phox, we used yeast strains HF7c containing two GAL4-inducible reporter genes, HIS3 and lacZ. The multiple cloning sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH), containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and pGADGH (CLONTECH), containing the GAL4 trans activation domain, were modified so that the inserts from glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein plasmids pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) can be readily transferred in correct orientation and reading frames, to obtain pGBT9g and pGADGHg (14Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were co-transfected with pairs of two-hybrid plasmids and selected by growth on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Cells containing both plasmids were picked up and plated on a histidine-lacking medium to test protein-protein interaction. The DNA fragment encoding a constitutively active form of Rac2 (Q61L) was subcloned into the (His)6-tagged fusion protein plasmid pProEX-HTb expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA fragments encoding p67phox and its mutants were subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). (His)6-tagged or GST fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 (Novagen) and purified by His-bind resin (Novagen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Various p67phox fused to GST (10 μg) were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter using Hybri-slot (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The filter was incubated with the blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h, and washed two times with buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). His-tagged Rac2 (Q61L/C189S) (0.2 μg) was preloaded for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products Inc; 6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 0.8 m) in the GTP-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The freshly prepared probe was incubated for 5 min at room temperature with the GST fusion proteins on the filter in buffer A containing 1 mm GTP and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The filter was washed 3 times with an ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). After the filter was dried up, it was exposed to a Fuji Imaging plate (Fuji Photo Co.), and signals were detected with the image scanner STORM (Molecular Dynamics). The membrane fraction of human neutrophils was prepared as described previously (12Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding p47phox was subcloned into the (His)6-tagged fusion protein plasmid pET-28a(+) expression vector (Novagen). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21DE3 (Novagen) and purified by His-bind resin (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The neutrophil membrane (17.5 μg/ml) was mixed with His-tagged Rac2 (7.5 μg/ml) preloaded with 100 μm GTPγS, His-tagged p47phox (3.7 μg/ml), and the indicated concentration of GST-p67phox or its mutants, followed by incubation with an optimal concentration of SDS (100 μm) for 2.5 min at room temperature in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.0) containing 75 μm cytochrome c, 10 μm FAD, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mmMgCl2, and 1.0 mm NaN3. The reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH (250 μm) to the reaction mixture. The production of superoxide was measured at the rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction at 550–540 nm with a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Hitachi 557) (15Sumimoto H.

We used a retroviral vector system, pSXLC/pHa, that utilizes an internal ribosome entry site fragment of encephalomyocarditis virus (36Sugimoto Y. Aksentijevich I. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), to transduce the gp91phox gene into the leukemia cell line K562 that expresses p22phox but not gp91phox (37de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells highly expressing gp91phox were selected using FACS scan with the monoclonal antibody 7D5 to detect functional cytochrome b558 comprising the two subunits gp91phox and p22phox (38Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A bicistronic retrovirus vector encoding a human multidrug resistance gene (MDR 1) and the p47phox gene (pHa-MDR-IRES-p47) (39Iwata M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Kanegasaki S. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were further transduced to the stably transduced gp91phox-expressing K562 cells. The doubly transduced cells were selected with 4 ng/ml vincristine, expanded in a drug-free medium, and used for the following experiments. Complementary DNAs encoding the full-length of wild-type and mutant p67phox carring the R102E substitution were subcloned into pREP10 (Invitrogen), which were transfected by electroporation to the K562 cells that stably express both gp91phox and p47phox. The K562 cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were electroporated in the presence of 10 μg of the wild-type or mutant form of p67phox plasmid DNA at 170 V, 960 microfarads using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were selected for 5 days with 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. For detection of p47phox and p22phox, K562 cells were sonicated and the lysates were applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide of p47phox and with an anti-p22phox monoclonal antibody. For detection of p67phox, proteins were immunoprecipitated from the K562 cell lysates (2 × 107 cells) with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide of p67phox and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0). Bound proteins were resuspended in the SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with an anti-p67phoxmonoclonal antibody (12Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Superoxide production by the K562 cells expressing wild-type or mutant p67phox was determined as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence detected with an enhancer-containing luminol-based detection system (DIOGENES; National Diagnostics) as described by de Mendez et al. (37de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the selection, K562 cells (2 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS buffer (17 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mmglucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2). After the addition of the enhanced luminol-based substrate (40 μl), the cells were stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with 200 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The chemiluminescence was assayed using luminometer (Auto Lumat LB953; EG & G berthold). The reaction was stopped by the addition of superoxide dismutase (50 μg/ml). GST-p67 (1–203) and GST-p67 (1–203, R102E) were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21DE3 (Novagen) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described above. After thrombin digestion to remove the GST tag, the protein fragments, namely p67 (1–203) and p67 (1–203, R102E), were purified on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and RESOURSE S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and their purities were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The concentrations of the proteins used for these studies were 5 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4. CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-725 spectrometer using rectangular quarts cells of 0.2-cm path length at 20 °C. Far-UV CD spectra were the average of eight accumulations taken at 50 nm/min. Secondary structural components were calculated by the method of Yang et al. (40Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) using software supplied by Jasco, Inc. The proteins without tags, p67 (1–203) and p67 (1–203, R102E), were dissolved at concentrations of 1 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mmdithiothreitol-d10 in 90% H2O and 10% D2O, and then adjusted to pH of 6.9 (direct pH meter reading). Their 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a UNITY inova 500 spectrometer operating at 1H 500 MHz and 25 °C with a spectral width of 7000 Hz. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to the internal standard 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. To explore the region of p67phox for binding to Rac2, we prepared a series of deletion mutants of p67phox to use them for the yeast two-hybrid system. A constitutively active form of Rac2, carrying the Q61L substitution, interacted with the full-length p67phox (p67-F) (Fig.1 A), which agrees with the result obtained by the yeast two-hybrid system using a different reporter system (35Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G.M. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two C-terminal deleted p67phox, p67-N (amino acids 1–242) and p67 (1–203), fully interacted with Rac2 (Fig.1 A). The findings indicate that the N-terminal region of p67phox is sufficient for the interaction with Rac, which is consistent with the results obtained from an in vitro binding assay using purified proteins (22Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a dominant negative form of Rac2, namely Rac2 (T17N), was incapable of interacting with p67-F, p67-N, or p67 (1–203) (Fig. 1 B and data not shown), confirming that the GTP-bound Rac2, but not the GDP-bound one, binds to p67phox. Further deletion of p67 (1–203) from either its N or C terminus resulted in complete loss of the interaction with Rac2 (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that the p67phox N-terminal domain comprising about 200 residues is both required and sufficient for binding to Rac2. When Rac1 was used instead of Rac2, the same results were obtained: GTP-bound Rac1 interacted with the N terminus of p67phox (data not shown). These Rac GTPases share 92% amino acid identity with the identical effector loop of amino acid residues 32–40. Some mutations in the loop region result in impaired interaction with p67phox(22Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 27Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as well as decreased ability to support the NADPH oxidase activation (22Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 41Freeman J.L.R. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One such mutation is substitution of Asn, a neutral hydrophilic residue, for Asp-38 (27Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Replacement of this residue by basic ones (D38K and D38R) also abrogated the interaction with p67phox (Fig. 1 B). These observations raise the possibility that Asp-38 may interact with a basic residue in the N terminus of p67phox. To define residues of p67phoxinvolved in Rac binding, we substituted the neutral residue Gln for each of all eight Arg residues that occur in the p67phox N terminus (Fig. 2 A). The R102Q substitution resulted in severely impaired interaction with Rac2, while the R38Q or R77Q substitution led to a slight defect of the interaction (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, five other mutant proteins carrying an Arg → Gln substitution at 62, 66, 155, 184, or 188 interacted with Rac2 as strongly as the wild-type one did (Fig.2 B). The binding experiment using p67phoxproteins with substitution of Gln for Arg suggests that approximately 150 residues from the N terminus play a more important role, since the substitution at 155, 184, or 188 did not affect the interaction with Rac2 (Fig. 2). A search of SwissPlot data base with this region by Blastp algorithm revealed a weak sequence similarity (20–30% identity) to regions of Ssn6p, a general transcriptional repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (42Smith R.L.

For direct immunofluorescence localization, purified rat mAb C27 was directly conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC hydrochloride, 10% on Celite, Research Organics Inc., Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-seprase mAb D28 was similarly conjugated with rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine, 10% on Celite, Research Organics Inc.). Cells were cultured on cross-linked gelatin films, fixed, and immunolabeled in a single step using these directly conjugated mAbs (8Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, LOX cells were indirectly labeled for integrin subunits following fixation in the presence (0.1% Triton X-100) or absence of detergent and secondary antibody detection of rat mAbs using Texas Red goat anti-rat antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) as described previously (8Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A set of mAbs against LOX cell surface antigens was made by immunizing rats with glycoproteins isolated from LOX membranes and generating hybridomas. C27 mAb was selected from this round of hybridomas (19Mueller S.C. Hasegawa T. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Chen W.-T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and further characterized by affinity chromatography and blotting. mAbs were directly conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent LOX cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. Protein was applied to a C27-Sepharose or mAb 13-Sepharose column in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol, 1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 50 mm glycine, 10% glycerol, 1%n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, pH 2.5. Fractions were analyzed using silver staining, immunoblotting, or Ponceau red detection of proteins. LOX cells were seeded onto cross-linked gelatin films (18Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar) or hydrated collagen I films (rat tail type I collagen at 1 mg/ml according to manufacturers instructions, Collaborative Biomedical Products, Becton and Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) and cultured overnight until 80–90% confluence. To harvest lysates, each 175-cm2 plate was washed once with 25 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, at 25 °C and then extracted with 25 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3 by incubating for 2 h at 25 °C on a rotary shaker (25 rpm, Bellco Orbital Shaker, Vineland, NJ). The cell layer and buffer (or gelatin plus cell layer and buffer) were transferred to a 50-ml conical tube and incubated a further 3 h at 4 °C with end-over-end agitation. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation reactions. Cell body (cb) and invadopodia membranes (in) were rapidly harvested by shearing the cell bodies in 25 ml PBS after a brief PBS wash. The invadopodia and cell bodies were extracted in 25 ml of extraction buffer as described above for lysates. Purified rat and mouse mAbs against membrane proteins (2.5 mg) were coupled to 1 ml of Sepharose 4 MB (50% slurry) and 0.25 ml used to immunoprecipitate complexes from 25 ml of cell extract overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end agitation. After 3× washes in 25 ml of extraction buffer, the beads with coupled antibody-antigen complexes were resuspended in extraction buffer (equal to the bead volume) and the sample subjected to 3 cycles of sonication on ice (setting 20, 10 s each using a KONTES Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disrupter). Immediately, the sample was transferred to an Amicon filter insert (0.45 μm, 400-μl capacity) and centrifuged 20 min at 10,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microfuge at 4 °C. The bead filtrate was used either for Western blotting of integrin and seprase or for zymography to detect seprase gelatinase activity. To test for complete extraction of the seprase and integrin complexes from the beads, Laemmli sample buffer (equal to the bead volume) was added, and the samples were heated by microwaves (2 cycles on low setting, 30 s each, followed by 1 cycle on medium for 30 s). Then, the samples were immediately centrifuged at 25 °C. The filtrates were subjected to immunoblotting and gelatin zymography as described (14Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A. Dodt J. Howard L. Yeh Y. Tran H. Argraves W.S. Chen W.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7595-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antigens were essentially absent from post-sonication beads. We concluded that sonication detached antigens from antibodies, but the antibodies were only removed from the Sepharose beads after extraction with Laemmli sample buffer. LOX cells were cultured on plastic or collagen overnight. After washing cells with PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMgCl2 at 4 °C, cell surface proteins were cross-linked at 4 °C for 30 min in the same buffer using BS-3 as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Following additional washing in the above buffer, cells were surface biotinylated at 4 °C for 120 min using SH-biotin (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Cross-linking and biotinylation of cell surface proteins were carried out at 4 °C to prevent internalization of cell surface proteins. In addition, these reactions were carried out in the absence of detergent to ensure that intracellular pools of integrins and seprase would not be labeled or cross-linked. Cells were then solubilized in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with C27 or D28. After multiple washes, immunoprecipitated complexes were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer by boiling without reduction, and the cross-linked proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Ferritin (440 kDa, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as the high molecular weight standard in addition to the routinely used 205-, 116-, 97.4-, 66-, 45-kDa standards (Sigma). To determine invadopodial proteins that associate with seprase and participate in matrix degradation and invasion, the mAb C27 was generated using detergent soluble proteins derived from LOX melanoma cells that exhibited gelatinolytic activities. Immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb C27 identified two major bands in the LOX cell extract (Fig. 1 A). The first band at 120 kDa, co-migrated with β1 integrin, and the second migrated at 150 kDa. To determine whether the 120-kDa C27 antigen was β1 integrin, the C27 antigen was isolated from LOX RIPA extracts by affinity chromatography using either mAb C27 or mAb 13 that recognizes β1 integrin (17Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The eluates were immunoblotted with each of the mAbs and with polyclonal antibodies against β1 (3847) or β3 (anti-vitronectin receptor) integrin. The results in Fig. 1 B indicate that the C27 antigen band at 120 kDa is β1 integrin. The C27 antigen was not β3 integrin, because β3integrin was expressed at high levels in platelets but was not detected in LOX antigen preparations (Fig. 1 B). The C27–120 and 150-kDa antigens were also affinity-purified from MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, and the 120-kDa band in C27 antigen preparations was identified as β1 integrin in these cells (Fig.1 C). We sought to identify the 150-kDa band by subjecting it to N-terminal peptide sequencing. The following sequence was obtained: F N L D T R F L. The data base search program “FindPatterns” was used to search for the identical protein sequence allowing zero mismatches in the protein data banks (PIR-Protein and SwissProt). This sequence is 100% identical to the N-terminal residues 1–8 of the human integrin α3 chain/galactoprotein α3/very late antigen-α3 chain; residues 38–45 of human integrin VLA-3 α3 chain precursor; and residues 38–45 of golden hamster cell surface glycoprotein α3 precursor (20Takada Y.

We conclude that mAb C27 recognizes β1 integrin on Western blots, and appears to preferentially immuno-isolate α3β1heterodimers from these two cell lines. To probe further the possible interaction between α3β1 integrin and seprase, immunoprecipitation was performed on lysates of LOX cells cultured on plastic (Fig. 2 A) or collagen or gelatin (Fig. 2, B and C) with mAbs D8 or D28 to detect seprase (14Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A.

Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar) and C27 to detect β1integrin. In three independent experiments, a stable association of integrin and seprase was not detected when cells were cultured on plastic (Fig. 2 A) but was reproducibly detected in lysates prepared from cells that were cultured on collagen or gelatin (Fig.2 B). This association was specific because anti-αv integrin or rat mAb E19 (control) did not co-immunoprecipitate either β1 integrin or seprase (Fig.2 B). To determine the localization of the seprase-α3β1 complex at invadopodia, we fractionated LOX cells into an invadopodia-enriched fraction (in) and the cell body fraction (cb) as described previously (8Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar). Association of seprase and integrin occurred specifically in the invadopodia fraction rather than in the cell body fraction (Fig. 2 B, IP: seprase and β1, cb versus in) despite the predominant localization of β1 integrin in the cell body fraction (Fig.2 B, IP and BLOT: β1, cb versus in). As previously demonstrated (18Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar), we found that seprase was concentrated in the invadopodia-enriched membrane fraction (in) with very little detected in the remaining cell body (Fig. 2 B, IP and BLOT: seprase, cb versus in). These data suggest the existence of a stable invadopodial complex consisting of seprase and β1 integrin. Furthermore, gelatin zymography detected a 170-kDa gelatinase activity in immunoprecipitates of anti-seprase mAb D28 (Fig. 2 C, IP: seprase) or anti-β1 integrin (Fig. 2 C, IP: β1). Lysates (ly) from cells cultured on cross-linked gelatin films or on collagen I layers contained equal amounts of seprase gelatinase activity co-immunoprecipitating with β1 integrin. This demonstrated that both native or denatured collagen matrices were equally effective in eliciting co-immunoprecipitation of seprase- and β1-integrin (Fig. 2 C, IP: β1). Similar to what was observed by immunoblot detection of seprase, the association of seprase gelatinase activity with integrin occurred predominantly in the invadopodia fraction (Fig. 2 C). Control immunoprecipitations using mAb E19 (control) and anti-αvmAb did not result in immunoprecipitation of any detectable seprase gelatinase activity (Fig. 2 C). Immunoprecipitations of individual α subunits of integrin were used to determine the specificity of seprase interactions with integrins. Lysates from LOX cells cultured on plastic or collagen were immunoprecipitated using anti-α2, α3, or α6 integrin mAbs or anti-seprase mAb D28 (Fig.3). Western blotting of immunoprecipitates revealed that anti-α3 mAbs, but not mAbs against α2 or α6, were able to precipitate seprase from cells cultured on collagen (Fig.3 A, BLOT seprase, IP α3 versus IP α2 or α6 obtained from lysates of LOX cells cultured on collagen, lane 7 versus lanes 6 and 8). In the complementary immunoprecipitation, anti-seprase mAb D28 only co-precipitated β1 integrin from cells cultured on collagen (Fig. 3 A, BLOT β1, IP seprase obtained from lysates of LOX cells cultured on collagen, lane 5). Western blotting using secondary antibody only (control) revealed background bands that were present particularly in the α6 lane (see Fig. 3 A, brackets, rat IgG). These bands, however, were not related to seprase as demonstrated by zymography (Fig. 3 B). The increased background bands might be due to impurities that were present in the α6 antibody preparation or the fact that this particular antibody results in higher background binding to lysate proteins. Zymography was used to detect seprase gelatinolytic activity. Activity was only immunoprecipitated from cells cultured on collagen using anti-α3 or seprase mAbs (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we conclude that collagenous matrix can induce the seprase-α3β1 association in invadopodia, which results in the localization of the 170-kDa gelatinase activity at sites of matrix degradation. In vitro experiments to determine the interaction between α3β1 and seprase are not very feasible, because the association of these dimeric membrane molecules requires cell attachment to matrix and occurs only in membranes isolated from the invadopodia-enriched fraction. Therefore, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analyses were used to explore the cell surface association of seprase and integrin. Chemical cross-linking experiments were used to determine whether seprase interacts directly with β1 integrin complexes on the cell surface. Because immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that this interaction occurred only in cells cultured on collagen, but not on plastic, we expected that cells cultured on plastic would not form oligomers of seprase and α3β1 integrin. And, conversely, cells cultured on collagen would be expected to contain complexes of a molecular weight corresponding to seprase dimer (170 kDa) plus α3β1 dimer (∼270 kDa), thus a complex of about 440 kDa. Comparison of D28 and C27 immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells cultured on plastic versus collagen, confirmed our prediction that seprase and α3β1 integrin were associating in a direct manner at the cell surface (Fig. 4, α3β1 + seprase). Specifically, a complex of ∼430 kDa was precipitated both by C27 and D28 demonstrating that the complex contains both α3β1 integrin and seprase dimers (Fig. 4, coll1 lanes). This high molecular weight band was only observed in the lanes derived from cells cultured on collagen (Fig. 4, α3β1 + seprase, IP D28 and C27, compare plastic versus coll1). In cells cultured on plastic, D28 seprase dimer was the major species observed, whereas C27 precipitated α3β1dimer as well as a prominent band at the position of β1monomer (Fig. 4, α3β1 and β1). In cells cultured on collagen, seprase dimers were detected in D28 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, seprase dimer, IP D28, coll1 lane). Bands co-migrating with the expected molecular weight of seprase monomer also appear in the D28 and C27 lanes (Fig. 4, seprase monomer, IP D28 and C27, coll1 lanes). We conclude that 1) the immunoprecipitates observed in Fig. 4 are derived from the cell surface; 2) the high molecular weight complex at 430 kDa is formed only when cells are cultured on collagen 1; and 3) this high molecular weight complex corresponds to seprase dimer plus α3β1 dimer, because it is immunoprecipitated by anti-seprase or anti-integrin antibodies. Cell surface expression of seprase and α3β1integrin distribution was also examined using fluorescence-activated cell sorter and immunofluorescence microscopy of cells in suspension or cultured on collagenous substrata. Comparison of the mean values from fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of 10,000 suspended cells for each antibody, relative to secondary antibody alone controls, revealed no difference in the levels of either of these proteins on either substratum (data not shown). Immunofluorescence studies on cells cultured in the absence of collagen demonstrated seprase and β1 protein at membrane ruffles and diffusely distributed on the remainder of the plasma membrane. To confirm that seprase and integrin are associated in invadopodia during localized ECM degradation, double label immunofluorescence experiments were performed. We found that mAb C27 directed against β1integrin did co-localize with seprase in the same invadopodia (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, anti-α3 mAb P1B5 labeled invadopodia directly overlying the sites if localized matrix degradation (Fig. 5 B, closed arrows) as well as membrane extensions at the cellular margin (Fig. 5 B, open arrow). However, the α5β1 integrin, a fibronectin receptor, localized in focal adhesions throughout the cell (anti-α5mAb 11; Fig. 5 C, open arrow) as well as in fine adhesion structures surrounding the base of invadopodia (Fig.5 C, solid arrow). Double label experiments using combinations of anti-α3/mAb 13, anti-α5/mAb 13, and C27/mAb 13 demonstrated the selective staining of invadopodia and membrane protrusions by anti-α3β1 and C27, and the recognition of focal adhesions by anti-α5β1 mAbs (data not shown). Anti-β1 mAb 13 staining was a combination of the two, both invadopodia and focal adhesion staining. Detergent extraction (0.1% Triton X-100) during fixation of cells effectively reduced diffuse membrane staining by anti-integrin mAbs while retaining invadopodia staining in the case of anti-α3β1 and C27 or focal adhesion staining in the case of anti-α5β1 staining (data not shown). This suggests that a subpopulation of integrin is anchored to the cytoskeleton at invadopodia as well as focal adhesions. The presence of α5 in punctate sites at the base of invadopodia and in streaks at the cellular periphery suggests that these structures are both related to focal adhesions, sites of actin-membrane anchorage to the membrane. Finally, we compared the immunolocalization of α3 and the related α6integrin, because we had found that α3 but not α6 co-immunoprecipitated with seprase. The α6 subunit localized in a pattern that was indistinguishable with that of α3 in LOX cells cultured on cross-linked gelatin. Anti-α6 mAbs labeled filopodia and invadopodia associated with sites of degradation (data not shown). Thus, α3 integrin associates with seprase even though both (α3 and α6 ) integrins localize to the same filopodia and invadopodia structures. We therefore suggest that α3β1 integrin is a protease-docking protein for directing seprase to invadopodia, and α5β1 may participate in the adhesion process necessary for formation and extension of invadopodia (Fig.5 D). Considering that integrins are linked both to ECM components and to cytoskeleton, and that seprase possesses a putative cytoplasmic domain of only 6 amino acids, it seems likely that α3β1 integrin actively forms a docking site for seprase. Additionally, α3β1 integrin may immobilize seprase to invadopodia following α3β1 attachment to the cytoskeleton and collagenous matrices. This argument is not without precedent, because ligation or aggregation of integrins by fibronectin or by anti-integrin antibodies recruits cytoskeletal and signaling molecules to the membrane (6Mueller S.C.

Our immunofluorescence, cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate the association between α3β1 integrin and seprase that occurs only when cells are cultured on matrix. This scenario is also consistent with the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of these cytoskeletal/signaling molecules and their localization at invadopodia (8Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at invadopodia as well as the degradative and motile activities of invadopodia (8Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence data shown in this paper demonstrate that α3β1 may participate in the formation of invadopodia by docking seprase, and α5β1 integrin appears to function in adhesion structures throughout the cell, particularly at the base of invadopodia. α3β1 is primarily a receptor for the basement membrane-associated molecules epiligrin and laminin/merosin, but also for fibronectin and collagen types I and IV (25Gehlsen K.R.

A related laminin binding integrin, α6β1, does not associate with seprase, even though we found that it was localized at the membrane in filopodia and invadopodia in a pattern very similar to α3β1 (data not shown). However, α6β1 integrin previously was demonstrated to play a role in signal transduction that promotes invadopodial activities (28Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y.Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) suggesting that these integrins may coordinately regulate the activities of invadopodia. Taken together, these results suggest that proteolytic activity at the tip of the invadopodia degrades the matrix to weaken resistance to invasion and that collagen-induced α3β1association with seprase participates in this process. We speculate that α5β1 supports the localized membrane attachment for extension of invadopodia into the matrix. The authors thank Umesh B.

Although L-, E-, and P-selectin can bind a simple glycan containing sialyl Lewis x (sLex)1(NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4[Fucα1→3]GlcNAcβ1→R) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, each selectin binds with higher affinity to a limited number of macromolecular ligands expressing sialylated and fucosylated glycans (1Yang J.

P-selectin, which is expressed by activated platelets and endothelial cells, demonstrates the most discriminating ligand specificity of any selectin. It interacts predominantly with a disulfide-bonded dimeric mucin on leukocytes termed P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (subunit mass ∼120 kDa) (5Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Each 120-kDa subunit of human PSGL-1 contains numerous sialic acids and approximately 70 extracellular Ser and Thr residues, which are potential sites for O-glycosylation, plus three potential sites for N-glycosylation (6Norgard K.E.

These features suggested that the large amount of carbohydrate on the mucin might promote high avidity binding to P-selectin. However, indirect evidence suggests that the extreme N-terminal extracellular region of mature PSGL-1, which begins at residue 42, is important for high affinity binding to P-selectin (reviewed in Ref. 3McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, tyrosine sulfate residues and O-glycans within that region have been considered essential for binding (Fig.1). A monoclonal antibody directed to a peptide epitope spanning residues 49–62 of PSGL-1 blocks cell adhesion to P-selectin, whereas antibodies to other domains of PSGL-1 do not block adhesion (8Moore K.L.

Treatment of human neutrophil PSGL-1 with aryl sulfatase removes sulfate from tyrosine residues and decreases binding of PSGL-1 to immobilized P-selectin (14Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. Li F. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22677-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These combined results were taken to predict a potential role of tyrosine sulfate plus an O-glycan at Thr57 of PSGL-1 in binding to P-selectin. Little is known about the specific glycan structures on human leukocyte PSGL-1 that contribute to its binding to P-selectin. Structural analyses of the total O-linked glycans of PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells revealed that many of these O-glycans have a core 2-based structure, although only a minor fraction carries the sLex determinant (15Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Generation of recombinant PSGL-1 capable of binding P-selectin in CHO cells requires co-expression of a core 2 β1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β1,6-GlcNAcT) and an α1,3-fucosyltransferase (12Li F.

Sullivan F.X. Cumming D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3872-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the prediction that sLex on core 2-based O-glycans on PSGL-1 is required for its binding to P-selectin. In support of this prediction, leukocytes from mice lacking expression of either the core 2 β1,6-GlcNAcT or the α1,3-fucosyltransferase FucT-VII bind weakly to P-selectin (17Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Finally, P-selectin binds to chimeric glycoproteins containing only a small N-terminal domain of PSGL-1 that lacks N-glycans (10Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,11Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 19Goetz D.J.

These studies point to an important role of the N-terminal domain of PSGL-1 in binding to P-selectin. However, the specific post-translational modifications of this domain and the relative binding affinity of this domain for P-selectin independent of the remainder of the dimeric mucin structure are not yet known. There is no direct evidence that O-glycans containing sLexon a core 2 motif in the extreme N terminus of PSGL-1 contribute to P-selectin recognition. Furthermore, the putative relationship between tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation in the extreme N terminus of PSGL-1 on binding to P-selectin has not been directly examined. The overall role of sLex itself is unclear. Some cells reportedly deficient in sLex expression bind well to P-selectin, suggesting that glycans other than sLex may serve as ligands for both E- and P-selectin (20Wagers A.J. Stoolman L.M. Craig R. Knibbs R.N. Kansas G.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5122-5129PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, polyanionic compounds lacking peptide, sialic acid, or fucose can inhibit P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion (21Damle N.K. Klussman K. Dietsch M.T. Mohagheghpour N. Aruffo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Cummings R.D. Smith D.F. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Cecconi O. Nelson R.M.

Finally, recent studies have suggested that covalent dimerization of PSGL-1 is essential for its binding to P-selectin (24Fujimoto T.T. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 64: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, there are many questions regarding the direct role of the N-terminal domain of mature PSGL-1 in binding to P-selectin and the specific contribution of tyrosine sulfate and O-glycosylation in this region for binding. The interaction of P-selectin with simple sLex-containing glycans is relatively weak (26Moore K.L. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and concentrations of sLexin the millimolar range are required to inhibit adhesion of cells to P-selectin (27Nelson R.M. Cecconi O. Roberts W.G. Aruffo A. Linhardt R.J. Bevilacqua M.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 3253-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, surface plasmon resonance measurements indicate that monomeric P-selectin binds to neutrophil-derived PSGL-1 with relatively high affinity (Kd ∼300 nm) and rapid on/off kinetics (28Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This affinity is particularly high relative to typical carbohydrate-binding proteins, where the Kd for monovalent carbohydrate ligands is usually in the range of 0.1–1 mm (29Hindsgaul O. Cummings R.D. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Indeed,l-selectin binds to GlyCAM-1, a heavily sialylated and sulfated mucin, with a Kd of ∼100 μm(30Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We sought to directly address the functional significance of the extreme N-terminal domain of PSGL-1 and its putative post-translational modifications in binding to P-selectin. To this end, we used purified and recombinant enzymes to modify synthetic peptides based on the N-terminal sequence of human PSGL-1. The resultant glycosulfopeptides contain tyrosine sulfate residues and O-glycans with defined carbohydrate residues that allow a direct exploration of their importance in binding to P-selectin. This new strategy of glycosulfopeptide synthesis was chosen because it has several advantages over the expression of recombinant glycoproteins. Recombinant glycoproteins expressing the post-translational modifications described here are difficult, if not impossible, to produce, because of heterogeneity in glycosylation and sulfation and because of the uncertain requirements of glycosyltransferases for site-specific initiation and modification of O-glycan structure. Here we use synthetic glycosulfopeptides to show that both tyrosine sulfate residues and a specific core 2-based O-glycan with sLex(C2-O-sLex) on a nearby Thr residue are required for high affinity binding to P-selectin. The binding affinity of one of these glycosulfopeptides is similar to that of native neutrophil-derived PSGL-1. Moreover, micromolar concentrations of this glycosulfopeptide are sufficient to block neutrophil attachment to immobilized P-selectin. These results help define the molecular nature of the interaction between P-selectin and PSGL-1 and pave the way for novel glycosulfopeptides that may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases. Crude glycopeptide 1 (GP-1) was synthesized at the Protein Resource Facility of Oklahoma State University. Tri-O-acetylated GalNAc was incorporated into the peptide during the solid phase synthesis using tri-O-acetyl-GalNAcα-Fmoc Thr derivative (Oxford GlycoSciences, Oxford, United Kingdom). The crude GP-1 (2 mg) was de-O-acetylated with 6 mm methanolic sodium methylate as described (31Meldal M. Bielfeldt T. Peters S. Jensen K.J. Paulsen H. Bock K. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 43: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The deacetylated peptide was purified by reversed phase HPLC. The retention time of deacetylated GP-1 (34.6 min) was clearly different from the tri-O-acetylated GP-1 (45.3 min) (Fig. 3). The yield of the pure GP-1 was 1.1–1.5 mg. In matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra, the observed m/z for the [M − H]− molecular ion was 2952.9 (calculated m/z 2953.2) (Fig. 4). In addition the [M − H]−molecular ion of oxidized GP-1 (m/z 2969.5) was present where the methionine residue had been oxidized.Figure 4Mass spectrometric analysis of glyco(sulfo)peptide samples.

In the course of these studies, we developed a strategy to purify the core 1 β1,3-GalT from rat liver. The enzyme, purified over 70,000-fold to near homogeneity, was highly efficient in catalyzing the formation of GP-2 (Fig.2). The purification of this novel enzyme and cloning of its cDNA has been accomplished and will be described elsewhere. GP-1 was galactosylated overnight at 37 °C in 100–200-nmol aliquots by using 3–4 times molar excess of UDP-Gal (Sigma) and 13 nmol/h of purified core 1 β1,3-GalT in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 2 mm ATP, 15 mm MnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100. After removing proteins and Triton X-100 by chloroform-methanol (2:1) extraction (deproteination), the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. The retention time of the galactosylated product, GP-2, was 32.9 min (Fig.3), and the degree of galactosylation was >95%. MALDI-TOF analysis of GP-2 revealed m/z 3115.4 for the [M − H]− molecular ion (calculated m/z 3115.3) (Fig. 4). GP-2 (0.4–0.6 mm) was incubated at 37 °C with 1–2 mm UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma) and affinity purified recombinant core 2 β1,6-GlcNAcT (100 nmol/h) in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0. After 24 h of incubation, a small aliquot from the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. GP-2 was converted quantitatively into a faster moving product, GP-3 (retention time 31.3 min) (Fig. 3). MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of GP-3 showed m/z 3318.2 for the [M − H]− molecular ion (calculated m/z 3318.5) (Fig. 4). The reaction mixture was taken directly to a β1,4-GalT reaction. Alternatively, UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) (12,000 cpm/nmol) was used as a donor in the core 2 β1,6-GlcNAcT reaction to get [3H]GP-3. Unlabeled GP-3 (0.4 mm) (core 2 β1,6GlcNAcT reaction mixture) was galactosylated using 125 milliunits of bovine milk β1,4-GalT (Sigma) and UDP-Gal (1.5 mm) in a total volume of 160 μl of 40 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 20 mm MnCl2, and 0.02% NaN3. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, a sample from the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC, which showed that all GP-3 had been converted into a faster moving product, GP-4 (retention time 30.4 min) (Fig. 3). In MALDI-TOF analysis, the observed m/z for the [M − H]− molecular ion of GP-4 was 3480.4 (calculated m/z 3480.7) (Fig. 4). Glycopeptide samples were deproteinated and desalted in a Sephadex G-50 column (10 ml, 0.7 × 25 cm) using water or 25 mmNH4HCO3 as an eluant. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the glycopeptides were detected by measuring either UV absorbance at 215 nm or radioactivity of the fractions. After desalting and deproteination, the sample was taken directly to an α2,3-sialylT reaction. Radiolabeled [3H]GP-3 was galactosylated using UDP-[3H]Gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) (10,000 cpm/nmol) as a donor. GP-4 (1 mm) was sialylated using 20 milliunits of α2,3-(N)-sialylT (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 3 mm CMP-NeuAc (Sigma) in a total volume of 50 μl of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3. After 14 h of incubation at 37 °C, a 1-μg sample was analyzed by HPLC, which showed that GP-4 had been converted completely into a faster moving product, GP-5 (retention time 29.7 min) (Fig. 3). In MALDI-TOF analysis, the observed m/z for the [M − H]− molecular ion of GP-5 was 3770.6 (calculated m/z 3771.9) (Fig. 4). The reaction mixture was used directly for the α1,3-FucT reaction. Radiolabeled [3H]GP-4 (0.1 mm) was also sialylated using the donor CMP-[3H]NeuAc (0.2 mm, 31,500 cpm/nmol) (NEN Life Science Products). GP-5 (0.4 mm) was α1,3-fucosylated for 16 h at 37 °C with 2 milliunits of α1,3-FucT-VI (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and GDP-Fuc (0.8 mm) (Calbiochem) in a total volume of 120 μl of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 20 mm MnCl2 and 0.02% NaN3. Deproteinated and desalted sample was analyzed by HPLC, which showed that GP-5 was converted completely into the product GP-6 (retention time 29.1 min) (Fig. 3). In MALDI-TOF analysis, the observed m/z for the [M − H]−molecular ion of GP-6 was 3917.5 (calculated m/z 3918.1) (Fig. 4). Starting with 185 μg of GP-2, the overall recovery of GP-6 was 88 μg, as determined by UV absorbance at 275 nm during the HPLC runs. Radiolabeled [3H]GP-4 was fucosylated using GDP-[14C]Fuc (83,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the donor. Several aliquots of GP-6 (0.02 mm) were sulfated for 35 h at 37 °C using 0.15 mm PAPS (Sigma) or [35S]PAPS (NEN Life Science Products) (specific activity 30,300 cpm/nmol) and 0.85 nmol/h of recombinant human TPST-1 (32Ouyang Y.B.

After chloroform-methanol (2:1) extraction to remove protein and detergent, the reaction mixture was desalted by gel filtration and subjected to HPLC. The retention time of the product, GSP-6, was 15.6 min (Fig. 3), and the conversion of GP-6 to GSP-6 was >95%. Electrospray mass spectrum analysis showed the molecular mass of GSP-6 as 4158.0 (calculated 4159.2), confirming that three sulfate groups were present (Fig. 4). Alternatively, a radiolabeled form of GSP-6 was generated by incubating GP-6 (0.01 mm) for 14–17 h with 0.06 mm[35S]PAPS (107,000–559,000 cpm/nmol) and 0.36 nmol/h of TPST-1 in a total volume of 50 μl. The conversion of GP-6 to35SO3-GSP-6 was >85%. GP-2 (0.08 mm) was sulfated for 35 h at 37 °C by using 0.6 mm PAPS (Sigma) and 4.8 nmol/h of affinity-purified recombinant TPST-1 in a total reaction volume of 400 μl. After deproteination and desalting, the sample was analyzed by HPLC. The retention time of the product was 21.4 min (Fig. 3), and the conversion of GP-2 to GSP-2 was 98%. Electrospray mass spectra of GSP-2 showed the molecular mass as 3356.0 (calculated 3356.5), which confirmed that three sulfate groups were present (Fig. 4). Alternatively, GP-2 (0.04 mm) was sulfated for 18 h at 37 °C using [35S]PAPS (0.2 mm, 30300 cpm/nmol) (Sigma) and TPST-1 (0.7 nmol/h) in a total volume of 56 μl. The conversion of GP-2 to 35SO3-GSP-2 was >95%. GP-5 was sulfated in a similar fashion as GP-6 using [35S]PAPS (30300 cpm/nmol) as a donor. The conversion of GP-5 to35SO3-GSP-5 was >90%. The retention time of35SO3-GSP-5 was 17.5 min in HPLC (data not shown). Extension of GP-2 was carried out using purified recombinant β1,3-GlcNAcT from Neisseria meningitidis IgtA (34Blixt O. van Die I. Norberg T. van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Acceptor GP-2 (0.1 mm) was incubated for 20 h at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 8 nmol/h of β1,3-GlcNAcT (activity assayed using lactose as an acceptor) in a total volume of 100 μl in 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MnCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After deproteination and desalting the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. The retention time of the product GP-3′ was 31.9 min (data not shown). The conversion of GP-2 to GP-3′ was 62%. In MALDI-TOF analysis, the observed m/z for the [M − H]− molecular ion of GP-3′ was 3317.8 (calculated m/z 3318.5) (data not shown). β1,4-GalT, α2,3-sialylT, and α1,3-FucT-VI reactions were carried out essentially as described above. Each glycosyltransferase reaction was followed by HPLC. GP-6′ had a retention time of 30.3 min in HPLC (data not shown). In MALDI-TOF analysis, the observed m/z for the [M − H]− molecular ion of GP-6′ was 3917.6 (calculated m/z 3918.1) (data not shown). The TPST-1 reaction using GP-6′ as an acceptor and [35S]PAPS (400,000 cpm/nmol) as a donor was performed as described for GP-6. The retention time of 35SO3-GSP-6′ was 18.7 min in HPLC. Partially sulfated slower moving products were not present. Glycopeptide samples were filtered on a Spin-X membrane (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and were subsequently analyzed in a reversed phase C-18 HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on a Beckman System Gold HPLC. The following solvent system was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 1–10 min, 20% acetonitrile, 80% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 10–70 min, linear acetonitrile gradient from 20% to 45% in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The UV absorbance at 215 nm or 275 nm was monitored and/or the radioactivity of the collected fractions was measured. The pooled fractions were dried under vacuum.

Samples were eluted with buffer A (including35SO3-GSP-6), and 140-μl fractions were collected at a flow rate of 70 μl/min. Radioactivity in the fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments to test inhibitors of binding between sPS and GSP-6 were performed using 400 pmol of sPS and 5,000 cpm/ml of35SO3-GSP-6. The EDTA concentration was 1 mm in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.02% NaN3. Anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibodies (G1 and S12) (800 pmol each) were preincubated for 30 min with sPS in buffer A before 35SO3-GSP-6 was added. Elution was performed by using buffer A with35SO3-GSP-6. Soluble P-selectin was coupled to UltralinkTM biosupport medium (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. P-selectin columns (0.8 ml, 0.6 × 2.7 cm) of different densities (0, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, and 2.0 mg/ml) were equilibrated with 25 ml of buffer A. Radiolabeled glyco(sulfo)peptides (800–1000 cpm, 1–10 pmol) were dissolved in 200 μl of buffer A and applied to the sPS-columns. Bound material was eluted with buffer B (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3). Fraction size was 0.5 ml, and the flow rate was 200–250 μl/min. All fractions were counted for radioactivity. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed in the linear negative ion delayed extraction mode with a BiflexTM time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. HPLC-purified glycopeptide samples, except GSP-2 and GSP-6, were dissolved in 30% aqueous acetonitrile, and a 0.5-μl aliquot (about 2.5 pmol) was mixed with 0.5 μl of 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone matrix (3 mg/ml in acetonitrile, 20 mm aqueous diammonium citrate, 1:1, by volume) and immediately dried under reduced pressure. The spectra were externally calibrated with insulin [M − H]− and [M − 2H]2− signals. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were collected in the negative ion mode using a Q-TOF hybrid quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). GSP-2 and GSP-6 were dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and injected into the mass spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Instrument calibration was performed with sodium trifluoroacetate ion clusters (38Moini M. Jones B.L. Rogers R.M. Jiang L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 977-980Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 35SO3-GSP-6 (6,000 cpm) was desialylated by treatment with 8.4 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (Sigma) in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, for 13 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was desalted and deproteinated before analysis by chromatography on sPS columns.

Oxidized lipids present in minimally modified-low density lipoproteins (MM-LDL) contribute to this process by activating endothelial cells to express monocyte-specific adhesion molecules and chemoattractant factors. A major focus of our group has been the isolation and characterization of the biologically active oxidized lipids in MM-LDL. We have previously characterized three oxidized phospholipids present in MM-LDL, atherosclerotic lesions of fat fed rabbits, and autoxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) that induced human aortic endothelial cells to adhere human monocytes in vitro. We have used sequential normal and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography to isolate various isomers of an oxidized phospholipid from autoxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The fatty acid in the sn-2 position of this biologically active isomer and its dehydration product was released by phospholipase A2 and characterized. Hydrogenation with platinum(IV) oxide/hydrogen suggested a cyclic moiety, and reduction with sodium borohydride suggested two reducible oxygen-containing groups in the molecule. The fragmentation pattern produced by electrospray ionization-collision induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry was consistent with a molecule resembling an E-ring prostaglandin with an epoxide at the 5,6 position. The structure of this lipid was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of the free fatty acid isolated from the dehydration product of m/z 828.5. Based on these studies, we arrived at the structure of the biologically active oxidized phospholipids as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.

The precursor of the atherosclerotic lesion, the fatty streak, begins to develop in the first decade of life and is characterized by the accumulation of monocyte/macrophages within the intimal layer of the blood vessel (3Strong J.P.

Later, highly oxidized lipids such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal modify the protein component of LDL so that it is recognized by the macrophage scavenger/oxidized LDL receptor rather than the native LDL receptor (13Fogelman A.M.

Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages generates foam cells that reside in the subendothelial space. It is the lipid-laden foam cells that are the hallmark of the fatty streak lesion. We have previously demonstrated that mildly oxidized LDL, which we have termed “minimally modified” (MM-LDL), stimulated human aortic endothelial cells to bind human monocytes in vitro (9Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). By separating the components of MM-LDL it was found that the phospholipid fraction contained nearly all of the biological activity (9Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). When the phospholipids from MM-LDL and native LDL were compared it was found that phospholipids containing arachidonic acid were preferentially oxidized compared to phospholipids containing other polyunsaturated fatty acids (16Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This lead us to suspect that the biologically active phospholipids were oxidized derivatives of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids. We then found that autoxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) had identical biological properties as MM-LDL, and we began using Ox-PAPC as a surrogate for MM-LDL (17Watson A.D.

Recently, our group has described three compounds present in MM-LDL, Ox-PAPC, and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions that stimulated endothelial cells to bind monocytes in vitro (18Watson A.D.

All were derived from the oxidation of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids in LDL (16Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that antibodies to these lipids were spontaneously produced in vivo by apolipoprotein E knockout mice that were genetically predisposed to develop atherosclerosis (18Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

Two of the biologically active compounds were produced by oxidative fragmentation of the arachidonic acid moiety in the sn-2 position of PAPC and were identified as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5)oxovaleryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC). The molecular structure of the third molecule, which gave a signal at m/z 828.5 by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), was not determined at that time. In this study we provide evidence that this molecule contained an epoxyisoprostane in the sn-2 position of the phospholipid (SchemeFS1 A) and this molecule undergoes dehydration to form a structurally similar molecule with a mass of 810.5 [M + H+] (Scheme FS1 B). Tissue culture media, serum, and supplements were obtained from Irvine Scientific and Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. Acetonitrile, chloroform, methanol, ethyl acetate, and water (all Optima grade) were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA. Gelatin (endotoxin-free, tissue culture grade), porcine liver esterase, calcium chloride, methoxylamine hydrochloride, ammonium acetate, sodium borohydride, platinum(IV) oxide, phospholipase A2(naja naja), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were obtained from Sigma. Authentic l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) or Sigma. Deuterated chloroform (99.99% D), deuterated methanol (99+% D), and deuterium oxide (99.9% D) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Sodium borodeuteride was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Human aortic endothelial cells at passages 4–7 were cultured as described in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (9Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B.

These studies were performed essentially as described previously (9Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Blood monocytes were isolated from a large pool of healthy human blood donors by a modification of the Recalde procedure (19Fogelman A.M. Sykes K. Van Lenten B.J. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For monocyte adhesion assays, human aortic endothelial cells were incubated with test medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The test medium was removed, the endothelial cells were washed, and a suspension of human monocytes was added for 12–15 min after which nonadherent monocytes were removed. Bound monocytes were counted and expressed as monocytes/microscopic field. PAPC was oxidized by transferring 1 mg in 100 μl of chloroform to a clean 16 × 125-mm glass test tube and evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen. The lipid residue was allowed to autoxidize while exposed to air for 24–72 h at room temperature. The extent of oxidation was monitored by flow injection ESI-MS. Normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) was performed by injecting oxidized phospholipid preparations (resuspended in chloroform) onto a silica column (Adsorbosphere, 250 × 22-mm, 5 μm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) and eluting isocratically with a mobile solvent of acetonitrile/methanol/water (77:8:15, v/v/v, pH 5.0 with formic acid) at a flow rate of 18.0 ml/min. Typically, Ox-PAPC produced from 25–35 mg of PAPC was applied for each run. Reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) of oxidized phospholipids was performed with a C8 column (Betasil, C8, 250 × 10-mm, 5 μm, Keystone Scientific, Inc.). Phospholipids were eluted with a mobile phase of 80% methanol that was changed linearly over a period of 60 min to 100% methanol at 5 ml/min. Fractions containing oxidized phospholipids of interest were collected by monitoring ultraviolet absorbance and ESI-MS (LC/MS). Oxidized free fatty acids were separated by RP-HPLC using a C18 column (Betasil, C18, 250 × 10-mm, 5 μm, Keystone Scientific, Inc.). A mobile phase of 60% methanol containing 1 mm ammonium acetate changed linearly over 60 min to 100% methanol containing 1 mm ammonium acetate was used. When isolating lipids for NMR analysis, solvents without ammonium acetate were used. UV absorbance was detected with a diode array detector (L-3000, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) scanning from 200 to 350 nm at 2.5 nm resolution. Phospholipid fractions collected by HPLC were dried under argon to a lipid residue and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2. To this solution was added 5 units of phospholipase A2. The solution was mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. After incubation, the lipids were extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate containing 0.01% BHT after acidification with formic acid to pH 3.0. Phospholipid fraction containing 828.5 (i2) was isolated by sequential NP-HPLC and RP-HPLC from 5 mg of Ox-PAPC. The fraction was dried under argon, and 1 ml of 0.92 mm methoxylamine hydrochloride in 1× phosphate-buffered saline was added. The solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. After incubation the lipids were extracted with CHCl3/MeOH + BHT and analyzed by positive ion ESI-MS. Chemical reduction of lipids was achieved by addition of 600 μl of a 70 mm solution of sodium borohydride or sodium borodeuteride in acetonitrile at room temperature for 30 min. Following incubation, 1 ml of ethyl acetate containing 0.01% BHT and 1 ml of water was added. The solution was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The ethyl acetate phase was transferred to a clean glass tube, and 30 μl of formic acid was added to displace sodium from phospholipid sodium salts. Lipids were hydrogenated by exposure to hydrogen gas in the presence of platinum(IV) oxide (20Thomas D.W. van Kuijk F.J. Dratz E.A. Stephens R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Oxidized lipids were resuspended in 300 μl of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 25-ml round bottom flask. Platinum(IV) oxide (1 mg) was added and the flask was covered with a rubber septum. Two 18-gauge hypodermic needles were placed through the septum, and the flask was flushed by introduction of hydrogen through one of the needles. After flushing, one of the needles was removed and a balloon containing hydrogen gas was attached to the other. The samples were incubated with constant stirring at room temperature for 45 min. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 13 × 100-mm glass test tube and dried under argon gas. The lipid residue was resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), 400 μl of water, and 20 μl of concentrated formic acid and then the lipids were recovered from the chloroform phase after mixing and centrifugation. 18Oxygen exchange experiments were performed by incubation of the free fatty acids with porcine liver esterase in H218O (21Westcott J.Y. Clay K.L. Murphy R.C. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1985; 12: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To the oxidized fatty acid residue was added 100 μl of H218O and 23 units of porcine liver esterase. The contents were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with occasional mixing. Lipids were extracted by addition of 300 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to the reaction mixture. ESI-MS was performed using an API III triple-quadrupole biomolecular mass analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Norwalk, CT) fitted with an articulated, pneumatically assisted nebulization probe and an atmospheric pressure ionization source. Details of calibration and tuning have been described previously (18Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were introduced into the mass spectrometer by direct flow injection analysis (FIA) in acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) or via liquid chromatography (LC/MS) and analyzed as the protonated molecule [M + H+] in positive ion mode. The mass spectrometer was set to scan from m/z 450 to 950 with an orifice voltage of +65, a step size of 0.3, a dwell time of 3 msec, and a scan speed of ∼4 s. Fatty acids were analyzed as carboxylate anions [M−] by FIA in methanol/water (50:50, v/v) with 1 mm ammonium acetate or by LC/MS in chromatography solvent. For negative ion ESI-MS/MS, a solvent of 100% methanol with 1 mm ammonium acetate was used, and daughter ion spectra were obtained by colliding the Q1 selected ion of interest with argon in Q2, and scanning Q3 to analyze the fragment ion products. Reconstructed selected ion chromatograms were produced by software supplied by PE Sciex. High resolution-fast atom bombardment/MS spectra were obtained using a VG ZAB-SE fast atom bombardment mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a 11/250 data system. HPLC fractions containing oxidized phospholipids of interest were dried under argon and resuspended in an aqueous solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To the static fast atom bombardment probe containing 1–2 μl of liquid matrix (m-nitrobenzylalcohol/thioglycerol/trifluoroacetic acid, 50:50:0.5, v/v/v) was added 1–2 μl of the oxidized phospholipid solution. Spectra were recorded using a 8 kV accelerating potential, cesium bombardment at 22 kV and 1–2 μA, and a mass resolution of 3,000 (10% valley, M/ΔM). The mass spectrometer was set to scan from m/z 200–1,000, and ∼10 scans were collected into a multichannel analyzer. The data were smoothed, centroided, and mass measured using cesium iodide ion clusters for calibration. All proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-500 MHz spectrometer using a microprobe (2.5 mm) NMR tube. Proton chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) on the δ scale with reference to CHCl3 (δ 7.24).1H NMR spectral data were tabulated in terms of multiplicity of proton absorption (s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of a doublet; dt, doublet of a triplet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad), coupling constants (Hz), and number of protons. Purified lipids were dried under argon, resuspended in CDCl3 (90 μl) and transferred to a microprobe NMR tube for analysis. Proton-proton homodecoupling experiments were performed using a power level of 55 dB. Absorbance spectra in the 190–500 nm range for various oxidized phospholipids were measured using a Shimadzu Biospec-1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc, Columbia, MD). For extinction coefficient determination, the isomers of 828.5 and 810.5 were isolated by sequential normal phase and reverse phase HPLC and quantified by FIA-ESI-MS using dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine as an internal standard (22Han X. Gubitosi-Klug R.A. Collins B.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5822-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorbance was scanned for m/z 828.5 and 810.5 isomers in methanol (1 ml) at three different concentrations. Using these absorbance values, molar extinction coefficients were calculated (23Silverstein R.M. Bassler G.C. Morrill T.C. Spectroscopic Identification of Organic Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 289-315Google Scholar) for isomers of m/z 828.5 and 810.5. We have previously separated the phospholipid components of Ox-PAPC by NP-HPLC and found that the second peak enriched in m/z 828.5 induced endothelial cells to bind monocytes in vitro (18Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments and collected the active fraction between 16.5 and 18.0 min (Fig. 1 A) that contained mostly m/z 828.5 and 810.5 (mass spectrum not shown). The lipids in this fraction were then applied to a reverse phase column, which effectively separated several isomers of m/z 828.5 and 810.5 (Fig. 1 B). Each major peak was collected, dried under argon, resuspended in tissue culture medium, and tested for the ability to induce endothelial cells to bind monocytes. The only peak that showed significant biological activity above control was the second of the peaks containing m/z 828.5 (Fig. 1 C). This isomer caused a dose-dependent increase in monocyte binding reaching a statistically significant increase over control as low as 380 ng/ml. The fatty acid hydrolyzed from the sn-2 position of the biologically active isomer did not induce monocyte-endothelial interactions (data not shown). As a convention throughout this article, the five major isomers of m/z 828.5 resolved by RP-LC/MS will henceforth be abbreviated 828.5 (i1–5) and the three major isomers of m/z 810.5 will be abbreviated 810.5 (i1–3). All isomers with m/z 828.5 possessed nearly identical UV maxima at 252 nm, and all isomers of the m/z 810.5 possessed identical UV maxima at 257 nm (Fig.2). These UV maxima were consistent with a specific conjugated system within all of these molecules. Extinction coefficients (ε) at room temperature in methanol for the various isomers were calculated to be: 828.5 (i1) = 24,070; 828.5 (i2) = 18,632; 828.5 (i3) = 17,975; 828.5 (i4) = 22,275; 828.5 (i5) = 15,917; 810.5 (i1) = 20,503; 810.5 (i2) = 19,572; and 810.5 (i3) = 14,950. To confirm the molecular formula of m/z 828.5 we analyzed the molecule by high resolution-fast atom bombardment/MS. The experimental mass of the ion was determined to be 828.5391, which closely matched the mass of a molecule with the elemental composition of C44H79NO11P (calculated mass = 828.5381). Because unoxidized PAPC has an elemental composition of C44H81NO8P, we concluded that during oxidation this molecule acquired three oxygen atoms and lost two hydrogen atoms. Based on the mass of the products observed after phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of this molecule, we further concluded that the only oxidized part of the PAPC molecule was the arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position of PAPC. Thus, the molecular formula of this oxidized fatty acid in the sn-2 position was C20H30O5, compared with the elemental formula of arachidonic acid, C20H32O2. Periodically, positive ion ESI-MS was performed on stored preparations of Ox-PAPC and it was noticed that the relative ratio of 828.5 to 810.5 decreased over time, suggesting that 810.5 may be a decomposition product of 828.5. To test this, we isolated isomers of 828.5 by RP-LC/MS and allowed each of them to undergo spontaneous dehydration. After 48 h at 4 °C in chloroform, we reanalyzed the sample by RP-LC/MS using the same chromatographic conditions that were used for original isolation. Two isomers of 828.5 were collected, the biologically active isomer, 828.5 (i2), and a biologically inactive isomer, 828.5 (i5), (Fig.3 A). After 48 h at 4 °C, 828.5 (i2) had partially decomposed to a molecule that co-migrated with 810.5 (i2) eluting at 31.5 min (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the tube containing 828.5 (i5) contained a mixture of two isomers of 810.5 that co-eluted at 30.0 min and 32.5 min with 810.5 (i1) and 810.5 (i3), respectively (Fig. 3 C). This experiment showed that 828.5 (i2) underwent dehydration to form 810.5 (i2) and that 828.5 (i5) underwent dehydration to form 810.5 (i1) and 810.5 (i3). In addition, this suggested that the molecular structure of 810.5 (i2) was similar to 828.5 (i2). Derivatization with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide demonstrated the presence of one hydroxyl group in m/z 828.5, which was lost in m/z 810.5 (data not shown). As a measure of the number of carbonyl or epoxide groups we examined the derivatization of the molecule with methoxylamine hydrochloride, which adds 47 mass units to carbonyl group and reactive epoxide groups. Treatment of 828.5 (i2) with methoxylamine hydrochloride yielded several compounds (Fig.4). An ion at m/z 857.4 was produced by the addition of a methoxylamine group and subsequent loss of water ([M + H+] + 47 − 18). An ion at m/z 875.7 was produced by the addition of a methoxylamine without the loss of water ([M + H+] + 47). An ion at m/z 886.5 was produced by the addition of two methoxylamine groups with subsequent loss of two waters {[M + H+] + 2(47) − 2(18)}. An ion at m/z 904.5 was produced by the addition of two methoxylamines with the loss of one water. When the reaction with methoxylamine hydrochloride was allowed to proceed, the most abundant ion was m/z 904.5 (data not shown). These data indicate the presence of two groups on m/z 828.5, which react with methoxylamine hydrochloride. Reduction of the molecules (m/z 810.5 and 828.5) by sodium borohydride and sodium borodeuteride was used to confirm the number of reducible oxygen groups. Sodium borohydride can effectively reduce hydroperoxides, ketones, aldehydes, and some epoxides to hydroxyl groups, thereby altering the molecular weight of the molecule in a predictable manner. Individual isomers of 828.5 and 810.5 were isolated by RP-LC/MS and then treated with sodium borohydride, re-extracted, and analyzed by positive ion FIA-ESI-MS. Each reactive group adds two hydrogens. After reduction with sodium borohydride, the molecular weight of each isomer of 828.5 was increased by 4 Da to m/z 832.5. This suggested that all isomers of 828.5 possessed two reducible oxygen-containing functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, and/or reactive epoxides. Fig.5 shows the positive ion ESI-MS of the purified biologically active isomer, 828.5 (i2), before (Fig.5 A) and after (Fig. 5 B) sodium borohydride reduction. Some 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (m/z 496.2) and its corresponding sodium salt (m/z 518.1) were produced by partial saponification of the phospholipid during the reduction procedure. The reduction was likely incomplete because of the presence of a signal at m/z 830.4. Treatment with sodium borodeuteride, in addition to reducing an aldehyde, ketone, or reactive epoxide, will simultaneously add two deuterium atoms to the group, one associated with oxygen. Because ESI-MS was performed in a solvent containing H2O, the deuterium bound to the oxygen will undergo rapid exchange with protons in the solvent. Indeed, when 828.5 (i2) was treated with sodium borodeuteride the major product was an ion at m/z 834.5 rather than m/z 832.5 as seen when the molecule was treated with sodium borohydride (data not shown). These deuterium additions are consistent with the presence of two reducible oxygen functionalities. When 810.5 (i2) was treated with sodium borohydride, the mass was increased by six mass units to 816.6 (data not shown), and with sodium borodeuteride, the mass was increased by nine mass units to 819.6 (Fig.6 A). Because this molecule only possessed two reducible oxygen groups, a reactive double bond of the enone was also reduced. It is known that treatment of reactive enones with sodium borohydride results in the reduction of both carbonyl groups as well as double bonds (24Johnson M.R."

MTP exists in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum as a heterodimer with protein-disulfide isomerase and is involved in the transfer of triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids to newly synthesized apoB (1Gregg R.E.

In human patients with abetalipoproteinemia, the absence of functional MTP results in a defect in the assembly and secretion of plasma lipoproteins containing apoB (3Wettreau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P.

In the absence of either MTP lipid transfer activity or sufficient lipid, apoB translocation and lipoprotein assembly are blocked, and apoB is rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome process. Under physiological conditions, only a portion of de novo synthesized apoB is secreted; the remaining portion is degraded (5Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol.

These findings raise the possibility that changes in MTP activities under various physiological conditions may modulate lipoprotein production and secretion in the liver and intestine. Recent studies have demonstrated that a high-fat diet fed to hamsters causes an increase in the hepatic MTP mRNA levels (8Lin M.C.M. Arbeeny C. Bergquist K. Kienzle B. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. J.

Insulin treatment has also been reported to decrease very low density lipoprotein secretion from hepatocytes (11Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8854-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, oleate stimulates apoB-containing lipoprotein secretion by preventing the intracellular degradation of apoB (12Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that oxysterols regulate the production of lipoproteins by modulating the ubiquitin conjugation of apoB and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (14Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitsen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1856-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the effect of sterols on MTP mRNA and protein levels. It has been reported that sterols affect the transcription of a number of genes encoding enzymes and proteins involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism through the actions of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (15Brown B.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). SREBPs activate the transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase, and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. SREBPs also stimulate the transcription of genes encoding fatty acid synthesis enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty-acid synthase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase). Unlike other members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family, SREBPs are synthesized as precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear envelope (16Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active NH2-terminal portion including the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain is released from the membrane by two-step proteolysis (18Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, SREBPs are cleaved at site 1 in the endoplasmic reticulum luminal loop by site-1 protease, which allows site-2 protease to cleave at site 2 within the first membrane-spanning region. The activity of site-1 protease is subject to negative feedback regulation by cholesterol. When cells are overloaded with sterols, the proteolytic process is blocked; the NH2-terminal domains are not released; and transcription of the target genes declines. In this report, we examine whether MTP mRNA and protein levels are affected by sterols and SREBPs, testing our hypothesis that SREBPs might control lipoprotein production and secretion by regulating MTP gene expression. We also characterize the human MTP promoter and define the region responsible for the sterol-dependent regulation. Furthermore, we investigate how SREBPs regulate MTP gene expression, compared with insulin-negative effects. The luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the Bgl II-Hin dIII polymerase chain reaction fragments coding the 5′-untranslated region of the human MTP gene into the same restriction sites of a pGL3 basic vector (Promega). To generate pMTP−204, pMTP−124, pMTP−109, and pMTP−100, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to hybridize at the corresponding position (19Sharp D. Ricci B. Kienzle B. Lin M.C.M. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and were coupled with the common downstream primer from nucleotide +33 (Fig. 1). To disrupt the SRE, the megaprimers were amplified with the upstream primer with six mutations (AGCCCA → GAATTC at the SRE, GCAGCCCAC) and the common downstream primer and further extended in the second polymerase chain reaction as described previously (20Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The LDL receptor luciferase plasmid, designated pLDLR, contains the 1.5-kilobase human LDL receptor promoter (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in a pGL3 basic vector. Expression plasmids, e.g. pSREBP1-(1–487), were constructed as described previously (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and pSREBP2-(31–481) was constructed by replacing the Xho I-Bst EII fragment (600 bp) of pSREBP2-(1–481) with the Xho I-Bst EII polymerase chain reaction fragment (510 bp) amplified with the upstream primer (amino acids 31–36) utilizing methionine at the position corresponding to amino acid 31 as an initiator codon. Monolayers of human HepG2 cells were set up on day 0 (2.5 × 105cells/35-mm dish) in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml Fungizone) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum (FCS). On day 1, the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 2 μg of one of the reporter luciferase plasmids and 1 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega). After 4 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS supplemented either with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol or with a 50 μm concentration of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) plus 50 μmsodium mevalonate. In the cotransfection experiments, 10 ng of an expression plasmid for SREBP-1 or -2 was added. After 4 h, the cells were refed with medium A containing 7% FCS. After 48 h of culture, the cells were processed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by the β-galactosidase activity to give a normalized luciferase value. HepG2 cells were set up on day 0 (1.8 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) in medium A supplemented with 7% FCS. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with PBS and refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS supplemented with either sterols or the inhibitor, as described above. After 48 h of culture, total RNA was extracted and fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and then transferred to nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Riboprobes were prepared using human MTP cDNA (890–1560 bp downstream of the initiator codon) and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (963–1245 bp) with a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization signals were quantified with AttoPhos (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). HepG2 cells were set up on day 0 (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) in medium A supplemented with 7% FCS. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with PBS and refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS with or without 5 μg/ml cholesterol. After 14 days of culture, the cells were refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS supplemented with either sterols or the inhibitor, as described above. After 2 days of culture, the cells were harvested, and Western blot analysis was carried out using a polyclonal antibody against human MTP with the Vistra fluorescence Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signals for 97-kDa MTP were quantified using a FluorImager 595. A double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −128 to −112 was 3′-end-labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP using a DIG gel shift kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 100 ng of recombinant SREBP-2-(1–481), 30 fmol of the end-labeled probe, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20, and 30 mm KCl. Each reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Following the addition of 0.5 μg of antibodies, the reaction mixture was placed on ice for 30 min and then loaded directly onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. In competition assays, an excess amount of an unlabeled 17-bp fragment was added prior to addition of the labeled probe. The bands were detected by an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HepG2 cells were set up on day 0 in medium A supplemented with 2.5% FCS. On day 1, after 4 h of transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with PBS and refed with medium A containing 2.5% LPDS supplemented with the indicated concentration of insulin in the presence of either sterols or the inhibitor, as described above. After 48 h of culture, the cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were carried out. For Western blot analysis of SREBP-2, the nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells without transfection were prepared as described previously (16Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies (RS001 against human MTP and RS004 against human SREBP-2) were produced by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein encoding six consecutive histidines followed by amino acids 300–507 of human MTP and amino acids 1–481 of human SREBP-2, respectively. The fusion protein constructs were cloned into a pET28(a) vector (Novagen), expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography. HepG2 cells were cultured with LPDS in the presence of either sterols (sterol-loaded conditions) or a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) plus mevalonic acid (sterol-depleted conditions), and their total RNA was prepared. In the absence of sterols, the MTP mRNA level was reduced by 53% (Fig.2 A). To see if such reduced mRNA levels lead to an decrease in MTP protein levels, Western blot analysis was carried out. Because the half-life of the MTP protein has been reported to be relatively long (4.4 days), HepG2 cells were cultured for a longer than usual period either in the presence or absence of cholesterol (10Lin M.C.M. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of a 97-kDa band detected by a polyclonal antibody against human MTP declined by 49% in the absence of sterols (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that intracellular cholesterol affects MTP protein levels in the long term through the regulation of its mRNA levels. It is of interest to determine whether the above phenomenon is due to transcriptional regulation of the MTP gene. Thus, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the human MTP gene and searched for the sequence motifs potentially responsible for such regulation. It has been demonstrated using luciferase assays that the MTP promoter activity is positively regulated by cholesterol (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed various deletion versions of reporter genes (Fig. 1) and carried out luciferase assays. HepG2 cells were transfected with these reporter genes and cultured under sterol-loaded or -depleted conditions for 2 days. Fig.3 shows that a significant decrease in luciferase activity was observed under the sterol-depleted conditions with the −204 and −124 bp reporter genes (pMTP−204 and pMTP−124, respectively), but there was no alteration with the −109 and −100 bp reporter genes (pMTP−109 and pMTP−100, respectively). The magnitude of suppression of luciferase activity by sterol depletion (40–50%) was similar to that of endogenous MTP mRNA (Fig. 2). Deletion of the region between −109 and −100 bp containing a putative AP-1-binding site (Fig. 1) reduced luciferase activity dramatically, suggesting that this region is critical for transcription. To determine whether the above phenomenon is due to effects of SREBPs that are activated by proteolysis under sterol-depleted conditions, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with one of the reporter genes and an expression construct of an active form of SREBP-2 (amino acids 1–481) or SREBP-1 (amino acids 1–487). Enforced expression of SREBP-2-(1–481) or SREBP-1-(1–487) diminished the luciferase activity of pMTP−204 or pMTP−124, respectively (Table I), mimicking the sterol-depleted conditions observed in Fig. 2. Further deletions from −124 to −109 or −100 bp abolished the inhibitory effects of SREBP-1 and -2. These results strongly suggest that the human MTP promoter contains the elements regulated by sterols and that the region between −124 and −109 bp is necessary for SREBP-mediated transcriptional regulation.Table ISREBP-1 and -2 suppress MTP gene expressionReporter gene constructActivitySREBP-2-(1–481)SREBP-1-(1–487)% of controlpMTP−20451 ± 3—1-a—, not determined.pMTP−12460 ± 648 ± 5pMTP−109106 ± 12102 ± 8pMTP−100126 ± 15—HepG2 cells were transfected with one of the reporter gene constructs, an expression construct for β-galactosidase, and an expression plasmid encoding the active form of either SREBP-1 (amino acids 1–487) or SREBP-2 (amino acids 1–481).

Data are expressed as means ± S.D. The region between −124 and −109 bp contains a GCAGCCCAC sequence (−124 to −116 bp), resembling the SRE sequence in the LDL receptor gene (TCACCCCAC). To determine whether the putative SRE is able to bind SREBP-2, we performed gel mobility shift assays with recombinant human SREBP-2-(1–481) and a digoxigenin-labeled DNA fragment. As shown in Fig. 4, a single-shifted DNA-protein complex was observed in the presence of recombinant SREBP-2 (lane 2). The band almost completely disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of an unlabeled wild-type probe, but not a mutant probe (lanes 4 and 5), and was supershifted by antibodies against human SREBP-2 (lane 3). These results clearly show that SREBP-2 is capable of binding the GCAGCCCAC sequence in the MTP promoter. To verify that the SRE is involved in the SREBP-mediated transcriptional regulation of the human MTP gene, luciferase assays using the SRE mutant reporter gene were carried out (Fig.5). HepG2 cells were cultured under sterol-loaded or -depleted conditions or were cotransfected with an expression construct of an active form of SREBP-2. In support of the involvement of the SRE site, suppression of luciferase activities by both sterol depletion and SREBP-2 expression was abolished when the SRE was mutated (pMTP−124SREKO) (Fig. 5, A and B) or deleted (pMTP−109) (Fig. 6 A), and the level of luciferase expression increased ∼1.8-fold by mutation of the SRE (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the SRE site is essential for the SREBP-mediated transcriptional regulation of the MTP gene.Figure 6Effect of deletion of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain in SREBP-2 on the expression of reporter genes. A and B, HepG2 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter and expression plasmids (10 ng).

The acidic NH2-terminal region of SREBPs acts as the transcriptional activation domain, and deletion of this sequence prevents transcriptional activation of the LDL receptor gene (16Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a truncated version of SREBP-2 (amino acids 31–481) lacking 30 amino acids in the transactivation domain coded in exon 1 inhibits MTP transcription, luciferase assays using reporter genes and expression constructs of wild-type or truncated SREBP-2 were carried out. As long as the SRE was intact, both wild-type and truncated SREBP-2 similarly diminished luciferase activity by ∼40% (Fig. 6 A). Once the SRE was deleted (pMTP−109) or mutated (pMTP−124SREKO), neither wild-type nor truncated SREBP-2 altered luciferase activity. On the contrary, SREBP-2-(31–481) inhibited transcription of the LDL receptor, whereas SREBP-2-(1–481) stimulated it (Fig. 6 B). These results show that the mechanism by which MTP transcription is regulated by SREBPs is distinct from that for the LDL receptor gene and further support the direct involvement of SREBPs through binding to the SRE. It has been reported that insulin negatively regulates MTP gene expression and that the region between −123 and −112 bp is essential for the insulin response (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the SRE in the MTP promoter is found in this region raises the possibility that SREBPs might mediate certain gene regulatory effects of insulin or that SREBPs might simply mimic the functions of an unknown DNA-binding protein activated by insulin. To see if the insulin effect is dependent on SREBPs, luciferase assays using various reporter genes in the presence or absence of insulin were performed. HepG2 cells were transfected with one of the reporter genes and cultured under either sterol-loaded or -depleted conditions in the presence of the indicated concentration of insulin for 2 days. When cells were transfected with the −124 bp reporter gene, MTP gene expression was suppressed under sterol-loaded conditions (Fig.7 A, white bars) by 38 and 53% at insulin concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 μm, respectively. However, insulin did not affect the reduced luciferase activity that occurred under sterol-depleted conditions (Fig.7 A, shaded bars). Luciferase activity with the LDL receptor reporter gene was increased under sterol-depleted conditions in the presence or absence of insulin (Fig. 7 B). Fig. 7 C shows that the amounts of active forms of nuclear SREBP-2 under sterol-loaded conditions were significantly low in the presence or absence of insulin as determined by Western blotting. Therefore, the suppression of MTP gene expression by insulin under sterol-loaded conditions might imply that SREBPs only slightly mediate, if at all, the insulin-negative effect. When cells were transfected with the −109 bp reporter gene without both the SRE and the putative insulin-responsive element, luciferase activity was not changed by the addition of sterols or insulin to the medium, in accordance with the results in Fig. 3 as well as observations in a previous report (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the effects of sterols on the MTP activity that controls the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins from the small intestine and liver. We have demonstrated that sterols regulate MTP gene expression and the amount of the protein in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). We performed a series of luciferase assays to identify the sequence motifs responsible for transcriptional regulation of the MTP gene. Since it has been reported that all the putative positive and negative response elements for the liver-specific MTP gene expression are localized within the human MTP promoter −142 bp region (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we focused on the promoter activity of the first 200 bp 5′ to the transcription start site. The following line of evidence indicates that SREBPs can negatively regulate MTP gene expression through binding to the SRE site in the promoter. First, the reporter gene containing at least the −124 bp region was positively regulated by sterols, i.e. was negatively regulated by sterol deprivation (Fig.3). When either human embryonic kidney 293 or HeLa cells were transfected with the reporter genes plus an expression plasmid for hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), luciferase activities were detectable, and the sterol-mediated regulation was also observed (data not shown), suggesting that HNF-4 is necessary for cell type-specific expression of the MTP gene and that the regulation is not liver-specific. Second, the −124 to −109 bp region was involved in the sterol-mediated regulation of MTP gene expression (Fig. 3). Third, enforced expression of an active form of either SREBP-1 or -2 suppressed MTP gene expression, mimicking the effect of sterol depletion (Table I). Indeed, we found a putative SREBP-binding site, a GCAGCCCAC sequence resembling the original SRE (TCACCCAC) in the human LDL receptor promoter, in the −124 to −109 bp region and confirmed by gel mobility shift assays that this sequence is able to bind SREBP-2 (Fig. 4). Fourth, deletion or disruption of the SRE abolished the response to both sterols and SREBP-2 (Figs. 5 and 6). We show that the MTP gene is up-regulated by sterols, as well as the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid synthesis pathway, regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), nuclear receptors activated by oxidized derivatives of cholesterol (23Peet D.J.

Although this fact raises the possibility that MTP is another target gene for LXRs, we failed to find a putative LXR-binding element with a direct repeat of the half-site sequence AGGTCA separated by 4 nucleotides in the −124 to −109 bp region. It has been demonstrated that SREBPs stimulate the expression of target genes in cooperation with either of the general transcription factors Sp1 (24Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and NF-Y (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein is capable of binding the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of SREBPs and is required for SREBP-regulated transcription (25Oliner J.D. Anderesen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that neither the Sp1- nor NF-Y-binding site exists in the vicinity of the SRE in the MTP promoter indicates that these cooperative factors are not required for the inhibitory effect of SREBPs on MTP gene expression. As shown in Fig. 6, a dominant-negative form of SREBP-2 (amino acids 31–481) lacking the transactivation domain, which is unlikely to bind to cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein, suppressed MTP gene expression in the same manner as wild-type SREBP-2-(1–481). Although the stimulation of LDL receptor gene expression required the transactivation domain, the suppression of MTP gene expression did not. Taken together, we conclude that the mechanism by which SREBPs suppress MTP gene expression is novel and distinct from the known mechanisms through which the transcription of numerous genes, including the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase genes, is up-regulated by the combination of SREBPs with cooperative factors. In this study, we found that the SRE (−124 to −116 bp) overlaps the putative insulin-responsive element (−123 to −112 bp) previously identified (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that insulin negatively regulates MTP gene expression and that the approximate −124 to −109 bp region is involved in regulation in accordance with previous in vivo and in vitro observations (10Lin M.C.M. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We had questioned whether SREBPs mediate the gene regulatory effects of insulin, and the current results suggest that SREBPs regulate MTP gene expression independently of the insulin-negative effects. First, MTP gene expression was significantly repressed by insulin under sterol-loaded conditions even though the amount of active forms of nuclear SREBP-2 was quite low (Fig. 7, A and C). Second, increased amounts of active forms of nuclear SREBPs under sterol-depleted conditions suppressed the transcription of the MTP gene even at lower concentrations of insulin, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of SREBPs do not require the signaling induced by insulin (Fig.7 A). Although a previous report (27Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Koponen A. Njamen D. Kremer L. Roth G. Munck M. Knebel B. Krone W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SREBP-1 mediates activation of the LDL receptor by insulin and that the effect might be linked to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, in the current study, the sterol-mediated transcriptional regulation of the LDL receptor was not significantly altered in the presence or absence of insulin (Fig. 7 B). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a trace amount of the active form of nuclear SREBPs under sterol-loaded conditions mediates the insulin effect. It has been demonstrated that the insulin response sequence on the fatty-acid synthase promoter contains an E-box CANNTG sequence that is able to interact with the ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors, upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1 and USF2 (28Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two adjacent SRE sequences on the fatty-acid synthase promoter flank the E-box. Unlike MTP gene expression, expression of the fatty-acid synthase gene is stimulated by insulin and SREBPs (28Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Analysis of endogenous fatty-acid synthase mRNA expression in USF1 and USF2 knockout mice revealed that USFs and SREBPs independently activate fatty-acid synthase gene expression (30Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Voulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that SREBPs might be able to substitute for the unidentified factor(s) bound to the MTP insulin-responsive element by binding an overlapping site, thereby down-regulating MTP gene expression. In our experiments, we found that further deletion of the NH2-terminal portion of SREBP-2 from amino acids 32 to 180 abolished the inhibitory effect (data not shown). Because only 29% of the amino acid sequence for the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 32–180) of SREBP-1 and -2 is identical, it appears that the entire region might be required for sufficient inhibition of the transcriptional activation of the MTP gene rather than in association with unidentified corepressor. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of the region between −109 and −100 bp of the MTP promoter, which is located close to the SRE and contains a putative AP-1-binding site (19Sharp D. Ricci B. Kienzle B. Lin M.C.M. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diminished the luciferase activity dramatically. It is possible that insulin and SREBPs may disrupt the interaction between AP-1 and this region, thereby diminishing MTP gene expression. Further studies will be required to elucidate the precise mechanism. Horton and co-workers (31Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Korn B.S. Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

We are aware that these findings are apparently not in accordance with our results, but as the authors themselves stated in these reports, it remains to be elucidated whether the elevation of MTP mRNA in these animals is a direct effect of altered SREBP activity or whether it is secondary to increased lipid content in the liver. It is possible that overexpression of SREBPs in these transgenic mice might activate certain crucial genes such as AP-1 and/or HNF-4, which might be involved in MTP gene expression (22Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a profound elevation of fatty acid synthesis in these mice might modulate the level of HNF-4 transcription by the production of an increased amount of fatty acyl-CoA ligands for HNF-4 (34Hertz R. Mangenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the absence of resolution of these competing explanations, the results obtained from these transgenic mice studies cannot therefore be taken to be in clear contradiction to the findings that we report. Further investigation will be necessary to determine the source of the ambiguity. In summary, sterols positively regulate MTP gene expression and protein synthesis in HepG2 cells. Unlike acute insulin effects, stimulated transcription of the MTP gene by higher intracellular sterol levels over the longer term is able to bring about an increase in MTP protein levels, despite the slow turnover rate of the MTP protein. It is likely that elevated MTP activity augments lipoprotein production and secretion by facilitating the assembly of apoB and lipids, preventing the intracellular degradation of apoB. It is noteworthy that cholesterol is one of the determinants of lipoprotein production and secretion through its effect on MTP activities. The sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of the MTP gene is mediated by SREBPs through binding to the SRE in the MTP promoter. Here we report for the first time a novel mechanism by which SREBPs are able to inhibit MTP gene expression, a mechanism distinct from that of the transcriptional stimulation of the sterol-regulated genes related to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. In this regard, it is important to note that SREBPs play a central role in lipid metabolism, regulating not only the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids, but also lipoprotein production and secretion.

Clinically overt NIDDM is characterized by defects in insulin secretion and insulin resistance of all major target tissues (9DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferannini E.

Increasing knowledge of the signaling molecules involved in insulin action has led to the proposal of several possible candidates that could contribute to insulin resistance (11Häring H.U. Mehnert H.

Insulin mediates its action through phosphorylation of a transmembrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptor, the insulin receptor. Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor leads to activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and subsequently to tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of substrates that mediate the metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin (12Seedorf K.

Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 71-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar inhibitory effects on the IR kinase are observed when cells are treated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (23Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D.L. Spiegelman B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 24Feinstein A. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that analogous mechanisms may be responsible for the reduced insulin receptor kinase activity in NIDDM patients. However, how glucose or TNFα can mediate this effect is not understood. Because hyperglycemia leads to the production of hydrogen peroxide within the cell (8Paolisso G. Giugliano D. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we investigated whether H2O2 affects insulin receptor kinase activity and the activation of insulin-induced signal transduction pathways. Furthermore we addressed the possibility that the production of H2O2 may mediate TNFα-induced insulin resistance. Recombinant human insulin was obtained from Novo-Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark. Anti-p85 and anti-insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) antisera were produced by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 710–723 from mouse p85 and amino acids 1220–1233 from rat IRS-1, respectively. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the insulin receptor was produced by immunization with synthetic peptides covering the last 15 C-terminal amino acids of the β-subunit. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies were purchased from Promega. Protein assay reagent and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad, and nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll, BA85) was obtained from Protran. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNAs for the type A insulin receptor (25Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jaragin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W.

The expression plasmid GST-ELK1 has been described before (27Gille H. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and was grown and expressed according to the GST Gene Fusion System manual, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts (HEK293; ATCC CRL 1573) and NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (NIH-B cells, kindly provided by R. Schumacher and A. Ullrich) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 enriched, humidified atmosphere. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using CaCl2 as described by Chen and Okayama (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and Graham and Van der Eb (29Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). 24 h later cells were starved overnight in medium containing 5 mm glucose and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to confluence and left for 2 days. Differentiation medium I containing differentiation promoting factors (DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2 μm insulin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 μmdexamethasone) was then added. After 2 days differentiation medium II (DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2 μm insulin) was added for 5–7 days with medium changes every second day. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells used for the glucose transport assay were incubated in differentiation medium II with 0.5% fetal calf serum but without insulin overnight before the assay was done. After stimulation the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.0, 0.27m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mmC3H7O6PNa2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. After the removal of cellular debris (15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), the protein content in each sample was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cell lysate were dissolved in 2 × Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll, BA85). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After treatment of NIH-B cells with insulin, H2O2, or a combination of both, the cells were lysed in HNTG buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerin, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The samples were diluted 1:1 with the same buffer containing only 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding anti-p85, anti-IRS-1, anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, and Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C followed by brief centrifugation. The precipitates were washed twice in HNTG buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and twice in the same buffer without Triton X-100. NIH-B cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described. PI-3 kinase assays were performed essentially as described by Seedorf et al. (30Seedorf K. Shearman M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm adenosine, 40 μm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. The phospholipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1), washed twice with methanol, 1 N HCl (1:1), and finally spotted onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates. After one-dimensional chromatography, the plates were exposed to the PhosphorImager to quantitate radioactive lipids corresponding to authentic phosphatidylinositol monophosphate standards. NIH-B cells were starved overnight and subsequently stimulated with insulin or H2O2 or pretreated with H2O2 prior to insulin stimulation. Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed as described. The data from the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 Western blot were scanned and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were starved overnight in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 0.5% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed and incubated for 3 h in preheated serum starvation medium (DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 0.2% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then washed three times in preheated Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer, pH 7.5 (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mmCaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. 1 ml KRH buffer/0.2% bovine serum albumin was added to the cells, and they were left untreated or stimulated with insulin, H2O2, a combination of the two, cytochalasin B, or cytochalasin B plus insulin at 37 °C. For the last 5 min the 2DG uptake was determined by adding 50 μl of a start solution containing 2 mm 2DG and 2 μCi/ml (0.1 μCi/ml final specific activity) 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose. The glucose uptake was terminated by washing the cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and lysis in 500 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined by mixing 400 μl of cell lysate with 2.6 ml of scintillation fluid (Optiphase “Supermix”) followed by counting in a β-counter for 10 min. The remaining 100 μl of cell lysate was used for protein determination. Noncarrier-mediated 2DG uptake was determined in parallel in the presence of 20 μmcytochalasin B and subtracted from both basal and stimulated glucose uptake measurements (31Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The results are presented as cpm/mg protein. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Group comparisons were made by unpaired Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. To investigate whether hydrogen peroxide has a direct effect on IR autophosphorylation, we pretreated NIH-B cells for 5 min with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (0.1–5 mm) prior to insulin stimulation (10−7m for 5 min). As shown by Western blot analysis using total cell lysates probed with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody, an inhibitory effect of H2O2 on tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit is seen with 100 μmH2O2 (Fig.1 A). The effect becomes more pronounced with higher concentrations of H2O2. Fig. 1 B shows a time course of the inhibitory effect. When pretreated with 500 μm H2O2 prior to insulin stimulation the inhibition can be observed after 2 min of preincubation with H2O2 and is further enhanced after 5 and 10 min. Interestingly, after 20 min the tyrosine phosphorylation is only slightly affected, but longer incubation with H2O2 is once again inhibitory. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on insulin receptor activity is oscillating. As a control the lower panels in Fig. 1, A and B, show a Western blot of the same samples probed with an antibody against the IR β-subunit. Next we investigated whether proximal events in insulin signaling were also affected by pretreatment with H2O2. Because the endogenous IRS-1 was difficult to detect in NIH-B cells, we used 293 cells transiently transfected with the insulin receptor and IRS-1. As a control, cells were also transfected with IR alone (IR + Vec) or vehicle only (Vec). As shown on the anti-phosphotyrosine blot in the upper panel of Fig. 2, 500 μm of H2O2 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit in these cells in a time-dependent manner. In parallel with the inhibitory effect on the IR β-subunit (and the IR precursor) we saw a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 after 30 min of H2O2 pretreatment. Compared with the result in the NIH-B cells (Fig. 1 B), the inhibitory effect was not as strong and occurred after longer times of pretreatment. Whereas we reproducibly saw oscillations of the effect in NIH-B cells, we could not detect such a phenomenon in the 293 cells under the above conditions. The two lower panels in Fig. 2 show the expression of IRS-1 and the IR in these samples as a control. To further investigate whether reduced IR autophosphorylation and insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 affects both mitogenic and metabolic signaling pathways, we studied insulin-induced MAPK activation and glucose transport, respectively. A key event in the stimulation of insulin-induced glucose transport is the activation of PI-3 kinase. We therefore initially determined the insulin-induced PI-3 kinase activity in NIH-B cells in the presence and absence of H2O2 pretreatment (500 μm, 5 min). A representative diagram is shown in Fig.3. Insulin-induced PI-3 kinase activity in combined immunoprecipitates (anti-PY + anti-IRS-1 + anti-p85) was reduced to about 57% in the presence of H2O2. H2O2 alone showed a slightly insulinomimetic effect. The diagram shows mean and S.D. of two representative experiments done in triplicate. Significance was determined using the Student's t test. Because NIH-B cells are not suited to study insulin-induced glucose transport (they lack the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT-4), we turned to 3T3-L1 cells to measure glucose uptake. The cells were differentiated into adipocytes as described under “Methods.” Glucose transport was measured as [3H]2DG uptake, corrected for the protein content in the sample, and expressed as percent of maximal insulin-stimulated transport. Insulin induced about a 5-fold increase in 2DG uptake, and both the basal and insulin-induced glucose transport were completely blocked in the presence of cytochalasin B (data not shown). When the cells were pretreated with 500 μm H2O2 for 20 min prior to insulin stimulation (10−7m), 2DG uptake was clearly inhibited. In these experiments H2O2had a slightly positive effect on basal 2DG uptake. The diagram shows mean and S.D. of a representative example of 5 experiments performed in triplicate. Significance was determined using the Student's t test (Fig. 4). To investigate whether H2O2 also regulates the mitogenic signaling of insulin, we studied MAPK activation in NIH-B cells. As shown in the lower panel of Fig.5 A, using an antibody recognizing the activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 proteins (anti-MAPK active), insulin induced a rapid induction of MAPK activity, which peaked around 7.5 min and thereafter declined but remained elevated throughout the experiment (120 min). H2O2 treatment alone (500 μm) also resulted in MAPK activation; however, activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was observed after 20 min and peaked around 60 min. When the cells were pretreated with H2O2 (500 μm 10 min) prior to insulin stimulation, the initial peak observed at 7.5 min of insulin stimulation was completely inhibited. However, MAPK activity at later time points was slightly increased as compared with the maximum in the samples treated with insulin alone and seemed to follow the curve observed with H2O2 treatment alone. To monitor insulin receptor phosphorylation the samples were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody as shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5 A. Both the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR as well as the oscillations of this effect can be seen, leading to delayed activation of the receptor. In the case of the insulin-treated samples there is a good correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activity. This is also the case in the samples that are pretreated with hydrogen peroxide prior to insulin stimulation. In contrast, the samples treated with H2O2 alone show MAPK activation in the absence of IR tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that a different mechanism is involved. The middle panel shows the expression level of the insulin receptor as a control. A quantitation of the MAPK data using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) is shown in Fig.5 B. The data are representative of 4 experiments. Because TNFα and hyperglycemia mediated similar inhibitory effects on IR autophosphorylation and because both agents create cellular stress, we investigated the possibility that H2O2 could be a common mediator for their inhibitory effect. To eliminate endogenously produced H2O2 in the cell we incubated 293 cells overexpressing the IR and IRS-1 in the absence or presence of 11,700 units of the H2O2 scavenger catalase overnight. As shown in the upper panel in Fig.6 A (anti-phosphotyrosine blot) pretreatment with 25 mmd-glucose or 25 mm 2-deoxyglucose results in a reduction of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR-β-subunit, similar to the pretreatment with H2O2, which was used as a control (lanes 3–5). As expected, pretreatment with catalase prevented the inhibitory action of H2O2 (lane 10). However, it did not change the hyperglycemia-induced inhibition (lanes 8 and 9, the inhibitory effect of 2-deoxyglucose was even enhanced, as determined in several independent experiments). The upper panel of Fig. 6 B presents an anti-phosphotyrosine blot of samples pretreated with 5.7 nmTNFα (10 min) or H2O2 (10 min) prior to insulin stimulation. Comparable inhibition of insulin-induced IR tyrosine phosphorylation is observed for the two preincubation conditions (lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, treatment of the cells with catalase completely prevents the inhibitory effect of TNFα (lanes 7), suggesting that production of hydrogen peroxide is involved in the mechanism. Control blots showing the IR expression level are represented in the lower panels of Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. Tyrosine-specific phosphatases as well as the action of serine/threonine kinases, in particular protein kinase C, have been discussed as potential mediators of insulin receptor kinase inhibition (32Kellerer M. Häring H.U. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995; 28 (suppl.): 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of the H2O2-induced inhibition of insulin signaling, we therefore used specific inhibitors of these proteins. Pretreatment of NIH-B cells with the specific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (250 μm, 30 min) abolished the inhibitory effect of hydrogen peroxide on insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, as shown on an anti-phosphotyrosine blot in the upper panel of Fig.7 A. As a control the samples were also probed with an antibody against the IR β-subunit (Fig.7 A, lower panel). The specific protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976, which mainly inhibits the Ca2+-dependent classical PKC isoforms, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B, upper panel, H2O2 + insulin, 58% of insulin, pretreatment with 10 μm Gö6976 85%). The lower panel of Fig. 7 B shows the level of insulin receptor expression as a control. In this study, we demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of H2O2 have a strong inhibitory effect on insulin responsiveness in two different fibroblast cell lines and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We present evidence for inhibition of the insulin receptor kinase as well as downstream signaling processes such as IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI-3 kinase activation. In addition, the metabolic (glucose transport) and mitogenic (MAPK) responses to insulin were reduced after pretreatment with low doses of H2O2. The finding of reduced insulin responsiveness is in agreement with recent reports by Rudich et al. (16Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar), which described an inhibitory effect of oxidative stress on insulin-induced glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and glycogen synthase a activity in 3T3-L1 cells. These defects could not be attributed to early events of the insulin signaling cascade (33Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Kozlovsky N. Bashan N. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 (suppl.): 559Google Scholar). The effects on glucose transport were explained by elevated GLUT1 and a decreased GLUT4 expression level as well as a defect in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (16Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kanety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This discrepancy with the present study could possibly be explained by the different mechanisms of stress induction in the two studies. Whereas we treated cells directly with H2O2 for short periods of time, Rudich et al. (16Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kanety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) exposed them to prolonged low grade oxidant stress through exposure to glucose oxidase for 18 h. Previous studies have shown insulinomimetic effects of H2O2 on insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI-3 kinase, MAPK, and glucose uptake (13Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Heffetz D. Rutter W.J. Zick Y. Biochem.

Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, other tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (38Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), Src family tyrosine kinases (39Yan S.R. Berton G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23464-23471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), Ha-Ras, and Raf-1 kinase (40Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) have been reported to be activated by H2O2-generated oxygen radicals, UV irradiation, and xanthine production. Although we clearly detected the insulinomimetic effects of H2O2 on MAPK activity, we could only detect minor effects on PI-3 kinase activity or glucose transport. Although insulin treatment resulted in the activation of PI-3 kinase, glucose transport, and MAPK, the addition of H2O2 resulted in impaired insulin-induced activation of these pathways (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). This clearly shows that H2O2 in the concentrations and for the times used in this study is slightly insulinomimetic on its own; however, it is strongly inhibitory on different insulin-induced signaling pathways. Several regulatory mechanisms seem to be involved in the effect of H2O2 on insulin signaling. Pre-incubation of the cells with orthovanadate prevents the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on insulin signaling suggesting an involvement of tyrosine phosphatases. However, H2O2 has in general an inhibitory effect on phosphatases, as seen when we measure the overall activity of phosphatases in our cell extracts after stimulation with H2O2 (data not shown). This finding is in agreement with other recent reports (41Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 42Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 43Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). We would therefore argue that H2O2 specifically activates one particular IR-specific phosphatase. Such specific protein tyrosine phosphatase activity would not have to be detectable in the overall protein tyrosine phosphatase activity measured in the lysates. We detected partial prevention of the inhibitory effect of H2O2 by the protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976, indicating that activation of PKC is also involved. PKC has long been known to be able to modulate cross-talk between several signal transduction pathways (44Houslay M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is also known to play an important role in insulin signaling (45Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Arnold T., Yu, B. Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Vila M. Cooper D. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46Takayama S. White M.F. Lauris V. Kahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7797-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PKC is a large family of proteins with multiple subspecies (47Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 344: 661-665Crossref Scopus (3537) Google Scholar, 48Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), and so far it is not clear which of these isoforms play a role. Activation of PKC by H2O2 has been described previously for several isoforms from the three subclasses of PKC (49Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 50Wang Y. Sostman A. Roman R. Stribling S. Vigna S. Hannun Y. Raymond J. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18107-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The activation was independent of receptor-coupled hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and occurred through tyrosine phosphorylation. Another study reported a dual effect of H2O2 on PKC with an initial activation by mild oxidative modification and a subsequent inactivation by further oxidation (51Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 86: 6758-6762Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Such dual activation/inactivation could possibly be responsible for the oscillations that we observed in this study. Depending on the cell line there seem to be defined “time windows” that allow observation of the inhibitory effect at a given concentration (Fig. 1 B). Decreases in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity have been observed in various insulin resistant states (52Roth R.A. Liu F. Chin J.E. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1994; 41: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data that we obtained when we studied the effect of H2O2 on insulin signaling bore strong resemblance to the effects of hyperglycemia and TNFα on insulin signaling in these cells (18Berti L. Mosthaf L. Kroder G. Mushack J. Seffer E. Seedorf K. Häring H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3381-3386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kroder G. Bossenmaier B. Kellerer M. Capp E. Stoyanov B. Mühlhöfer A. Berti L. Horikoshi H. Ullrich A. Häring H.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both, hyperglycemia and TNFα-mediated modulation of the insulin receptor have been suggested to be important for acquired insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (32Kellerer M. Häring H.U. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995; 28 (suppl.): 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of hyperglycemia for the development of the metabolic insulin resistance syndrome in NIDDM patients is well documented. On the other hand, TNFα has been proposed to play a role in obesity-linked insulin resistance (23Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D.L. Spiegelman B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 54Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.

A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Because both hyperglycemia and TNFα create cellular stress, we evaluated the possibility that the modulation of IR kinase activity might occur through the generation of oxidative stress and H2O2 production. Both MnCl2 (data not shown), which mimics a function of the intracellular scavenger, superoxide dismutase (56Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and catalase, an enzyme that specifically catalyzes the dismutation of H2O2 to O2 and H2O, prevented the H2O2-induced attenuation of insulin signaling. Interestingly, catalase prevented the inhibitory effect of TNFα completely, whereas it had no effect on hyperglycemia-induced inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that production of H2O2 in response to TNFα could be an important step in the molecular mechanism involved in causing insulin resistance. Different pathways for hyperglycemia- and TNFα-mediated insulin resistance at the level of the insulin receptor have been proposed before (53Kroder G. Bossenmaier B. Kellerer M. Capp E. Stoyanov B.

Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide have been linked to noninsulin-dependent as well as insulin-dependent diabetes and seem to increase with the duration of the disease (2Cross C.E. Halliwell B.

Because we have studied only short term effects of hyperglycemia, we cannot rule out that high blood glucose over sustained periods of time leads to the generation of H2O2 within the organism and thereby induces insulin resistance. However, other metabolic changes of the diabetic milieu such as hyperinsulinemia could also be responsible for the increase in hydrogen peroxide. H2O2 is produced in response to insulin (58Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 59Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J.

(Basel). 1995; 43: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and we could therefore speculate that this effect of insulin could be part of a feedback mechanism involved in signal termination. This would suggest that hyperinsulinemia, through production of H2O2, could cause premature termination of insulin signaling. The present study suggests that cellular events leading to increased H2O2 production might not only be connected to late complications of diabetes but possibly play a role in the induction of insulin resistance in early phases of the disease. Additional work is required to understand the detailed mechanism of this decreased insulin responsiveness and to study its physiological relevance in models of insulin resistance and patients with NIDDM.

The toxicity of the pure protein was bioassayed by detecting the inducing necrosis in tobacco leaves. The pure protein also elicited host synthesis of fluorescent substances in tobacco and plane (Platanus acerifolia) leaves. We purified the protein from culture medium to homogeneity.

In the present paper we report on the purification procedure, the amino acid sequence, and the characterization of the biological activity of a new protein (named cerato-platanin) from the culture filtrate of C. fimbriata f. sp. platani. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N endoproteinase, and thermolysin (all sequencing grade) were obtained from Sigma. Activated Sequelon-1,4-phenylenediisothiocyanate and Sequelon-AA polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased from PerSeptive Biosystems. Bio-Gel P-10 was from Bio-Rad, and Sephadex LH-60 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The peptide and protein C18 HPLC1 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) was from Vydac. All other reagents were the purest commercially available. The virulent strain Cf AF 100 of C. fimbriata f. sp. platani was isolated from a naturally infected plane tree in Versilia (Tuscany, Italy) (2Panconesi A. Eur. J. For. Pathol. 1981; 11: 385-395Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fungus was inoculated in 500-ml flasks containing 150 ml of sterilized Sigma potato dextrose broth medium and incubated on the Gerhardt RO30 rotary shaker (Gerhardt, Bonn, Germany) at 100 revolutions/min for 21 days at 25 °C. Culture filtrates were obtained by removing mycelia and spores from the medium after filtration through a 0.45-μm Millipore membrane (Millipore Co., MA). Before bioassays, all samples were dialyzed against distilled water. For the routine determination of the biological activity of samples, a few quantities (50–200 μl) were infiltrated into tobacco leaf mesophyllum by means of a hypodermic syringe; control tobacco leaves were infiltrated with distilled water. The samples capable of inducing tissue cell necrosis were considered biologically active. Sometimes tobacco leaves were detached and observed on a transilluminator (Bio-Rad) at UV 312-nm light; the infiltrated part of the leaf appeared slightly fluorescent. A 100-μl aliquot of 80 μm cerato-platanin was added to the lower surface of the plane leaf and maintained in a moisture chamber at room temperature. At various times after treatment the leaves were observed under incident 254-nm UV light, and fluorescence was evaluated. The culture filtrate (1 liter, 800 mg of proteins) was lyophilized, redissolved in water to have a 60-fold concentrated solution, and stored at −30 °C. Before starting the purification procedure, this concentrated solution was clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 1% acetic acid and successively filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore membrane. A 10-ml aliquot of concentrated filtrate was loaded onto a Bio-Gel P-10 column (2.5 × 70 cm) equilibrated with 1% acetic acid and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Five-ml fractions were collected and assayed for their ability to induce tobacco leaf cell necrosis and for optical density at 280 nm. The toxic fractions were pooled, concentrated to 10 ml by freeze-drying, dialyzed against 60% ethanol, and chromatographed twice on a Sephadex LH-60 column (2.4 × 90 cm) previously equilibrated with 60% ethanol. The column was eluted with 60% ethanol at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min; 5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for optical density at 280 nm and phytotoxic activity. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The final yield was 4 mg of pure protein starting from 1 liter of filtrate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 15% polyacrylamide according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was run at constant 200 V for about 30 min. Proteins were stained with Bio-Rad silver stain. The pure protein (2 nmol) was dissolved in aqueous 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoyc acid matrix. Spectra were acquired by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) Reflex mass spectrometer, equipped with a Scout ion source (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany). Ions formed by a pulse UV laser beam were accelerated at 20 KeV. Mass spectra were obtained averaging 100–200 shots. The pure protein (1–2 nmol) was hydrolyzed in sealed evacuated tubes with 0.2 ml of 6 n HCl containing 0.1% phenol at 110 °C for 20 and 70 h. Amino acid analysis was performed by the procedure of Spackman et al. (13Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1958; 30: 1190-1205Crossref Scopus (6589) Google Scholar) using an amino acid analyzer (model 3A29, Carlo Erba, Italy). Amino acids were detected by a post-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol or with ninhydrin (14Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Cysteine was determined as cysteic acid after oxidation with performic acid (15Lee K.S. Drescher D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6248-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cysteine was determined as carboxymethylcysteine. Tryptophan was determined by a spectrophotometric method (16Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar) or alternatively by the method of Penke et al. (17Penke B. Ferenczi R. Kovacs K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Reaction of Ellman's reagent (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar) with thiol compounds causes the release of 1 eq of the 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion, thus providing the basis for determining the concentration of thiols in aqueous solution. The determination was performed on 5 nmol of native protein. Cerato-platanin (30 nmol) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 6m guanidinium chloride and then treated with 10 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol overnight at 40 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Successively, 0.2 ml of a solution of iodoacetic acid (freshly recrystallized, 120 mg/ml) in 3 m guanidinium chloride adjusted to pH 8.7 with Tris base was added. After 15 min at room temperature the carboxymethylated (CM) protein was separated from reagents by dialysis. Before protease addition, the CM protein solution was incubated for 3 min in a boiling water bath and then chilled in ice. Trypsin digestion was performed as follows. 20 nmol of CM cerato-platanin was dissolved in 80 μl of 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate, the the protease (3.2% w/w) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Asp-N endoproteinase digestion was carried out on 30 nmol of CM protein dissolved in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0. The protease (2 μg) was added to this solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Thermolysin was added to 20 nmol of CM protein dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m 4-ethylmorpholine buffer, pH 7.8, and the protein was digested at 37 °C for 2 h. The protease/protein molar ratio was 1/50. Chymotrypsin digestion was performed as described previously (19Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Modesti A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The determination of disulfide bonds was achieved by treating 40 nmol of the native protein, dissolved in 120 μl of 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1.0 mguanidinium chloride, with 6 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N (in aliquot of 2 μg). The solution was kept at 30 °C for 72 h. Peptides produced after each enzymatic digestion were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Vydac (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) column using a trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient. The peaks containing more than one peptide were rechromatographed using different elution gradients. Edman degradation was carried out using the Milligen Protein Sequencer model 6600, which operates the solid phase Edman degradation on peptides or proteins covalently immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes derivatized with 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (Sequelon DITC) or arylamine groups (Sequelon AA) (20Findlay J.B.C.

The C-terminal region sequence was obtained using the HP G1009A C-terminal protein sequencing system (Hewlett-Packard, Germany) (21Inglis A.S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The elution profile of the Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography is shown in Fig.1 a. The hatched area indicates fractions eluted with the column void volume that contained biological activity. These fractions, which were nearly free of the brown-to-black pigments abundantly present in the concentrated culture filtrate, were able to induce tobacco leaf cell tissue necrosis (Fig. 3 A). We found that the protein solution in 60% ethanol maintained a stable toxic activity for several weeks (data not shown).Figure 3Cerato-platanin induces tobacco leaf cell necrosis. Leaf cell necrosis induced by active fractions from the Bio-Gel P-10 column (A) and pure cerato-platanin (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The successive purification steps performed with Sephadex LH-60 chromatography permitted us to isolate a protein that was completely free of pigments (Fig. 1, b and c; the hatched areas indicate biologically active fractions). This protein, which elicits toxic activity, shows a single band in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (15% gel), indicating that it is a pure protein. It shows an apparent molecular mass of about 12 kDa (Fig. 2). The mass spectrum obtained with the native protein by a MALDI-TOF spectrometer revealed a single peak at 12,383.6 m/z. The amino acid composition reveals an high percentage of hydrophobic residues, four cysteines and two tryptophans. When infiltrated in tobacco leaf mesophyllum, pure cerato-platanin induced leaf cell necrosis (Fig. 3 B) and fluorescence (Fig. 4 A). We found that the minimum dose able to cause leaf necrosis is 0.8 nmol. Furthermore, drops containing about 8 nmol of purified cerato-platanin became fluorescent just 24 h after addition to the lower leaf surface of P. acerifolia (Fig. 4 B), suggesting the release of phytoalexins from leaves. Automated Edman solid-phase degradation was first performed on whole CM cerato-platanin to obtain the N terminus sequence (residues 1–36, Fig. 6). The amino acid sequence at the C terminus (residues 117–120) was determined by using the C-terminal sequencing system (Fig. 6). Aliquots of the CM cerato-platanin were separately digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and Asp-N proteinase. The peptide fragments were purified by reverse phase HPLC (Fig.5), and their amino acid compositions were determined. All peptides from trypsin and Asp-N proteinase digestions were sequenced to obtain most of the sequence. Among the chymotryptic and thermolytic peptides, only the overlapping ones were subjected to automated Edman solid-phase degradation. All the information obtained enabled us to reconstruct the complete amino acid sequence of cerato-platanin (Fig. 6). It consists of 120 amino acid residues and contains 4 cysteines and more than 40% hydrophobic residues. No blocking groups are present at the N terminus, as indicated by the accessibility of the N-terminal residue to Edman degradation. The isoelectric point, calculated by the ProtParam program at the Expasis server, is 4.33, indicating that cerato-platanin is an acidic protein. The molecular weight calculated from sequence is 12,399.79 (this molecular weight was calculated by the Peptide Mass program at the Expasy server, Switzlerland using average isotopic masses), a value that agrees with that determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (12, 383.6), suggesting that no post-translational modifications occur. Cerato-platanin contains four cysteines at positions 20, 57, 60, and 115, which are present as two disulfide bonds in the native protein. In fact, we have found no free SH groups by the method of Ellman (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar). To determine the actual disulfide bond arrangement in cerato-platanin, we proceeded to isolate and analyze the disulfide-bonded peptides from the protein. This was achieved by digesting the native protein with Asp-N endoproteinase and separating peptides, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Amino acid analysis, after performic acid oxidation, of the HPLC peaks and the amino acid sequencing of the cysteine-containing peptide were performed. The peak eluting at about 33.5% acetonitrile in the reverse phase HPLC gave three sequences, which represent fragments 12–23 (DLSMGSVACSNG), 53–76 (DSPSCGTCWKVTIPNGNSIFIRGV), and 111–120 (DLSNCINGAN), held together by two intramolecular disulfide bonds. This clearly excludes that the vicinal Cys-57 and Cys-60 are S—S-bridged to each other. The actual disulfide bonding pattern was determined as previously suggested by Seetharam et al. (22Seetharam R. Corman J.I. Kamerkar S.M. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 6. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 125-132Google Scholar) by analyzing the cycles that yield diphenylthiohydantoin-cystine during N-terminal sequencing. We have found diphenylthiohydantoin-cystine in cycles 8 and 9, indicating the disulfide bonding pattern Cys-20—Cys-57 and Cys-60—Cys-115.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 320-325Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) proposed the following criteria for the classification of proteins from pathogenic fungi: (i) the number of cysteine residues (6–10 or more); (ii) the relatively small molecular weight (<150 amino acids); and (iii) the role of these proteins in the action specificity and in the pathogenicity. Hydrophobins are an interesting subgroup of the cysteine-rich proteins described by Templeton. These all contain eight cysteine residues, the consensus sequence CCN, and show moderate to strong hydrophobicity (35Templeton M.D. Rikkerink E.H.A. Beever R.E. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 320-325Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Wessels J.G.H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 413-437Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 37Wessels J.G.H. Adv.

Hydrophobins play important physiological roles in the morphogenesis and/or the pathogenicity and host specificity of some saprophytic and/or pathogenic fungi (39Ebbole D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This paper deals with a protein of about 12.4 kDa called cerato-platanin, which is produced by C. fimbriata f. sp.platani in axenic culture. We have demonstrated that it induces both cell necrosis and fluorescence after infiltration into tobacco leaf mesophyllum; in addition, the treatment of the lower surface of P. acerifolia leaves causes the host production of fluorescent substances (phytoalexins) (see Figs. 3 and 4). Other authors (40Montecchio L. Causin R. Santini A. Scala A. Mutto Accordi S. Petria. 1996; 6: 269-270Google Scholar) also report that this protein behaves as a fungal toxin that rapidly causes plane cuttings to wilt when they are immersed in a solution of this fungal protein. These behaviors do not define the exact role of cerato-platanin in the biology of C. fimbriata f. sp. platani but rather suggest a potential involvement in the host plane-fungus interaction. Host reactions like those described in this paper are indicated as effects of activity of elicitors, a property also possessed by elicitins; the minimum active dose of 0.8 nmol of cerato-platanin is comparable with the α-elicitins (41Huet J.C. Le Caer J.P. Nespoulous C. Pernollet J.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,42Le Berre J.Y. Panabières F. Ponchet M. Bonnet P. Marais A. Ricci P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 251-258Google Scholar). Starting from culture filtrates of a C. fimbriata strain isolated from plane trees in the Marseille area, Ake et al. (10Ake S. Darbon H. Grillet L. Lambert C. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1199-1202Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) purified a protein called fimbriatan, which is able to inhibit the growth of plane (P. acerifolia) callus cultures. This protein has an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa and contains a high percentage of hydrophobic residues. However, both its amino acid composition and the presence of a blocking group at the N terminus render fimbriatan different from the protein purified by us. Our cerato-platanin consists of 120 amino acid residues and contains four cysteines and a high percentage (more than 40%) of hydrophobic amino acids; the grand average of hydropathicity (43Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17098) Google Scholar) is 0.02. Compared with hydrophobins, this value lies in the lower part of the hydrophobin grand average of hydropathicity index range. We aligned the amino acid sequence of cerato-platanin with that of cerato-ulmin, a phytotoxic protein belonging to the hydrophobin family and produced by O. (Ceratocystis)ulmi, a fungus responsible of Dutch elm disease (25Yaguchi M. Puszatai M. Roy C. Surewics W.K. Carey P.R. Stevenson K.J. Richards W.C. Takai S. Sticklen M.B. Sherald J.L. Dutch Elm Disease Research, Cellular and Molecular Approaches. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1993: 152-170Crossref Google Scholar, 44Stringer M.A. Timberlake W.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 145-146PubMed Google Scholar). The identity between cerato-ulmin and cerato-platanin is only 17.5% (Fig. 7, top). It can be noted that most of the homologous residues in the two sequences are clustered at the N terminus: in the 1–25 stretch, the identity value increases to 40%. Considering that cerato-platanin does not contain the eight-cysteine pattern characteristic of hydrophobins, this new protein should not be included in the hydrophobin family. Nevertheless, some features of cerato-platanin link this protein to hydrophobins. In fact, cerato-platanin elicits a quite high hydrophobicity and possesses an N terminus sequence highly homologous to cerato-ulmin (Fig. 7, top); in addition, it contains the sequence Cys-Ser-Asn-22 aligned with the cerato-ulmin Cys-Cys-Asn sequence, which is the signature sequence of hydrophobins. This sequence contains the conservative substitution Cys → Ser, but we can note that two other hydrophobins, such as Eas from Neurospora crassa (consensus sequence = CCQ) (44Stringer M.A. Timberlake W.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 145-146PubMed Google Scholar) and Hfb1 from Thricoderma reesei (consensus sequence = CCA) are exceptions to the consensus rule (45Nakari-Setälä T. Aro N. Kalkkinen N. Alatalo E. Penttilä M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some recent findings obtained by immunolocalization experiments 2A. Scala, unpublished data. have indicated that cerato-platanin accumulates abundantly on the fungal cell surface, as hydrophobins do. Searches performed using the BLAST program in data banks (Swiss-Prot, EMBL, and GenBank™) revealed that this protein is highly homologous with two other proteins produced by different Ascomycete fungi. One, expressed during infection of wheat leaves, is codified by the snodprot1 gene of Phaeosphaeria nodorum, which is the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat (46Scharen A.L. Krupinsky J.M. Phytopathology. 1970; 60: 1480-1485Crossref Google Scholar), and the other is the rAsp f13 allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus (Fig. 7, bottom). These three proteins could represent the first members of a new family of fungal proteins that possess biological activity. The snodprot1 gene product is produced by a plant pathogen fungus during infection, and cerato-platanin has direct necrotic and eliciting effects on the P. acerifolia plants. Although the molecular mechanism of cerato-platanin in the plant pathogenesis remains to be clarified, the amino acid sequence gives us the possibility of new experimental approaches. One possibility is to synthesize short peptides designed on the basis of homologous regions present in fungal phytotoxic proteins. For example, the N termini of cerato-platanin and cerato-ulmin (residues 1–25, Fig. 7, top) are highly homologous, suggesting that they could be involved in the biological effects of these fungal proteins. Combinatorial chemistry approaches could be devised to construct peptide libraries that will be tested for induced host defense reactions. The knowledge of the cerato-platanin-host plant interaction will enable us to understand whether this protein is involved as a signal molecule in the activation of the plane defense response (such as phytoalexin production) and, successively, to obtain host genotypes more timely and effective in defense response. Furthermore, a synthetic gene coding for cerato-platanin can be easily constructed, and the recombinant wild type or the mutants proteins can be produced to reveal the molecular site(s) involved in the biological activities of this phytotoxic protein. Finally, inhibitor substances can be found that could be employed in the control of the P. acerifolia fungal disease. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. A.

Among them, group IIA sPLA2 has been thought to be one of the key enzymes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases owing to its augmented expression under various inflammatory conditions. However, in a number of inbred mouse strains, the group IIA sPLA2 gene is naturally disrupted by a frameshift mutation. Here, we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel sPLA2 expressed in the spleen of group IIA sPLA2-deficient mouse. We also cloned its human homolog and mapped its gene location on chromosome 1p36.12 near the loci of group IIA and V sPLA2 genes. The human mature sPLA2 protein consists of 125 amino acids (Mr = 14,500) preceded by a 20-residue prepeptide and is most similar to group IIA sPLA2 with respect to the number and positions of cysteine residues as well as overall identity (48%). Based on these structural properties, the novel sPLA2 should be categorized into group II, called group IID to follow the already identified IIA to IIC sPLA2s. When the cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, PLA2 activity preferentially accumulated in the culture medium. It is maximally active at neutral to alkaline pH and with 2 mm Ca2+. In assays with individual substrates,l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine was more efficiently hydrolyzed than the other phospholipids examined. An RNA blot hybridized with the cDNA exhibited two transcripts (2.0 and 1.0 kb) in human spleen, thymus, and colon.

PLA2s participate in a wide variety of physiological processes, including phospholipid digestion, remodeling of cell membranes, and host defense, and also take part in pathophysiological processes by producing precursors of various types of biologically active lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and platelet-activating factor (3Dennis E.A.

According to their biochemical features such as cellular localization, requirement of Ca2+, substrate specificity, and the primary structure, these PLA2s are classified into several families, including low molecular weight secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), Ca2+-sensitive arachidonoyl-specific 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2, Ca2+-independent PLA2, and platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (14Dennis E.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Low molecular mass sPLA2s (13–18 kDa) have several features distinct from other PLA2 families, such as a high disulfide bond content, a requirement for millimolar concentration of Ca2+ for catalysis, and a broad specificity for phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acyl chains (15Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). At present, mammalian sPLA2s are classified into five different groups (groups IB, IIA, IIC, V, and X), depending on the primary structure characterized by the number and positions of cysteine residues (12Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.-G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Dennis E.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Among them, group IIA sPLA2 has been a focus of attention as a potent mediator of the inflammatory process, because its local and systemic levels are elevated in numerous inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, Crohn's disease, and acute pancreatitis (16Gronroots J.M. Nevalainen T.J. Digestion. 1992; 52: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Green J.-A. Smith G.M. Buchta R. Lee R. Ho K.Y. Rajkovic I.A. Scott K.F.

Snow K.M. Vadas P. J. Rheumatol. 1988; 15: 1351-1355PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of group IIA sPLA2 is enhanced by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in various cell types (19Crowl R.M. Stoller T.J. Conroy R.R. Stoner C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2647-2651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakano T. Ohara O. Teraoka H. Arita H.

In some inbred mouse strains, however, the group IIA sPLA2 gene is spontaneously inactivated by a point mutation (23MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 2443-2451PubMed Google Scholar), and the mast cells derived from these mice exhibit normal prostaglandin production to ligand activation (27Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice expressing the human group IIA sPLA2 gene do not develop any overt inflammatory conditions (28Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.-Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennet C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These findings point to the need to reassess the contribution of group IIA sPLA2 in inflammatory diseases and suggest that other types of the sPLA2 isoform play a pivotal role in place of or in concert with the group IIA sPLA2. For example, group V sPLA2, one of the newly identified sPLA2isoforms (7Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been reported to be involved in the production of lipid mediators in P388D1 murine macrophages and bone marrow-derived mast cells based on antisense experiments (27Reddy S.T.

The involvement of group X sPLA2 in inflammatory responses is suggested by its restricted expression in immune tissues such as the spleen and thymus, although there is no direct evidence for its commitment to the pathological conditions. A possibility of the involvement of the most classical sPLA2, group IB sPLA2, in the inflammatory response is also worth considering. This sPLA2 has been thought to act as a digestive enzyme, given its abundance in digestive organs including the pancreas (30de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, a series of our studies have revealed group IB sPLA2-induced various biological responses, such as cell proliferation, smooth muscle contraction, and lipid mediator release, through the binding to its specific receptor, the PLA2receptor (31Arita H.

Furthermore, recent studies with mice deficient for both PLA2 receptor and group IIA sPLA2demonstrated a potential role of group IB sPLA2/PLA2 receptor-mediated responses in the progression of endotoxic shock, because the knock-out mice exhibit resistance to endotoxin-induced lethality with reduced plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (37Hanasaki K. Yokota Y. Ishizaki J. Itoh T. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32792-32797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Besides previously identified sPLA2s, other low molecular weight PLA2s have been detected in various tissues including the brain and lung (38Gray N.C. Strickland K.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of novel sPLA2s that might play a compensatory role for the deficiency in group IIA sPLA2 or an independently functional role in the inflammatory processes. During a survey of the DNA data base, we encountered an expressed sequence tag (EST) that could represent part of a new sPLA2isoform. Here, we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel sPLA2 expressed in the spleen of group IIA sPLA2-deficient mice. We also describe the cloning of its human homolog, the characterization of recombinant protein and its expression profile in humans, as well as in endotoxin-treated rats and group IIA sPLA2-deficient mice.

Two rounds of amplifications (nested PCR) were carried out with these primers and ExTaq (Takara, Japan). Reverse transcribed cDNAs from various mouse tissues were used as templates. Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles. The PCR products were separated on agarose gel, and the DNA of the expected size was isolated. The recombinant plasmid was then constructed with pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen), purified with GFX Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequenced with Applied Biosystems PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. From the determined DNA sequence, four primers were designed for the isolation of 5′ and 3′ portions of the cDNA. The cloning of these remaining parts was carried out with rapid amplification of the cDNA ends protocol using mouse spleen marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's manual with a slight modification in the choice of polymerase; ExTaq was used instead of KlenTaq polymerase. The full-length cDNA was isolated by PCR with primers, 5′-ataaggggctgcctgccttgct-3′ and 5′-gaaagttgtttattaagagggctctt-3′. In each cloning step, sequences were determined with more than 10 individual clones to rule out the possibility of misincorporation during the PCR. Based on the mouse sPLA2 cDNA sequence, four primers (5′-acagactggtgctgtcagaa-3′, 5′-catgactgttgctatgccca-3′, 5′-acacagttgcctttcacacca-3′, and 5′-ttcacaccagctcccgttgtc-3′) were prepared for amplification of the middle part of the human homolog cDNA. Using human spleen marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template, two consecutive rounds of PCR were performed with two pairs of primers in the nested manner. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles with ExTaq. The amplified product was separated on agarose gel, and the DNA of the expected size (117 base pairs (bp)) was isolated and sequenced. The 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed basically as described above using human sPLA2-specific primers and spleen cDNA. The chromosome localization of the human sPLA2 was determined using the radiation hybrid mapping panel (Genebridge4, Research Genetics). 1 μl of each DNA aliquot was subjected to PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol with primers (5′-aagggaagctggtgtgagcag-3′ and 5′-ccgccagtagaaacgcagtcg-3′) which amplified the 108-bp PLA2 encoding genomic DNA fragment. The PCR was initiated at 94 °C for 2 min and then followed by 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles with ExTaq and TaqStartTM Antibody (CLONTECH) using the hot start technique. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The presence or absence of the product in each of the hybrid clones was scored. With the screening result, mapping was performed on the server computer at the Whitehead Institute/MIT center for Genome Research. Two primers, 5′-agtagttgatgcggccg ccacc atgagactcgccctgctgtgtg-3′ and 5′-taagcttttctagattagcatgctggagtcttgccttt-3′, were used for PCR amplification of the coding region of the mouse sPLA2cDNA. Those for the human sPLA2 were 5′-agtagttgatgcggccg ccacc atggaacttgcactgctgtgtg-3′ and 5′-taagcttttctagactagcaccaggggtctgcccc-3′. Upstream primers have a Not I recognition site and Kozak sequence (italic). Downstream primers are with the Xba I recognition site. The sPLA2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from mouse or human spleen cDNA followed by digestion with Not I and Xba I and inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to construct mouse and human sPLA2 expression plasmids. After sequencing confirmation, 5 μg of recombinant plasmid was transfected into 50% confluent COS-7 cells grown in 56-cm2 Petri dishes with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 72 h after transfection, culture media were collected. The washed cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 1 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and kept at −40 °C until the assay. The expression plasmid without sPLA2 cDNA was also introduced into COS-7 cells for the control. Preparation of autoclaved E. coli membranes and sPLA2 assays were performed essentially as described previously (40Furue S. Hori Y. Kuwabara K. Ikeuchi J. Onoyama H. Yamamoto M. Tanaka K. Gut. 1997; 41: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, sPLA2 assays were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 250 μl consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 50,000 dpm of [3H]oleate-labeled E. coli membranes. Incubation times and sample volumes were adjusted to ensure hydrolysis rates within the linear range of the enzymatic assays. Typically, 50 μl of culture medium containing novel sPLA2 was incubated for 60 min to measure the PLA2 activity. Control incubation in the absence of novel sPLA2 was carried out in parallel and used to calculate the specific hydrolysis. The pH dependence of sPLA2 activity was performed in the presence of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH range 4.5–6.0, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH range 7.0–9.0, or 100 mm glycine-HCl at pH 10.0. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with human sPLA2expression plasmid, and stably expressing clones were generated by selection against G418 (1 mg/ml). From the culture medium of the established cell lines, the recombinant enzyme was partially purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the sPLA2 activity was eluted with 1 mNaCl) and then subjected to individual reactions with 13 types of commercially available phospholipid as the substrate. The enzymatic activity was measured using mixed micelles of 1 mm of each substrate and 3 mm sodium deoxycholate in a total volume of 100 μl. The assay mixture contained 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mmNaCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The released fatty acids were quantified according to the method of Tojo et al. (41Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid. Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation times and sample volumes were adjusted to ensure hydrolysis rates within the linear range of enzymatic assays. Typically, 20 μl of partially purified human sPLA2 or 5 ng of purified human group IIA sPLA2 was incubated for 30 min. The results were expressed as the percentage of hydrolyzed phospholipids within 30-min incubation. The coding region of the novel sPLA2 cDNA was amplified by PCR and labeled with 32P using Prime-ItTM II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). A multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with the probe in GMC buffer (250 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7.2) (42Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar) (2.0 × 106 cpm/ml) at 65 °C overnight, then washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Subsequently, human group IIA sPLA2 cDNA, which was isolated by PCR and β-actin probe, were used for the hybridization of the same membrane. The sizes of the transcripts are calculated from the standard molecular size markers. LPS (E. coli: 055:B5) was injected intravenously into Harlan Sprague Dawley rat tail at a dosage of 5 mg/kg. In C57BL/6J mice, LPS (10 mg/kg; Salmonella typhosa 0901) was injected intraperitoneally. Total RNA was extracted from several tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) at 24 h after LPS injection and subjected to Northern analysis (20 μg of RNA) using mouse novel sPLA2 or rat group IIA sPLA2cDNA probe. The intensity of the signals was quantified with BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film) and normalized against the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. In searching for novel sPLA2s in the rapidly expanding data base, we identified a cDNA fragment (GenBankTM accession number AA762051) by tBLASTn search using catalytically essential residues of sPLA2s as a query. This cDNA was an EST sequence originally cloned from thymus of C57BL/6J mouse (one of the group IIA sPLA2-deficient strains (23MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 24Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A.

We amplified the cDNA corresponding to this EST sequence from reverse transcribed RNA samples extracted from various mouse tissues including the spleen, liver, and small intestine. Using splenic cDNA fragment as a probe, an expression profile was examined by Northern analysis of multiple tissues originated from Balb/c mice, which detected two transcripts (1.2 and 2.4 kb) expressed most abundantly in the spleen among the tissues examined (data not shown). Using the spleen cDNA library as a source, the 5′ and 3′ surrounding regions were isolated using the PCR-based protocol. These separately isolated 5′, middle, and 3′ cDNAs were assembled to yield one open reading frame that potentially encodes a functional sPLA2. The full-length cDNA was cloned with the 5′- and 3′-most primers by PCR from spleen cDNA to confirm the existence of the consecutive transcript and its sequence. The 1233-bp cDNA thus identified encoded a novel sPLA2 consisting of 144 amino acids. To clone its human homolog, we first attempted to amplify the middle portion of the cDNA by PCR using primers designed from the mouse sPLA2 sequence under the assumption that the catalytically and functionally essential residues are conserved between the two animals. Through intensive search for the human PLA2cDNA fragments after PCR using several combinations of primers, one of the amplified cDNA fragments was found to have a nucleotide sequence 70% identical to that of the corresponding region of the mouse sPLA2 cDNA and encoded 25 amino acid residues with a characteristic of sPLA2. Using this sequence information, we were able to clone the full-length cDNA from a human spleen cDNA library with the rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol. The human sPLA2 cDNA clone consists of 878 bp with one long open reading frame encoding 145 amino acids. The coding region has 79% nucleotide sequence identity with the mouse counterpart. To assign the chromosome localization of the human novel sPLA2 gene, we performed radiation hybrid mapping. The PCR using two primers described under “Experimental Procedures” gave a 108-bp fragment from human genomic DNA as well as from the isolated sPLA2 cDNA, which means that the corresponding gene sequence is not separated by interrupting introns. With this pair of primers, the radiation hybrid mapping panel was screened. 25 of 93 DNA aliquots derived from human/hamster hybrid clones gave clear amplification of the genomic fragment. The PCR results statistically assigned the sPLA2 gene location to chromosome 1p36.12 at 3.77 centiray centromeric relative to the sequence tagged site WI-5273. Amino acid sequences of novel mouse and human sPLA2s are shown in Fig.1 aligned with those of other sPLA2s. 2Mouse group IB and X sPLA2 cDNAs were isolated based on rat group IB sPLA2 and human group X sPLA2 sequence, respectively (N. Suzuki, H. Nakazato, and K. Hanasaki, unpublished data). The sequence similarity and hydropathy profiles (data not shown) suggest that the N-terminal 19 (mouse) and 20 (human) residues are signal peptides. Judging from the length of the predicted signal peptide and absence of basic amino acids preceding the N terminus of the mature protein, this sPLA2 does not have a propeptide. The calculated molecular masses of mouse and human novel sPLA2s are 14.3 and 14.5 kDa, respectively. There is one potential N-glycosylation site in each sPLA2; Asn99 (mouse) and Asn89 (human). As shown in Fig. 1, the novel sPLA2s have about 40% identity with other isoforms and show preferential homology with group IIA sPLA2 (47 and 48% in mouse and human, respectively). All of the previously published sPLA2s contain 12–16 cysteine residues to form 6–8 intramolecular disulfide bonds by which each isoform is taxonomically characterized (15Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the mature portion of the novel sPLA2, mouse and human enzymes share identical distribution of 14 cysteine residues. Compared with the characteristic cysteine residues found in the known sPLA2 sequences, the novel sPLA2 possesses 50–137 pairs, which is typical of group IIA sPLA2, but does not have the 11–77 and 86–92 sets, which are characteristic of group IB and IIC sPLA2, respectively. In addition, novel sPLA2 has an amino acid C-terminal extension, which is found in group IIA, IIC, and X sPLA2s, whereas it does not contain the pancreatic loop, a feature characteristic of the group IB sPLA2. Taken together, the novel sPLA2 is most similar to group IIA sPLA2 and should be categorized in"

A major function of the junctional connection is to maintain the semi-permeable property of the endothelial barrier and to control the transvascular passage of solutes, fluid, and blood cells. Four types of junctions associated with endothelial cells have been identified: adherens junctions (AJ),1 tight junctions, gap junctions, and complexus adherentes (1Rubin L.L. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 830-833Google Scholar, 2Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). AJ, formed by transmembrane adhesive proteins called cadherins, appear to be the main complex regulating macromolecular permeability in microvascular endothelium. Cadherins, specifically vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through a family of proteins called catenins, including α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin (3Kemler R.

Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar). At the site of injury or inflammation, circulating PMNs often adhere to and subsequently migrate through the endothelium and enter surrounding tissues (15Burns A.R. Walker D.C. Brown E.S. Thurmon L.T. Bowden R.A. Keese C.R. Simon S.I. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2893-2903PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been documented that the process of PMN adherence and migration is associated with an increase in endothelial permeability (10Yuan Y. Mier R.A. Chilian W.M. Zawieja D.C. Granger H.J. Am.

Although much work has been dedicated to identify PMN-derived hyperpermeability factors (11Beynon H.L.C. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Walport M.J. J.

Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular targets of activated PMNs and the derived factors. Within this context, whether PMNs affect microvascular barrier function by altering the structural and functional integrity of the endothelium remains elusive.Recent evidence suggests that the AJ is involved in PMN-promoted endothelial barrier dysfunction. Upon PMN adhesion, VE-cadherin proteolysis is accompanied by the disappearance of both VE-cadherin and catenins from AJ (14Carden D. Xiao F. Moak C. Willis B.H. Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar, 16Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J.

Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Another hyperpermeability agonist, vascular endothelial growth factor, has been shown to increase the transendothelial flux of albumin concomitant with a loss of VE-cadherin (18Kevil C.G. Payne D.K. Mires E. Alexander J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15099-15103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These studies have provided a possible linkage between PMN activation and VE-cadherin disorganization in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that the VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is controlled by a dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the junctional proteins including cadherins and catenins. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin resulted in a dissociation of the catenin from cadherin and from the cytoskeleton, leading to a weak AJ (19Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagfuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin occurred in loose AJ and was notably reduced in tightly confluent monolayers (21Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).This study focuses on the effect of activated PMNs on both endothelial permeability and phosphorylation of AJ proteins. The results showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin was increased when cultured coronary venular endothelial cells (CVECs) were exposed to activated PMNs. β-Catenin and VE-cadherin staining revealed a marked decrease in the amount of these proteins at the cell periphery upon stimulation by PMNs. Correspondingly, PMN-treated monolayers showed a significant increase in permeability as measured by albumin clearance. This work is the first to correlate hyperpermeability and tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional proteins in response to PMNs in microvascular endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONPMN-induced vascular leakage has long been implicated in the development of coronary microvascular dysfunction during ischemia-reperfusion injury and other types of cardiovascular disorders (12Gibbs L.S.

Our study is the first systematic examination of the direct effects of PMN activation on the function and structure of coronary microvascular endothelial cells. We had previously demonstrated the interaction of PMNs with the endothelium using intact, perfused coronary venules and arterioles (10Yuan Y. Mier R.A. Chilian W.M. Zawieja D.C. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H490-H498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We modified existing monolayer models (12Gibbs L.S. Lai L. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Rosengren S. Olofsson A.M. von Andrian U.H. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Arfors K.E. J. Appl.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15099-15103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) to accommodate CVECs to study processes occurring at the molecular level in these cells. Compared with the intact, perfused coronary venules, the CVEC monolayer exhibited a higher basal permeability but a similar responsiveness to the hyperpermeability stimulators.The complexity of the precise molecular events that lead to microvascular leakage is becoming evident. To allow large molecules and even blood cells to pass through the endothelial layer, individual endothelial cells must contract to form gaps. In this process, the intercellular junction may undergo conformational changes, facilitating the gap formation and macromolecular transflux. VE-cadherin, a transmembrane protein, and β-catenin, a signaling protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, were found to exhibit increases in tyrosine phosphorylation levels concomitant with an increase in permeability. We suggest that this phosphorylation is an important signal responsible for breaking down the AJ and diminishing the ability of neighboring cells to interact. Our results and those of others showed the disappearance of AJ proteins at the cell periphery under conditions of hyperpermeability (14Carden D. Xiao F. Moak C. Willis B.H. Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar, 16Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Allport J.R. Ding H. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. Luscinskas F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, we observed an increase in the formation of actin stress fibers that coincides with the AJ breakdown and permeability increases. In PMN-treated monolayers, although not all cells show stress fiber formation, there is an overall increase in stress fiber formation across the monolayer versus control cell monolayers. Presumably these stress fibers make contact with opposite sides of the cell membrane and “pull” the cell into a spherical shape, breaking the contacts between neighboring cells. The question then becomes, to what protein or protein complex are the actin fibers anchoring during hyperpermeability situations? Our hypothesis is that AJ proteins anchor the peripheral actin filaments under resting conditions and allow for the integrity of the monolayer to remain intact. In response to agonists, actin stress fibers form and interact with structure(s) including the AJ to instigate changes in cellular morphology, leading to a weak or diminished AJ. Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin may be a critical signaling event that elicits such structural changes. In further support of this, our data show that inhibiting phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin blocks the hyperpermeability response in the endothelial cells.The precise mechanism by which PMNs increase microvascular permeability has not been established. A body of evidence supports that the leakage is mainly attributed to PMN-derived cytotoxic mediators including oxygen radicals and various proteases (28Sepper R. Konttinen Y.T. Ingman T. Sorsa T. J. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 15: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Smedley L.A. Tonnesen M.G. Sandhaus R.A. Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Clin.

At the site of PMN adhesion, large amounts of the cytotoxic factors are released and accumulate, initiating a full cascade of signaling reactions in the endothelium. Ultimately, endothelial cell contraction occurs, and intercellular gaps are formed. Based on our previous and present studies, it appears that protein phosphorylation is one of the signaling events that is activated in response to PMN adhesion, and these kinase cascades result in the hyperpermeability response. In support of this, we found that activated PMNs induce increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of AJ proteins accompanied by an increase in permeability. Interestingly, we also discovered that serine kinase inhibitors could attenuate the permeability increase provoked by PMNs, and a serine phosphatase inhibitor increased basal permeability. However, our attempts to detect serine phosphorylation of β-catenin and VE-cadherin were unsuccessful. It is likely that activated PMNs initiate events that directly or indirectly up-regulate both the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation pathways, which may interact (cross-talk) with each other. Our opinion is that both types of phosphorylation are necessary to instigate hyperpermeability of CVEC monolayers.This study is the first to correlate PMN activation with phosphorylation of AJ proteins and hyperpermeability in cultured microvascular endothelial monolayers. We had previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and focal adhesion kinase occurs in CVEC monolayers in conjunction with a breakdown of endothelial barrier function (23Yuan Y. Meng F.Y. Huang Q. Hawker J. Wu H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H84-H93PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we now have evidence that alterations in both the focal adhesion complex and the AJ can result in hyperpermeability of the microvascular endothelium and that activated PMNs can induce at least some of these events. We have established the appropriate model for further studies aimed at methodically dissecting the molecular events associated with changes in CVEC permeability. The wall of exchange vessels consists of a layer of endothelial cells that connect to each other with closely opposed intercellular junctions. A major function of the junctional connection is to maintain the semi-permeable property of the endothelial barrier and to control the transvascular passage of solutes, fluid, and blood cells. Four types of junctions associated with endothelial cells have been identified: adherens junctions (AJ),1 tight junctions, gap junctions, and complexus adherentes (1Rubin L.L. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 830-833Google Scholar, 2Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). AJ, formed by transmembrane adhesive proteins called cadherins, appear to be the main complex regulating macromolecular permeability in microvascular endothelium. Cadherins, specifically vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through a family of proteins called catenins, including α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin (3Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 4Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The endothelial permeability is affected by many agonists including α-thrombin, histamine, and phorbol esters (5Ehringer W.D. Edwards M.J. Miller F.N. J. Cell.

Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar). At the site of injury or inflammation, circulating PMNs often adhere to and subsequently migrate through the endothelium and enter surrounding tissues (15Burns A.R. Walker D.C. Brown E.S. Thurmon L.T. Bowden R.A. Keese C.R. Simon S.I. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2893-2903PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been documented that the process of PMN adherence and migration is associated with an increase in endothelial permeability (10Yuan Y. Mier R.A. Chilian W.M. Zawieja D.C. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H490-H498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Beynon H.L.C. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3160-3167PubMed Google Scholar). Although much work has been dedicated to identify PMN-derived hyperpermeability factors (11Beynon H.L.C. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3160-3167PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gibbs L.S. Lai L. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Rosengren S.

Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular targets of activated PMNs and the derived factors. Within this context, whether PMNs affect microvascular barrier function by altering the structural and functional integrity of the endothelium remains elusive. Recent evidence suggests that the AJ is involved in PMN-promoted endothelial barrier dysfunction. Upon PMN adhesion, VE-cadherin proteolysis is accompanied by the disappearance of both VE-cadherin and catenins from AJ (14Carden D. Xiao F. Moak C. Willis B.H. Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar, 16Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J.

Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Another hyperpermeability agonist, vascular endothelial growth factor, has been shown to increase the transendothelial flux of albumin concomitant with a loss of VE-cadherin (18Kevil C.G. Payne D.K. Mires E. Alexander J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15099-15103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These studies have provided a possible linkage between PMN activation and VE-cadherin disorganization in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that the VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is controlled by a dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the junctional proteins including cadherins and catenins. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin resulted in a dissociation of the catenin from cadherin and from the cytoskeleton, leading to a weak AJ (19Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagfuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin occurred in loose AJ and was notably reduced in tightly confluent monolayers (21Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study focuses on the effect of activated PMNs on both endothelial permeability and phosphorylation of AJ proteins. The results showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin was increased when cultured coronary venular endothelial cells (CVECs) were exposed to activated PMNs. β-Catenin and VE-cadherin staining revealed a marked decrease in the amount of these proteins at the cell periphery upon stimulation by PMNs. Correspondingly, PMN-treated monolayers showed a significant increase in permeability as measured by albumin clearance. This work is the first to correlate hyperpermeability and tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional proteins in response to PMNs in microvascular endothelial cells. DISCUSSIONPMN-induced vascular leakage has long been implicated in the development of coronary microvascular dysfunction during ischemia-reperfusion injury and other types of cardiovascular disorders (12Gibbs L.S.

Our study is the first systematic examination of the direct effects of PMN activation on the function and structure of coronary microvascular endothelial cells. We had previously demonstrated the interaction of PMNs with the endothelium using intact, perfused coronary venules and arterioles (10Yuan Y. Mier R.A. Chilian W.M. Zawieja D.C. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H490-H498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We modified existing monolayer models (12Gibbs L.S. Lai L. Malik A.B. J. Cell.

Compared with the intact, perfused coronary venules, the CVEC monolayer exhibited a higher basal permeability but a similar responsiveness to the hyperpermeability stimulators.The complexity of the precise molecular events that lead to microvascular leakage is becoming evident. To allow large molecules and even blood cells to pass through the endothelial layer, individual endothelial cells must contract to form gaps. In this process, the intercellular junction may undergo conformational changes, facilitating the gap formation and macromolecular transflux. VE-cadherin, a transmembrane protein, and β-catenin, a signaling protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, were found to exhibit increases in tyrosine phosphorylation levels concomitant with an increase in permeability. We suggest that this phosphorylation is an important signal responsible for breaking down the AJ and diminishing the ability of neighboring cells to interact. Our results and those of others showed the disappearance of AJ proteins at the cell periphery under conditions of hyperpermeability (14Carden D. Xiao F. Moak C. Willis B.H. Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar, 16Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J.

Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, we observed an increase in the formation of actin stress fibers that coincides with the AJ breakdown and permeability increases. In PMN-treated monolayers, although not all cells show stress fiber formation, there is an overall increase in stress fiber formation across the monolayer versus control cell monolayers. Presumably these stress fibers make contact with opposite sides of the cell membrane and “pull” the cell into a spherical shape, breaking the contacts between neighboring cells. The question then becomes, to what protein or protein complex are the actin fibers anchoring during hyperpermeability situations? Our hypothesis is that AJ proteins anchor the peripheral actin filaments under resting conditions and allow for the integrity of the monolayer to remain intact. In response to agonists, actin stress fibers form and interact with structure(s) including the AJ to instigate changes in cellular morphology, leading to a weak or diminished AJ. Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin may be a critical signaling event that elicits such structural changes. In further support of this, our data show that inhibiting phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin blocks the hyperpermeability response in the endothelial cells.The precise mechanism by which PMNs increase microvascular permeability has not been established. A body of evidence supports that the leakage is mainly attributed to PMN-derived cytotoxic mediators including oxygen radicals and various proteases (28Sepper R. Konttinen Y.T. Ingman T. Sorsa T. J.

Part of the mechanism by which insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis may involve phosphorylation and activation of Akt, serine phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), leading to dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase. To study Akt and GSK-3 regulation in muscle, time course experiments on the effects of insulin injection and treadmill running exercise were performed in hindlimb skeletal muscle from male rats. Both insulin and exercise increased glycogen synthase activity (%I-form) by 2–3-fold over basal. Insulin stimulation significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and activity, whereas exercise had no effect. The time course of the insulin-stimulated increase in Akt was closely matched by GSK-3α Ser21 phosphorylation and a 40–60% decrease in GSK-3α and GSK-3β activity. Exercise also deactivated GSK-3α and β activity by 40–60%. However, in contrast to the effects of insulin, there was no change in Ser21 phosphorylation in response to exercise. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of GSK-3, another putative mechanism for GSK-3 deactivation, did not occur with insulin or exercise. These data suggest the following: 1) GSK-3 is constitutively active and tyrosine phosphorylated under basal conditions in skeletal muscle, 2) both exercise and insulin are effective regulators of GSK-3 activity in vivo, 3) the insulin-induced deactivation of GSK-3 occurs in response to increased Akt activity and GSK-3 serine phosphorylation, and 4) there is an Akt-independent mechanism for deactivation of GSK-3 in skeletal muscle.

In the postprandial state, insulin promotes muscle glucose uptake and the storage of glucose as glycogen (1Shulman G.I. Rothman D.L. Jue T. Stein P. DeFronzo R.A. Shulman R.G. N. Engl. J.

In contracting skeletal muscles glycogenolysis is activated, whereas the period following muscle contraction is characterized by a marked increase in glycogen synthesis (2Garetto L.P. Richter E.A. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Goodman M.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E471-E475PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of UDP-glucose to glycogen by glycogen synthase is the rate-limiting step in glycogen synthesis, and this enzyme is regulated by both allosteric and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanisms (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase is serine phosphorylated on multiple sites, and insulin treatment results in the hierarchal dephosphorylation of several of these sites, leading to activation of the enzyme and increased glycogen synthesis (3Lawrence Jr., J.C.

The two identified GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, contain serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are critical in the regulation of enzyme activity (4Hughes K. Ramakrishna S. Benjamin W.B.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that dephosphorylation on tyrosine in vivo could be a mechanism for enzyme deactivation. Insulin results in phosphorylation on Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3α and β, respectively, leading to enzyme deactivation (16Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase on two sites that are identical to those dephosphorylated by insulin (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism leading to GSK-3 deactivation with insulin stimulation likely involves phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent protein kinase-1, and Akt (also known as protein kinase B). The PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate lipid products of PI 3-kinase recruit and activate PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn phosphorylates Akt on Thr308 (18Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is also dependent upon Ser473phosphorylation, which presumably involves an additional PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent protein kinase molecule (18Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase as an upstream regulator of Akt is supported by studies demonstrating that wortmannin, dominant-negative PI 3-kinase mutants, and growth factor-receptor point mutations prevent the activation of Akt (18Coffer P.J.

Although there has been considerable progress in elucidating signals regulating insulin activation of glycogen synthase in various cell types, there is little understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to stimulation of glycogen synthase with exercise in skeletal muscle. In the current investigation we compared the effects of insulin and exercise on the regulation of glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle and determined whether the activation of glycogen synthase was accompanied by changes in the phosphorylation state and activity of Akt and GSK-3. We show that both insulin and exercise increase glycogen synthase activity and that the time course of synthase activation is closely mirrored by deactivation of GSK-3. Insulin-induced GSK-3 deactivation is associated with GSK-3α serine phosphorylation and increased Akt activity, whereas exercise deactivates GSK-3 in the absence of changes in serine or tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 or increased Akt activity. GSK-3α and Akt1 antibodies, Phospho-GS2 substrate peptide, and Akt/PKB-specific substrate peptide were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). GSK-3β antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life ScienceProducts, and protein A- and G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for protein assays and electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad (Rockville Center, NY). Chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and all other standard chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (190 g) were divided into three treatment groups: basal, exercise, and insulin. Insulin-stimulated animals were studied 5, 10, or 30 min after intraperitoneal insulin injection (maximal, 20 units/rat), and exercised animals were studied immediately after 5, 10, 30, or 60 min of treadmill running at 25 m/min, 10% grade. Serum glucose concentrations were determined by hexokinase assay (26Bondar R.J. Mead D.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and serum insulin concentrations by radioimmunoassay (27Soeldner J.S. Sloane D. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Rats were killed by decapitation, and the gastrocnemius muscles from both legs were quickly dissected, divided into red and white fractions, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until processed. Approximately 60 mg of muscle tissue was Polytron homogenized in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mmsodium fluoride, pH 7.8. Glycogen synthase activity in the absence or presence of 6.7 mm glucose 6-phosphate was determined as described previously (28Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and is reported as the ratio of the glycogen synthase activity in the absence of glucose 6-phosphate to that in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate (%I form). To measure muscle glycogen concentrations, homogenates were hydrolyzed in 2 n HCl, neutralized, and assayed spectrophotometrically for glucose content as described previously using a hexokinase-dependent assay kit (26Bondar R.J. Mead D.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For studies of GSK-3 activity and phosphorylation, pulverized skeletal muscle was homogenized in GSK-3 buffer (1:5) containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.6. For studies of Akt1 activity and phosphorylation, additional muscle was homogenized in Akt buffer (1:5) containing 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. Samples were rotated end over end for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,500 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were retained and assayed for protein concentrations using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Akt1 activity in the muscle lysates was measured as described previously (30Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle lysates (100 μg) were preincubated with either anti-GSK-3α or anti-GSK-3β antibody in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were formed by incubating samples with protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed once with buffer A, once with buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm lithium chloride, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and twice with buffer containing 8 mm MOPS, 200 μm EDTA, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.0. Beads were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 102 μm Phospho-GS2 substrate peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ pS EDEEE), 125 μm ATP, 8 mm MOPS, 10 nm microcystin, 200 μm EDTA, 500 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.0, and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose papers and extensively washed with 75 mm H3PO4. Papers were dried, placed in vials with scintillation fluid, and counted with a Beckman scintillation counter. Aliquots of muscle lysates (90 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 100 mm Tris, 1.5m NaCl, and 0.01% sodium azide (TNA) + 5% nonfat dry milk + 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight with phosphospecific anti-Akt Ser473 antibody (1:1000), anti-GSK-3α Ser21 antibody (2 μg/ml), or anti-GSK-3β Tyr216 antibody (1 μg/ml) in TNA + 5% nonfat dry milk + 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C. To study tyrosine phosphorylation, immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments were done by incubating muscle lysates (1 mg) with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1 μg/ml), anti-GSK-3α (2 μg/ml), or GSK-3β (2 μg/ml), followed by immunoblotting with anti-GSK-3α (2 μg/ml), anti-GSK-3β antibody (1:2500), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1 μg/ml). Primary antibodies were bridged with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and immune complexes were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Specific bands were quantitated by densitometry. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS General Linear model. Differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. Fig.1 shows the time course for the activation of the %I-form of glycogen synthase in red gastrocnemius muscle in response to treadmill running exercise and maximal insulin injection. Only 5 min of exercise was necessary to produce a significant activation of glycogen synthase, but the highest levels of activity were not observed until 30 or 60 min of running exercise (3-fold above basal). Insulin was slightly less effective in increasing glycogen synthase activity (2-fold above basal), but maximal activation occurred more rapidly (10 min). Similar results were observed in white gastrocnemius muscle (data not shown). Muscle glycogen content was decreased by exercise at all time points, whereas glycogen levels were unaffected by insulin injection (data not shown). To determine whether the magnitude and time course of glycogen synthase activation with insulin and exercise corresponded to changes in Akt, we measured both Akt activity and serine phosphorylation in red and white gastrocnemius muscle. Similar to the activation of glycogen synthase, Akt activity (Fig.2 A) and serine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C) were significantly increased with insulin in the red gastrocnemius muscle. Maximal insulin-stimulated Akt activation occurred earlier than peak glycogen synthase activation (5 min versus 10 min), and Akt phosphorylation/activity had returned to base-line levels by 30 min after insulin injection. Insulin also increased Akt activity in white gastrocnemius with a similar time course of activation, although peak stimulation was somewhat less than in the red muscle (2.5-fold above basal; data not shown). In contrast to the consistent stimulation of Akt with insulin, exercise did not alter Akt activity or serine phosphorylation in the red (Fig. 2) or white skeletal muscle (data not shown). The temporal relationship between Akt and glycogen synthase activation is consistent with the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis is through stimulation of Akt. In contrast, exercise must utilize a different mechanism to increase glycogen synthase activity. Consistent with the stimulation of Akt, insulin rapidly decreased GSK-3α and β activities in red gastrocnemius muscle (Fig.3). With 5 min of insulin stimulation, both GSK-3α and β were decreased by approximately 40% and remained significantly lower than basal after 30 min of insulin treatment. In contrast with the lack of effect of exercise on Akt activity and phosphorylation, exercise decreased GSK-3α and β activities in the muscle (Fig. 3). Activities of both isoforms were significantly decreased within 10 min of exercise and remained depressed with 30 and 60 min of exercise (Fig. 3). This time course of GSK-3 deactivation (Fig. 3) followed closely with the time course of activation of glycogen synthase (Fig. 2). The pattern and magnitude of decrease in GSK-3α activity with insulin and exercise was similar in the red and white gastrocnemius muscle. However, decreases in GSK-3β activity in response to insulin and exercise were highly variable in white muscle (data not shown), suggesting that GSK-3β may be less sensitive to metabolic alterations in the more glycolytic fibers. Phosphorylation of the GSK-3 isoforms on Ser21 or Ser9 results in a decrease in enzyme activity. To determine whether the insulin- and exercised-induced decreases in GSK-3 activity were associated with increased serine phosphorylation, we immunoblotted muscle lysates with an antibody that recognizes GSK-3α only when phosphorylated on Ser21. Fig. 4 shows that insulin increased GSK-3 Ser21 phosphorylation in both red and white skeletal muscle in a time-dependent manner, strikingly similar to the deactivation of the enzyme and the activation and phosphorylation of Akt. On the other hand, the deactivation of GSK-3 activity with exercise was not accompanied by an increase in Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3α. These data provide compelling evidence that exercise regulates GSK-3 activity in skeletal muscle by a mechanism other than Ser21 phosphorylation. GSK-3α and β may be constitutively active in resting cells, and this activated state may be maintained by phosphorylation on Tyr279 and Tyr216, respectively. Because some studies have suggested that tyrosine dephosphorylation may regulate kinase activity in vivo (14Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we determined whether insulin or exercise altered GSK-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the muscle. Immunoblotting muscle lysates with a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes GSK-3β when phosphorylated on Tyr216failed to demonstrate any effect of insulin or exercise (Fig.5). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, GSK-3α, and GSK-3β showed significant phosphorylation in the basal state but no regulation with insulin or exercise (data not shown). The current results demonstrate that physical exercise decreases GSK-3 activity in skeletal muscle and that the magnitude of GSK-3 deactivation is similar to that observed with maximal insulin stimulation in vivo. In addition to the novel finding that exercise decreases GSK-3 activity in muscle, our data also suggest that there are distinct mechanisms leading to GSK-3 deactivation in response to exercise and insulin. For the insulin-induced deactivation of GSK-3, the findings are consistent with an Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3 on Ser21. Previous studies have provided direct evidence that Akt can phosphorylate GSK-3 on Ser9 or Ser21 (24Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar, 31Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although we could not make this type of assessment in the intact animal, it is compelling that the time course of Akt activation and GSK-3 phosphorylation with in vivo insulin stimulation was so similar (Figs.2 A and 4 B). The magnitude and time course of GSK-3α serine phosphorylation also strikingly resembles the deactivation of GSK-3α (Figs. 3 A and 4 B). Furthermore, the return of Akt activity to near basal activity occurred more rapidly than the dephosphorylation of GSK-3. Thus, the pattern of regulation of muscle Akt and GSK-3 in the intact animal supports the hypothesis that insulin results in the sequential phosphorylation and activation of Akt and GSK-3 in skeletal muscle. In contrast to the effects of insulin to cause serine phosphorylation of GSK-3, exercise did not result in Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3α. The inability of exercise to elicit GSK-3 serine phosphorylation is consistent with experiments demonstrating that Akt activity (current study and Refs. 30Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F.

Physiol. 1995; 268: E987-E995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not increased in response to treadmill running exercise or muscle contractions induced by electrical stimulation. There are other kinases that have been suggested to serine phosphorylate GSK-3 (35Skoglund G. Hansson A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and we have shown that two of these molecules, the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (37Goodyear L.J. Chung P.-Y. Sherwood D. Dufresne S.D. Moller D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E403-E408PubMed Google Scholar), are highly activated by the same exercise protocol used in the current study. This suggests that high levels of RSK2 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity in skeletal muscle do not necessarily lead to increased Ser21phosphorylation of GSK-3 in vivo. There are other examples in the literature of an Akt-independent mechanism for deactivation of GSK-3. In mouse fibroblasts, Wingless inactivation of GSK-3 is wortmannin-insensitive (38Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Evidence that GSK-3β Ser9 phosphorylation is not required for a decrease in enzyme activity also comes from a study showing that mutation of Ser9 to alanine does not diminish lithium effects on GSK-3-mediated tau phosphorylation (7Hong M. Chen D.C.R. Klein P.S. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that lithium increases glycogen synthase activity by a wortmannin-independent mechanism in rat skeletal muscle (39Furnsinn C. Noe C. Herdlicka R. Roden M. Nowotny P. Leighton B. Waldhausl W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E514-E520PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, exercise and lithium may work by a similar, serine phosphorylation-independent mechanism for deactivation of GSK-3. In the activated state, GSK-3α and β are tyrosine phosphorylated (Tyr279 and Tyr216, respectively) (13Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 14Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), making it plausible that dephosphorylation of these residues could facilitate enzyme deactivation. Although one study has demonstrated tyrosine autophosphorylation of GSK-3 (14Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a clear mechanism for tyrosine dephosphorylation in vivo has not been established, and data are conflicting regarding tyrosine dephosphorylation of GSK-3 as a result of insulin stimulation (15Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because we did not observe Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3α with exercise, we hypothesized that the enzyme may be regulated by tyrosine dephosphorylation. However, we found no evidence for exercise regulation of GSK-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the current study and found stable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation under all conditions. This raises the possibility that exercise deactivates GSK-3 by phosphorylation at an alternative site. Indeed, some isoforms of protein kinase C can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3, and the exact sites of phosphorylation have not been determined (15Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could also speculate that glycogen or glycogen-bound molecules function as allosteric regulators of GSK-3 activity in skeletal muscle. If glycogen itself could act as an allosteric activator of GSK-3, this would limit glycogen synthesis under conditions where glycogen is abundant. Following exercise, decreased glycogen content within the muscle fibers could reduce the allosteric activation of GSK-3, leading to increased glycogen synthesis. Our data showing a close correlation between the exercise- and insulin-induced decrease in GSK-3 activity and increase in glycogen synthase activity are consistent with the hypothesis that GSK-3 functions to regulate glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. However, recent studies in adipocytes have suggested that activation of phosphatases is the primary factor regulating glycogen synthase activity (41Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J.

In adipocytes isoproterenol-induced deactivation of GSK-3 is not accompanied by glycogen synthase activation (41Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In 3T3L1 fibroblasts glycogen synthase activity may be regulated by GSK-3 deactivation, but when these cells differentiate into adipocytes, control of synthase with insulin stimulation appears to shift to protein phosphatase-1 activation (42Brady M.J.

Furthermore, overexpression of Akt in L6 myotubes increases glycogen synthase activity via inhibition of GSK-3 activity (47Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M.T.

These types of inhibitor and overexpression studies have not yet been done in adult skeletal muscle, although it is well established that insulin causes both activation of protein phosphatase-1 and deactivation of GSK-3 in this tissue (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on all the available data, it is likely that glycogen synthase regulation in skeletal muscle is regulated by both phosphatase and kinase activities. Early studies of GSK-3 demonstrated the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate and deactivate glycogen synthase in vitro, but it is now clear that there is a wide variety of cellular substrates for GSK-3. Particularly relevant to our finding that exercise deactivates GSK-3 are data showing that GSK-3 can phosphorylate transcription factors that have AP-1 activity (8Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.

Proc. 1985; 44: 2293-2300PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the molecular signaling mechanisms that convert skeletal muscle contractile activity into biochemical and gene regulatory responses. The effects of exercise to deactivate GSK-3 may function as an initial signaling event that results in changes in muscle protein metabolism and gene transcription. Interestingly, we have recently shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (51Aronson D. Violan M.A. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling cascades (52Aronson D. Dufresne S.D. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25636-25640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are also increased by exercise and muscle contraction in skeletal muscle. Thus, there is likely to be convergence of multiple signals at the nucleus in response to contractile activity, with integration of these signals critical in controlling transcription and ultimately determining muscle phenotype. We are beginning to develop an understanding of molecular signaling mechanisms in contracting skeletal muscle, and the current observation that exercise decreases GSK-3 activity should be an important step toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, and gene transcription in working muscle. We thank Drs. Lawrence Mandarino and Katsumi Maezono for assistance with the GSK-3 assay."

A series of deletion mutants together with an in vivo drug-binding assay were used to test whether the deletion mutants interacted with substrates or were transported to the cell surface. We found that a deletion mutant consisting of only the transmembrane domains (residues 1–379 plus 681–1025) retained the ability to interact with drug substrates. In the absence of drug substrates, the deletion mutant was sensitive to trypsin and endoglycosidase H.

The mutant was then detected at the cell surface and was sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase F. By contrast, the N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1–379) alone did not interact with drug substrates, since it was sensitive to only endoglycosidase H and was not detected at the cell surface.

There has been considerable effort in understanding the role of various domains in the mechanism of transport by P-gp.

These two segments are close to each other in the tertiary structure of P-gp (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

There is evidence, however, that suggests that the nucleotide binding domains also contribute to drug binding. For example, mutations in the nucleotide-binding domains of mouse mdr3 P-gp have also been reported to cause large alterations in the drug resistance phenotypes in transfected cells (34Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the nucleotide-binding domains could also interact with hydrophobic molecules such as steroids and flavonoids (35Conseil G. Baubichon-Cortay H. Dayan G. Jault J.M. Barron D. Di Pietro A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9831-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to determine if P-gp deletion mutants missing one or both nucleotide-binding domains could still interact with drug substrates. An in vivo assay was used to test for drug binding by the deletion mutants. The rationale for this approach was that if the transmembrane domains alone could form the drug-binding site, then expression in the presence of drug substrates should result in a tightly and correctly folded protein that would be trafficked to the cell surface.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 at the C-terminal ends were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pMT21. The cDNAs coding for TMD1 (residues 1–379) and TMD2 (residues 681–1025) tagged at the C-end with A52 (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were joined together to give TMD1+2 (residues 1–379 and 681–1025; transmembrane segments 1–6 and 7–12 only) and inserted into pMT21. P-gp cDNA coding for residues 1–1023 (i.e. deletion of the second nucleotide-binding domain) and tagged with A52 at the C-end was inserted into vector pMT21 to give the ΔNBF2 construct. For expression studies involving drug resistance assays, the cDNAs of the A52-tagged wild-type, mutant P709G, N-half, C-half, and TMD1+2 were also inserted into the Epstein-Barr virus-based vector, pREP4 (Invitrogen Inc.). For simple expression studies, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the cDNAs coding for the mutant P-gps. After 48 h, the cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (10 μm E-64, 12 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml benzamidine). The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and developed with monoclonal antibody A52 (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody that is specific for the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Life Technologies, Inc.). For drug resistance assays, HEK 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) constitutively expressing the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) gene and resistant to neomycin (G418) were used. The HEK 293(EBNA-1) cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA constructs in vector pREP4 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was again replaced with fresh medium containing various concentrations of vinblastine. Then 72 h after transfection, the medium was again replaced with fresh medium containing no drug substrates. After another 4 days, the concentration of vinblastine that caused inhibition of cell growth by 50% was determined as described previously (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293(EBNA-1) cells were transfected with the cDNA coding for mutant TMD1+2 in pREP4 and grown for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μmcyclosporin A as described above. Membranes were prepared from the transfected cells (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The membranes (5 mg/ml protein) were treated for 5 min at 22 °C with various amounts of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma; 12,000 BAEE units/mg), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington). Digestion with endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs) or with endoglycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) was carried out as described previously (39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with mutant TMD1+2 cDNA and then treated for 24 h with or without 10 μm cyclosporin A or 25 μm verapamil. The cells were chilled, washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4), and then incubated in the dark with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm NaIO4 for 10 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated for 10 min with 2 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. The cells were washed once with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and then solubilized with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Biotinylated TMD1+2 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and probed with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. The cDNAs coding for the A52-tagged TMD1+2 P-gp mutant or the A52-tagged TMD1+2 in which residues 1–27 were deleted were inserted into the Nhe I to Xho I sites of vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen Inc.), transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and selected in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The clones were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and then grown for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations (0–1 mm) of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min and then lysed with SDS sample buffer as described above. Equivalent volumes of samples were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the mutant P-gps were detected with monoclonal antibody A52 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Resistance to tetraphenylarsonium chloride (TPA+) (Sigma) was done as described by Bibi et al. (40Bibi E. Gros P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, the same number of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the mutant TMD1+2 or TMD1+2 missing residues 1–27 were plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μm IPTG, and various concentrations (0–5 mm) of TPA+.

For measuring resistance to TPA+ in liquid culture, the same number of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the mutant TMD1+2 or TMD1+2 missing residues 1–27 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μm IPTG, and various concentrations (0–5 mm) of TPA+. At hourly intervals, the absorbance at 600 nm was measured and compared with cells containing only the vector. Each of the nucleotide-binding domains of P-gp (Fig.1 A) is predicted to contain 275–300 residues. To examine the role of the various domains of P-gp in drug-protein interactions, we first constructed a mutant that lacked the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (ΔNBF2; Fig.1 B). The ΔNBF2 mutant consisted of residues 1–1023 followed by the A52 antibody epitope tag. The presence of the tag facilitated detection of the protein after expression in HEK 293 cells and allowed us to distinguish it from any endogenous expression of P-gp. As shown in Fig. 2 A (lane 1), immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected with ΔNBF2 mutant cDNA showed the presence of a protein of 110 kDa as the major product. The 110-kDa ΔNBF2 protein was sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H (data not shown), suggesting that it was present mainly as a core-glycosylated immature protein.Figure 2Effect of drug substrates on expression of P-gp deletion mutants. HEK 293 cells transfected with the cDNAs of mutant ΔNBF2 (A) or mutant TMD1+2 (B) were treated for 24 h with (+) or without (−) 3 μm cyclosporin A (Cyclo), 25 μmverapamil (Ver), 6 μm vinblastine (Vin), or 100 μm capsaicin (Caps). The cells were then solubilized with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The locations of the 130- and 110-kDa (A) and the 100- and 80-kDa (B) proteins are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the ΔNBF2 mutant protein retained the ability to interact with drug substrates, we used an in vivo drug-binding assay. The rationale was that the ΔNBF2 mutant protein was not completely folded, since it was still sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H, and it most likely failed to be transported to the plasma membrane. We had previously shown that some point mutations in P-gp can cause malfolding of the protein such that it remains as a core-glycosylated protein that is not present at the cell surface. By expressing these mutant proteins in the presence of drug substrates, it was possible to induce the mutant proteins to fold in an active conformation, become resistant to endoglycosidase H, and be transported to the plasma membrane (41Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we expressed the 110-kDa ΔNBF2 protein in the presence of various substrates. Fig.2 B shows that expression in the presence of 3 μm cyclosporin A (lane 2), 25 μm verapamil (lane 4), 6 μm vinblastine (lane 6), or 100 μm capsaicin (lane 8) all resulted in the appearance of another polypeptide of apparent mass 130 kDa. The 130-kDa ΔNBF2 P-gp protein was resistant to digestion by endoglycosidase H but not to endoglycosidase F (data not shown). The appearance of the 130-kDa protein in the presence of drug substrates suggests that the 110-kDa ΔNBF2 protein retained the ability to bind drug substrates, resulting in maturation of the protein. We then tested whether a deletion mutant that was missing both nucleotide-binding domains, and containing only the transmembrane segments 1–6 and 7–12 (TMD1+2; Fig. 1 C) could also interact with drug substrates. The cDNA for mutant TMD1+2 was expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of drug substrates. In the absence of drug substrates, the major product for TMD1+2 was an 80-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Expression of mutant TMD1+2 in the presence of 3 μm cyclosporin A (lane 2); 25 μm verapamil (lane 4), 6 μm vinblastine (lane 6), or 100 μm capsaicin (lane 8), however, resulted in the appearance of two products of 80 and 100 kDa. These results suggest that the mutant TMD1+2 protein could interact with drug substrates and undergo maturation. The mutant TMD1+2 protein was treated with endoglycosidases to test whether expression in the presence of drug substrates had indeed induced maturation of the protein. Fig. 3 shows that the 80-kDa TMD1+2 protein was sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H when expressed in the presence (lanes 1 and 2) or absence (lanes 3 and 4) of drug substrate (cyclosporin A). The 80-kDa protein decreased in apparent mass to 72 kDa following digestion by endoglycosidase H. Similar results were obtained when the 80-kDa protein was digested with endoglycosidase F (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). These results suggest that the 80-kDa protein is the core-glycosylated immature form. In contrast, synthesis in the presence of drug substrate resulted in the appearance of the 100-kDa protein that was insensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2) but not to endoglycosidase F (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Apparently, the expression of mutant TMD1+2 in the presence of substrate allowed the mutant protein to leave the endoplasmic reticulum and pass through the Golgi apparatus for extensive modification of the carbohydrate groups. Cells expressing TMD1+2 were then subjected to cell surface labeling to determine if the mutant protein was correctly targeted to the cell surface. Cells expressing the A52-tagged TMD1+2 protein were grown for 24 h in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A, treated with sodium periodate to convert the carbohydrate moieties to aldehydes, and then reacted with biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce). Biotin-LC-hydrazide is a cell-impermeant compound that covalently attaches biotin groups to glycoproteins after periodate oxidation of the carbohydrate moieties. The biotinylated TMD1+2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52 and subjected to Western blot analysis with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Fig. 4 shows that the mutant TMD1+2 protein (100 kDa) was detected at the cell surface after expression in the presence of cyclosporin A (lane 2) or verapamil (lane 4). There was no labeling of TMD1+2 (80 kDa) when expressed in the absence or presence of drug substrate (lanes 1 and 3). These results showed that TMD1+2 is capable of interacting with drug substrates, resulting in maturation of the carbohydrate residues and trafficking to the cell surface. These results also suggested that the presence of drug substrates during synthesis induces structural changes in the protein. We previously showed that immature and mature forms of full-length wild-type P-gp were different in their sensitivity to digestion by trypsin (42Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Core-glycosylated P-gp was about 100-fold more sensitive to digestion by trypsin compared with the mature enzyme. This enhanced sensitivity to trypsin of the core-glycosylated form of P-gp suggested that it existed in a more “relaxed” conformation than the mature enzyme. Accordingly, the TMD1+2 protein was subjected to trypsin digestion to test for potential structural differences between the 80- and 100-kDa forms of the protein. Membranes prepared from cells expressing the A-52-tagged TMD1+2 protein were treated with trypsin and then subjected to Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52. Fig. 5 (lane 1) shows that the 80-kDa form of TMD1+2 is the major product in the membranes of cells grown in the absence of drug substrate, while the 100-kDa form is the major product when grown in the presence of substrate. In addition, the 80-kDa form of the protein showed relatively higher sensitivity to trypsin (10 μg/ml trypsin;lane 3) than the 100-kDa form of the protein (1000 μg/ml trypsin; lane 5). These results suggested that the trypsin-sensitive sites are more readily accessible in the 80-kDa protein but are probably hidden in the 100-kDa protein as a result of tighter or proper folding when synthesized in the presence of drug substrate. We then tested whether TMD1+2 could confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs when expressed in mammalian cells. The usual approach for determining if a mutant P-gp can confer resistance to different drugs is to generate stable cell lines. The cells are first transfected with the mutant P-gp cDNA followed by selection of drug-resistant colonies after incubation in different cytotoxic drug substrates. A technical problem in using this method for studying mutant TMD1+2 is that the protein does not reach the cell surface in the absence of substrate. Compounding this problem is the observation that the concentrations of drug substrate required for trafficking of TMD1+2 to the cell surface would initially cause extensive cell death, thus complicating the results. Another problem with generating stable lines is that other mechanisms of drug resistance (endogenous) could develop during the relatively long selection period (months) needed to generate highly drug-resistant colonies. To circumvent these potential problems, we developed a faster assay for measuring P-gp-mediated drug resistance that does not require the generation of drug-resistant stable cell lines. The assay relies on the use of an Epstein-Barr virus vector, pREP4, that can be maintained extrachromosomally in HEK 293 cells that constitutively express EBNA-1. The cDNAs for the A52-tagged wild-type, and P-gp mutants P709G, N-half, C-half, and TMD1+2 were inserted into the pREP4 vector and transfected into HEK 293(EBNA-1) cells. Mutant P709G was included because it shows similar processing defects as mutant TMD1+2. When mutant P709G is expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of drug substrate, the major product is a protein of 150 kDa that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as a core-glycosylated intermediate (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in the presence of drug substrate, however, corrects this processing defect (Fig. 6 A). The P-gp half-molecules were also included because the processing of the N-half is also sensitive to the presence of substrate. When N-half P-gp is expressed alone or co-expressed with the C-half P-gp in the absence of drug substrate, it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as a core-glycosylated intermediate. Maturation of the N-half P-gp and trafficking to the cell surface is restored when it is expressed in the presence of the C-half P-gp and drug substrate (42Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows expression of the P-gp mutants using the pREP4 vector and HEK 293(EBNA-1) cells. The major product for wild-type P-gp was the 170-kDa mature protein in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. For mutant P709G, the major product in the absence of drug substrate was the 150-kDa (core-glycosylated) protein, while the 170-kDa protein was the major product in the presence of substrate. When N-half (90-kDa) P-gp was co-expressed with C-half P-gp in the presence"
https://openalex.org/W1965570761,"The recent discovery of a vestigial, nonphotosynthetic plastid (“apicoplast”) in the Apicomplexa has considerably modified our perception of the evolutionary origin of these parasites. Phylogenetic analysis and the presence of four surrounding membranes of the apicoplast provide important support for the hypothesis that apicomplexans have acquired their apicoplast by secondary endosymbiosis, probably from a green alga. This suggests that genes encoding predicted homologs of proteins of green algae or related photosynthetic lineages could have entered the nucleus of apicomplexan parasites by transfer from the ancestor harboring the apicoplast. We describe here complementary DNAs encoding two Toxoplasma gondii glycolytic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6-PI) and enolase, which have considerable identities with land plant counterparts. Both cDNAs of T. gondii complement Escherichia coli mutants lacking G6-PI and enolase genes and lead to the expression of active enzymes. In the drug untreatable encysted bradyzoites of T. gondii, G6-PI and enolase genes are overexpressed or exclusively expressed at both transcriptional and protein levels. Moreover, three-dimensional models and protein phylogeny confirmed that G6-PIs and enolases of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and land plants are closely related. Because these glycolytic enzymes are plant homologs, which differ from those of animals, they will be useful to trace the evolutionary origin of Apicomplexa and might offer novel chemotherapeutic targets in diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites.

These parasites possess a third genetic element, a 35-kilobase circular DNA contained within a nonphotosynthetic plastid in addition to the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (1Wilson R.J.M. Denny P.W. Preiser P.R. Rangachari K. Roberts K. Roy A. Whyte A. Strath M. Moore D.J. Moore P.W. Williamson D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the tufA gene encoded by the apicoplast genome, the presence of four membranes, and the analogy to present day chrysophytes, cryptomonads, diatoms, and chlorarachniophytes, it is postulated that apicomplexan parasites have acquired this organelle by the ingestion of another eukaryotic plastid-containing alga (2McFadden G.I.

However, these recent data provided unexpected and contradictory evidence for the origin of apicomplexan plastids because previous classifications showed the closest relationship between apicoplast and plastids of red alga (6Williamson D.H. Gardner M.J. Preiser P. Moore D.J. Rangachari K. Wilson R.J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and euglenoids (7Egea N. Lang-Unnasch N. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, ultrastructural and biochemical studies revealed that most apicomplexan parasites synthesize amylopectin, a glucose storage form in cytosol like most of red algae and glaucophytes (8Cavalier-Smith T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 953-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations together with the acquisition of the apicoplast raise many key questions regarding the evolutionary origin of apicomplexan parasites. Identification of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes should promote investigations of the evolutionary origin of apicomplexans and the biology of parasitism, because these enzymes are particularly suitable for theories of enzymes evolution (9Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of apicomplexan parasites could also pave the way for the search of novel and specific chemotherapeutic targets. The infection by T. gondii can lead to severe syndromes including congenital malformations such as blindness, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly in children exposed in utero. Recently, more attention has been given to T. gondii because toxoplasmosis is the most common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients with AIDS or in transplant patients (10Luft B.J. Remington J.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the parasite has a sexual cycle occurring in cats, the infection is usually transmitted asexually by ingestion of undercooked meat from latently infected animals (e.g. pork or lamb). In mammalian nonfeline hosts, T. gondii is found in two haploid asexual forms, the rapidly replicating tachyzoites and the slowly dividing, quiescent encysted bradyzoites. The tachyzoites differentiate into encysted bradyzoites in response to the immune system attack during disease progression. They will remain in the brain and other organs during the lifetime of infected hosts. The reactivation of encysted bradyzoites into actively replicating and cytolytic tachyzoites is the cause of fatal toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS patients (11Luft B.J. Hafner R. Korzun A.H. Leport C. Antoniskis D. Bosler E.M. Bourland D.D. Uttamchandani R. Fuhrer J. Jacobson J. Morlat P. Vilde J.-L. Remington J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Understanding stage conversion could be helpful in designing novel targets and strategies to overcome the disease. We and others have found that mitochondria are functionally impaired in encysted bradyzoites of T. gondii, suggesting that these parasitic forms rely predominantly on anaerobic glycolysis (12Tomavo S. Boothroyd J.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Bohne W. Heesemann J. Gross U. Infect.

Stage-specific lactate dehydrogenase homologs and two expressing sequence tags encoding short sequences of enolase have been identified in T. gondii (15Yang S. Parmley S.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Manger I.D. Hehl A. Parmley S. Sibley L.D. Marra M. Hillier L. Waterston R. Boothroyd J.C. Infect.

Glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (d-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) and enolase (2-phospho-d-glycerate hydrolase, EC 4.2.1.11) are two important enzymes of glycolysis and catalyze the interconversions of fructose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate or 2-phospho-d-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, respectively. Here, we report for the first time the full-length cDNAs, deduced amino acid sequences, and functional expression of cytosolic G6-PI1 and enolase of T. gondii. We show several lines of evidence demonstrating that G6-PI and enolase of both T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum are homologous to their land plant counterparts using extensive analyses of predicted primary sequences, three-dimensional structures, and molecular phylogeny. We further discuss the implications of these findings regarding our understanding of the evolutionary origin of apicomplexan parasites and for developing novel chemotherapeutic strategies. The 76K strain of T. gondii was used because of the ease in culturing these parasites in vitro or to obtain encysted bradyzoites from chronically infected mice. Encysted bradyzoites were purified and freed by pepsin digestion (0.05 mg ml−1 pepsin in 170 mm NaCl, 60 mm HCl) for 5–10 min at 37 °C (17Tomavo S. Fortier B. Soete M. Ansel C. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3750-3753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tachyzoites were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Dutscher), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 0.05% gentamicin (Sigma). Parasites were harvested from the monolayer HFF cells and purified by filtration on a glass wool column and finally through a 3.0-μm pore size filter (Nucleopore) (18Tomavo S. Dubremetz J.F. Schwarz R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11721-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from parasites using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A+) RNA was purified using the oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). Genomic DNA isolation, recombinant DNA purification, and the analysis of nucleic acids by blots were carried out according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Specific probes were randomly labeled DNAs generated from the complete ORFs of G6-PI and enolase using the digoxigenin method (DIG-High Prime, Roche Diagnostics). To obtain full-length cDNAs, RACE techniques were performed using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) with the Adaptor Primer 1 and specific oligonucleotides of either G6-PI (5′-AACGCCAGCAGCTGGCCAATATGG-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CTTTGCTCAGC CAGATGCGCTGGC-3′ for 3′-RACE) or enolase (5′-CAGAATATCGTCCCCTATAACCTG-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CGAGGGGTGGCTGAAAAAGTATCC-3′ for 3′-RACE). Nested PCR was performed using Adaptor Primer 2 and internal primers of either G6-PI (5′-GGTGAGATCTCCGGAAAAAGAAGC-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-GACACCCGAAGAACTCCGCAAGGA-3′ for 3′-RACE) or enolase (5′-TATAACCTGTGTTTTCTCACCCAC-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CGACCAAGATGACTTCGCAAGTTT-3′ for 3′-RACE). PCR products were cloned into the TA-Cloning pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an ALFexpress automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA isolated from tachyzoite and bradyzoite forms using reverse transcriptase. Serial dilutions of cDNAs (1:1, 1:10, and 1:100) were used to amplify ORFs of T. gondiiα-tubulin (20Nagel S.D. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), G6-PI, and enolase by PCR. Primers were as follows: for α-tubulin, 5′-ATGAGAGAGGTTATCAGCATC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTACTCGTCACCATAGCC-3′; for G6-PI, 5′-GGGCGGATCCATGGCGCCGACACAGCTGGAACAG-3′ and 5′-GGGCGGATCCAGCCTTCGACTGCTGCACGTAGTG-3′; and for enolase, 5′-GGGCCCATGGTGGTTATCAAGGACATCGTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCAGATCTTTTTGGGTGTCGAAAGCTCTCTCC-3′. The complete ORFs of G6-PI and enolase were tagged to oligonucleotide encoding a polyhistidine peptide and cloned inframe into the pQE-60 expression vector (Quiagen) designated pQE-G6PI and pQE-Enolase, respectively. Under induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, transformed Escherichia coli (XL1-Blue strain) was lysed, and recombinant proteins were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns using an imidazole gradient elution. Polyclonal antisera were from BALB/c mice immunized with purified recombinant proteins. Western blots were performed using polyclonal antisera diluted 1:1000 and secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or to peroxidase. E. coli G6-PI/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient DF214 strain (21Vinopal R.T. Hillman J.D. Schulman H. Reznikoff W.S. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enolase-deficient DF261 strain (22Hillman J.D. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Department of Biology, Yale University. These mutants, which grow normally in nonselective media composed of Luria broth (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin for DF214 strain or M9 minimal medium containing 12.5 mmglycerol and 25 mm malate for the DF261 strain, are unable to grow on the selective media consisted of M9 minimal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mg ml−1 glucose and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (21Vinopal R.T.

Bacteria were transformed by electroporation (BTX, 2.45 kV, 129 ohms, 5 ms), plated onto selective medium, and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. The G6-PI assay was performed with 2 μg of purified G6-PI in 980 μl of a mixture containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm fructose 6-phosphate (Sigma), 0.2 mm NADP, and 0.1 unit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at 37 °C. Purified enolase (2.55 μg) was mixed with 990 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm 2-phospho-d-glycerate (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C. The G6-PI and enolase activities were detected by spectrophotometry at 230 and 340 nm, respectively (23Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism. A Manual of Biochemical Methods. 3rd Ed. Grune and Stratton, Philadelphia1984: 40-42Google Scholar). The G6-PI or enolase sequences were aligned using Clustal V and W (24Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar, 25Myers E.W. Miller W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). Using Swiss-Model and Swiss-PDBViewer (26Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9587) Google Scholar), three-dimensional models were generated from the data of the three-dimensional structure (x-ray diffraction at 2.0 Å resolution) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase published previously (28Zhang E. Brewer J.M. Minor W. Carreira L.A. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12526-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and maximum parsimony algorithms (29Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar, 30Adachi J. Hasegawa M. MOLPHY: Version 2.2. 1995; Google Scholar). Bootstrap analysis and trees were performed using 100 replicates in MOLPHY 2.2 (30Adachi J. Hasegawa M. MOLPHY: Version 2.2. 1995; Google Scholar) and Tree View software (31Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have cloned two fragments of cDNAs encoding the glycolytic enzymes G6-PI and enolase using a subtractive library devised for the isolation of cDNAs that are specifically expressed by the encysted bradyzoites of T. gondii (32Yahiaoui B. Dzierszinski F. Bernigaud A. Slomianny C. Camus D. Tomavo S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These two cDNAs of 242 and 491 bp enabled appropriate PCR primers to be designed for the generation of 5′-end and 3′-end DNA fragments by using the RACE method. The reconstruction of full-length cDNAs of the two enzymes was achieved by RACE. For G6-PI, the nucleotide sequence of 2656 bp revealed an ORF of 1689 bp (nucleotides 142–1833), which encodes a 563-amino acid protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 63,122. The enolase cDNA is 2016 bp long with an 1332-bp ORF (nucleotides 321–1652), which encodes a 444-amino acid protein (Mr = 48,341). To assess the copy number of both genes in the nuclear genome of T. gondii, Southern blots were carried out using G6-PI (Fig.1 A) or enolase (Fig.1 B) probes. Under stringent conditions, the blots gave mostly a single band except when predicted internal restriction sites were present. The data were consistent with a single copy number G6-PI and enolase genes in the T. gondii genome. Because cDNAs of these enzymes were isolated from the in vitro bradyzoite library, we verified the level of their transcripts in encysted bradyzoites isolated from mice. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed because there are limitations in obtaining sufficient cysts in vivo for Northern blots. Levels of G6-PI and enolase transcripts are increased 10- and 1000-fold, respectively, in the encysted bradyzoites (Fig.1 C). These conclusions were strongly supported by the nearly constant level of the housekeeping α-tubulin amplified in both tachyzoite and bradyzoite forms (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that G6-PI and enolase genes are transcriptionally overexpressed in the encysted stage of T. gondii. To investigate whether these mRNA abundances increase the expression of G6-PI and enolase proteins, recombinant proteins tagged to the C-terminal polyhistidine peptide were produced in E. coli transformed with pQE-G6PI and pQE-Enolase plasmids. Fig.2 shows the purification of G6-PI (Fig.2 A) and enolase (Fig. 2 B) recombinant proteins. Purified recombinant proteins (lanes 4a and 4) were used to raise polyclonal antisera in mice. By comparing the reactivity of monoclonal antibody specific to the tachyzoite protein SAG1 (Fig. 2 E, lane 4), Western blots of polyclonal antibodies revealed proteins of 63 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3) and 48 kDa (Fig. 2 D, lane 3) corresponding to the expected sizes of G6-PI and enolase only in the encysted bradyzoite of T. gondii. However, the polyclonal antibody against enolase cross-reacted with a faint band of a 50-kDa protein present in brain cells (Fig. 2 D, lane 2) but absent in HFF cells (lane 1). The cross-reactivity can be explained by the high degree of homology (65%) between all enolases. Together with the increase of mRNA abundance, the data demonstrate the expression of stage-specific G6-PI and enolase by T. gondii. Finally, immunofluorescence assays were used to determine the localization of G6-PI and enolase in T. gondii. The two glycolytic enzymes were found exclusively in the cytosol of the parasite. 2F. Dzierszinski, O. Popescu, C. Toursel, C. Slomianny, B. Yahiaoui, and S. Tomavo, unpublished data. To determine whether pQE-G6PI and pQE-Enolase plasmids encode active enzymes, we have chosen to complement E. coli mutants lacking G6-PI and enolase genes and to perform enzymatic assays on purified recombinant proteins. The transformation of these E. coli mutants with three different concentrations of pQE-G6PI and pQE-Enolase plasmids gave an increasing number of colonies (Fig. 3, A and D). The presence of pQE-G6PI and pQE-Enolase plasmids was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–5, and Fig.3 E, lanes 4–7). These clones expressed the 63-kDa G6-PI (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2–5) or the 48-kDa enolase (Fig. 3 F, lanes 4–7) recognized specifically by the polyclonal antibodies that cannot react with any protein in noncomplemented E. coli mutants, as expected (Fig. 3 C, lane 1, and Fig. 3 F, lane 3). Interestingly, although the antibodies reacted against T. gondii G6-PI and enolase recombinant proteins purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Fig. 3 C, lane 6, and Fig. 3 F, lane 1), no reactivity could be observed against G6-PI (Fig.3 C, lane 7) or enolase (Fig. 3 F, lane 2) from rabbit, confirming that our polyclonal antibodies were specific to the enzymes of the parasite. Moreover, the purified recombinant G6-PI and enolase displayed specific activities comparable to the rabbit enzymes (data not shown). In conclusion, the data show convincingly that these isolated cDNAs encode functional G6-PI and enolase that are specifically expressed in encysted bradyzoites of T. gondii. The amino acid sequences of G6-PI and enolase from T. gondii (this study) and P. falciparum (33Read M. Hicks K.E. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Kaslow D.C. Hill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12337-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were aligned with those of several other species. The G6-PIs of T. gondii and P. falciparum displayed four amino acid insertions (residues 286, 423, 425–426, and 429) and four deletions (residues 21–22, 32–33, 47–50, and 403–404) like land plants G6-PIs (Fig. 4 A). Similarly to G6-PIs, the two apicomplexan enolases revealed also two short insertions (residues 96 and 263–264) and one deletion (residues 82–83) like plant and green alga enolases (Fig. 4 B). In addition, a plant enolase synapomorphy (a pentapeptide EWGWC insertion) is also found in T. gondii (35Van Der Straeten D. Rodrigues-Pousada R.A. Goodman H.M. Van Montagu M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Lal S.K. Johnson S. Conway T. Kelley P.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to higher plant enolases, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lacks this plant signature. The pentapeptide, first reported in apicomplexan parasites for P. falciparum (33Read M. Hicks K.E. Sims P.F.G. Hyde J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is composed of EWGYS amino acids (residues 103–107) in T. gondii and EWGWS in P. falciparum instead of EWGWC. We have recently cloned another isoform of enolase, which contains the true EWGWC motif of land plant in the tachyzoite stage of T. gondii.2 These studies revealed the almost complete matches, as assessed by the perfect superimposition of three-dimensional structures of T. gondii and human enolases (with a Cα root mean square of 1.05 Å), except for domains I and II (Fig.5 A). These two loops were also found when P. falciparum and human enolases were superimposed (Fig. 5 B). Domain I contains the pentapeptide EWGWC insertion only found in plants and in apicomplexans, whereas a 2-amino acid (EK or NK) insertion is observed in domain II. These short insertions of only five and two amino acids seem to be responsible for the increased length of the two loops. The superimposition of T. gondii and Zea mays enolases indicates similarities between the two loops in plant and apicomplexan enolases (Fig.5 C). These two domains evidenced by the superimposition of all four T. gondii, P. falciparum, maize, and human enolases (Fig. 5 D, domain II, and Fig. 5 E, domain I) confirmed that enolases from apicomplexan parasites are more closely related to plants than to human and other enolases. Finally, two other features distinguish the three-dimensional models of the human enzyme from those of the apicomplexan counterpart: 1) one β-sheet is present in domain II of human enolase, whereas none is found in apicomplexan and plant enolases (Fig. 5 D); and 2) two β-sheets are present in loop I of P. falciparum, whereas none are seen in that of plants and T. gondii (Fig.5 E). The biological significance of these β-sheets in the loops is presently unknown. To gain further phylogenetic support for our assumption, extensive molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted. For G6-PIs and independently to the algorithm used, maximum likelihood (ML), neighbor joining (NJ), and maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees showed that apicomplexans and plants are unequivocally sister lineages (Fig.6 A). The apicomplexans plant clade is supported by bootstrap values of 88, 94, and 96% for ML, NJ, and P, respectively. When the enolase trees were generated, only the maximum parsimony analysis indicate that T. gondii, P. falciparum, and plants are most closely related to each other (Fig. 6 B). The data showed an apicomplexans plant clade supported by a bootstrap value of 92%, and there is no way to root the parsimony tree of enolases without having apicomplexans and higher plants as a monophyletic group. However, the ML and NJ analyses gave fragile branchings, with bootstrap values of 38 and 40%, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, the ML and NJ data of enolase trees do not provide any direct statistical support for the apicomplexans plant clade. It should be noticed that bootstrap values above 70% are considered as true clades at >95% probability (37Hillis D.M. Bull J.J. Syst. Biol. 1993; 42: 182-192Crossref Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the evolutionary relationships between apicomplexan parasites and plant enolases evidenced by the parsimony tree are weakly supported by the NJ and ML trees, indicating that the phylogenetic links are not as congruent as those found for the G6-PIs. This argues for the placement of Apicomplexa as a sister group closer to plants than animals, fungi, Trypanosomatidae, and bacteria. We have cloned and expressed two functional plant-like glycolytic enzymes, G6-PI and enolase of T gondii. Three lines of evidence support our conclusion. First, the amino acid sequences show considerable homology to known G6-PIs and enolases. Second, these cDNAs complement and restore the ability of E. coli mutants lacking endogenous enolase and G6-PI to utilize glucose. Third, and most importantly, E. coli transfected with the cDNAs encode active recombinant G6-PI and enolase. These two glycolytic enzymes are localized in the cytosol of T. gondii. Consistent with their cytosolic localization, G6-PI and enolase lack either signal sequences or organelle-targeting presequences of the T. gondii apicoplast (38Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.J.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Both T. gondii and P. falciparum G6-PIs and enolases displayed amino acid insertions and deletions like their plant homologs. It is unlikely that these amino acids were inserted or removed randomly and independently in apicomplexans and plants. The more direct interpretation is that these events occurred in ancestral glycolytic enzymes inherited by both apicomplexans and plants. The plant signatures found in the amino acid sequences and the phylogenetic results of G6-PIs and enolases provide support for apicomplexans being a sister group of the plant clade. However, the ML and NJ analyses of enolase trees do not firmly establish this evolutionary link because of the weakness of the bootstrap values. Altogether, these data raise several hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of apicomplexan parasites. First, these cytosolic G6-PIs and enolases of apicomplexan parasites could be of algal origin. This assumption is supported by the recent discovery of a nonphotosynthetic remnant plastid (“apicoplast”) in apicomplexan parasites (1Wilson R.J.M. Denny P.W. Preiser P.R. Rangachari K. Roberts K. Roy A. Whyte A. Strath M. Moore D.J. Moore P.W. Williamson D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 2McFadden G.I. Reith M.E. Munholland J. Lang-Unnasch N.

Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In light of these observations and on the basis of previous analyses of the evolution of chloroplast cytosol isoenzymes (39Nowitzki U. Flechner A. Kellermann J. Hasegawa M. Schnarrenberger C. Martin W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Martin W. Schnarrenberger C. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 41Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), the closer evolutionary relationship existing between G6-PIs and enolases of apicomplexans and higher plants could indicate an endosymbiotic gene transfer from the cyanobacterial ancestors of the green algal plastid. By analogy to higher plants, which display in the cytosol a eubacterial type of glycolytic pathway (40Martin W. Schnarrenberger C. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 41Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the archaebacterial enzymes of the ancestor cell, which gave rise to modern apicomplexan parasites, have been replaced by the products of genes that were donated to the nucleus from cyanobacterial symbionts within green algae (3Köhler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J.M. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Most importantly, plastidial origin for G6-PI has been previously hypothesized (42Katz L.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It seems possible to root the ML and the maximum parsimony trees described in this study in such a way that monophyly can be obtained between the apicomplexans plant and bacteria cyanobacteria clades. However, it appears that enolases of apicomplexans are closer to those of land plants rather than those of green algae from which the apicoplast might be derived. This interpretation should be taken with caution because the enolase phylogeny provides solid statistical proof only for the parsimony analysis. In addition, the C. reinhardtii enolase is the only green algal sequence presently available. Therefore we feel that more green algal enolase sequences are required for extensive phylogenetic analyses. Second, apicomplexans may have evolved from a plant parasite of protist nature, which has acquired several genes by lateral transfers. In this case, the ancestor has completely disappeared or has not been yet identified in modern protists. Third, if the origin of these plant-like glycolytic enzymes is not linked to the horizontal gene transfer events, it should then be hypothesized that Apicomplexa and plants are derived from a common ancestor (8Cavalier-Smith T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 953-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ancestor could be a member of the phylum Protalveolata because of common features such as the presence of ultrastructural similarities between the inner membranous complex of apicomplexans and the cortical alveoli in Dinozoa (that include dinoflagellates) and Ciliophora phyla. These cortical alveoli are also present in Glaucophyta, which have starch-like granules in their cytosol like most apicomplexan parasites. To further investigate these hypotheses, molecular cloning and analysis of G6-PIs and enolases from cyanobacteria, algae, dinoflagellates, ciliates, and other protists need to be determined. Nevertheless, it appears that the ancestor of apicomplexan parasites might belong to the photosynthetic lineage and has switched from photoautotrophy to endocellular parasitism. Specific targets for novel chemotherapeutic agents should emerge from these fascinating facets of the evolutionary origin of apicomplexan parasites (38Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.J.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 43Roberts F.

Even though it was postulated that high degrees of identity between glycolytic enzymes would hamper the development of specific inhibitors directed solely against the enzymes of the parasite, it has been recently reported that glycolytic enzymes remain good candidates for chemotherapy (44Bakker B.M.

Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 11: 1423-1427Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For instance, species-specific inhibition has been achieved for triose-phosphate isomerase of Trypanosoma brucei based on the evolutionary changes found in the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures (45Gomez-Puyou A. Saavedra-Lira E. Becker I. Zubillaga R.A. Rojo-Dominguez A. Perez-Montfort R. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the selective and specific inhibition of four glycolytic enzymes from T. brucei has been described using suramin derivatives (46Trinquier M. Perie J. Callens M. Opperdoes F. Willson M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 11: 1423-1427Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The glycolytic enzymes identified in T. gondii could be evaluated as potential targets against which new chemotherapeutic agents could be developed. Glycolysis may represent a major or even the unique source of ATP production in encysted bradyzoites, whereas tachyzoites may depend on both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (12Tomavo S. Boothroyd J.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Bohne W. Heesemann J. Gross U. Infect.

The expression of G6-PI and enolase is increased in the cysts of T. gondii, and similar increases of glycolytic enzymes are also observed in red blood cells infected by P. falciparum (47Roth Jr., E. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 453-460PubMed Google Scholar). These glycolytic enzymes could represent new therapeutic targets because of their resemblance to plant enzymes. Theoretically, rational drug design can be envisaged using information drawn from the three-dimensional structure of enolase such as the two enlarged loops located right in front of the channels used by the substrate (2-phosphoglycerate) and the end products, phosphoenolpyruvate and H2O. To our knowledge, G6-PI and enolase isolated here are the first glycolytic enzymes of T. gondii to be functionally expressed in heterologous systems. The complemented E. coli expressing T. gondii glycolytic enzymes can be helpful for rapid screening of new drugs. We thank Drs. K. Séron and J. Vamecq for critical reading of the manuscript. We are grateful to Dr. I. Callebaut for analysis of the three-dimensional models."

Members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) families are trans-acting nuclear factors playing a regulatory role in the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (1Hwang C.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and plays a critical role in the adipocyte differentiation process (3Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ genes is not restricted to adipose tissue but is induced early and transiently during the program of adipocyte differentiation. Expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ decreases following adipocyte maturation, whereas expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 gene is induced (5Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). C/EBP-binding sites have been identified in the PPARγ2 promoter, and it has been recently shown that C/EBP proteins directly control transcription from the PPARγ2 promoter (6Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The adipogenic role of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ has been previously demonstrated. Their ectopic expression in fibroblasts leads, in the presence of adipogenic hormones, to the adipocyte phenotype (7Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 8Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the generation by homologous recombination of C/EBPβ−/−·δ−/− mice has clearly established the essential role of these two C/EBPs for the acquisition of adipocytes both in vitro and in vivo (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, the extracellular factors and the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression in preadipose cells are poorly defined. During the course of our investigation to identify extracellular factors that regulate early events in adipocyte differentiation, secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by preadipocytes was observed. LIF is known to induce differentiation of the murine myeloid leukemia cell line M1, to maintain pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells (11Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 12Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagner E.F. Metcalf D.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). LIF and the related cytokines cardiotrophin (CT-1) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) act through heterodimeric receptors comprised of LIF receptor and gp130 (14Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). We show in the current study that exogenous LIF stimulates terminal differentiation of Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A preadipose cells and induces adipocyte differentiation of multipotent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Moreover, by using an antagonist of LIF receptor or genetically modified ES cells, we show that LIF receptor plays a key role during adipocyte differentiation. These results are at variance with previous reports showing an anti-adipogenic effect of LIF in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (15Mori M. Yamaguchi K. Abe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Greenberg A.S. Nordan R.P. McIntosh J. Calvo J.C. Scow R.O. Jablons D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4113-4116PubMed Google Scholar). The differential response to LIF of 3T3-L1 cells versus other cells is discussed. The expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ genes was rapidly induced in Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A preadipose cells after LIF addition. The role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in early events induced by LIF has been investigated. The results show that p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway mediates both C/EBP gene expression and adipocyte differentiation induced by LIF. Ob1771 preadipose cells were induced to undergo differentiation in serum-free conditions as previously reported (17Gaillard D. Négrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem.

For differentiation of 3T3-F442A in serum-free conditions, confluent preadipose cells were exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), T3 (200 pm), transferrin (10 μg/ml), fetuin (50 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml), BRL49653 (10 nm) plus sodium ascorbate (100 mm), and sodium selenite (20 nm). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were harvested from 14-day post-coitus embryos and maintained for 10 passages in 10% heat-inactivated FCS. MEF were a gift of D. Grall and G. Pagès (Nice, France). For studying effect of LIF, MEF were plated at 2.5 × 103cells/cm2 and maintained in serum-free medium for proliferation. At confluence cells were maintained in serum-free medium (17Gaillard D. Négrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 nm BRL49653. Embryonic stem (ES) cells were maintained pluripotent as described previously (18Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolin S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ES cells deficient for LIF receptor were maintained pluripotent by addition of IL-6 together with soluble IL-6 receptor. For differentiation, wild-type and mutant ES cells were cultivated in aggregates termed embryoid bodies and were committed into the adipocyte lineage as recently described (18Dani C. Smith A.G.

LacZ-marked ES cells were generated by introducing the lacZ gene into Oct-4 locus by homologous recombination using an internal ribosome entry site-containing construct (19Mountford P. Zevnik B.

Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays (for expression of LIF and LIF receptor transcripts) were performed as described previously (21Dani C. Doglio A. Amri E.-Z. Bardon S. Fort P.

Quantification of the hybridization signal was performed using a PhosphorImager apparatus (Fujix Bas 1000). Probes for LIF, ob, GAPDH, and LIF receptor have been described (22Leroy P. Dessolin S.

McKnight (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco). The PPARγ cDNA was isolated from PPARγ2/SPORT plasmid and the a-FABP cDNA from pAL422 plasmid (gift of P. Tontonoz and B.M. Spiegelman, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Confluent cells were maintained in 0.5% FCS for 12 h before adding LIF. Whole-cell lysates were prepared and electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with specific antiserum against C/EBPδ or C/EBPβ. Anti-C/EBPβ (C–19) and anti-C/EBPδ (C-22) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies were used at supplier's recommended concentrations. LIF was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor preparation has been described (24Yoshida K. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A.G. Saito M. Yasukawa K. Shoyab M. Taga T.

PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs, and U0126 was purchased from Promega. The expression of LIF and LIF receptor genes was investigated during three defined stages of the program of 3T3-F442A adipocyte differentiation using a sensitive ribonuclease protection assay. Total RNAs were prepared from either exponentially growing cells corresponding to the adipoblast stage, from cells that reach confluence corresponding to the preadipose stage characterized at the molecular level by the early expression of specific genes such as A2COL6 (21Dani C.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10119-10125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or from cells that express ob gene and accumulate triacylglycerol corresponding to the adipose stage of differentiation (22Leroy P. Dessolin S. Villageois P. Moon B.C. Friedman J.M. Ailhaud G. Dani C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25Maffei M. Fei H.

As shown in Fig.1, levels of RNAs encoding the two forms of secreted LIF, i.e. the diffusible form (LIF-D) and the form associated to the extracellular matrix (LIF-M) (26Rathjen P.D. Toth S. Willis A. Heath J.K. Smith A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1105-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), were higher in adipoblasts and preadipocytes than in mature adipocytes. In contrast, the LIF receptor was not detectably expressed in adipoblasts. Expression of LIF receptor was induced in preadipocytes in parallel to that of A2COL6 gene (not shown) and was maintained in mature adipocytes. Transcripts encoding the soluble form (sLIF-R) and the transmembrane form (tmLIF-R) of LIF receptor, which could be distinguished by RNase protection (23Chambers I. Cozens A. Broadbent J. Robertson M. Lee M. Li M. Smith A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), showed a similar pattern of expression. The differential developmental expression of LIF and LIF receptor was found to be similar during adipocyte differentiation of the 3T3-F442A and Ob1771 clonal lines (not shown). Expression of LIF and LIF receptor genes in mouse adipose tissue was investigated. The stromal-vascular fraction, containing adipoblasts and preadipocytes, and the adipocyte fraction, containing the bulk of mature adipocytes, were isolated from epididymal fat pads after cell dissociation by collagenase treatment. Total RNAs from each fraction were then prepared as described previously (21Dani C. Doglio A. Amri E.-Z. Bardon S. Fort P. Bertrand B. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10119-10125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIF RNA was detected only in the stromal-vascular fraction, whereas LIF receptor was expressed in both fractions. These data are consistent with in vitro data and suggest that LIF and LIF receptor RNAs are expressed simultaneously in preadipocytes only. The capacity of preadipocytes to secrete bioactive LIF was investigated. For that purpose we studied the capacity of Ob1771 preadipocytes to support pluripotent ES cells in coculture assays. It has been previously described that the maintenance of ES cells required the presence of LIF or LIF-related factors (24Yoshida K. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A.G. Saito M. Yasukawa K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and we have recently described the generation of convenient LacZ-marked ES cells in which β-galactosidase expression is restricted to pluripotent ES cells (19Mountford P. Zevnik B. Düwell A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Dani C. Chambers I.

The indicator ES cells were plated on layers of confluent Ob1771 preadipocytes and maintained in either serum-supplemented or serum-free medium (17Gaillard D. Négrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Five days later, the number of β-galactosidase-positive colonies was determined. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Ob1771 preadipose cells maintained in both culture conditions could support pluripotent ES cells. Addition of an antagonist of LIF receptor, hLIF05 (27Vernallis A.B. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26947-26952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), completely blocked ES cell maintenance supported by preadipocytes. The antagonist of LIF receptor is a mutated form of human LIF that antagonizes the action of LIF-D and LIF-M as well as that of CNTF and CT-1 by blocking the LIF receptor (27Vernallis A.B. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26947-26952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Neophytou C. Vernallis A.B. Smith A.G. Raff M.C. Development. 1997; 124: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the capacity of preadipocytes to maintain ES cells was due to LIF-D as the activity of Ob1771 preadipocyte-conditioned medium was reduced by 60–80% in the presence of a specific anti-LIF blocking antibody (Fig. 2 B). It is interesting to note that the activity of the conditioned medium was not abolished suggesting that a soluble LIF-related cytokine is also secreted by preadipocytes. In control experiments, the anti-LIF antibody was efficient to abolish activity of 0.4 ng/ml LIF when added to basal medium (not shown). LIF and LIF-like factors were specifically expressed at the preadipose stage as no activity was detected in medium conditioned by mature adipocytes (not shown). This result is in agreement with Fig. 1 showing that expression of LIF-D is inhibited in fully differentiated cells. Taken together these results show that LIF and LIF receptor expression are differentially regulated during adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that this pathway plays a regulatory role in adipogenesis. This hypothesis was further investigated. The effect of LIF on differentiation of Ob1771 preadipose cells was investigated in a chemically defined medium (17Gaillard D. Négrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) is a late marker of adipocyte differentiation that faithfully reflects cells containing triacylglycerol (17Gaillard D. Négrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure to LIF elicited a 20-fold increase in the specific activity of GPDH (Fig. 3) and the appearance of adipocyte-like cells (Fig. 4). The adipogenic effect of LIF was not unique to Ob1771 cells as a positive effect of LIF on differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes was observed (Fig. 3). LIF also induced adipocyte differentiation of BRL49653-treated multipotent MEF, indicating that the adipogenic effect of LIF is not restricted to clonal preadipose cell lines (Fig. 3). The effect of LIF was then investigated as a function of exposure time. Exposure of Ob1771 cells to LIF from day 0 to 3 induced a 6-fold increase of GPDH activity, and exposure from day 0 to 7 was sufficient to achieve maximal response at day 11. In contrast, exposure after day 7 was ineffective (Fig. 3, lower panel). This observation suggests that LIF exerts its adipogenic effects by acting at an early step in the differentiation process, i.e. at the preadipose stage, which in turn dictates terminal events. Chronic exposure of Ob1771 cells to low concentration of the thiazolidinedione BRL49653 (20 nm), a PPARγ ligand (3Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 29Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar), promoted adipocyte differentiation to a low extent. However, LIF addition to the thiazolidinedione-treated preadipose cells led to a dramatic increase in adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 3, lower panel and Fig. 4). Thus, LIF and PPARγ appear to stimulate differentiation in a synergistic manner. Cross-talk between LIF signaling and PPARγ activation remains to be elucidated.Figure 4Photomicrographic record of Ob1771 cells. Cells were maintained for 11 days in the indicated conditions (magnification, × 100).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The LIF receptor antagonist hLIF05 was used to determine whether LIF receptor and LIF secreted by preadipocytes play a role during adipocyte differentiation. At the concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, hLIF05 had no toxic effect but inhibited adipocyte differentiation enhanced by 10 ng/ml LIF (not shown). As shown in Fig.5, when hLIF05 was added during BRL49653-induced differentiation of Ob1771 cells in serum-free medium (no exogenous addition of LIF), the level of GPDH activity was reduced to 56 ± 7%. Another approach was used to examine the requirement of LIF receptor during the development of adipose cells as we have recently determined culture conditions that favor the commitment of ES cells into the adipocyte lineage (18Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolin S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model provides a valuable in vitro system for studying the role of genes active during adipocyte differentiation. The role of LIF and LIF receptor was addressed by investigating whether embryoid bodies derived from lif−/− ES cells (20Dani C. Chambers I. Johnstone S. Robertson M. Ebrahimi-Chahardahcherik B. Saito M. Taga T. Li M. Burdon T. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or lifr−/− ES cells 2M. Li and A. G. Smith, submitted for publication. were able to undergo adipocyte differentiation. These mutant cells have been generated by gene targeting via two rounds of homologous recombination. LIF-null ES cells underwent adipogenesis with comparable efficiency to wild-type ES cells, as determined by the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. This result was in agreement with studies of LIF mutant mice, which indicated also that a lack of LIF expression did not prevent the development of adipose tissue (not shown). Likely, both in vitro and in vivo, LIF-related cytokines such as IL-6, CT-1, or CNTF could compensate for the lack of LIF. Therefore, the phenotype of LIF receptor-null ES cells was investigated. As previously reported (24Yoshida K. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A.G. Saito M. Yasukawa K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), propagation of pluripotent ES cells can be maintained by addition of gp130-activating cytokines. Therefore, pluripotent lifr−/− ES cells were maintained by addition of IL-6 together with soluble IL-6 receptor. These cells are responsive to IL-6/sIL-6R but are unresponsive to LIF, CT-1, or CNTF, which act through the LIF receptor-gp130 complex (20Dani C. Chambers I. Johnstone S. Robertson M. Ebrahimi-Chahardahcherik B. Saito M. Taga T. Li M. Burdon T. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The capacity of LIF receptor-deficient ES cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation was dramatically reduced. Only 5–7% of outgrowths derived from two independent clones of LIF receptor-deficient ES cells contained adipocyte colonies compared with 55–70% of outgrowths derived from wild-type ES cells. The lifr+/− cells displayed an intermediate phenotype (Fig.6 A). The lower levels of expression of adipocyte-specific genes such as PPARγ and a-FABP in mutant cells compared with wild-type and heterozygotes were consistent with a suppression of terminal differentiation (Fig. 6 B). Cardiomyocytes beating cells were detectable in wild-type and mutant cultures (not shown) and transcripts for myogenin, a skeletal muscle-specific marker, as well as for α chain 2 of type VI collagen (A2COL6), a gene preferentially expressed by mesenchymal cells (30Ibrahimi A. Bertrand B. Bardon S. Amri E.-Z. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Dani C. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Marvulli D. Volpin D. Bressan G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were present at similar levels in the three cell types (Fig. 5 B). These observations indicate that the reduction of adipogenesis of LIF receptor-deficient ES cells did not reflect a general defect of these cells to undergo differentiation. Moreover, addition of IL-6 together with the soluble IL-6 receptor from day 7 to day 20 after embryoid formation, which corresponds to the permissive period for terminal differentiation (18Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolin S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), restored the capacity of LIF receptor-null cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation and to express adipocyte-specific genes (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). These results indicate that LIF receptor plays a critical role in the process of terminal differentiation of preadipose cells into adipose cells derived from ES cells. Thus, detailed studies of LIF effects and the transducing machinery were undertaken.Figure 6Inability of LIF receptor-deficient ES cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation in vitro. A, embryoid bodies derived from wild-type and mutant ES cells were induced to undergo adipocyte differentiation. Twenty days after embryoid body formation the percentage of outgrowths showing adipocyte colonies was scored. Number of outgrowths (no), number of independent clones (ncl) checked, and number of experiments (ne) performed are, respectively, lifr+/+, no = 334, ncl = 3, ne = 4; lifr+/−, no = 254, ncl = 1, ne = 3; lifr−/−, no = 609, ncl = 2, ne = 3. B, total RNAs prepared from 20-old-day outgrowths were analyzed by Northern blotting for the expression of the indicated genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The C/EBβ and C/EBPδ transcription factors are expressed at the preadipose stage of the differentiation program. Although these trans-acting factors play a critical role in adipocyte differentiation, the nature of the extracellular factors that regulate their early expression is poorly known. Therefore, the regulation of C/EBP gene expression by LIF was investigated in Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A preadipose cells. As shown in Fig. 7, a dramatic increase in C/EBPδ expression in response to LIF was observed. This induction was rapid and transient as C/EBPδ transcript accumulation peaked within 1 h and decreased to basal level within 24 h. Similar kinetics were observed for C/EBPβ gene expression, although the stimulation remained lower due to a higher basal level at time 0. The accumulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ RNAs by LIF was followed by an increase in C/EBP proteins. Accumulation of C/EBP proteins was detectable after 1 h, extended until 8 h, and disappeared 15 h after LIF addition (Fig. 7, lower panel). Not unexpectedly, the LIF receptor antagonist hLIF05 at 0.1 to 1 μg/ml abolished completely the stimulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ by 10 ng/ml LIF but did not abolish that induced by 10 ng/ml IL-6 (not shown). This observation is consistent with the inhibition of adipogenesis by hLIF05 within the same range of concentrations (Fig.5). Addition of LIF to 3T3-F442A preadipose cells induced activation of p42 MAPK as determined by a decrease in electrophoretic mobility (Fig.8). The level of activation was maximal after 10 min and returned to basal levels after 25 min. A similar response was observed for activation of p44 MAPK, whereas no activation of p38 MAPK and Jun kinase was detectable (not shown). Preincubation of preadipose cells with the specific MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059 (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) prevented induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (Fig.9 A). This effect could not be mimicked by preincubation of cells with an inhibitor of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide (not sho"

Consequently, there is reason to believe that inhibitors directed against target reactions in surface glycoconjugate assembly may provide viable alternate therapeutic approaches. However, bacterial cell surface glycoconjugates show remarkable structural diversity due to variations of the sugar components, linkages, and substitutions. A successful strategy requires identification of enzymes and pathways unique to bacteria, yet present within a wide spectrum of bacterial species. One such target is the synthesis of the activated form ofl-rhamnose, dTDP1-l-rhamnose.l-Rhamnose is found in polysaccharides from strains of important human pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Burkholderia, and streptococci, as well as in plant-associated bacteria including Xanthomonas and Rhizobium. The primary structures of many of these glycoconjugates have been reported (see the Complex Carbohydrate Structure Data base). l-Rhamnose is also found in many surface layer glycoproteins from Bacillaceae (1Messner P. Sleytr U.B. Messner P. Pum D. Sára M. Crystalline Bacterial Cell Surface Proteins. R. G. Landes Comp./Academic Press, Inc., Austin, TX1996: 35-76Google Scholar), in the linkage unit that joins the mycolylarabinogalactan complex to peptidoglycan in mycobacteria (2McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and in some mycobacterial glycopeptidolipids (3Mills J.A. McNeil M.R. Belisle J.T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4803-4808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of gene data bases also indicates the presence of the structural genes for enzymes involved in dTDP-l-rhamnose synthesis in strains where the rhamnose-containing structure is not necessarily resolved, for example, in Enterococcus faecalis (4Xu Y.

The pathway for the biosynthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose from glucose 1-phosphate and thymidine triphosphate was proposed in the early 1960's by Glaser and Kornfeld (6Kornfeld S. Glaser L. J. Biol.

Recently, the first two enzymes in the pathway, glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) (11Lindquist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) (12Stein A. Kula M.-R. Elling L. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were analyzed in detail. Overexpressed gene products were used for enzymatic synthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose and dTDP-l-rhamnose with varying yield (12Stein A. Kula M.-R. Elling L. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Marumo K. Lindqvist L. Verma N. Weintraub A. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although RmlC and D are required for the conversion of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose to dTDP-l-rhamnose, the definitive assignment of individual activities has not been done, and the mechanism has not been elucidated. This is a clear limitation for studies where inhibitor development is the ultimate goal. In this report we describe the purification, characterization, and unequivocal assignment of dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase (RmlC) and dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase (RmlD) using the overexpressed enzymes from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2. The following reaction scheme for the conversion of dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose to dTDP-l-rhamnose by RmlC and D is proposed (ReactionFR1). Thymidine monophosphate (dTMP), thymidine diphosphate (dTDP), thymidine triphosphate (dTTP), dTDP-d-glucose, CDP-d-glucose, UDP-d-glucose, ADP-d-glucose, GDP-d-glucose, NADH, NADP+, NAD+, dithiothreitol, glucose 1-phosphate, and Cibacron blue-Sepharose CL-4B were obtained from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka GmbH, Vienna, Austria). NADPH was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Mono Q HR 5/5, phenyl-Superose HR 5/5, DEAE-Sephacel, and Sephadex G-10 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Bio-Gel HT was from Bio-Rad (Vienna, Austria). Nucleotide-activated sugars were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column by the method of Köplin et al. (14Köplin R. Brisson J.-R. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4121-4128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Monosaccharides were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column as described previously (15Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Res. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Determination of the molecular weight of native proteins was done on a UltroPac TSK G3000SW column (LKB, 7.5 × 300 mm) in 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. Bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000), and RNase A (13,700) were used as reference proteins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using slight modifications (16Messner P. Hollaus F. Sleytr U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1984; 34: 202-210Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) of the original method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed in 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer at pH 7.0. The resolving gels contained 12.5%, and the stacking gels 5% polyacrylamide (3% cross-linking). Ammonium persulfate and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine were removed by prerunning gels at 200 V for 1 h with two changes of Tris/citrate buffer. Electrophoresis was performed using a constant voltage (200 V) at 10 °C for 4 h. Gels were silver-stained using a method described elsewhere (18Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed at 25 °C in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer and at excitation and emission wavelengths as indicated. Radioactivity counting was done in Ultima Gold liquid scintillation mixture (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) on a Packard Tri-Carb 1900 CA liquid scintillation counter. Plasmids were routinely maintained in Escherichia coli DH5α (K-12 F− ϕ80d lacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17 (rK− mK−)supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169) (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For enzyme overexpression, E. coli BL21 (λDE3) (F− ompT hsdSB(rB− mB−)gal dcm (λDE3); Novagen, Madison, WI) was used. All strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Media were supplemented, where required, with kanamycin (Km; 30 μg/ml). Cultures were grown at 37 °C with or without agitation. DNA sequence for the complete rfb gene cluster from S. enterica strain LT2 was obtained from the GenBank (Ref.8Jiang X.M. Neal B. Santiago F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar; accession number X56793). The order of the dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthesis genes is rmlBDAC. The four open reading frames were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to introduce a unique Nco I or Nde I site (underlined below) overlapping the initiating ATG codon. A downstream Sst I site was introduced to facilitate cloning of the amplified fragment. Primers were synthesized with the following sequences at the Guelph Molecular Supercentre: RMLB1(forward), 5′-TGGAATAGAAccaTGgAGATACTT-3′ (Nco I); RMLB2 (reverse), 5′-TTACTgAgcTCACCGCAAAACTCTT-3′ (Sst I); RMLD1 (forward), 5′-GAAGGACGCCAcatATGAATATCTT-3′ (Nde I); RMLD2 (reverse), 5′-TTgAgcTCCATTTCTCATTCATAGA-3′ (Sst I); RMLA1 (forward), 5′-AGAAATGcAtATGAAAACGCGTAAG-3′ (Nde I); RMLA2 (reverse), 5′-TTTgagCTCTAAGATCAAGACATCT-3′ (Sst I); RMLC1 (forward), 5′-AGGTTTAcAtaTGATGATTGTGATT-3′ (Nde I); RMLC2 (reverse), 5′-TTCgagCTCTCTACCGGAAAATTCA-3′ (Sst I). Lowercase letters indicate nucleotides introduced to construct appropriate restriction sites (in parentheses); the restriction sites are underlined. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed using a GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Chromosomal DNA from S. enterica LT2 (1 μg/μl) was obtained from Dr. Wendy J. Keenleyside. For the amplification reactions, 2.5 units of Pwo I DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5 μg of template DNA, 200 μmol of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 25 μmol of the corresponding synthetic nucleotide primers were used. Twenty cycles were used. Optimal MgSO4 concentration and reaction temperatures and times were individually determined for each polymerase chain reaction product. The product sizes for rmlA (943 base pairs), rmlB (1, 222 base pairs), rmlC (627 base pairs), and rmlD (966 base pairs) were those predicted from their respective nucleotide sequences. The amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases, according to the manufacturer's recommendations and cloned in plasmids pET-28a(+) (rmlB) or pET-30a(+) (rmlA,C,D) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The procedures for manipulation of DNA and for ligation were those described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrotransformations of E. coli DH5α and BL21 (λDE3) were performed using published protocols (21Binotto J. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson P.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1991; 37: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Transformants were selected on LB/Km plates. Plasmids were column-purified using QIAGEN spin columns (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. The sequence of each cloned rml gene was determined and confirmed to be identical to the authentic chromosomal copy. Plasmid DNA sequencing was performed by automated sequencing at the Guelph Molecular Supercentre. Nucleotide and protein sequences were analyzed using online analysis tools, including BLAST (Basic local alignment search tool; Ref. 22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) and Clustal W 1.6 (Refs. 23Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar and 24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56228) Google Scholar) using default parameter settings. For protein family analysis and motif analysis, the Prosite data base (25Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) was used. The pET vector-based constructs place the cloned rml genes under the control of a T7-promoter. For overexpression of the rml gene products, an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase is supplied by the host, E. coli BL21 (λDE3). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of E. coli BL21 (λDE3) transformed with pET constructs carrying each rml gene, led to expression of RmlA, RmlB, RmlC, and RmlD as the predominant proteins in the induced cultures. For large-scale enzyme preparations, up to 500 ml of LB/Km medium was inoculated with 1% of an overnight culture and cultivated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. After 3 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubation was continued for 3 h. The bacterial cells were then collected by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Before sonication, the buffer was adjusted by addition of dithiothreitol and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively. Sonication on ice was carried out 6 times for 10 s with intervals of 20 s. Large debris were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell-free supernatants were carefully removed and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a Ti 70.1 rotor in a Beckman LE-80 ultracentrifuge. Supernatants were stored at −20 °C following addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 44%. Glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.24, RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.46, RmlB) activities were assayed as described by Kornfeld and Glaser (6Kornfeld S. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1791-1794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Vara and Hutchinson (26Vara J.A. Hutchinson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14992-14995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The specific assay for determination of RmlC typically contained 45 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 9 mmMgCl2, 0.18 mmdTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose, 0.072 mm NAD(P)H, a 20-fold molar excess of RmlD for determination of RmlC, and an appropriate volume of RmlC in a total volume of 550 μl. Assays for RmlD were done using a similar reaction mixture but incorporating a 100-fold molar excess of RmlC. Time absorption plots were recorded at 25 °C in a Beckman DU65 spectrophotometer or a Hitachi U-2010 spectrophotometer. Enzyme activities were calculated from the linear decrease of the absorption at 340 nm. Assays with low amounts of NAD(P)H were analyzed in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer with an excitation at 340 nm and recording emission at 460 nm. One unit of RmlC or RmlD activity refers to 1 μmol of NAD(P)H consumption per minute using these assay conditions. Controls without addition of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose, or enzyme, were analyzed by the same procedure. For determination of the thermodynamic equilibrium constants of the reaction described in reaction steps 3 and 4, the reverse reaction starting from dTDP-l-rhamnose was used. Assays contained 0.05 to 0.18 mm dTDP-l-rhamnose, 0.03 to 0.4 mm NAD+, 0.16 μm RmlD in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or 50 mmethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 9.0. The assays were performed with, and without, addition of RmlC (0.6 μm). Equilibrium constants were calculated as: Keq,RmlD = [NAD+][dTDP-l-rhamnose]/[NADH][dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo -4-hexulose][H+] and Keq,RmlD × Keq,RmlC = [NAD+][dTDP-l-rhamnose]/[NADH][dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose][H+]. For determination of the pH dependence of enzyme activity, RmlC and RmlD were assayed in different buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 11.0 (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5–8.5, and 50 mm ethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 8.5–11.0) without addition of MgCl2. To determine the profile of enzyme stability versus pH, enzymes were diluted in various buffers (potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5–8.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Residual activities were determined at pH 7.0 after exchange of the buffer. Measurements of kinetic data were performed using the spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric assays described above. The kinetic constants, Km and kcat, where Km is the apparent Michaelis constant and kcat is the turnover number, were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the equation (27Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar),v=νmax[A]/(Km+[A])Equation 1 using the program Sigma Plot (Jandel, Erkrath, Germany).kcat (1/s) was calculated from the maximum initial velocity vmax (μmol/(liter·s)) as,νmax=kcatEEquation 2 where E is the total enzyme concentration (μmol/liter). A molecular mass of 20.6 and 32.6 kDa was used for RmlC and RmlD, respectively. For RmlC, the initial velocities were recorded for the concentration range 0.036 to 0.36 mmdTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose. The RmlC concentration was 16.6 nm and RmlD was used in 20-fold molar excess. For RmlD, NADH and NADPH concentrations were 0.0015 to 0.109 mm and dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose concentration was 0.18 mm. The RmlD concentration was 7.5 nm and RmlC was used in 100-fold molar excess. Activities at NAD(P)H concentrations below 0.01 mm were measured spectrofluorometrically. For the analysis of the reaction mechanism of RmlD the concentrations of NADPH and dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose were varied between 0.007 and 0.11 mm, and 0.091 and 0.36 mm, respectively. The experimental data were fit to,v=νmax[NADH][hexulose]kIKm,hexulose+Km,NADH[hexulose]+Km,hexulose[NADH]+[NADH][hexulose]Equation 3 for a sequential reaction mechanism (27Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar, 28Segel I.W. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). For an ordered mechanism, kI represents the dissociation constant of the first substrate. The correlation coefficients of nonlinear regression were usually 0.98 or better. Variance analysis and other statistics provided by the program showed that Equation 3 adequately fits the data. To prevent oxidative damage of proteins during the purification process, all buffers contained 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions were collected on ice. Cell-free lysates were applied to a Bio-Gel HT column (1.6 × 10 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Proteins were eluted using the following gradient: 0–20 ml, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8; 20–100 ml, 0–100% 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Two-ml fractions were collected. Fractions showing enzyme activity eluted at approximately 0.06 m potassium phosphate and these were combined and adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate. Pooled enzyme fractions from step 1 were applied to phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the following gradient: 0–10 ml, 1 m ammonium sulfate; 10–30 ml: 1–0 mammonium sulfate. One-ml fractions were analyzed for enzyme activity. Enzymatically active fractions eluted at 0.2 m ammonium sulfate and these were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against several exchanges of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. The enzyme preparation from step 2 was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by the following gradient: 0–10 ml, 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7; 10–30 ml, 0 to 0.5 m KCl. Fractions showing enzyme activity eluted at 0.28 m KCl. These were combined, adjusted to 44% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C until use. The purified RmlC enzyme preparation (86% yield; approximately 12.5 mg/liter culture) showed a specific activity of approximately 21 units/mg. Cell-free Lysates—Cell-free lysates (stored without addition of glycerol) were diluted 1:1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, and up to 10-ml aliquots were applied to a Cibacron blue-Sepharose CL-4B column (1.5 × 5 cm) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 50% ethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, and 0.3 m KCl in the same buffer. Most of the proteins in the lysate did not bind to the matrix, while RmlD was absorbed and subsequently eluted in 1.5 mm KCl. The active fractions were dialyzed overnight as described. This was performed as described above. RmlD eluted at 0.14 m KCl. The purified RmlD enzyme preparation (70% yield; approximately 20 mg/liter culture) showed a specific activity of approximately 44 units/mg. Reaction mixtures for synthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose (12Stein A. Kula M.-R. Elling L. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Marumo K. Lindqvist L. Verma N. Weintraub A. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) contained approximately 20 μmol of dTDP-d-glucose and 2 units of RmlB in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. Incubation was performed at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of absolute ethanol and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The product was desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.5 × 120 cm), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until use. UV spectroscopy at 320 nm performed in 0.1m NaOH was used to determine concentration of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose. Quantitation is based on the characteristic absorption of the 4-keto group. Following reduction with NaBH4 and hydrolysis, the monosaccharides obtained from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed electrochemical detection (HPAEC/PED) (15Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Res. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For synthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose, 1 μmol dTDP-d-glucose was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with 1 unit each of RmlB and RmlC in 500 μl of 30 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 30 min. The enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration and the reaction mixture containing both dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose was desalted as described above. The amount of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose in the resulting preparation was determined by conversion to dTDP-l-rhamnose in the presence of RmlD and spectrofluorometric measurement of the decrease of NADH. Direct proof for the presence of free dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose was obtained by reducing the 4-keto group with NaB[3H]4 (100 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Following hydrolysis and HPAEC/PED of the resulting monosaccharides, fractions (0.25 ml) were analyzed for radioactivity. dTDP-l-rhamnose was synthesized from dTDP-d-glucose using RmlB, RmlC, and RmlD in the presence of low amounts of NAD+. NADH was regenerated using NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (ASA Spezialenzyme GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). A typical reaction mixture contained 20 μmol of dTDP-d-glucose, 1 μmol of NAD+, 100 μmol of ammonium formate, 1 unit of each RmlB, RmlC, and RmlD, and 3.5 units of formate dehydrogenase in a total volume of 5 ml of 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. After reaction at 25 °C for 2 h, proteins were removed by ultrafiltration in an Amicon model 8050 cell using a Millipore PLGC 10-kDa ultrafiltration membrane. dTDP-l-rhamnose was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column as described previously (15Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Res. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and desalted as described above. Isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside-induction of E. coli BL21 (λDE3) cells, transformed with pET-derivatives carrying each of the rmlABCD genes, led to expression of RmlA, RmlB, RmlC, and RmlD as the predominant proteins in the induced cultures (Fig. 1). Limited amounts of these proteins were also present in the noninduced cultures (not shown). The majority of each Rml protein was found in the cell-free supernatant fraction. This, together with their activities (see below), indicates that these proteins are located in the cytoplasm. The residual amounts of RmlC and RmlD were sedimented during removal of cellular debris from the ultrasonicated cell lysate. Electron microscopy of ultrathin-sectioned intact cells confirmed formation of inclusion bodies (not shown), presumably containing the enzyme confined to the particulate fraction. Since sufficient amounts of soluble protein was obtained, inclusion bodies were not pursued further for protein purification. The expressed Rml enzymes showed in SDS-PAGE apparent molecular masses of 31.8, 42.9, 23.4, and 34.8 kDa, respectively. These values correspond closely to the predicted translation products based upon available nucleotide sequence data (32.5, 40.7, 20.6, and 32.6 kDa, respectively) (8Jiang X.M. Neal B. Santiago F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). By gel permeation chromatography on an UltroPac TSK G3000SW column, the native molecular mass of RmlC was determined to be 40.6 kDa. This is consistent with RmlC forming a dimer (calculated molecular mass = 41.2 kDa). The molecular mass of RmlD, determined on a silica column was 41.5 kDa, a value inconsistent with the calculated molecular mass for either the monomer (32.6 kDa), or the dimer (65.2 kDa). The aberrant molecular mass estimated for RmlD may result from interactions between RmlD and the chromatographic resin. For example, the hydrophobic protein chymotrypsinogen A has been shown to bind tightly to silica matrices resulting in retarded elution and accordingly a lower apparent mol"

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The dependence of stable DNA replication on recombination proteins and the likelihood that replication initiation during stable DNA replication occurred at either D loops or R loops (5Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that all of the phenotypes elaborated in priA null mutant strains resulted from a failure of replication forks to assemble at these structures (2Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proposal was consistent with the ability of PriA to direct the assembly of a ϕX174-type primosome at specialized DNA sequences called primosome assembly sites (PAS)1 (6Marians K.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 153-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primosomes are an essential part of the replication fork apparatus, providing both the DNA unwinding function and the Okazaki fragment-priming function (7Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). McGlynn et al. (8McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PriA could indeed recognize and bind specifically to D loops. We showed in the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that PriA exhibited two modes of specific DNA recognition. Binding to double-stranded (ds) DNAs carrying 3′-single-stranded (ss) extensions of at least 12 nucleotides (nt) presumably reflected the 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity of the protein (10Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 24: 8345-8349Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas binding to D loops reflected the ability of PriA to bind to bent DNA at three strand junctions. Replication fork assembly in simple terms requires that all the necessary catalytic activities, DNA helicase, primase, and DNA polymerase, have access to a specific point on the DNA. Generally, this occurs at an origin of replication, such as oriC in E. coli (7Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A temporal imperative is imposed as well because a protein-protein interaction between DnaB, the replication fork helicase, and the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme must be established for proper replication fork formation (12Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This, in turn, requires that binding of the polymerase to the primer for the nascent leading strand occur at roughly the same time that the primosome assembles. If these events are not coordinated properly, the primosome may move away from the polymerase before the required protein-protein interaction is established. If replication forks do form at D loops, clearly primosome assembly must proceed efficiently and rapidly so that the DnaB-τ interaction is established with holoenzyme that binds to the 3′-end of the invading strand. Primosome assembly occurs in discrete steps at a PAS sequence (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar): (i) PriA recognizes and binds to the PAS, (ii) PriB joins PriA to form a PriA-PriB-PAS DNA complex, (iii) DnaT then joins this complex to form a triprotein complex on the PAS DNA, and (iv) DnaB is then transferred from a DnaB-DnaC complex in solution to the PriA-PriB-DnaT-PAS DNA complex to form a preprimosome consisting of PriA, PriB, DnaT, and DnaB on the DNA. Complete primosome assembly occurs when DnaG adds to this complex by virtue of a protein-protein interaction with DnaB (14Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We know that PriC is also present in the preprimosome and primosome when they are formed on large DNAs, but we have not been able to define the step at which it is added to the complex (15Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have investigated primosome formation on D loops composed of synthetic oligonucleotides. We were able to detect formation of a stable PriA-PriB-DnaT complex by gel mobility shift analysis. However, unlike the case where a 300-nt long ssDNA carrying the ϕX174 PAS was used as the substrate (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we could not detect any higher order complexes when DnaB and DnaC were added to the reaction. We therefore used DNA footprinting with both deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and S1 nuclease as probes. A specific complex could be detected between PriA and the D loop DNA, but no evidence of higher order complexes was obtained. Unwinding of one end of the D loop, which required all the primosomal proteins, however, could be detected as a result of changes in the sensitivity of the DNA substrate to S1 nuclease in the presence of ATP. Thus, we conclude that a complete preprimosome could be assembled on D loop DNA. This is consistent with our demonstration that replication forks can assemble and extend the invading strand in a D loop in a primosomal protein-, single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB)-, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme-dependent manner (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PriA, PriB, DnaT, DnaB, and DnaC were prepared as described by Marians (17Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DNA substrates were prepared as described in the accompanying article (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift analysis was as described in Liu et al. (18Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 4 °C), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 nm 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA substrate, either 200 μm CaCl2 (for DNase I cleavage) or 200 μm ZnCl2 (for S1 nuclease cleavage), or no, 5 μm, or 1 mm ATP as indicated, and the primosomal proteins as indicated, were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Either DNase I (0.4 unit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or S1 nuclease (1 unit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added and the incubation continued for an additional 1 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 30 mmand 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. DNA products were ethanol precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m NaOAc and resuspended in 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA. The cleavage products were analyzed by electrophoresis at 20 watts for 2 h through 12% polyacrylamide gels (30 cm × 16 cm × 0.45 mm) (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 50% (w/v) urea using 50 mm Tris, 40 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The lower chamber was made 250 mm in NaOAc to compress the spacing between bands in the lower part of the gel. Gels were dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and autoradiographed. Maxam-Gilbert sequence ladders were prepared as described (19Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). We have been able to analyze each step of primosome assembly on the ϕX174 PAS sequence using gel mobility shift analysis (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore used the same approach initially in an attempt to detect a similar ordered assembly of the primosome on D loop DNA. The bubble and D loop used here have been described in detail in the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The top and bottom strands are composed of 82-nt long oligonucleotides (oligos) that have a central noncomplementary region of 42 nt. When annealed together, these two oligos form the bubble DNA. To form the D loop DNA, a 42-nt long invading strand is annealed to the top strand of the bubble. As elaborated in the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the bubble is composed of oligonucleotides 1 and 2L, with the top strand being oligo 1. The invading strand in the D loop is oligo 5S. As demonstrated previously (8McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and in the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), PriA was capable of forming a stable complex with D loop, but not bubble, DNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). No change was detected in the mobility of the protein-DNA complex formed when PriB was also included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Similar results were observed in our analysis of primosome assembly on the ϕX174 PAS sequence (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In that investigation, the presence of the PriA-PriB-PAS DNA complex was only revealed by Western analysis. Because PriB is a small protein (20Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mass added to the complex is insufficient to cause a detectable change in mobility. Although we have not performed a similar Western analysis here, the fact that we can detect a PriA-PriB-DnaT complex specific for D loop DNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) argues that the PriA-PriB-D loop DNA complex does form. As in the case where PAS DNA was used as a substrate (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), formation of the PriA-PriB-DnaT-D loop DNA complex did not require ATP (data not shown). With PAS DNA as a substrate, addition of DnaB and DnaC to the PriA-PriB-DnaT-PAS DNA complex in the presence of 10 μmATP resulted in the appearance of a new complex that contained the later three proteins as well as DnaB (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, this was not observed with D loop DNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). Whereas this could be taken as indicating that a preprimosome did not assemble on the D loop DNA, other interpretations were possible. The PAS and D loop DNA substrates are distinct in that the PAS DNA is nominally single-stranded, with no duplex region that can be unwound, whereas the D loop DNA has two duplex regions. Thus, even though the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B was not performed in the presence of an ATP concentration high enough to effect primosome-catalyzed DNA unwinding (21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered that the structure itself might be destabilizing, preventing detection of primosome complex formation by an assay that has slow time resolution such as gel mobility shift analysis. We therefore turned to DNA footprinting techniques to assess the possibility of primosome assembly at D loops. Because the bubble and D loop DNA contained regions of both duplex and single-stranded DNA, we used two different probes in the footprinting reactions, DNase I, to detect interactions with dsDNA, and S1 nuclease, to detect interactions with ssDNA. As shown, for example, in Figs.2 and 6, the expected specificity was observed: DNase I only digested regions of the D loop and bubble that, based on the nucleotide sequence (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), should have been duplex, whereas S1 nuclease only digested regions of these DNAs that were predicted to be single-stranded based on the nucleotide sequence (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Figure 6Primosomal protein-catalyzed unwinding of the left-hand side of the D loop as observed on the top strand. Standard DNA footprinting reaction mixtures containing D loop DNA labeled on the top strand, either 5 μm ATP (lanes 4–8) or 1 mm ATP (lane 9), 26 nm PriA, 15 nm PriB, 28 nm DnaT, 32 nm DnaB, and 32 nm DnaC, as indicated, and either DNase I (panel A) or S1 nuclease (panel B) were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Maxam-Gilbert (lanes 1–3) sequence ladders are of the top strand. pp, this reaction mixture contained PriA, PriB, DnaT, DnaB, and DnaC. Correspondence of the Maxam-Gilbert sequence ladder to the sequence of oligo dlp1 is indicated on the left-hand side of the panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA substrates were used that were 5′-end-labeled on either the top or bottom strand. As predicted from the gel mobility shift analysis, no interaction could be detected between PriA and the bubble DNA (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 5, and Fig. 5). On the other hand, PriA gave a complicated footprint on the D loop DNA (Figs. 2, A and B, lanes 8, and 6). Both the top and bottom strand of the left-hand flanking duplex region were protected from DNase I digestion. Protection on the top strand started 14 nt from the 5′-end and extended into the duplex region formed by the top strand and the invading strand. Protection on the bottom strand started 6 nt from the 3′-end and extended for about 10 nt, but did not enter the single-stranded region of the displaced strand. This positioned PriA at the left-hand three-strand junction of the D loop. This is consistent with the preference observed by gel mobility shift analysis for PriA binding to three-strand junctions with 5′-single-stranded tails (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the duplex DNA formed by the top and invading strands, alternating regions of protection and enhancement of cleavage could be observed. Although not perfectly so, these alternating regions showed a periodicity of about one turn of the helix (Fig. 2, A, lane 5, and Fig. 6). The addition of PriB and DnaT improved the protection of the left-hand flanking region of the top strand and altered subtly the pattern observed in the duplex formed by the top strand and the invading strand. Several enhanced protections (nt T44, G45, and G54) and a new enhanced cleavage site (nt G35) could be observed (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 9). This is consistent with the ability to observe a stable PriA-PriB-DnaT-D loop DNA complex by gel mobility shift analysis. A similar pattern of alternating protection and enhanced cleavage was observed when DNase I was used to probe the interaction of PriA with the invading strand (Fig. 3, lane 2). Here the affected region was smaller (32 nt), but the regions of protection and enhancement were reflected directly across the helical axis from the top strand (Fig. 5). As was observed with labeled top strand, the addition of PriB and DnaT only altered the observed pattern slightly, resulting in increased protection at the 3′-end of the invading strand (Fig. 3, lane 3). In the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) we demonstrated two modes of PriA binding to DNA, one in which the protein bound to duplex DNA with 3′-single-stranded extensions and one that presumably reflected binding to a D loop where the protein bound to bent DNA at three strand junctions. In order to determine whether the striking pattern of alternating protection and enhancement of cleavage observed when PriA bound the D loop was particular to one or the other mode of PriA binding to DNA, we examined the footprint of PriA on dsDNA with a 3′-single-stranded extension (Fig.4). In order to facilitate analysis of interactions at the 3′-end of the top strand, we included a 5′-single-stranded extension past the duplex region so that DNase I cleavages at the intersection of the 3′-single-stranded tail and the dsDNA would fall in an easily readable section of the gel. The pattern of alternating protection and enhancement observed on both the top and invading strand of the D loop was not evident (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 5). Protection on the top strand of the duplex extended back about 14 nt from the single-stranded tail. Protection on the bottom strand, although weaker, appeared to extend back about 25 nt from the 3′-end. No enhanced cleavages were observed at all. Probing with S1 nuclease indicated that about 7 nt of the 3′-single-stranded tail abutting the dsDNA was also protected by PriA binding (data not shown). Thus, the DNA footprinting reported here supports the conclusion of the accompanying report (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that there are two modes of PriA binding to DNA. Modification of the pattern of DNase I cleavages as a result of PriA binding to the D loop was observed along 58 base pairs of dsDNA formed by the co-helical segments of the duplex consisting of the top and bottom strands with that of the duplex consisting of the top and invading strands (Fig. 5). This is roughly 200 Å, a very large distance when compared with the 36-Å Stokes radius of PriA (21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests, based on the assumption that one PriA molecule could protect about 70 Å, that there are either multiple molecules of PriA bound per D loop, or that PriA is wrapping the D loop DNA about itself in some manner. PriA is a monomer in solution (22Greenbaum J.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2594-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also not observed any sigmoidicity in the binding isotherms of PriA to either PAS (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or D loop (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) DNA that might suggest dimerization of the protein upon binding. However, we could detect two distinct complexes of PriA bound to PAS DNA that differed by a factor of two in the relative amount of PriA bound (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and quantitative Western blotting of the protein components in primosomes formed on ϕX174 ss(c) DNA suggested a stoichiometry of two PriA molecules per primosome (15Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an alternating pattern of protection from and enhancement of DNase I cleavage is characteristically observed when dsDNA lies on a surface, such as what occurs when DNA is wrapped around a protein. Distinguishing between these two possibilities will require additional investigation. Replication fork assembly at a D loop requires that DnaB, the replication fork helicase (24LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gain access to the DNA. The experiments described in the previous section demonstrate that an intermediate consisting of a PriA-PriB-DnaT complex could be isolated on the D loop. We therefore continued our investigation by adding DnaB and DnaC to the footprinting assays. The combination of DnaB and DnaC alone, without the other primosomal proteins, gave no visible footprint, regardless of whether the top (Fig. 6) or bottom (Fig.7) strand was labeled and whether DNase I (Figs. 6 A, lane 7, and 7 A, lane 4, respectively) or S1 nuclease (Figs. 6 B and 7 B, lanes 7) was used as a probe. Similar results were observed if the invading strand was labeled (data not shown). DnaB can be transferred to ssDNA by DnaC in the presence of ATP (7Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The footprinting experiments described in this section contained 5 μm ATP, which should have been sufficient for these purposes (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Yet, even though no SSB was present to prevent DnaB binding, no footprint was observed. There are several possible reasons for this. The most likely explanation is that DnaB may be binding transiently under these circumstances, leaving the displaced strand quickly because of hydrolysis of ATP. Another alternative is that the DnaB is present on the DNA, but is sliding back and forth rapidly. If this were the case, one might expect a generalized reduction in DNase I sensitivity, but this was also not observed. Finally, it is also possible that there is no binding of DnaB at all under these conditions. There is insufficient evidence to decide between these three alternatives, however, these observations are consistent with our demonstration, reported elsewhere (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), that DnaB and DnaC alone are insufficient to support DNA polymerase III holoenzyme-catalyzed elongation of the invading strand. Footprinting also failed to reveal the presence of a primosome on the D loop. Although this was consistent with our inability to observe a stable primosomal complex by gel mobility shift analysis, it was inconsistent with our ability to observe primosomal protein-dependent replication initiating at a D loop (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Addition of DnaB and DnaC to the PriA-PriB-DnaT-D loop DNA complex did not result in any observable modification to the footprint, regardless of whether the top (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 8) or bottom strand (Fig. 7, A, lane 5, and B, lane 8) was labeled or whether DNase I (Figs. 6 A and 7 A) or S1 nuclease (Figs. 6 B and 7 B) was used as a probe. Again, there were alternative possible explanations for this observation. We rejected the possibility that this implied that a primosome was not forming on the D loop DNA because, as mentioned above, we could observe primosomal protein-dependent replication on a D loop template DNA (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Instead, we considered two alternatives: either the oligonucleotide substrate used was not large enough to support stable binding of a complete primosome or a rearrangement of the disposition of the proteins involved was required for stable primosome assembly and this rearrangement was driven by ATP hydrolysis and thus required higher concentrations of ATP than 5 μm. Accordingly, we performed the footprinting experiments in the presence of 1 mm ATP. Significant changes to the footprints on the D loop could be observed in the presence of PriA, PriB, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and 1 mmATP. On the top strand, the region between T9 and T22 became S1 nuclease-sensitive (Figs. 6, B, lane 9, and 9), as if base pairing with the bottom strand had been lost. Little in the way of consistent changes in the DNase I footprint were observed. Occasionally, a generalized decrease in DNase I sensitivity was observed. However, this was very variable (e.g. compare Fig. 6 A, lane 9, to8 A, lane 5). On the bottom strand, new DNase I-hypersensitive sites became apparent at C13, G14, and T15 as the surrounding nucleotides, T10, G12, and G17 became somewhat less sensitive to DNase I (Figs. 7, A, lane 6, and 9). Consistent with the increased S1 nuclease sensitivity of the left-hand end of the top strand, a similar region, between G64 and A74, on the bottom strand also became S1 nuclease-sensitive (Figs. 7, B, lane 9, and 9).Figure 8D loop unwinding requires assembly of a primosome. Standard DNA footprinting reaction mixtures containing D loop substrate labeled on either the top (panel A) or bottom (panel B) strand, 1 mm ATP, 26 nm PriA, 15 nm PriB, 28 nm DnaT, 32 nm DnaB, and 32 nm DnaC, as indicated, and either DNase I (lanes 1–5) or S1 nuclease (lanes 6–10) were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Correspondence of the cleavage patterns to the sequence of oligos dlp1 and dlp2L are indicated on the right-hand side of panel A and the left-hand side of panel B, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We interpret the conversion of a significant portion of the left-hand flanking duplex region of the D loop from profound S1 nuclease-insensitivity to obvious S1 nuclease-sensitivity as indicating that this region of the substrate had become unwound by the action of the primosomal proteins. Both PriA and DnaB are helicases that could unwind this substrate. Thus, in order to determine whether the observed unwinding was a result of the independent action of the DNA helicases present in the reaction mixture or a result of primosome assembly, we examined the dependence of the unwinding reaction on the presence of all the primosomal proteins. Neither PriA alone (Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 2 and 7, respectively), DnaB in the presence of DnaC (Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 3 and 8, respectively), or the combination of PriA with DnaB and DnaC (Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 4 and 9, respectively) showed the changes to the DNase I and S1 nuclease footprints that were indicative of unwinding of the left-hand duplex region and were obvious when PriB and DnaT were also present with PriA, DnaB, and DnaC in the reaction mixture (Figs. 6, A, lane 9; B, lane 9; 7 B, lane 9; 8 A, lane 5; 8 B, lane 10). Thus, the observed unwinding was neither the result of either PriA or DnaB acting independently nor the result of the two helicases acting independently, but in a concerted manner, one after the other. Instead, we conclude that the unwinding resulted because the helicase activities intrinsic to a primosome that had been assembled on the D loop became activated in the presence of 1 mm ATP. This is consistent with the known ATP requirements for primosome helicase action (21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PriA was discovered originally because of its requirement for conversion of viral ϕX174 DNA to a duplex replicative form in vitro (25Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Schekman R. Weiner J.H. Weiner A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5859-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that this protein initiated the assembly of a protein-DNA complex that primed DNA synthesis of the complementary strand (6Marians K.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 153-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intensive biochemical analysis of this reaction revealed that seven proteins, now called PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG, were involved in assembly of this protein-DNA complex (7Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On ϕX174 DNA coated with SSB, this complex is composed of PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, and DnaG (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is capable of: (i) translocation along ssDNA in either direction (21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) acting as a bidirectional DNA helicase (21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and catalyzing the synthesis of small oligoribonucleotide primers that can be used by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to initiate DNA synthesis (27Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ability to both unwind duplex DNA and synthesize ribonucleotide primers earned this complex the name of “primosome” (27Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and illuminated an economical solution to the requirements for unwinding the duplex template DNA and providing primers for Okazaki fragment synthesis during chromosomal replication. Currently, the term primosome now applies to any protein or multiprotein complex that is capable of providing both DNA unwinding and Okazaki fragment-priming functions at a replication fork and the one discussed specifically in this report is referred to as the ϕX-type primosome (7Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ϕX-type primosome is capable of participating in replication fork assembly in vitro (28Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the replication of a number of plasmid DNAs, such as pBR322 (29Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But four (PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT) of the seven proteins are not required for replication initiating at oriC (30Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the bacterial chromosome origin of replication. The three ϕX-type primosomal proteins required for chromosomal DNA replication, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG (30Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), all have very specific functions: DnaB is the replication fork DNA helicase (24LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DnaC is required for the efficient transfer of DnaB to DNA (31Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and DnaG is the primase for Okazaki fragment synthesis (32Bouche J.-P. Zechel K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5995-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been unclear as to the role, if any, of PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT during chromosomal replication. Genetic investigations of the phenotypes of priA null mutations suggested a role for this protein in the cell. These strains were constitutively induced for the SOS response (1Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were defective in homologous recombination (2Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both induced and constitutive stable DNA replication (4Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K.-I. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the repair of UV-damaged DNA (2Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and double-strand DNA breaks (3Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of D loops and R loops as initiating structures for the two forms of stable DNA replication (5Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and the key role of a D loop during initiation of homologous recombination (34Smith G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also required to initiate repair of double-strand breaks (35Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1981; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), led to the proposal that all these phenotypes resulted from a failure, in priA null strains, of replication forks to assemble at a D loop (2Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical evidence has provided significant support for this hypothesis. PriA specifically recognizes and binds D loop DNA compared with a corresponding bubble structure (8McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The basis for this binding is the ability of PriA to specifically recognize bent DNA at three-strand junctions (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this report, we have provided evidence that PriA will also catalyze assembly of a ϕX-type primosome at a D loop. This is a necessary step in order to effect replication fork assembly on these recombination intermediates. Primosome assembly on PAS sequences in ssDNA occurs in five discrete steps resulting in, sequentially, the following protein-DNA complexes (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar): (i) PriA-PAS DNA, (ii) PriA-PriB-PAS DNA, (iii) PriA-PriB-DnaT-PAS DNA, (iv) PriA-PriB-DnaT-DnaB-PAS DNA (the preprimosome), and (v) PriA-PriB-DnaT-DnaB-DnaG-DNA (the primosome). PriC is present in the latter two complexes if they are formed on large DNAs. We were able to demonstrate, using gel mobility shift analysis, the formation of a PriA-PriB-DnaT-D loop DNA complex, but could not, using this methodology, observe any of the higher order complexes. DNA footprinting revealed that PriA bound preferentially to the left-hand side of the D loop. This is consistent with our observation, reported in the accompanying manuscript (9Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), that PriA preferred to bind three-strand junctions with 5′-single-stranded tails. PriA binding resulted in the modification of the DNase I digestion pattern over a large portion of the D loop. At the three-strand junction formed by the top, invading, and bottom strands, PriA binding reduced DNase I activity on all three strands. This region of protection extended from the three-strand junction, 10 base pairs into the duplex formed by the top and invading strands and 18 base pairs in the opposite direction into the duplex formed by the top and bottom strands. Given that steric interference in a DNase I footprint generally leads to an overestimate of binding site size, this is a region that could be covered by a protein that has a Stokes radius of 36 Å (22Greenbaum J.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2594-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the footprint was more complex. PriA binding also generated an alternating pattern of protection from and enhancement of cleavage by DNase I essentially throughout the length of the duplex formed by the top and invading strands. The entire region effected by PriA binding covered almost 200 Å of DNA, far too much to be covered by one PriA molecule. Although the obvious explanation, that PriA wraps a portion of the D loop about itself, is attractive, we do not have any corroborating evidence to support it. The alternative explanation, that multiple molecules of PriA are bound to the D loop, cannot be ruled out at this time. In the presence of 5 μm ATP, a concentration sufficient to support primosome assembly (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the addition of the other primosomal proteins did not result in any significant changes in the footprint. This was surprising because we expected, if a primosome was being assembled, to observe a footprint on the displaced strand corresponding to the loading of DnaB. However, we were uncertain as to whether a substrate this small could support stable binding of a complete primosome. Our previous studies utilized a 304-nt long ssDNA that contained a PAS sequence roughly in the center of the fragment (13Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When a smaller substrate was used composed solely of the sequence of the PAS, we could only observe PriA binding. 2K. H. Zavitz and K. J. Marians, unpublished data. Thus we searched for functional evidence for primosome assembly. Primosome DNA helicase activity was detected in the presence of 1 mm ATP because of the appearance of S1 nuclease-sensitive sites in both the top and bottom strands of the left-hand flanking duplex region. It was clear that this was a primosomal function because: (i) all the preprimosomal proteins were required, and (ii) neither PriA or DnaB alone nor a combination of the two helicases was sufficient for unwinding to occur. It seems likely that the components of the primosome assembled on a D loop are binding to both strands of DNA. PriA binding alone spanned each of the three strands at the left-hand junction. The 5′ → 3′ directionality of the DnaB helicase activity argues that this protein is loaded onto the displaced strand. If it were bound to either the top or invading strand, we would have expected to observe either displacement of the invading strand or unwinding of the right-hand flanking duplex. The disposition of the other proteins in a primosome assembled on a D loop is not clear. In the presence of 1 mm ATP, we observed both protection from and enhancement of DNase I cleavage in an 8-nt region on the bottom strand in the right-hand flanking duplex region. However, no corresponding effects were observed on the top strand. Thus, we think it unlikely that unwinding of the right-hand flanking duplex was occurring. Instead, we take this to indicate a rearrangement on the DNA of some of the other primosomal proteins to accommodate loading of DnaB. Although to simplify the analysis, these experiments were conducted in the absence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), it is clear, because we can observe replication fork assembly at a D loop (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), that primosome occurs on D loops in the presence of SSB as well. It seems likely, then, that the normal substrates for PriA-directed primosome assembly in the cell are D loops that are formed by the recombination proteins. This is supported by our demonstration of primosomal protein- and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme-dependent replication fork assembly on form II DNA templates carrying a D loop (16Liu J., L. Xu Sandler S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, one can conclude, much as bacteriophage λ evolved the λP protein to steal DnaB from DnaC and suborn it to replication of its own genome, bacteriophage ϕX174 evolved to steal an existing cellular replication system and direct it to its own survival by mimicking the substrate for primosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2095862628,"The biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by homodimeric NO synthases (NOS). For unknown reasons, all NOS co-purify with substoichiometric amounts of (6 <i>R</i>)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H<sub>4</sub>Bip) and require additional H<sub>4</sub>Bip for maximal activity. We examined the effects of H<sub>4</sub>Bip and pterin-derived inhibitors (anti-pterins) on purified neuronal NOS-I quaternary structure and H<sub>4</sub>Bip content. During l-arginine turnover, NOS-I dimers time dependently dissociated into inactive monomers, paralleled by a loss of enzyme-associated pterin. Dimer dissociation was inhibited when saturating levels of H<sub>4</sub>Bip were added during catalysis. Similar results were obtained with pterin-free NOS-I expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This stabilizing effect of H<sub>4</sub>Bip was mimicked by the anti-pterin 2-amino-4,6-dioxo-3,4,5,6,8,8a,9,10-octahydro-oxazolo[1,2f]-pteridine (PHS-32), which also displaced NOS-associated H<sub>4</sub>Bip in a competitive manner. Surprisingly, H<sub>4</sub>Bip not only dissociated from NOS during catalysis, but was only partially recovered in the solute (50.0 ± 16.5% of control at 20 min). NOS-associated H<sub>4</sub>Bip appeared to react with a NOS catalysis product to a derivative distinct from dihydrobiopterin or biopterin. Under identical conditions, reagent H<sub>4</sub>Bip was chemically stable and fully recovered (95.5 ± 3.4% of control). A similar loss of both reagent and enzyme-bound H<sub>4</sub>Bip and dimer content was observed by NO generated from spermine NONOate. In conclusion, we propose a role for H<sub>4</sub>Bip as a dimer-stabilizing factor of neuronal NOS during catalysis, possibly by interfering with enzyme destabilizing products."

Recent reports have suggested a model whereby NHE-RF, in association with PKA II and ezrin, functions as a signaling complex to regulate NHE3 activity (2Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J.

Multiple aspects of this model have not been explicitly studied, although an increase in phosphorylation of NHE3 is necessary for the cAMP inhibition (4Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present experiments use PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)-tagged NHE3 and either native NHE-RF or E3KARP or a mutant form of NHE-RF to study two phosphorylation-related aspects of the proposed signaling complex model through which cAMP inhibits NHE3. First, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates NHE3 activity was examined. Specifically, the question of whether NHE-RF or E3KARP is necessary for PKA to phosphorylate NHE3 was addressed. Second, although NHE-RF was originally isolated and characterized as a PKA substrate (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), recent in vivo experiments indicate that NHE-RF exists as a phosphoprotein in unstimulated human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and OK cells but that treatment of these cells with cAMP increased the phosphorylation of NHE-RF minimally or not at all (5Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Bui G. Yuan N. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1254-F1258PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin.

These prior in vivo studies, however, did not specifically correlate the relation between the effect of cAMP on NHE3 transporter activity and the phosphorylation state of NHE-RF. Accordingly, the functional and biochemical properties of a nonphosphorylated mutant NHE-RF containing serine to alanine mutations of residues 287, 289, and 290 (NHE-RF/S287A/S289A/S290A) was examined. The results confirmed that in PS120 cells expressing NHE3, there is an absolute requirement for the presence of NHE-RF or E3KARP for cAMP to inhibit transporter activity. These studies showed that NHE-RF or E3KARP is required for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NHE3. On the other hand, phosphorylation of NHE-RF is not required for it to function as a co-factor in cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3.DISCUSSIONcAMP regulation of the intestinal epithelial brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 occurs physiologically as part of the digestive process, and it occurs in an exaggerated form in diarrheal diseases, such as cholera. Similarly, parathyroid hormone inhibition of renal proximal tubule NHE3 is partially mediated by cAMP (15Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown a requirement in this regulation for members of the regulatory factor gene family NHE-RF or E3KARP. A mechanism suggested as being involved in RF mediation of cAMP inhibition of NHE3 includes action in a signaling complex that includes NHE3, NHE-RF or E3KARP, ezrin, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase II and results in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of NHE3 (2Lamprecht G.

Although neither NHE-RF nor E3KARP acts as an A kinase-anchoring protein, ezrin does bind PKA II (2Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J.

However, until the current study, it was not established that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of NHE3 required the presence of NHE-RF or E3 KARP. The current studies were designed to more fully understand the biochemical steps between the activation of PKA and inhibition of NHE3 activity, specifically to determine (i) whether NHE-RF or E3KARP was necessary for cAMP to phosphorylate NHE3; and (ii) whether basal or cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of NHE-RF was important for cAMP inhibition of NHE3 or for NHE-RF to associate with NHE3 as part of a signaling complex.The present studies confirm our previous observation that the presence of NHE-RF or E3KARP is necessary for cAMP inhibition of NHE3 (1Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 99: 3010-3015Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and show that NHE-RF or E3KARP is necessary for cAMP to phosphorylate NHE3. Using two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic analysis of chymotryptic digests of in vivo[32P]orthophosphate-labeled NHE3, these studies show that cAMP did not change the NHE3 phosphorylation pattern in the absence of NHE-RF or E3KARP, whereas a change in two chymotryptic phosphopeptides of NHE3 occurred with cAMP treatment in cells transfected with NHE-RF or E3KARP. In addition, it was shown that cAMP caused changes in the same phosphopeptides in cells containing either NHE-RF or E3KARP. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that in PS120 cells expressing rabbit NHE3, there is an absolute requirement for NHE-RF or E3KARP to demonstrate cAMP inhibition of NHE3, that NHE3 and NHE-RF physically associate in vivo, and that NHE-RF or E3KARP is required for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NHE3.Others have demonstrated that cAMP causes changes in phosphorylation of NHE3 expressed in fibroblasts or the OK renal proximal tubule cell line (17Kurashima K., Yu, F.H.

However, there is some controversy concerning which part of NHE3 is phosphorylated and the significance of the phosphorylation for cAMP inhibition of NHE3. Kurashima et al. (17Kurashima K., Yu, F.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in AP-1 fibroblasts, cAMP phosphorylates NHE3 on a single serine residue, Ser605. Mutating this serine inhibited cAMP inhibition of NHE3 by 50%. More recently, Zhao et al. (19Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), in studies using the same AP-1 cells as well as OK cells, showed that cAMP phosphorylates NHE3 on multiple serines. In addition, mutating either Ser605 or Ser552, greatly decreased cAMP inhibition of NHE3. Mutating three serines other than Ser605 and Ser552 also decreased cAMP inhibition of NHE3, an effect potentially due to a larger change in the structure of NHE3 (19Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our results cannot be directly compared with those of Zhao et al. (19Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or Kurashima et al. (17Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabó E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), because different proteases were used. However, our results are most consistent with the studies of Zhao et al. (19Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), because cAMP increased phosphorylation of more than one phosphopeptide in NHE3. Importantly, the data most inconsistent among previous studies of NHE3 phosphorylation relate to the potential role for Ser552 in cAMP inhibition of NHE3. Cabado et al. (20Cabado A.G., Yu, F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) used C-terminal truncation mutants of NHE3 to define the domain in the NHE3 cytoplasmic C terminus, which is involved in cAMP inhibition of NHE3 in AP-1 cells. C-terminal truncation to NHE3 amino acid 638 decreased the extent of cAMP inhibition, whereas truncation to amino acid 579 eliminated cAMP regulation of NHE3. On face value, these results are consistent with Ser605 but not Ser552 being involved in cAMP inhibition because Ser552 is N-terminal of the domain of NHE3, which is involved in cAMP regulation of NHE3.The second major aim of the present experiments was to study the relationship between the phosphorylation of NHE-RF and its function in cAMP inhibition of NHE3. Prior in vitro experiments using chemically purified, immunopurified, and recombinant NHE-RF have indicated that NHE-RF was phosphorylated by PKA (2Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, more recent studies using HEK293 and OK cells expressing rabbit NHE-RF have indicated that although NHE-RF is a phosphoprotein in unstimulated cells, treatment of the cells with cAMP resulted in little (HEK293) or no (OK cells) increase in phosphorylation of NHE-RF (2Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The relation between the in vivo phosphorylation status of NHE-RF and PKA regulation of Na+/H+ exchange activity, however, was not determined in those experiments. The present experiments using PS120 cells support the observation that cAMP does not significantly increase the phosphorylation of wild type NHE-RF. These results also indicate that an increase by PKA in NHE-RF phosphorylation is not critical to its function as a co-factor in PKA regulation of NHE3. Although the failure to observe an increase in the phosphorylation of NHE-RF following treatment with cAMP of PS120 cells confirms the findings from studies using HEK293 and OK cells, it remained possible that cAMP phosphorylation of NHE-RF was masked by virtue of the fact that NHE-RF was overexpressed in all three model cell systems. However, this consideration was eliminated by the finding that the S287A/S289A/S290A mutant was not constitutively phosphorylated in vivo, nor was its phosphorylation state altered by cAMP, yet the mutant nonphosphorylated form of NHE-RF co-immunoprecipitated NHE3 and was fully active as an accessory co-factor for PKA-mediated inhibition of NHE3. Moreover, mutant NHE-RF facilitated phosphorylation of NHE3, based on back-phosphorylation studies. Collectively, these findings provide strong confirmation for the conclusion that basal or PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NHE-RF is not essential to its function in regulating the relationship between PKA activation and NHE3 activity and NHE3 phosphorylation in PS120 cells or in the physical association between NHE-RF and NHE3.Several points are worthy of additional discussion. First, the present results indicate that one or more of the NHE-RF serine residues 287, 289, or 290 is phosphorylated in the basal state. At the present time, the functional significance of the basal phosphorylation of NHE-RF is unknown, and the relevant protein kinase has not been identified. Although the phosphorylation of NHE-RF by PKA is not critical to its interaction with NHE3, it remains possible that the phosphorylation of NHE-RF is necessary and required for some of its other physiologic functions, such as those related to its binding to the β2 receptor or to CFTR (12Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J.

Another issue relates to differences in these in vivo findings and previously reported in vitro studies of cAMP inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange based on reconstitution of renal brush border vesicles. In these in vitro studies, PKA phosphorylation of NHE-RF appeared to occur and to be necessary for NHE-RF to act as a co-factor in PKA-mediated inhibition of rabbit renal brush border Na+/H+ exchange activity (4Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Bui G. Yuan N. Shenolikar S. Am. J.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies using a recombinant protein of NHE-RF/S287A/S289A/S290A and a brush border reconstitution assay indicated that the mutant was not a substrate for PKA but that it also was not functional in mediating an inhibitory effect of PKA on renal brush border Na+/H+ exchange (8Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At the present time, there is no clear explanation for these differences between the in vitro and in vivo studies. One potentially relevant difference relates to the study of native rabbit BBM NHE3 from renal epithelial cells versus the study of NHE3 transfected into a fibroblast cell line. It may be speculated that if the phosphorylation of NHE-RF by PKA is not critical to its function in allowing PKA phosphorylation of NHE3, basal or cAMP-stimulated NHE-RF phosphorylation might be required to activate or deactivate an additional factor in rabbit solubilized renal brush border membranes; this postulated factor would not be involved in PS120 cells. The more difficult nature of the in vitro reconstitution studies must be considered as an additional explanation for these differences.In summary, the present experiments indicate that NHE-RF or E3KARP is absolutely required for NHE3 inhibition by cAMP when expressed in PS120 cells. NHE-RF and NHE3 are physically associated in these cells, and NHE-RF or E3KARP allows PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NHE3. It is now established that cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3,1 the epithelial brush border isoform Na+/H+ exchanger, requires the presence of associated regulatory proteins of the regulatory factor (RF) gene family (1Yun C.H.

There are two identified members of this family, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHE-RF) and NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein (E3KARP) (1Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 99: 3010-3015Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested a model whereby NHE-RF, in association with PKA II and ezrin, functions as a signaling complex to regulate NHE3 activity (2Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J.

Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Multiple aspects of this model have not been explicitly studied, although an increase in phosphorylation of NHE3 is necessary for the cAMP inhibition (4Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W.P. Dinh Q. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present experiments use PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)-tagged NHE3 and either native NHE-RF or E3KARP or a mutant form of NHE-RF to study two phosphorylation-related aspects of the proposed signaling complex model through which cAMP inhibits NHE3. First, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates NHE3 activity was examined. Specifically, the question of whether NHE-RF or E3KARP is necessary for PKA to phosphorylate NHE3 was addressed. Second, although NHE-RF was originally isolated and characterized as a PKA substrate (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), recent in vivo experiments indicate that NHE-RF exists as a phosphoprotein in unstimulated human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and OK cells but that treatment of these cells with cAMP increased the phosphorylation of NHE-RF minimally or not at all (5Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Bui G. Yuan N. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1254-F1258PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These prior in vivo studies, however, did not specifically correlate the relation between the effect of cAMP on NHE3 transporter activity and the phosphorylation state of NHE-RF. Accordingly, the functional and biochemical properties of a nonphosphorylated mutant NHE-RF containing serine to alanine mutations of residues 287, 289, and 290 (NHE-RF/S287A/S289A/S290A) was examined. The results confirmed that in PS120 cells expressing NHE3, there is an absolute requirement for the presence of NHE-RF or E3KARP for cAMP to inhibit transporter activity. These studies showed that NHE-RF or E3KARP is required for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NHE3. On the other hand, phosphorylation of NHE-RF is not required for it to function as a co-factor in cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3. DISCUSSIONcAMP regulation of the intestinal epithelial brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 occurs physiologically as part of the digestive process, and it occurs in an exaggerated form in diarrheal diseases, such as cholera. Similarly, parathyroid hormone inhibition of renal proximal tubule NHE3 is partially mediated by cAMP (15Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown a requirement in this regulation for members of the regulatory factor gene family NHE-RF or E3KARP. A mechanism suggested as being involved in RF mediation of cAMP inhibition of NHE3 includes action in a signaling complex that includes NHE3, NHE-RF or E3KARP, ezrin, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase II and results in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of NHE3 (2Lamprecht G.

Since all three receptor subtypes appear to couple to the same effectors, it is of interest to explore other differences among these subtypes in an effort to understand the functional relevance of subtype diversity. Two α2-AR subtypes manifest differences in agonist-induced receptor redistribution from the cell surface as follows: the α2B-AR becomes rapidly and extensively internalized following agonist occupancy, whereas the α2A-AR does not readily redistribute to an intracellular compartment following agonist occupancy (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α2C-AR exists both on the surface and in an intracellular compartment at steady state (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), confounding quantitative assessment of α2C-AR redistribution. Recent reports suggest that internalization is required for some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to stimulate the MAP kinase cascade (4Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 56-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the current studies was to determine if the differing profiles of agonist-induced internalization of the α2A-AR and α2B-AR subtypes are paralleled by differing rates or extents of MAP kinase activation and whether agents that interfere with agonist-elicited receptor redistribution alter MAP kinase activation. HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Permanent transfectants were generated by LipofectAMINE-mediated co-transfection of the cells with plasmids containing the indicated receptors and a neomycin resistance gene. Cells that survived selection in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 were screened for expression of the expected receptor by binding of the radiolabeled α2-AR antagonist, [3H]rauwolscine. Clonal cell lines with varying levels of α2-AR expression were kept for further study. The experiments reported here were performed on an α2A-AR expressing cell line that contains 7–8 pmol of receptor per mg of protein and an α2B-AR-expressing cell line that contains 2–4 pmol/mg. Permanent transfectants of HEK 293 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and allowed to multiply until they reached a density of 60–80%. The cells were then serum-deprived overnight. On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM, DMEM supplemented with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A, or K+-depleted medium as described below to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After the pretreatment, the indicated drugs were added directly to the medium on the cells and were swirled to mix. After the indicated times, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2(PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+) and then lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% w/v SDS; 10% glycerol; 50 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mmsodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 10 units/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 10 units/ml aprotinin (Bayer Corp., Kankakee, IL). The lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube on ice. When all samples were collected, they were bath sonicated for 30–40 s, then placed in a heating block at 90 °C, allowed to warm to 95 °C, and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The lysates were then spun in a microcentrifuge at room temperature for 5 min to remove debris. The supernatants were assayed in Bio-Rad's protein assay for relative protein concentration, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. The gel was run for 160 mA-h and then transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose in transfer buffer (20% methanol; 0.19 m glycine; 25 mmTris base) at 33 mV. MAP kinase activation was evaluated using an antibody that recognizes dually phosphorylated (Thr/Tyr) MAP kinase (Promega catalog number V6671) and normalized to total MAP kinase using an antibody that recognizes MAP kinase regardless of its phosphorylation state (New England Biolabs catalog number 9102). To assess activated MAP kinase content, the nitrocellulose blot was incubated in blocking buffer (1× TBS; 0.1% Tween 20; 5% w/v nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody (from Promega) to dually phosphorylated MAP kinase, diluted 1/500 in blocking buffer, for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times for 5 min each with TBST (2.42 g/liter Tris base; 8.0 g/liter sodium chloride; 0.1% Tween 20; pH 7.6) and then probed with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1/2000 dilution in blocking buffer) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The wash protocol was repeated, and the immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were then stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 65 °C and reprobed with antibody to total MAP kinase (New England Biolabs) at a 1/500 dilution in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody as described above. To semi-quantify MAP kinase activation, the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) images were scanned into Adobe Photoshop with a UMAX Astra 600 scanner, and the band intensities were measured using NIH Image software. Background pixel density was subtracted from each band's pixel density. The corrected pixel density for active MAP kinase was divided by the corrected pixel density for total MAP kinase to obtain the normalized levels of activated MAP kinase reported in the figures as “active/total.” The introduction of the HA epitope into the amino terminus of α2-ARs expressed in HEK 293 cells provided a tool for quantitation of receptors expressed at the cell surface using a cell surface ELISA, as described previously (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Schoneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). On day 1, HEK 293 cells stably expressing the receptors of interest were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well culture plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. On day 2, the cells were serum-starved overnight. On the morning of day 3, the cells were treated in the absence or presence of agonist as indicated in the figure legends and then washed twice in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ to stop the drug treatment and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.12 m sucrose for 20 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% sheep serum to block nonspecific antibody binding in subsequent incubations. The 12CA5 antibody directed against the HA epitope was diluted 1/100 in blocking medium and applied for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times for 5 min each in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ at room temperature. The sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was applied at a 1/2500 dilution in blocking medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times for 5 min at room temperature in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, as above. The colorimetric substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (1 mg/ml, Pierce) was added and incubated for 20 min to 1 h at 15 °C. The color development was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 490 nm in each well was read on a microtiter plate reader. Generally, four replicates of each treatment were performed per experiment. Surface receptors were biotinylated on ice with disulfide-cleavable biotin (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) and treated with a hydrophilic reducing agent, mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA), after termination of the surface biotinylation reaction. Receptors that are inside the cell at the time of MESNA treatment are protected from reduction and therefore subsequently isolated from the detergent extract by adsorption to streptavidin-agarose. Our protocol was adapted from a previously published procedure (8Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For each experiment, HEK 293 clonal cell lines were plated on 60-mm dishes coated with poly-d-lysine and allowed to grow to 70–80% confluence. Cells were serum-starved for 16–18 h prior to each experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were first treated with serum-free DMEM with or without 250 μg/ml concanavalin A or with K+-depleted medium as described below. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C as follows: cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 or with K+ depletion buffer and then incubated with 100 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ or K+ depletion buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and once with serum-free DMEM or with K+ depletion buffer at 4 °C. Dishes were then incubated at 37 °C by placement on a rack in a water bath. For agonist activation, the medium was replaced with 37 °C serum-free DMEM or K+ depletion buffer containing 100 μm epinephrine for 5 min at 37 °C (control cells had their medium replaced with warm medium without agonist). The incubation was terminated by replacement of the 37 °C medium with ice-cold DMEM or K+ depletion buffer. The culture dishes were returned to 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, and then incubated with 250 mm MESNA in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ for two 20-min incubations to release surface-accessible biotinylating reagent via disulfide exchange. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold serum-free DMEM, and the reducing effect of any residual MESNA was then quenched by incubation with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 20 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated receptors resistant to MESNA reversal of biotinylation were defined as “inaccessible.” To define total MESNA-accessible receptors on these cell lines, one 60-mm dish per experiment was treated with MESNA immediately following biotinylation at 4 °C to reveal the quantity of surface receptor biotinylation that MESNA can reverse efficiently. To isolate biotinylated α2-AR, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (4 mg/ml dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem), 0.8 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Sigma), 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma), 20% glycerol, 25 mm glycyl glycine, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl) and homogenized by 5 up/down passages through a 25-gauge needle. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant (defined as the detergent-solubilized extract) was incubated with streptavidin-agarose (80 μl, 1:1 slurry) for 1 h at room temperature. The pass-through was saved, and the beads were washed 3 times with a 1:8 dilution of the solubilization buffer in “binding buffer” (25 mm glycyl glycine; 5 mm EDTA; 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0; 0.1 m NaCl). Proteins were eluted from streptavidin-agarose in Laemmli buffer containing 15 μg/ml dithiothreitol. The entire eluate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer (see above) of HA.11 antibody from Babco to the HA-tagged α2-ARs. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at a 1/3000 dilution in blocking buffer. Reactive proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were quantified by scanning and NIH Image software as described above. To calculate percent internalization, the intensity of the band in the lane where cells were immediately exposed to MESNA (labeled 0′, 4 °C) is subtracted as background from all other band intensities, and then the band intensity in the treated lanes (“no epinephrine” or “+epinephrine” after 5 min at 37 °C) is divided by the “total” band intensity, and the result is multiplied by 100. The potassium depletion protocol for blocking receptor endocytosis was adapted from previously published methods (9Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Clonal cell Lines expressing either α2-AR subtype were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in hypotonic shock solution (serum-free DMEM and distilled water in a 1:1 ratio). Then they were rinsed once in K+ depletion buffer (100 mm NaCl; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 1 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2) and then incubated in the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. (Control cells were treated with PBS instead of potassium depletion buffer.) MAP kinase stimulation or biotinylation then proceeded as described above. Clonal cell lines expressing either α2-AR subtype were incubated with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma), made fresh daily in serum-free DMEM, for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (11Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAP kinase stimulation or biotinylation then proceeded as described above. Clonal cell lines expressing either α2-AR subtype were washed once and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with DMEM containing 0.45 msucrose, as described previously (9Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Drug treatment and analysis then proceeded as described. Parental HEK 293 cells were plated on 6-well plates or 35-mm culture dishes and transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the HA-tagged α2B-AR and either dominant negative dynamin cDNA (kindly provided by Mark Caron) or “empty” pCMV4 vector as a control. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to package directions with a FuGENE 6/α2B-AR plasmid/dynamin K44A or control plasmid ratio of 6 μl/1 μg/2 μg. Internalization and MAP kinase activation were assayed as described above. Two wells of a 6-well plate were combined for each data point. Two independent experimental strategies were used to examine agonist-elicited receptor redistribution of α2-AR subtypes. An intact cell ELISA performed on HEK 293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged mouse α2A-AR and α2B-AR (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to assess loss of receptor from the cell surface (Fig. 1 A). Cell surface ELISAs corroborate earlier morphological findings (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the α2A-AR and α2B-AR show differing profiles of agonist-induced internalization. Whereas the α2A-AR demonstrates negligible loss of surface receptors following exposure to maximal agonist concentrations, the α2B-AR subtype demonstrates a 30–40% loss of surface-accessible epitope over the same time. Receptor internalization also can be examined by quantifying the fraction of surface receptors that moves in a time-dependent fashion to an inaccessible compartment. For these studies, we exploited a reversible biotinylating agent, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Fig. 1 B). Biotin remaining on the surface at the end of a particular treatment protocol was removed by treatment with MESNA, a non-permeant reducing agent that cleaves the disulfide bond and liberates the biotinylating reagent from proteins still accessible at the cell surface. MESNA reversal immediately after biotinylation (Fig. 1 B; time 0, +) provides an assessment of the amount of biotinylated receptor that is accessible to this reversal reagent at time 0. Further incubation of the cells at 37 °C in the absence or presence of agonist before MESNA reversal of surface biotinylation permits evaluation of agonist-independent versus agonist-accelerated receptor redistribution. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the α2A-AR is not extensively redistributed to a MESNA-inaccessible compartment at 37 °C, even in the presence of the agonist epinephrine, whereas the α2B-AR is rapidly internalized (i.e. removed from MESNA accessibility), and this internalization is enhanced by agonist stimulation. Previous studies in heterologous systems have demonstrated α2-AR-elicited activation of MAP kinase (12Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Recent findings suggest that G protein-coupled receptors may require internalization to activate MAP kinase, particularly via pertussis toxin-sensitive pathways (4Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 5Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To assess whether receptor internalization is required for MAP kinase activation by α2-ARs, we exploited the differential internalization profiles of the α2A-AR and α2B-AR subtypes and compared their ability to activate MAP kinase in permanent transfectants of HEK 293 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2, the extent of MAP kinase activation by these two receptor subtypes is similar when measured by the appearance of dually phosphorylated Erk 1 and Erk 2. Stimulation by both subtypes was sensitive to pertussis toxin pretreatment (data not shown), indicating that α2A-AR and α2B-AR are activating MAP kinase via a Gi-coupled pathway, as observed previously (17Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are confident that the stimulation of MAP kinase by epinephrine demonstrated in Fig. 2 is due to activation of the heterologously expressed α2A-AR or α2B-AR in the HEK 293 cells, as activation of MAP kinase is also elicited by the α2-AR agonist UK 14,304 and is blocked by the α2-AR-specific antagonists yohimbine and RX 821002 (data not shown). Furthermore, parental HEK 293 cells did not demonstrate activation by epinephrine prior to introduction of the α2-AR-encoding cDNAs. Unlike the properties of some clonal HEK 293 cell lines reported in the literature (4Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), we have found no evidence for β-AR stimulation of MAP kinase in our HEK 293 cells, as MAP kinase is not activated by isoproterenol and the response to epinephrine was not blocked by the β-AR antagonist, propranolol. The observation that both α2A-AR and α2B-AR subtypes stimulate MAP kinase suggests that receptor internalization, which is highly efficient for the α2B-AR but not for α2A-AR subtype, is not required for MAP kinase activation. Consistent with this interpretation is the realization that maximal MAP kinase activation occurs at 2 min, a time when agonist-elicited receptor loss from the surface, even for α2B-AR, is just beginning (see Fig.1 A). To assess directly the impact of internalization on MAP kinase activation, we utilized four independent experimental manipulations previously demonstrated to block internalization by clathrin-coated pit pathways as follows: hypertonic sucrose (9Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), pretreatment with concanavalin A (11Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exposure to K+ -depleted medium (9Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and co-expression with dominant negative (K44A) dynamin (18Damke H.B. Takeshi Warnock Dale E. Schmid Sandra L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 19Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Hypertonic sucrose proved a non-viable strategy in our HEK 293 cell lines, as it caused MAP kinase activation to occur without agonist addition and to a similar extent in parental HEK 293 cells as in permanent transfectants expressing α2-AR subtypes. A second treatment, concanavalin A, is thought to prevent internalization of GPCRs by stabilizing surface integrity due to tetravalent lectin contacts (11Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, concanavalin A was only variably successful in blocking α2B-AR internalization, when assessed via the redistribution of biotinylated α2B-AR into a MESNA-inaccessible compartment (data not shown). This lack of consistent inhibition of α2B-AR internalization may be a consequence of the non-glycosylated nature of the α2B-AR subtype (20Wilson A.L. Seibert K. Brandon S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this finding confounds the use of concanavalin A as a tool for assessing the role of internalization of this subtype in stimulation of MAP kinase. A third experimental manipulation, co-expression of dominant negative dynamin (K44A), was explored as a tool to block agonist-elicited internalization. However, as assessed in the reversible biotinylation assay, overexpression of dynamin K44A (assessed by Western blotting) did not eliminate α2B-AR internalization, suggesting that these receptors can be internalized via a dynamin-independent pathway (Fig. 3 A). Dynamin-independent endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors has also been noted for dopaminergic and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes (21Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, co-expression of dynamin K44A with the α2B-AR did not markedly alter MAP kinase activation by the α2B-AR (Fig. 3 B). A fourth experimental manipulation that blocks receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits, pretreatment in K+-depleted medium, was successful in probing the relationship between receptor internalization and MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig.4 A, exposure to K+-depleted medium blocks biotinylated surface α2B-AR redistribution into a MESNA-inaccessible compartment, consistent with blockade of α2B-AR internalization. However, as shown in Fig. 4 B, α2B-AR readily activates MAP kinase in response to epinephrine under the same conditions. These results demonstrate that internalization is not required for the α2B-AR to stimulate MAP kinase. In fact, the duration of MAP kinase activation appears to be extended upon blockade of α2B-AR internalization by incubation of cells in K+-depleted medium, which is consistent with internalization as a mechanism of desensitization of MAP kinase signaling. The present studies provide two lines of evidence that α2-ARs do not require internalization to evoke MAP kinase activation, in contrast to recent reports implicating internalization as a prerequisite for stimulating the MAP kinase cascade by Gi-mediated GPCR signaling. First, the α2A-AR and α2B-AR subtypes both elicit MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2), despite the greater efficiency of α2B-AR in leaving the surface (Fig. 1 A) and appearing in an inaccessible (presumably internal) compartment (Fig. 1 B). Second, incubation of HEK 293 cells permanently expressing the α2B-AR subtype in K+-depleted medium eliminates receptor internalization (Fig. 4 A) but does not eliminate MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4 B). The reason for the discrepancy between our findings and those previously reported for other G protein-coupled receptors is not certain. The simplest interpretation is that different GPCRs have different mechanistic requirements to stimulate MAP kinase. However, it is also important to note that interpretations from previous studies relied at least in part on transient expression of receptors (4Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) or on transient expression of dominant negative structures of dynamin or arrestin to block internalization of heterologous or endogenous receptors (4Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that agonist-elicited redistribution of the α2B-AR does not require dynamin-dependent mechanisms (Fig. 3), and thus dynamin K44A does not provide a diagnostic reagent for evaluating the role of endocytosis in α2B-AR-mediated MAP kinase activation. Why different pathways would be utilized by different GPCRs for internalization is not known, although a lack of reliance on dynamin for agonist-elicited endocytosis has also been observed for dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors (21Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It may be that, in previous studies examining the impact of dynamin K44A on receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation, expression of mutant dynamin structures may have altered molecular events in addition to those involved in receptor association with clathrin-coated pits (23Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or in pinching of clathrin-coated vesicles from the surface (19Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and it is these events that play a role in MAP kinase activation by some, but clearly not all, GPCRs. Our findings provide strong evidence that G protein-coupled receptor internalization is not a general prerequisite for activation of the MAP kinase cascade via Gi-coupled receptors (Fig. 4). Similar results have been obtained previously with chemokine receptors (24Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that MAP kinase activation may be terminated by internalization, since activation of MAP kinase by the α2A-AR persists longer than that by the α2B-AR (Fig. 2), and incubation in K+-depleted medium also parallels sustained activation of the enzyme (Fig. 3 B). Future studies will resolve whether different molecular events dictate the duration of receptor-elicited MAP kinase signaling and other Gi-mediated phenomena, such as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of K+currents, or suppression of Ca2+ currents.

Nevertheless, these receptors function as complete proteins. Studies of specific mutations suggest that in the holoreceptors, intramolecular domain-domain interactions are important for complete function, but there is little knowledge concerning these interactions. The important transcriptional transactivation function in the N-terminal part of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) appears to have little inherent structure. To study its interactions with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the GR, we have expressed the complete sequence from the N-terminal through the DBD of the human GR. Circular dichroism analyses of this highly purified, multidomain protein show that it has a considerable helical content. We hypothesized that binding of its DBD to the cognate glucocorticoid response element would confer additional structure upon the N-terminal domain. Circular dichroism and fluorescence emission studies suggest that additional helicity as well as tertiary structure occur in the two-domain protein upon DNA binding. In sum, our data suggest that interdomain interactions consequent to DNA binding imparts structure to the portion of the GR that contains a major transactivation domain.

DNA binding domain glucocorticoid receptor glucocorticoid response element The major identified domains of the nuclear family of receptors are those for ligand binding, DNA binding (DBD),1 and transactivation, with other functional areas mapped throughout the molecule (1Evans R.M.

Although the ligand and DNA binding domains have modular structures and, in “domain swapping” experiments, a remarkable ability to carry out their function within the context of other proteins, intramolecular signaling is also important for the proper natural functions of these receptors. Recent experiments studying the effect of mutations on function emphasize the importance of this intramolecular signaling (5Gandini O. Kohno O. Curtis S. Korach K. Steroids. 1997; 62: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). How and when information is exchanged between domains is largely unknown. This is due in part to the fact that no structures are yet available for multidomain proteins from the nuclear receptor family. One intriguing problem is the structural basis for the major transcriptional transactivation function (AF1, tau1) that mutagenesis experiments have defined in the human GR (7Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). By molecular genetics, AF1 is defined by amino acids 77–262. It appears to function by evoking physical interactions with the basal transcription mechanism, including Ada2 and TATA-binding protein (TBP), possibly through intermediary adapter protein (8Henriksson A. Almlof T. Ford J. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Ford J. McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). But unlike the ligand binding domain and DBD, AF1 does not appear to function well out of its protein context. Studies of recombinant peptides from the GR containing AF1 have shown it to have little or no structure in simple buffer solutions (10Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the presence of the strong α-helix stabilizing agent trifluoroethanol, up to three α-helices could form at the C-terminal end of AF1, and functional mutagenesis has shown that the primary sequences at the C-terminal end of AF1 may be relevant to tau1 function in vivo (10Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in the presence of the osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide, a small molecule that enhances natural protein folding, AF1 can take on tertiary structure (11Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, data short of actual structural proof support the idea that conditional folding of the transactivation domain is an important requirement for its interaction with target factors and its subsequent role in gene regulation (9Ford J. McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether and under what conditions such interdomain communication happens. Equally unknown are the consequent conformational changes. In the present studies, we test the hypothesis that information signaled from the DBD can enhance the propensity of AF1 to become structured. We have studied the secondary/tertiary structures of the GR fragments 1–500 (N-terminal through the DBD) and 398–500 (DBD) in solution alone and when bound to the DNA of a consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE). The data show greater structural content, largely in the N-terminal region of the two-domain fragment when it is bound to the GRE. We believe this to be the first study of its kind from any member of the nuclear receptor family involving two naturally contiguous domains. The expression vectors for human GR fragments 1–500 and 398–500 contained a frameshift mutant of the human GR coding for amino acids 1–500 and 398–500 plus codons for a unique 5-amino acid sequence followed by a stop codon, as described (15Chen H. Srinivasan G. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). These GR fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Sf9 insect cells (17Summers M.D. Smith G.R. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). The cytosolic fractions were prepared from the cell pellet (18Srinivasan G. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from cytosolic fractions by binding to a glutathione-Sepharose column and then cleaved from glutathione S-transferase by digesting with thrombin and analyzed as described (11Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed with an SLM 8000 spectrometer equipped with a polarizer, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 480 nm, respectively. Deoxyribonucleotides containing consensus GREs 5′-CTAGGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTGCCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGCAGAACATCCTGTACAGCCTAG-3′ were synthesized and annealed. Fluorescence polarization studies were done by labeling the DNA sequence containing GRE with fluorescent probe 7-ethylamino-3(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin as described (19Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The binding of fragment 1–500 to GRE was studied in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescence measurements were made using 1.0-cm path rectangular cuvettes thermostated at 22 °C. All the CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C on an Aviv 62 spectropolarimeter, with the bandwidth of 1.0 nm and scan step of 0.5 nm. The far-UV CD spectra were recorded using a 0.1-cm quartz cell; a 1.0-cm quartz cell was used for near-UV CD spectra. All the spectra were recorded in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and were corrected for the contribution of respective buffers. Each spectrum is a result of five spectra accumulated, averaged, and smoothed. Fluorescence emission spectra of the GR fragment 1–500 in solution were monitored using a Spex Fluoro Max spectrofluorimeter (excitation 278 or 295 nm). All the measurements were made using 1.0-cm path rectangular cuvettes maintained at 22 °C, and all the data were corrected for the contribution of the respective solute concentrations. The buffer conditions were the same as in the CD experiments. The 1–500 (Fig. 1 A) and 398–500 GR fragments were expressed in a baculoviral system, purified to homogeneity, and examined initially by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the far-UV CD spectra of fragment 1–500 are concentration-dependent. At the lowest concentration, the spectrum shows mostly random coil, with some helical structure. With increasing concentrations, the minimum at around 200 nm shifted toward higher wavelengths and decreased, indicating a decrease in the random coil content of the protein. The minimum around 220 nm in these spectra did not seem to change as greatly, suggesting a lesser change in the helical content of the protein with changing concentration. Apparently, these concentration-dependent changes reflect some conformational changes other than helix. There may be an unfolding transition in the protein, caused by association of the protein with itself or with the surrounding environment at the higher concentrations. Dissociation at the lower concentration could lead to unfolding. However, a series of equilibrium centrifugation studies at protein concentrations of 2–18 μm failed to show any evidence of dimers or larger complexes (data not shown). In contrast, the far-UV CD spectra of fragment 398–500 are the same at the various concentrations of the protein tested, even at molar concentrations greater than those used for fragment 1–500 (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that the concentration-dependent changes observed in fragment 1–500 require the N-terminal region. A comparison of the spectra of fragments 1–500 and 398–500 shows that generally the spectra of both fragments are similar in form. However, the helical content (as assessed by the minimum at 222 nm; Fig. 1, B and C) in fragment 1–500 is higher compared with the small piece, 398–500. This further suggests that the structure observed in fragment 1–500 was due not only to the contribution of the DBD, but also to structure in the N-terminal region. Because this region has little structure when expressed alone, it acquires greater structure when expressed with the DBD in a contiguous protein. Because fragment 1–500 appears to be a monomer in solution at these concentrations, these structural changes are primarily intramolecular interactions (of course, intermolecular interactions, such as an excluded volume effect exerted by the less structured N-terminal region, may also play some role). We studied whether binding of the GR fragment 1–500 to a GRE leads to further structural changes in the two-domain GR fragment. Using fluorescence polarization measurements, we first estimated the stoichiometry of binding of fragment 1–500 to the DNA sequence containing a consensus GRE, labeled at its 5′ end with the fluorescence probe 7-ethylamino-3(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (Fig.2). The labeled GRE was then titrated with varying concentrations of the protein, following the change in anisotropy. Assuming the protein binds to GRE as a dimer, curves were fitted to the data at concentrations of GRE ranging from 15 nm to 1 μm. All gave Kavalues in a close range. The best fit was obtained with 100 nm GRE, from which the value of Ka = 1.04 × 10−2 nm−1 (Fig.2 A) was obtained. The stoichiometry of binding was calculated from the binding data obtained at 1 μm GRE concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the binding ratio of protein to GRE is in fact approximately 2:1, which suggests that fragment 1–500 binds to GRE as a dimer, consistent with published data for DBD alone (20Hard T. Dahlman K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Rigler R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5358-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we were able to choose conditions, i.e. [GRE] of ∼100 × Kd, that forced most protein to be GRE-bound, for study of the secondary structure of the protein·DNA complexes. Fig.3 shows the far-UV CD data of fragments 1–500 and 398–500 at protein/GRE input ratios of 1 and 1.5. The CD spectrum of fragment 398–500 does not change when bound to the GRE, but fragment 1–500 consistently shows a blue shift and greater negative ellipticity at wavelengths higher than 210 nm at both protein concentrations. Similar results were given at a ratio of 0.5:1, protein/DNA (data not shown). It is evident from these observations that the secondary structure of fragment 1–500 is significantly changed following binding to GRE. The blue shifts of the whole spectra without significant changes in relative intensities of the 208 nm and 220 nm peaks imply an increase in β-sheet content, a change that would favor an intradomain interaction. Furthermore, the increase in negative ellipticity at wavelengths higher than 240 nm implies a perturbation of the environments of aromatic residues. To acquire direct evidence for tertiary structural changes occurring in the protein following its binding to GRE, we recorded the near-UV CD spectra of this protein when unbound and bound to GRE (Fig.4 A). It is evident that the tertiary structure of the protein is significantly changed following its binding to GRE. A comparison of the spectra of the protein in the absence and presence of the GRE shows that when bound to the DNA there are a maximum and a minimum around 290 nm and 280 nm, respectively, readings which reflect perturbation of Trp. In the protein there are two Trp residues, one is found in AF1, the other between AF1 and the DBD (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, spectral changes at 290 and 280 nm after binding to the GRE indicate that tertiary structure has developed in or near the AF1 contained in the N-terminal region. In Fig. 4 B are shown the fluorescence emission spectra of GR fragment 1–500, measured either upon excitation at 295 nm, to follow changes in the environment of Trp residues specifically, or upon excitation at 278 nm, in which emission arises from Tyr and Trp residues, as well as being a result of energy transfer from Tyr to Trp residues. Thus, the latter links Tyr probes distributed throughout the protein with fluorescence emission from two Trp residues. It is evident from Fig. 4 B that the protein fluorescence spectra are changed following their binding to GRE. Because a substantial amount of the fluorescence probes of the GR fragment 1–500 are located outside of the DBD (both Trp residues, Trp-213 and Trp-365, and seven of ten Tyr residues; Fig. 1 A), the intrinsic fluorescence reflects mainly changes involving the N-terminal region. On the basis of our far-UV CD data of the GR fragments 1–500 and 398–500 we suggest that there is “cross-talk” between the N-terminal region and the DBD, which leads to some structural changes in the N-terminal region. This suggests that the individual domains may not have exactly the same structure in the holoreceptor as they do alone. Molecular genetic studies have shown that at least in the case of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, there is intramolecular cross-talk between the N-terminal region and ligand binding domain (6Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the N-terminal region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulates ligand binding by altering the conformation of the unliganded receptor. These conformational changes have been correlated with the receptor's interaction with cofactors such as the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (21Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.-M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Such data indicate that the situation in the holoreceptor may be more complex than the simplest modular model anticipates. We postulate that structural changes occurring in the N-terminal region due to domain-domain interactions are important for maintaining the GR in a conformation suited for interactions between AF1 and its cofactors and/or specific proteins in the basal transcription machinery. The published structures of the DBD alone in solution and as a dimeric complex bound to GRE look similar, with no major difference in folding: only the second zinc finger region appears to be less well defined in solution compared with its crystal structure, suggesting that this region is stabilized upon formation of the (DBD)2·GRE complex (22Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 23Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K.

Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13463-13471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Published results found that in solution the DBD was monomeric, whereas it bound as a dimer at the GRE site. The increased secondary structural elements indicated by our CD data suggest that the structure of the fragment 1–500·GRE complex may be more compact than that of the protein alone. These observations further suggest that the conformational alterations taking place in the 1–500 fragment upon DNA binding are mainly occurring in the N-terminal region. This implies an intramolecular flow of information from the DBD to the N-terminal region. These conditional structural changes in the N-terminal region of the GR following DNA binding via the DBD to its cognate GRE may play an important role in triggering gene regulation. Assuming that these changes are taking place in AF1, it can be imagined that binding to GRE is required to bring the receptor's major transactivation domain into a conformation suited for its interaction with cofactors and/or the proteins of the transcriptional machinery. Of course, this model in no way rules out the possibility of further structural changes in AF1, or the entire GR, as a result of those protein-protein interactions. Many documented instances of negative effects of the GR on transcription involve interactions with other transcription factors without the GR bound to a proper GRE (25Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). If part of the functional structure of the GR necessary for positive regulation of transcription depends on GR-GRE interactions, these would be lost at the negatively regulated sites where there is no proper GRE interaction. The near-UV spectrum of the protein·DNA complex resembles that of dimers of two identical chromophores (26Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Diego, CA1980: 418-425Google Scholar). This spectrum implies an induced close interaction between the Trp residues upon binding of GRE. The specific changes occurring in our two-domain protein will require other methods for studying structure. It seems clear, however, that binding of the DBD to its GRE produces changes indicative of increased tertiary structure in the N-terminal domain. This is consistent with our hypothesis that structure develops in the N-terminal domain following binding of the DBD to the GRE. Trp-213 is especially interesting. It is a critical amino acid for the activation function of the GR, and mutation to either positively or negatively charged amino acids results in loss of function. Trp-213 seems to act in conjunction with a limited number of other amino acids in the AF1 domain (27Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that there is domaindomain interaction between the N-terminal region and the DBD in the GR fragment 1–500 and that this interaction is enhanced when the DBD binds a GRE, leading to imposition of some structure in the N-terminal region. We cannot immediately specify whether these changes are taking place only in the AF1 part of the N-terminal region or whether they are general. The structural changes observed in the N-terminal domain following binding of the DBD to a GRE open the possibility that the receptor, upon interacting with GRE, adopts a conformation important for the receptor's activity in vivo.

All of these phenotypes could be suppressed when a priA allele encoding a mutant PriA protein no longer capable of acting as a DNA helicase, but still capable of catalyzing primosome assembly (17Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was provided in trans (14Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K.-I. Kogoma T.

This observation, and the requirement for recombination proteins during double-strand break repair, and both induced and constitutive stable DNA replication, led to the proposal that the cellular function of PriA was to catalyze the assembly of replication forks at recombination intermediates such as D loops (15Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1998; 143: 5-13Crossref Google Scholar, 16Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was consistent with our initial proposal, based on the manifestation of chronic SOS induction in the absence of exogenous DNA damage in priA null strains, that PriA-directed replication fork loading was required under conditions of normal cell growth to rescue replication forks that had initiated at oriC, but had stalled before they could complete synthesis of the genome (18Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In support of this model for PriA action, McGlynn et al. (19McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the enzyme could bind D loop DNA. Using gel shift analysis, we show here that PriA can bind to two types of DNA structures: duplex DNAs with 3′-single-stranded extensions and bent DNA at three stranded junctions. The latter activity accounts for the high affinity binding of PriA to D loop DNA. Interestingly, the inability of PriA to bind bubble structures derives from the disposition of the single strands in the bubble region. In the accompanying report (20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

In order to assess which features of a D loop were recognized by PriA, we constructed a nested series of DNA-binding substrates that modeled different features of one particular D loop DNA and tested their binding to the enzyme by gel mobility shift analysis. The two basic substrates used to show the specific affinity of PriA for D loops were a bubble DNA consisting of oligos 1 and 2L (Tables I andII) and a D loop DNA consisting of oligos 1, 2L, and 5S (Tables I and II). These DNA-binding substrates were 82 nucleotides (nt) long with a central noncomplementary bubble region of 42 nt flanked by 23 and 17 nt of duplex DNA to the left and right, respectively, as drawn in the figures. The 3′-invading strand (oligo 5S) was 42 nt in length and was complementary to oligo 1. For purposes of clarity, in all diagrams oligo 1 or 1B is presented as the top 5′ → 3′ strand. In the D loop, the invading strand lacked a 5′-tail in order to prevent PriA binding to ssDNA from complicating our analyses. PriA bound the D loop substrate with a Kd of 6 nm, whereas binding to the bubble substrate was barely measurable (Fig. 1). Even though this difference in and of itself suggested that the D loop was in the form of the structure diagramed, we confirmed the structure of the D loop by: (i) demonstrating the presence of distinct electrophoretic mobilities for each of the oligo combinations involved (data not shown), (ii) demonstrating that the invading strand in the D loop could be elongated by DNA polymerase I for the predicted number of nucleotides (Fig. 2B), (iii) demonstrating that all regions predicted to be single-stranded in both the bubble and the D loop were sensitive to cleavage by S1 nuclease, but not to cleavage by DNase I (see the accompanying report, Ref. 20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and (iv) demonstrating that all regions in both the bubble and D loop predicted to be duplex were sensitive to cleavage by DNase I, but not to cleavage by S1 nuclease (see the accompanying report, Ref. 20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Figure 2Analysis of DNA-binding substrates.

Extension of oligo 5 by 23 nt is observed, as predicted by its structure (Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under the conditions of the assay, stable PriA binding could not be detected to either ssDNA or duplex DNA (Fig.3). This suggested that the specific binding of PriA to the D loop DNA arose as a result of PriA recognition of the regions in the D loop where the three strands intersected. We therefore tested the binding of PriA to substrates that mimicked the junctions between single- and double-stranded DNAs in the bubble and D loop substrates. PriA did not bind bubble DNA, this suggested that it should not bind duplex DNA with either a 5′- or 3′-single-stranded extension. To assess if this were correct, a series of substrates were prepared that had a 35-nt long duplex region flanked by either 5′- or 3′-single-stranded tails of varying length. PriA bound with high affinity to duplexes with 3′-tails, whereas it did not bind to duplexes with 5′-tails at all (Fig. 4). High affinity binding (Kd < 10 nm) required a 3′-tail of 16 nt or greater in length. This finding was surprising because PriA could not bind to the bubble even though this structure contained 3′-single-stranded extensions from duplex DNA long enough to promote high affinity binding. We considered that PriA might require a free 3′-single-stranded end to bind to DNA and that lack of binding to the bubble could be explained because there were no such ends in that structure. Accordingly, we assessed PriA binding to an 82-mer duplex DNA containing both a 21-nt (substrate 4) and a 42-nt long (substrate 5) single-stranded gap (Fig.5, A and B). (The integrity of all structures composed of three oligos was confirmed by the existence of a unique electrophoretic mobility on native gels for the three-stranded structure compared with that of a two-stranded structure (Fig. 2 A).) Both of these structures were bound with high affinity. Although we have not demonstrated this directly, the second, slower moving band shift observed with substrate 5 is most likely the result of the binding of two molecules of PriA to the substrate. Because the data in Fig. 5, A and B, could not be used to explain the observed lack of PriA binding to the bubble, we considered that PriA might not be able to bind to gapped DNAs that also had a single-stranded 5 ′-tail on one side of the gap. However, PriA bound with high affinity to this type of a substrate as well (Fig.5 C). PriA does, of course, bind to a gapped duplex with a 3′-tail on one side of the gap (data not shown). Thus, from the data presented, PriA should have bound the bubble DNA. We think it likely that this implies that the single strands in the bubble are not available for PriA binding. Whereas they are clearly not base paired (see the accompanying report, Ref. 20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), they may still be wrapped about each other as in a tangle, rather than in a helical structure with a regular periodicity. We attempted to assess this by preparing bubble substrates where the two noncomplementary strands of the bubble were of different length. If wrapping of the two single strands about each other were a problem, it was possible that these substrates, where there should be 20-nt long single-stranded regions that are not wrapped around another strand and are adjacent to a duplex, might provide the region necessary for PriA binding. Using this substrate, some weak binding could be observed at high concentrations of PriA (Fig. 6). This manifested as a decrease in the amount of free substrate and the generation of a smear extending above the position of free substrate. This is indicative of very unstable binding. No distinct PriA-DNA complexes could be observed. Thus we conclude that in bubble structures, even though the noncomplementary strands are not base paired, they are also not in the same conformation as a single strand in a duplex DNA structure with a 3′-single-stranded tail. Even though PriA could bind duplex DNAs with 3′-tails and did not need a free 3′-end to manifest this activity, it could not bind a bubble. However, in a D loop, the duplex formed by the invading strand and the top strand is likely to be co-helical with the duplexes formed by the flanking sequences. This might prevent tangling of the single-stranded region of the bottom strand. This, in turn, could provide a site for PriA binding at the right-hand three-strand junction of the D loop. If this accounted for PriA binding to the D loop, we would expect to observe a preference for PriA binding to three strand junctions with 3′-single-stranded tails. Accordingly, we investigated this by assessing PriA binding to substrates 8 and 9 (Fig.7). These three-stranded substrates carried either a 5′- or 3′-tail of 8 nt at the junction. These tails are too short to account on their own for any stable binding of PriA to the substrates (Fig. 4). Remarkably, whereas PriA bound both of these substrates, the 5′-tailed substrate was bound with an affinity 30-fold higher than the 3′-tailed substrate (Fig. 7). The Kd for binding to the 5′-tailed substrate was 1.3 nm, which is in close agreement with the Kd for binding to D loop DNA (6 nm). Thus we consider it unlikely that binding of PriA to D loops can be explained by its ability to bind duplex DNA with a 3′-single-stranded tail. Instead, this interaction represents a second mode of PriA binding to DNA. Because PriA bound the 5′- and 3′-tailed substrates with different affinity, it seemed unlikely that it was recognizing the nick in the substrate. The most likely feature responsible for PriA recognition was the bend in the DNA of the tailed oligo at the transition between the double- and single-stranded regions. The duplex regions formed by the three oligos of the substrate will be co-helical. This will force the tail to bend sharply out and away from the axis of the helix. This predicts that creation of a gap at the junction would relieve the necessity of a bend and decrease the affinity of PriA for the substrate. A series of substrates were therefore constructed with increasingly larger gaps at the three-strand junction. Two sets were examined that differed by the presence of a 5′-single-stranded tail at the junction. As already noted, PriA bound a three-strand junction with a 5′-single-stranded tail with high affinity (Fig. 8, B and C). Binding to such a junction in the absence of a tail (i.e. to a nick) was difficult to detect, having a dissociation constant over 105 greater than that of the three-strand junction (Fig. 8, A and C). As the gap between the two bottom strands was enlarged, PriA binding to the structures with the 5′-tail became progressively worse, whereas binding to the structures without the tail actually improved to the point where it could be accurately measured. Nevertheless, binding to the structure containing an 8-nt gap without a tail was still quite poor. This is consistent with our observation that a minimum of 12 nt of ssDNA is required for stable binding of PriA (Fig. 4). We interpret the progressive loss of PriA binding affinity to three-stranded structures with tails as the gap between the two bottom strands increases as indicating that the enzyme is, in fact, recognizing the intersection of the three strands and that the primary recognition feature is the sharp bend made by the tail being forced out of the axis of the helix. This predicts that in a D loop, PriA will bind preferentially to the left-hand junction. This proved to be the case (see accompanying article, Ref. 20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Binding of PriA to bent DNA in three-stranded junctions suggested that the enzyme might also bind similarly bent DNA in either three- or four-way (Holliday) junctions. We could not detect stable, high affinity binding of PriA to either intact three-way junctions, mobile (up to 12 nt of branch migration allowed) or immobile Holliday junctions of two different sequences (data not shown). PriA did bind with good affinity to three-way junctions that had a nick in one strand at the junction (Fig. 9). This strongly suggests that PriA is binding directly to bent DNA at the junction. The inability of PriA to bind bona fide Holliday junctions suggests that those junctions are too inflexible. Recent genetic analyses of the phenotypes of E. coli strains carrying priA null alleles suggested that PriA was likely to participate in assembly of replication forks at recombination intermediates such as D loops (14Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K.-I. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J.

(19McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PriA could bind D loop DNA. In this report, using a series of substrates composed of short oligonucleotides, we have investigated the underlying basis for the specificity of PriA DNA binding activity. PriA shows remarkable discrimination in binding to D loop substrates with very high affinity but not to the corresponding bubble structure at all. PriA possesses a weak ssDNA binding activity as manifested by its ability to bind a ssDNA cellulose column at intermediate salt concentrations and by the fact that it is a ssDNA-dependent ATPase (23Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under the conditions of the gel shift assay used here, PriA binding could not be detected to either ssDNA or duplex DNA. Thus, binding to any of the three duplex regions of the substrate or to the displaced single strand could not account for PriA binding to the D loop. This suggested that PriA was recognizing some distinct structural feature of the D loop that was not found in the bubble. Our analyses indicated that PriA could recognize and bind in a stable fashion to two types of three-strand junctions. PriA could bind to duplex DNA carrying a 3′-single-stranded extension with very high affinity, whereas it could not bind duplex DNA carrying a 5′-single-stranded extension at all. Stable binding could be detected with the 3′-extension when the single-stranded tail exceeded 12 nt in length and high affinity binding resulted when the tails were in excess of 16 nt in length. It seems likely that this mode of binding is a manifestation of the 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity of the enzyme. Stable binding of PriA to duplex DNA with a 3′-tail could result from movement of the protein in the 3′ → 5′ direction along the single strand until it collides with the duplex. Unwinding would not occur because ATP is not present and the protein would thus be paused at the junction. In this scenario PriA would run off the 5′-tails, thus accounting for the lack of binding on those substrates. However, we have demonstrated that unidirectional movement of PriA along ssDNA required ATP hydrolysis (25Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17078-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this is unlikely to be the reason for stable binding to the 3′-tailed duplex. Rather, as suggested by Lohman and Bjornson (26Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) in analyses of DNA helicase action, this mode of PriA binding probably results from an intrinsic ability of the enzyme to recognize such an orientation of duplex DNA and single-stranded tail. This ability to discriminate between 3′- and 5′-tails presumably contributes to the direction elaborated by the DNA helicase activity of the enzyme. The second type of three-strand junction recognized by PriA is one where one strand at the junction forms a sharp bend. In the substrates used, PriA showed a 30-fold preference for junctions where the DNA bend resulted from a 5′-tail, rather than a 3′-tail. It was clear that in this mode of binding PriA was recognizing the bend because: (i) PriA did not bind in a stable fashion to duplex DNAs with 5′-tails, (ii) the tails used on the substrates were too short in any case to promote stable binding even if they were 3′-extensions, and (iii) stable binding, albeit with about one-tenth the affinity, could be observed with three-way junctions that were completely duplex. Similarly, this mode of binding is distinct from the first mode discussed because of the preference for the 5′-tails at the junction and the fact that completely duplex DNA could be recognized. We conclude that it is this second mode of binding that is manifested when PriA binds to D loop DNA. This predicts that the protein should bind preferentially to the left-hand side of the D loop. This is demonstrated directly by DNA footprinting in the accompanying article (20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We were unable to account definitively for the inability of PriA to bind the bubble structure. Given that binding to a duplex region with a 3′-single-stranded tail did not require a free 3′-end, PriA should have been able to bind this substrate. We suspect that even though the single-stranded regions in the bubble are clearly not base paired, because they are susceptible to S1 nuclease (see accompanying article, Ref. 20Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), they are tangled about each other as a result of the free rotation of the flanking duplex regions about their helical axes. This tangling presumably prevents access of PriA to the ssDNA. Based on what we now know about PriA binding to DNA, can we account for the previous observations of specific binding of PriA to regions of DNA derived from bacteriophage and plasmid DNAs? Wickner and Hurwitz (23Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed initially that PriA possessed a specific DNA recognition function by the demonstration that ϕX174 ss(c) DNA was a 7–8-fold better effector of the PriA ATPase activity than f1 ss(c) DNA. This paralleled the relative activity of the ϕX174-type primosome in DNA replication supported by these two DNAs as templates. Shlomai and Kornberg (27Sholmai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6794-6798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the discrimination shown by PriA toward these two DNAs in the ATPase assay increased to nearly 100-fold if the DNAs were coated by SSB. Specific stimulation of the PriA ATPase activity could be attributed to a 55-nt long DNA sequence located in the ϕX174 intergenic space (28Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This region was resistant to digestion by exonuclease VII, suggesting that it possessed extensive secondary structure. Indeed, the DNA sequence could be folded on paper into a hairpin-like structure with a ΔG of −14 kcal/mol. This DNA region also served as the assembly site for the primosome (5Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subsequently we demonstrated that there were two such sites on ColE1-type plasmid DNAs, one on each strand, that were active only when the DNA was in single-stranded form (29Zipursky S.L. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although only one of these was resistant to digestion by exonuclease VII, they both could be folded into hairpin structures on paper (30Marians K.J. Soeller W. Zipursky S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5656-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Soeller W. Abarzúa P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis demonstrated that single point mutations that inactivated the site destabilized the putative secondary structure by disrupting base pairs. Single revertent point mutations could be selected in some cases that restored the base pair by altering the partner nucleotide (31Soeller W. Abarzúa P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Abarzúa P. Soeller W. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14286-14292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, high concentrations of SSB could melt the sites and inactivate them (33Greenbaum J.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12266-12272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that PriA was recognizing some specific structural aspect of these DNAs and named them primosome assembly sites (34Marians K.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 153-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Subsequently, primosome assembly site sequences were found on the F plasmid (35Imber R. Low R. Ray D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7132-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and on several extrachromosomal DNAs (36Nomura N. Masai H. Inuzuka M. Miyazaki C. Ohtsubo E. Itoh T. Sasamoto S. Mataui M. Ishizaki R. Arai K.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Masai H. Nomura N. Kubota Y. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15124-15133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, such sites were never found on E. coli chromosomal DNA. PriA recognition of primosome assembly site sequences may result from either mode of binding described here. Formation of a stable hairpin structure in ss(c) DNA in the presence of SSB may cause the DNA at the junction of the hairpin and SSB-coated DNA to bend sharply, providing a recognition feature. Alternatively, the formation of the hairpin may generate an SSB-free region at its base of sufficient size to allow PriA recognition of a 3′-single-stranded extension from a duplex DNA. Further investigation will be required to distinguish between these two possibilities."

Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar. One of the earliest responses to type I interferons is the increased transcription of the ISG15 1gene, which is controlled by a 5′ interferon-stimulated response element (1Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight E. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The sequence of the resulting 17.1-kDa ISG15 protein, also known as the ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP), is composed of two ubiquitin-like domains that retain the canonical LRLRGG sequence required for conjugation of ubiquitin to intracellular targets as the committed step for 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation (3Korant B.D. Blomstrom D.C. Jonak G.J. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14835-14839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol.

The biological effects of ISG15 are similarly mediated by its covalent conjugation to a small subset of cellular proteins through an enzyme pathway that is distinct from that of ubiquitin ligation (5Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Both free and conjugated ISG15 pools are significantly induced following exposure to interferon-α/β; however, in contrast to the homeostatic mechanism that maintains a constant ratio of free to conjugated ubiquitin (7Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 345-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two pools of ISG15 exhibit a characteristic biphasic induction during which free polypeptide increases early during the interferon response and then undergoes increased conjugation from 12 to 72 h (5Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ISG15 polypeptide acts in trans to noncovalently bind associated target proteins and model chimeric constructs to intermediate filaments 2S. N. Twigger and A. L. Haas, submitted for publication.; in contrast, free ISG15 shows only marginal affinity for binding to these cytoskeletal components (8Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Neither free nor conjugated ubiquitin levels are affected by interferon treatment, indicating that up-regulation of ISG15 ligation is a specific and independently regulated response (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ISG15 was the first example of a small class of ubiquitin-like proteins that includes SUMO-1,3Nedd8, 4The plant ortholog of Nedd8 is termed Rub1. and Ubl1 (reviewed in Refs. 9Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 10Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These proteins exhibit significant sequence similarity to ubiquitin and, with the exception of ISG15, contain single ubiquitin domains (11Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although SUMO-1 and Nedd8 polypeptides are found throughout eukaryotes (9Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), search of the complete yeast genome has identified no candidate ISG15 ortholog, indicating that this regulatory pathway represents a relatively recent functional divergence. 5A. L. Haas, unpublished observations. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins are synthesized as precursors bearing carboxyl-terminal extensions, which range in size from short polypeptides to complete protein domains (12Jentsch S. Seufert W. Hauser H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Expression of the carboxyl-terminal GTEPGGRS extension peptide of pro-ISG15 minimizes degradation of the nascent polypeptide, presumably through a kinetic folding effect.2 Although the function(s) of the unrelated extension peptides on newly synthesized chains of ubiquitin and the other ubiquitin-like proteins is unknown, their presence requires processing of the precursor protein to expose the carboxyl-terminal glycine required in isopeptide bond formation to their respective targets. In addition, correct processing is required for a novel extracellular cytokine function for ISG15 involving induction of CD56+ natural killer cell proliferation, augmentation of non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxicity, and T-cell interferon-β induction (13D'Cunha J. Knight E.J. Haas A.L. Truitt R.L. Borden E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Processing of the pro-ISG15 carboxyl-terminal extension occurs rapidly without significant accumulation of the precursor (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8811-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as is generally characteristic for processing of the entire class. A large family of enzymes has been described that act proteolytically at the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin to generate the free polypeptide from fusion proteins, ubiquitin-protein conjugates, multiubiquitin chains that serve as degradation signals for 26 S proteasome specificity, and small molecule adducts arising by reaction of cellular nucleophiles with activated intermediates of ubiquitin (15Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These enzymes collectively belong to the family of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases (UCH), which have been arbitrarily divided into two subfamilies based on molecular weight, sequence homology, and leaving group specificity (15Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Family 1 is composed of low molecular mass (∼30 kDa) enzymes, of which three tissue-specific mammalian isozymes (L1, L2, and L3) have been described (15Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 17Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7903-7910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that have related orthologs in yeast and Drosophila (16Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These enzymes are believed to function in generating mature ubiquitin from the precursor fusion proteins and in salvaging ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal adducts, based on observations that this class prefers small leaving groups or extended polypeptide chains (15Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Family 2 encompasses the ubiquitin-specific proteases and the deubiquitinating enzymes, which exhibit considerable heterogeneity in size (50–300 kDa) and show little sequence homology except for conserved cysteine and histidine motifs containing the active site residues (16Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Over 11 members of this family have been described in yeast with orthologs identified in mammals and Drosophila (16Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This family of ubiquitin proteases functions to release free ubiquitin from ubiquitin-protein conjugates and their polyubiquitin degradation signals (16Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The large number of UCH enzymes suggests a wide variety of cellular functions and/or potential roles with other ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present work, we identify two pro-ISG15 processing activities in cell extracts of the human lung carcinoma line A549. A minor activity (<1%) is probably a member of the UCH isozyme family, based on molecular weight and competitive inhibition by free ubiquitin. In contrast, free ubiquitin is a positive allosteric effector of the major activity, which shares features of family 2 with respect to size and apparent catalytic mechanism. Partial sequencing following purification of the latter processing enzyme to apparent homogeneity suggests this activity is either the human ortholog of the yeast family 2 enzyme Ubp1 or a Ubp1-like protein. These observations suggest that an existing ubiquitin-specific enzyme has been recruited for pro-ISG15 processing by adaptive divergence. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma and purified to apparent homogeneity (18Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human recombinant interferon-β containing a C17S mutation to enhance stability was supplied by Triton Biosciences. Recombinant pro-ISG15 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pET11d-ISG17 plasmid. Purification of pro-ISG15 was carried out as described previously for mature recombinant ISG15 (6Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with the exception that inclusion of CoCl2 during isolation was omitted inasmuch as carboxypeptidase inactivation by cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide from ISG15 was precluded by the presence of the carboxyl-terminal extension peptide present on the precursor. The resulting recombinant pro-ISG15 was >99% pure by SDS-PAGE when visualized by silver staining. The concentration of pro-ISG15 was determined spectrophotometrically using the empirically determined ε280 nm of 0.79 ml/mg·cm for mature ISG15 (6Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) corrected for the molecular weight difference. Typical yields of pro-ISG15 were 2–3 mg/liter culture (A600 nm=1.0). Purified pro-ISG15 could be stored for several months at −80 °C without a significant effect on processing activity and was unaffected by at least three freeze-thaw cycles. The pro-ISG15-Y mutant bearing an additional tyrosine residue after Ser165 of the extension peptide was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 19-mer forward primer encompassing the T7 promoter of the pET11d vector and a 39-mer reverse primer in which a tyrosine codon was engineered between the carboxyl-terminal serine of pro-ISG15 and the STOP codon followed by a Bam HI restriction site. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with Nco I and Bam HI, then ligated into Nco I/Bam HI-digested pET11d. After transformation into E. coli DH5α, the vector containing the mutant protein was isolated and the sequence confirmed by the dideoxy method (19Sanger M.L. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the pro-ISG15-Y mutant was identical to that for the wild type protein, yielding 2 mg/liter culture (A600 nm=1.0) that was >99% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining. The presence of the tyrosine residue in the purified mutant protein was confirmed by amino acid analysis by the Medical College of Wisconsin Protein and Nucleic Acid Shared Facility and laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. The absolute quantity of pro-ISG15-Y was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated extinction coefficient of ε280 nm = 0.85 ml/mg·cm. Control studies demonstrated that pro-ISG15-Y was processed at the same rate as the wild type pro-ISG15, indicating no significant structural differences between the two proteins. This has been independently confirmed by the quantitatively similar circular dichroism spectra for mature and precursor forms of ISG15. The mutant protein was radiolabeled with IODOGEN (Pierce) as described previously (6Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), except that the iodination reaction was carried out for 15 min to preferentially label the additional carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue rather than the two internal tyrosines present in ISG15. Specific activities ranged from 160 to 1600 dpm/pmol, with ∼2% of the total pro-ISG15-Y bearing the radiolabel. Based on the sequence and secondary structure similarities between ubiquitin and ISG15, the carboxyl terminus of pro-ISG15 is assumed to be solvent-exposed whereas the two internal tyrosine residues are buried and thus less accessible to radioiodination. Product analysis after the processing of 125I-pro-ISG15-Y revealed no detectable signal present in mature ISG15, confirming that the label was exclusively at the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine. The pro-ISG15 processing activity was monitored either by a SDS-PAGE gel-shift assay exploiting the molecular weight difference between pro-ISG15 and the mature polypeptide or by the release of the radiolabeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble carboxyl-terminal extension peptide from 125I-pro-ISG15-Y. For the gel shift assay, reactions of 20 μl final volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, and 5–25 μm pro-ISG15 were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of A549 105 × g supernatant. At the indicated times, incubations were quenched by adding an equivalent volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Unprocessed pro-ISG15 and the mature ISG15 product were resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Following sequential incubation of blots with affinity-purified anti-ISG15 or anti-ubiquitin antibodies (10 μg/ml) and 125I-Protein A (2 × 105 cpm/ml), immunospecifically bound antibody was visualized by autoradiography as described previously (5Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Product ISG15 was quantitated by excising the bands from the dried blot, determining the associated radioactivity by γ counting, and comparing the latter to that obtained with parallel recombinant ISG15 standards. The addition of a tyrosine residue at the carboxyl terminus of pro-ISG15 allowed the processing reaction to be followed by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity representing the cleaved peptide bearing the labeled tyrosine residue. Incubations were carried out as described for the gel shift assay but were quenched by addition of 0.2 ml each of 5 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin and 20% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Quenched reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was quantitatively transferred to another tube and the pellet washed with 0.2 ml of ice-cold 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, which was combined with the supernatant. Both the pellet and the supernatant were counted. Radioactivity present in the supernatant was corrected for label present in a 0-min blank that generally represented <10% of the total radioactivity. Subsequent studies to be described below demonstrated that the major pro-ISG15 processing activity exhibited a linear dependence on substrate concentration below 0.6 μm and was stimulated by the presence of free ubiquitin. Therefore, a unit of processing activity was defined as the quantity required to produce 1 pmol/min mature ISG15 at pH 7.5 and 37 °C in the presence of 5 μm pro-ISG15, 25 μm ubiquitin, and 1 mm DTT. Human A549 lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Monolayer cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml with one change of medium 24 h after seeding and were harvested at confluence (approximately 48 h after seeding) without further manipulation. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm DTT at a concentration of ∼108 cells/ml, followed by sonication for 10 s. The broken cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and 105 × g for 90 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction, which was flash-frozen in small aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Cell cytosol (15–50 mg of cellular protein) was applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column equilibrated at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm DTT at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear 0–0.5 mNaCl gradient (10 mm/ml). Mono Q fractions representing the major processing activity were pooled and adjusted to 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and then applied to 2.5 × 36-cm preparative Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow FPLC column (2 ml/min) equilibrated at 4 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and 1 mm DTT. Bound protein was eluted with a linear 1–0m ammonium sulfate gradient (−5 mm/min) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing pro-ISG15 processing activity were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT. The enzyme was stable for several months when flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C but lost activity with successive freeze-thaw cycles. Processing reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm DTT and were quenched by addition of 0.2 ml each of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and then allowed to set on ice for 10 min. Control studies demonstrated that trifluoroacetic acid quantitatively precipitated unprocessed125I-pro-ISG15-Y and the mature ISG15 product. Following centrifugation of quenched samples for 10 min at 14,000 ×g, the supernatant containing the processed carboxyl-terminal extension peptide was quantitatively removed and the trifluoroacetic acid volatilized in vacuo. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a 4 × 250-mm Bio-Sil ODS-5S reverse phase C18 HPLC column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (0.7 ml/min). Bound peptide was eluted with a linear 0–60% acetonitrile gradient (2.1%/ml) and was monitored at 215 nm. The 100-kDa pro-ISG15 processing enzyme obtained after Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 5) was resolved from minor contaminants by 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, after which the sample was electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-CD membrane and visualized by fluorescamine staining. The 100-kDa band was excised from the blot and then extracted from the Immobilon membrane by incubation in 70% (v/v) formic acid. Following vacuum centrifugation, the dry protein was dissolved in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and then digested for 2 h at room temperature with 1% by weight of TPCK-treated sequencing grade trypsin. A second aliquot of trypsin was added, and the incubation was allowed to continue an additional 2 h. The resulting sample was lyophilized, washed twice with water, and dissolved in 20 μl of 5% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile. The peptide mixture was resolved by reverse phase chromatography using a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC fitted with a 2 × 150-mm UltraSphere (Beckman) column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (40 °C). Sample was applied at 0.2 ml/min and bound peptide detected at 215 nm following elution with a linear 5–65% acetonitrile gradient. Fractions containing a well resolved, apparently homogeneous peak were pooled and dried in vacuo, after which the resulting peptide was sequenced on a Beckman/Porton LF3000 peptide sequencer. Incubation of recombinant pro-ISG15 with an A549 post-ribosomal supernatant obtained from uninduced confluent cultures results in the appearance of an anti-ISG15 immunoreactive band that comigrated with authentic mature ISG15 when analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). Endogenous free ISG15 present in the cell extract is not detected at the exposure time chosen for the autoradiogram of Fig. 1. An absolute rate for pro-ISG15 processing of 4.2 pmol/min/106 cells was calculated by quantitating mature ISG15 associated 125I radioactivity by γ counting and comparing to signal obtained from an authentic recombinant mature ISG15 standard (Fig. 1, left lane). That equivalent amounts of mature and precursor forms of ISG15 yield similar autoradiographic intensities (Fig. 1, left lanes) indicates that the presence of the carboxyl-terminal extension peptide does not significantly affect binding of the affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Similar pro-ISG15 processing is observed for A549 extracts harvested after 24 h of treatment in the presence of 103 IU/ml interferon-β, a concentration previously shown to yield maximum rates of ISG15 induction (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Elevated levels of endogenous mature ISG15 are evident in the blank sample (lanes B) obtained prior to addition of exogenous pro-ISG15 and in the 0-min lane quenched prior to addition of the substrate (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the absolute amounts of mature ISG15 in the interferon-β-induced incubations and correction for that introduced with the A549 extract yielded a linear rate for pro-ISG15 processing of 4.4 pmol/min/106 cells. These results indicate that pro-ISG15 processing activity is constitutively present in uninduced cells and is not significantly affected by interferon treatment, confirming earlier qualitative results from pulse-chase experiments (3Korant B.D. Blomstrom D.C. Jonak G.J. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14835-14839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When incubations similar to those of Fig. 1 are extended to longer times, a progressive loss of pro-ISG15 and appearance of the mature product is observed when probed with anti-ISG15 antibody (Fig.2 A). Approximately 5% of the initial pro-ISG15 remained at the longest times examined (Fig.2 B). The residual unreacted pro-ISG15 was not due to inactivation of the processing activity inasmuch as no further loss of pro-ISG15 was observed when an additional aliquot of fresh A549 cell extract was added (data not shown). Inability of the processing enzyme to convert the remaining fraction of substrate likely represents denaturation of pro-ISG15, consistent with the complete absence of processing by fresh extracts in the presence of heat denatured pro-ISG15 (data not shown). Both the decline in pro-ISG15 and appearance of the mature product displayed rigorous first order kinetics over 10 half-lives (solid lines in Fig.2 B) for which first order rate constants of 0.53 h−1 and 0.58 h−1, respectively, were determined from nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data in Fig.2 B. Quantitation of the Western blot showed that appearance of mature ISG15 accounted for 78% of the pro-ISG15 lost, the remaining 22% likely resulting from incomplete degradation of the polypeptide by the extracts. Identical samples from the upper panel of Fig. 2 A were also probed with affinity-purified anti-ubiquitin antibodies, which displayed a reduced recognition for pro-ISG15 compared with the mature polypeptide. Previous work has shown that the anti-ubiquitin antibodies are directed against an epitope(s) in the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide, accounting for the ability of these immunoprobes to discriminate between free and conjugated ubiquitin (20Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the carboxyl-terminal LRLRGG is conserved between ubiquitin and ISG15, it is reasonable that the anti-ubiquitin antibodies can readily detect mature ISG15. As the anti-ubiquitin antibody provided a significantly improved signal to noise ratio for Western blot quantitation of the mature ISG15 band when poorly resolved from pro-ISG15, these antibodies were used in subsequent gel shift assays. Resolution of the A549 post-ribosomal supernatant on a Mono Q HR10/10 anion exchange FPLC column results in two peaks of activity (Fig.3). The smaller peak consistently represented 10% of the recovered activity eluted at 0.18 mNaCl (Peak 1), whereas the major peak of activity eluted at 0.27 m NaCl (Peak 2). Separate control studies confirmed that the processing activities were unaffected by NaCl concentrations present in the fractions (data not shown). The activity in peak 1 eluted at a native molecular mass of 31 kDa when subsequently resolved by Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography (data not shown); in addition, processing activity by peak 1 was competitively inhibited by 50 μm ubiquitin (data not shown), a concentration approximating that of the free polypeptide in this cell line (5Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two observations suggested that the activity contained in peak 1 represented a member of the UCH family 1; however, this activity was not human UCH-L3 inasmuch as an authentic recombinant sample of this enzyme failed to act on pro-ISG15 (data not shown). The relative native molecular mass of the activity in peak 2 proved to be 100 kDa by Superose 12 chromatography (data not shown). At higher concentrations of sampl"

Crystal structures of collagen-binding regions of the human integrin α2β1 and a Staphylococcus aureus adhesin reveal a “trench” on the surface of both of these proteins.

Cna from S. aureus FDA 574 is depicted in Fig.1 a: it contains two major domains, A and B, in addition to features characteristic of cell-surface proteins on Gram-positive bacteria (11Patti J.M. Boles J.O. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11428-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The collagen-binding site has been localized within the Cna A domain (12Patti J.M. Jonsson H. Guss B. Switalski L.M. Wiberg K. Lindberg M. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4766-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding analyses demonstrate that (i) a synthetic peptide mimicking a short sequence of the A domain can inhibit collagen binding to S. aureus (8Patti J.M. House-Pompeo K. Boles J.O. Garza N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12005-12011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); (ii) the A domain/collagen interaction involves more than one affinity class and multiple sites of contact within a single collagen molecule (8Patti J.M.

Höök M. Methods (Orlando). 1994; 6: 134-142Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and (iii) the B domain does not alter the collagen binding ability of the A domain (13Rich R.L. Demeler B. Ashby K. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Petrich J.W. Patti J.M. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15423-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a truncated form of the Cna A domain reveals a binding-site “trench” on one face of the protein. In molecular modeling studies, this trench was found to accommodate a triple-helical peptide that mimics the collagen structure. Symersky et al. (7Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K. Teale M. Moore D. Jin L. Schneider A. DeLucas L.J. Höök M. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) noted that this trench complemented well the structure of a collagen triple helix and binding studies of site-specific mutants of the S. aureus Cna truncate revealed that (i) no single residue or area within the trench was responsible for collagen binding, but rather, a number of contacts contributed to the protein/collagen interaction and (ii) this binding-domain truncate bound to multiple sites along a collagen molecule. The affinity of Cna for an individual site within collagen may be the consequence of the number of “good” and “bad” contacts within the binding trench. Binding of eukaryotic cells to collagen serves not only as a mechanism of tissue adherence, but also may induce a complex signaling cascade in the cell. Attachment of eukaryotic cells to the extracellular matrix is primarily mediated by integrins. The integrins are transmembrane αβ heterodimeric proteins that direct cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and are found on most mammalian cells. To date, several integrins, including α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α9β1, α10β1, and αMβ2, have been reported to mediate cellular adherence to collagen (14Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 504SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Forsberg E. Ek B. Engström Å. Johansson S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Wayner E.A.

Cell Res. 1995; 218: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of these, α1β1 and α2β1are apparently the primary collagen-binding integrins. The α1, α2, and α10 subunits each contain an “inserted” (I) domain near the N terminus (Fig.1 c). The I domains have been shown to contain a ligand-binding site and a MIDAS motif, which needs to be occupied by an appropriate cation for effective ligand binding by the integrin. Recombinant proteins duplicating these small (approximately 200 amino acids) I domain polypeptide segments effectively bind collagen, presumably it is these regions that are responsible for the integrins' binding to collagens. A binding site-trench in the I domain of the human α2β1 integrin was also suggested by the crystal structure of the α2 integrin I domain. Molecular modeling of this protein complexed with a collagen triple-helical peptide (19Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) demonstrated favorable ligand docking encompassing about 10 residues of the collagen sequence within a trench spanning the MIDAS motif. From this work Liddington and co-workers (19Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) suggested that the divalent cation is involved in direct ligand binding via coordination of an amino acid residue (most probably, glutamate) within the collagen molecule. Our previous work has shown that the full-length A domain of the S. aureus Cna protein binds collagen more efficiently than the binding-domain truncate does (7Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K. Teale M. Moore D. Jin L. Schneider A. DeLucas L.J. Höök M. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Patti J.M. House-Pompeo K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4766-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The causes of this behavior have not been investigated to date. In addition, detailed analysis of collagen-binding activity of the human α1integrin I domain, which binds Type I collagen more efficiently than the α2 integrin I domain does (14Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 504SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), has not been performed. The questions we seek to answer here include: (a) can the gross structure of I domains and the detailed topology of their MIDAS-centered binding site be determined from modeling experiments based on known structures? (b) Is a trench similar to that found on Cna the binding-site motif employed by the α1β1 integrin? (c) Does the α1 integrin I domain bind to a single or multiple class(es) of sites within a collagen macromolecule? To address these questions, we compare the structures and collagen-binding characteristics of the S. aureus Cna A and the human α1 integrin I domains. The expression plasmid pQE-α1I was constructed based on the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) using standard molecular biology protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatas T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 21Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the I domain of the human α1 integrin was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a human hepatoma cDNA library as a template and the oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CGGATCCCCCACATTTCAAGTCGTGAAT-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAGTCATATTCTTTCTCCCAGAGTTTT-3′. The amplified gene fragment was digested with the Bam HI and the Pst I restriction endonucleases, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Geneclean kit, ISC BioExpress), and ligated into the vector pQE-30 (previously linearized by digestion with the same endonucleases). Ligation mixtures were subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM101. Plasmids from isolated transformants were analyzed by restriction digestions and automated DNA sequencing analysis (Molecular Genetics Core Facility, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX) to confirm the expected open reading frame. The α1 integrin I domain sequence examined here corresponds to the sequence published by Briesewitz et al. (22Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for nucleotide substitutions resulting in Lys174 → Glu and Thr230 → Ile. The α1 integrin I domain cDNA was also cloned into the glutathione S-transferase expression vector pGEX-KG (23Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochemistry. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-α1I fusion proteins were purified by chromatography over glutathione-agarose and cleaved by digestion with thrombin as described in Ref. 23Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochemistry. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar. The construction of a plasmid for the expression of the Cna A domain has been previously described and consists of the gene segment encoding the S. aureus collagen MSCRAMM amino acids Ala30-Glu531 cloned between the Bam HI and Sal I restriction sites of the pQE-30 expression vector (13Rich R.L. Demeler B. Ashby K. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Petrich J.W. Patti J.M. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15423-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Large-scale preparations of recombinant protein were prepared and purified as follows. Overnight cultures (40 ml) of stationary-phase bacteria were used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria broth and the cells were allowed to grow for 2.5 h at 37 °C (OD600 nm ∼ 0.6). Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a minimal volume of 4 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.9, before being frozen at −80 °C. Induced bacteria were thawed and passed through a French press (11,000 p.s.i) twice to lyse the cells. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 6.67 mm and the lysates were applied to a 10 × 100-mm column of Ni2+-charged iminodiacetic acid/Sepharose. The column was washed with 50 ml of 4 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.9, and bound protein eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–200 mm imidazole in 4 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.9. Fractions containing the desired protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration system. The isolated proteins were essentially pure and appeared as single bands on an overloaded SDS-PAGE gel. The isolated recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 3 × 1-liter changes of 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to remove all cations, and then dialyzed against 3 × 1-liter changes of 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to remove EDTA. All buffers for the α1 integrin I domain protein also contained 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; the justification for adding a reducing agent to this sample solution is discussed below. During our initial analyses of the recombinant His6 tag α1 integrin I domain protein, we observed gradual precipitation of the protein within several days post-purification when the solution was kept at 4 °C. The presence of dimeric and higher-order multimers of the recombinant α1 integrin I domain protein in the solution was apparent by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol delayed the protein precipitation for several weeks. All studies discussed here are the analyses of recombinant α1 integrin I domain within 2 weeks of expression and purification and in buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, unless noted otherwise. The far-UV CD spectra of freshly purified α1 integrin I domain in the presence and absence of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol were identical (data not shown). Also, the SPR sensorgrams of freshly purified α1 integrin I domain flowed over immobilized collagen in the presence and absence of 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol are identical (data not shown). The sensorgrams measured over a period of days for the α1 integrin I domain protein flowed over collagen in buffer containing the reducing agent remain unchanged; repeating this experiment in the absence of the reducing agent, however, revealed the gradual increase in association and decrease in dissociation of the protein-collagen complex over time. After approximately 2 weeks, the sensorgrams for the α1integrin I domain in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol duplicated those published previously (24Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kühn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The increase in apparent affinity of the α1 integrin I domain protein after storage for collagen may be due to the contribution of multiple I domain elements in the protein aggregate binding at one location within the collagen macromolecule. The addition of the reducing agent is therefore necessary to preserve the monomeric state of the recombinant protein and does not alter its structure or function.

No mass transport effects were observed in these measurements. The data for the construction of the Scatchard plots was obtained from the equilibrium portion of the SPR sensorgrams and analyzed as described. 2Rich, R. L., Kreikemeyer, B., Owens, R.

For wells in which the buffer included MgCl2, all washes and incubations were performed in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. The equilibrium dialysis experiments were carried out in a double acrylic microdialysis module (Hoffer, San Francisco, CA) as described by Yang et al. (26Yang V.W.-C. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C.

Aliquots of 150 μl of thrombin-cleaved α1 integrin I domain protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, were added to the inner compartments. The same volume of 0–5 mmultrapure MgCl2 (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was added to the outer compartments. After incubation, the concentration of Mg2+ in the outer compartments was determined using a Mg2+ detection kit (Sigma). An aliquot of 10 μl from each outer compartment and 100 μl of each kit component were mixed. The reaction was immediate and sample absorbance was measured at 525 nm using a Molecular Devices plate-reading visible spectrophotometer.

Recombinant His6 tag α1 integrin I domain protein in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0, was further purified using a 300 × 7.5 Bio-sil-TSK125 gel-filtration column. The protein solution was then concentrated to 20 mg/ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration system and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0. Crystallization trials were set up using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. High quality crystals were obtained from a droplet made by mixing 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of 31% PEG2000, 50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5 (solution A), and equilibrating it against 1 ml of solution A. Crystals were prism-shaped, with the largest having dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm. Crystals were soaked in a synthetic mother liquor containing 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant and subsequently cryo-cooled using the Oxford cryosystem (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, United Kingdom). X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.0-Å resolution using a RAXIS IV imaging plate system mounted on a RIGAKU RU-HBR rotating-anode generator (50 kV, 100 mA). A complete native data set was collected over 99 frames (oscillation of 2°, exposure time of 20 min, and crystal-to-image plate distance of 150 mm). The frames were indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The scaled data had 99% completeness, where 71.5% of the data in the last shell was above 3ς level with an Rsym value of 6.1%. The calculated Matthews coefficient, Vm, was 1.9 Å3 Da−1, suggesting two molecules exist in the asymmetric unit with an estimated solvent content of 35%.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the recombinant His6 tag α1 integrin I domain was determined by the molecular replacement method using the CCP4 integrated version of AmoRe (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar, 30Collaborative Computer Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). We used the molecular model of the human complement factor B middle domain as the initial molecular replacement unit (31Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix and all the connecting loops were removed from the starting molecular replacement search model, which had 109 residues. Repeated rounds of rigid-body refinement and checking for acceptable crystal packing helped us to identify two solutions having high correlation factors and the lowest R-factors (0.62 and 41%, respectively, for 8.0–4.5-Å resolution data). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were not related by an exact 2-fold non-crystallographic axis. Next, the side chains of the correctly positioned model were replaced with the corresponding homologous side chains of the α1 integrin I domain. Rigid body refinement to 3.0-Å resolution, where the individual secondary structural elements were treated as independent units in XPLOR (32Brunger A.T. X-PLOR manual, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), resulted in an R- factor of 39% and Rfree (calculated on 10% of the reflections) of 44%. Several rounds of manual refitting to 2 Fo − Fc maps using the graphics program “O” (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and positional refinement in XPLOR were done while extending the resolution to 2.5 Å in small increments. At this stage, the R-factor was 31%, Rfree value was 41%, and a 2 Fo − Fc map calculated had visible density for the missing C-terminal helix and for most of the deleted loop regions. At this juncture, the resolution was extended to the final 2.0 Å and two rounds of simulated annealing and model rebuilding led to the tracing of the complete C-terminal end. After one refinement cycle of individual B-factors (r= 26% and Rfree = 30%), water molecules were added to the model by picking the peaks above 3ς level in a calculated (Fo − Fc) difference map. Two of these water molecules were identified as metal ions based on their bonding geometry. The OOPS program (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 208-230Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was used throughout the cycles of rebuilding for quality checks. The cross-validated maximum likelihood refinements were performed with CNS-0.4 (35Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Baugen A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Bulk solvent corrections were applied in the last few cycles of refinement. The final refinement yielded 229 water molecules, two Mg2+ions, 3008 non-hydrogen atoms, and four cis-prolines. For 24,537 reflections (out of 24,807 reflections) between 100.0 and 2.0-Å resolution, the final R-factor was 20.6% and Rfree was 24.3%. The final structure was checked using PROCHECK (36Morris A.C.

We investigated the possibility that the anti-hypertrophic actions of ANF involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction cascade. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated for 48 h with the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) had an 80% increase in cross-sectional area (CSA). ANF alone had no effect but inhibited PE-induced increases in CSA by approximately 50%. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD098059 minimally inhibited PE-induced increases in CSA, but it completely abolished ANF-induced inhibition of PE-induced increases. ANF-induced extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) nuclear translocation was also eliminated by PD098059. ANF treatment caused MEK phosphorylation and activation but failed to activate any of the Raf isoforms. ANF induced a rapid increase in ERK phosphorylation and in vitro kinase activity. PE also increased ERK activity, and the combined effect of ANF and PE appeared to be additive. ANF-induced ERK phosphorylation was eliminated by PD098059. ANF induced minimal phosphorylation of JNK or p38, indicating that its effect on ERK was specific. ANF-induced activation of ERK was mimicked by cGMP analogs, suggesting that ANF-induced ERK activation involves the guanylyl cyclase activity of the ANF receptor. These data suggest that there is an important linkage between cGMP signaling and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and that selective ANF activation of ERK is required for the anti-hypertrophic action of ANF. Thus, ANF expression might function as the natural defense of the heart against maladaptive hypertrophy through its ability to activate ERK."

Although Tub is expressed in the key hypothalamic nuclei that have been implicated in the central control of energy homeostasis, it is not known whether Tub plays a regulatory role in the central mechanisms that control body weight. Alternatively, the weight gain observed in tubby mice may be due to a loss of cells in the hypothalamic nuclei that regulate body weight homeostasis accompanied by gradual loss of function as it occurs in the retina and cochlea of these animals. The most striking feature of the Tub family of proteins is a highly conserved C terminus. Specifically, the last 250 amino acids are 55–95% identical across species, suggesting that this domain may perform a very ancient and basic function. In contrast, the N-terminal portion of Tub and Tub-like proteins are poorly conserved. The mutation in tubby mice is a G-to-T transversion in the 3′ coding region of the tub gene that abolishes a donor splice site and results in the generation of a larger transcript containing the unspliced intron (7Kleyn P.W. Fan W. Kovats S.G. Lee J.J. Pulido J.C. Wu Y. Berkemeier L.R. Misumi D.J. Holmgren L. Charlat O. Woolf E.A. Tayber O. Brody T. Shu P. Hawkins F. Kennedy B. Baldini L. Ebeling C. Alperin G.D. Deeds J.

Interestingly, this mutation disrupts the highly conserved C terminus and is predicted to generate a Tub mutant protein in which the last 44 amino acids are replaced with 20 amino acids not found in the wild type protein. To gain insight into the role of Tub we searched for motifs that might be relevant for function (see Fig. 1). Tub encodes a highly hydrophilic protein containing putative tyrosine phosphorylation and SH21-docking sites. No membrane-spanning domain(s) or signal sequence peptide motif(s) were identified. Phosphotyrosine-mediated interactions with SH2-containing signaling proteins have been shown to play an important role in intracellular signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 9Cantley L.C. Auger K.R.

Cell. 1996; 85: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor initiates a cascade of events that lead to the phosphorylation of downstream targets, including the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a member of a growing family of adaptor proteins that link upstream kinases to downstream signaling pathways (18White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 binds to various SH2-containing signaling molecules, including p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2, SHP2, and Nck, linking the insulin receptor to a myriad of signaling pathways that have been implicated in mediating the cellular responses to insulin including growth and metabolic signals (reviewed in 18). By analogy to IRS-1, we postulated that Tub may function downstream of the insulin receptor. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that Tub can serve as a substrate for the insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, in addition to phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, Tub is phosphorylated in vitro by Abl and JAK2 but not by EGFR and Src protein-tyrosine kinases. We also show insulin-enhanced association of Tub with SH2 domains, suggesting a functional role for Tub as an adaptor protein, linking the insulin receptor to downstream signaling cascades. CHO cells stably expressing the wild type human insulin receptor (CHO-IR) (19White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The CHO-IR cells were a generous gift of Dr. Morris White (Joslin Institute, Harvard Medical School). PC12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum. The anti-Tub serum was raised against full-length His6-tagged wild type Tub (murine) and was kindly provided by Dr. Rene Devos (Roche-Gent Research Institute). The anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (RC20H) is from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), whereas the mouse monoclonal 4G10 was acquired from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-PLCγ1 antibodies used were mouse monoclonal clone 10 from Transduction Laboratories, and the rabbit polyclonal (530) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse wild type Tub cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from mouse brain total cDNA. The coding region was verified by sequencing. To enhance the translation efficiency of the cDNA, site directed mutagenesis was used to place a “Kozak” translation initiation consensus motif at the ATG of the cDNA (ggatCCACC ATG). In addition to this mutation, for ease of subcloning, an Eco RI site was introduced just 3′ of the cDNA termination codon. To aid in the detection of Tub protein during transfections, WT-Tub was introduced as 5′-Bam HI > Eco RI-3′ restriction fragments into the pN10 3X flu (HA) transient expression vector. The N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit) and Abl-SH2 were kindly provided by Dr. Lewis C. Cantley (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School) and Dr. Richard Van Etten (Center for Blood Research, Harvard Medical School), respectively. All others were obtained from commercial sources (Upstate Biotechnology). GST-Tub was generated by introducing Tub as a 5′-Bam HI > Eco RI-3′ restriction fragment into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DH5α, transformed with plasmids containing the above GST-SH2 fusion proteins, were grown in LB, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm), and lysed as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 16.7Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as suggested by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CHO-IR cells were split 1:5 onto 100-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection. We used the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method to transfect CHO-IR cells with either empty expression vector (pN10) or the expression vector containing HA-tagged Tub (8 μg/100 mm plate). The medium was replaced 24 h post-transfection with serum-free RPMI, and the cells were maintained in serum-free medium for at least 16 h prior to the addition of growth factors. PC12 cells were split 1:5 (from an 80% confluent dish) onto collagen-coated 100-mm plates. Two days later the cells were placed in low serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.05% fetal calf serum, 0.1% horse serum) for at least 16 h prior to the addition of growth factors. Following stimulation, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min, rocking at 4 °C, with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). The plates were further incubated with 300 μl of equilibration buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) for 10 min rocking at 4 °C. In the preparation of CHO-IR or PC12 cell lysates we used 1.5 or 6 mg of total protein/condition, respectively. The lysates were placed in Eppendorf tubes followed by high speed centrifugation. A 60-μl aliquot was taken from the cleared whole cell lysate (WCL) and mixed with 20 μl of 4× loading buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and placed at −20 °C until further use. The remainder of the lysate was then incubated for 2 h rocking at 4 °C with anti-HA (10 μl; 12CA5), anti-Tub (5 μl; polyclonal), or anti-phosphotyrosine (5 μl; anti-Tyr(P):clone 4G10) in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as indicated. Alternatively, the lysates were incubated with 5 μg of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) bound GST or GST-SH2 fusion proteins. The precipitates were then washed three times with high salt wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) and twice with low salt wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). 5 μl of 4× loading buffer was added to the precipitates. The WCL and precipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoresis. The membranes were incubated with Ponceau S to determine the quality of protein transfer and blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody (dilutions: α-Tub, 1:250; α-Tyr(P) (RC20H), 1:3000; α-HA(12CA5), 1:1000) as indicated in each experiment for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20/1% bovine serum albumin followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The blots were developed by ECL and exposed to film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified rat IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), GST, and GST-Tub (1 μg/reaction) were incubated or not with 2 μl of the following purified kinases: baculovirus-expressed insulin receptor kinase domain (bIRK), p60c-Src (Src), Abl, EGFR, or JAK2 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), as indicated. The reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of 2× kinase buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 μm ATP, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmMnCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) in a final volume of 20 μl, incubated for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer. The samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The phosphorylated proteins were revealed by autoradiography of the membrane. Although Tub does not share any regions or domains of homology with other known proteins, closer inspection of the amino acid sequence revealed 10 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Tub as indicated in Fig.1. Strikingly tyrosines 283, 311, 371, and 438 are conserved in all Tub family members from Arabidopsis to man. The sequence surrounding tyrosine 464 (YIVM) fits the consensus motif Y XX M for phosphorylation by insulin and IGF-1 receptors (9Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 18White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Further analysis of Tub amino acid sequence by a program being developed in Dr. Lewis Cantley's laboratory that searches for sites likely to be phosphorylated by protein kinases predicted that, in addition to tyrosine 464, tyrosines 343 (YDNG), 371 (YETN), and 438 (YVLN) may serve as potential sites of phosphorylation by protein-tyrosine kinases. To investigate whether Tub becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to insulin or IGF-1, we transfected HA-tagged wild type Tub (HA-Tub) into CHO-IR cells, which do not express endogenous Tub. Following treatment with either insulin or IGF-1, WCLs, anti-Tub, or anti-phosphotyrosine (α-Tyr(P)), immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of Tub and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Western blot (WB). Analysis of the WCL by α-Tyr(P) immunoblot demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in response to insulin and IGF-1 (Fig.2, top panel). An α-Tyr(P) immunoblot of α-Tub immunoprecipitates revealed that Tub was phosphorylated following insulin and IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 2, middle panel). The lower level of HA-Tub tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IGF-1 reflects the lower number of IGF-1 receptor in these cells (22Kapeller R. Chen K.S. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B.S. Backer J. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Ruderman N.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anti-Tub immunoblotting of the WCL demonstrated equivalent amounts of Tub expressed under the different conditions (Fig. 2, bottom panel). To further characterize the effect of insulin on Tub phosphorylation we examined the dose dependence and kinetics of response. As shown in Fig.3 A (top panel), transfected Tub became tyrosine phosphorylated when CHO-IR cells were treated with 10 nm insulin. This phosphorylation peaked at 50 nm. In this experiment, phosphorylation of bands corresponding to IR or IRS-1, in the WCL, peaked at 10 and 50 nm insulin, respectively (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Phosphorylation of Tub occurred as early as 1 min after insulin addition (Fig. 3 B) and was maintained for up to 60 min. These results indicate that insulin induces rapid and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of Tub at physiological doses. In the mouse, Tub is expressed only in neuronal tissues (23Sahly I. Gogat K. Kobetz A. Marchant D. Menasche M. Castel M. Revah F. Dufier J. Guerre-Millo M. Abitbol M.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2T. Chickering and R. Kapeller, unpublished results. Therefore, we examined a panel of cell lines by Western blot to determine the best expressor of Tub. All neuronal cell lines examined express Tub at low levels (PC12, GT1, and SHY-5Y); among them PC12 cells presented the highest level of expression (data not shown). Tub expression was not detected in any cell lines of non-neuronal origin (data not shown). Therefore we selected PC12 cells to examine whether endogenous Tub becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to growth factors. Undifferentiated PC12 cells, following serum starvation, were treated with either EGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (100 nm) and lysed, and the WCLs or anti-Tub immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and Tub by WB. Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot of the WCL showed that a number of proteins, including the EGFR itself, became tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EGF (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 2). Less phosphorylation was observed in the WCL in response to insulin (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 3), which is due to the lower number of insulin receptors in PC12 cells as compared with EGFR. Nevertheless, Tub became phosphorylated in response to insulin but not to EGF in these cells as shown (Fig. 4, middle panel, compare lanes 3 and 2). Equivalent amounts of Tub were detected in all three anti-Tub immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, lower panel). To determine whether Tub is a direct substrate for the insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, we performed in vitro kinase assays. As a positive control we used purified rat IRS-1, which has been previously shown to be directly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor both in vitro and in vivo (24Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White A.M.F. Science. 1991; 352: 73-77Google Scholar, 25White M.F. Stegmann E.W. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9769-9777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS-1, GST, or GST-Tub were incubated in the absence or presence of purified bIRK. As shown in Fig.5 A, only IRS-1 and GST-Tub (lanes 6 and 8) but not GST (lane 7) were phosphorylated when incubated with bIRK. Autophosphorylation of bIRK was also observed (lanes 5–8). No phosphorylation was detected in the reactions in which bIRK was not added (lanes 1–4). This result indicates that Tub, like IRS-1, can serve as a substrate for the insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in vitro. To evaluate the specificity of Tub phosphorylation, we tested whether Tub could be phosphorylated in vitro by other protein-tyrosine kinases as well. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GST-Tub became phosphorylated when incubated with purified Abl and Jak2 (lanes 8 and 16, respectively) but not when incubated with Src or EGFR (lanes 4 and 12, respectively). Both Src and Abl phosphorylated IRS-1 (lanes 2 and 6), whereas little or no phosphorylation of IRS-1 occurred in the presence of EGFR and Jak2 (lanes 10 and 14). These results suggest that Tub phosphorylation is specific and regulated by the recognition of tyrosine-containing sequences on Tub by a subset of PTKs. Because WT-Tub is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin, we examined whether this phosphorylation could induce the association of Tub with SH2 domains. Lysates from control and insulin-treated CHO-IR cells transiently expressing HA-Tub were incubated with various GST-SH2 fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound HA-Tub was detected by anti-HA immunoblot. As shown in Fig.6 A, HA-Tub associated strongly with the SH2 domains of Abl (lanes 17 and 18), Lck (lanes 15 and 16), as well as the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ (PLCγ-CSH2, lanes 9 and 10). Insulin treatment enhanced this interaction. In contrast, Src-SH2 (lanes 19 and 20) and PLCγ-N-terminal SH2 domain (PLCγ-NSH2, lanes 11 and 12) associated only weakly with HA-Tub, but some insulin-dependent binding was still observed. Even less HA-Tub was detected in p85-CSH2 (lanes 6 and 7) and GRB2-SH2 (lanes 13 and 14) precipitates, and in p85-NSH2 precipitates HA-Tub was undectectable (lanes 5 and 6). No HA-Tub was detected in GST precipitates (lanes 3 and 4). An anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot of the same membrane revealed that all the SH2 domains tested were able to precipitate phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, confirming that they were all functional (data not shown). Ponceau S staining of the nitrocellulose membrane furthermore shows that all the SH2 domains were present at comparable levels (data not shown). To examine whether the interaction between Tub and the various SH2 domains was mediated through the SH2 phosphotyrosine binding pocket, we incubated GST-PLCγ-CSH2 with 20 mm phenylphosphate prior to the addition of HA-Tub-containing lysates. Phenylphosphate binds to the phosphotyrosine binding pocket of SH2 domains and blocks their association with phosphoproteins. As shown in Fig. 6 B, phenylphosphate blocked the binding of GST-PLCγ-CSH2 to phosphorylated HA-Tub (top panel, compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 5 and 6), confirming that this is a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction. To further investigate the ability of insulin to induce the association of Tub with SH2-containing signaling proteins, we examined whether transiently expressed HA-Tub interacted with endogenous PLCγ in CHO-IR cells. We chose PLCγ because it is expressed at reasonable levels in CHO-IR cells, whereas Lck, Src, and Abl are not. As depicted in Fig. 6 C, HA-Tub was detected in anti-PLCγ immunoprecipitates, and insulin enhanced the association of Tub with PLCγ. These results suggest that Tub can associate with endogenous SH2-containing signaling proteins in an insulin-dependent manner stimulation and may serve as an adaptor protein linking the insulin receptor to intracellular signaling cascades. Tub and Tub-like proteins, because of their highly conserved C termini, the wide distribution across species, and the phenotypical alterations observed in tubby mice, are thought to play an important and basic role in the tissues where they are expressed (7Kleyn P.W.

Because of the retinal and cochlear degeneration observed in tubby mice, apoptosis has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the tubby phenotype. To date, however, no other programmed cell death-induced alterations have been observed in tubby mice that could explain the obesity phenotype, although that possibility cannot be ruled out. In addition to tubby, mutation in the Tub-like protein 1 (TULP1) in humans has been implicated in RP14, an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa (27Banerjee P. Kleyn P.W. Knowles J.A.

As a first step to gain more insight into the biological function of Tub, we explored the possibility that Tub is an intracellular signaling protein. Here we show that insulin as well as IGF-1 can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of transiently expressed HA-Tub in CHO-IR cells (Fig.2), with a dose response curve and kinetics (Fig. 3) that match that of other insulin receptor substrates such as IRS-1 and CBL (24Sun X.J.

The dPRL promoter is induced by the protein kinase A pathway in a delayed fashion via the region −332/−270 which contains two overlapping consensus binding sequences, B and D, for CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP). Here we show that sites B and D both bind C/EBPβ and -δ from ESC nuclear extracts. When decidualization of cultured ESC was induced by treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, complex formation on sites B and D was enhanced. Western blot analysis revealed an elevation of both C/EBPβ isoforms, liver-enriched activator protein and liver-enriched inhibitory protein, with a delayed onset between 8 and 24 h of cAMP treatment, while C/EBPδ expression remained unaffected. Cyclic AMP-mediated activation of dPRL promoter construct dPRL-332/luc3 was abrogated by mutation of sites B and D at −310/−285. An expression vector for liver-enriched activator protein potently induced transcription of dPRL-332/luc3 and further enhanced cAMP-mediated induction, while liver-enriched inhibitory protein expression vector abolished the cAMP response, implying that C/EBPs serve as mediators in the delayed cAMP signal transduction to the dPRL promoter.

In humans this process is independent of the presence of a blastocyst and is first apparent in the stromal cells surrounding the spiral arteries in the second half of the luteal phase. The key stimulus for decidualization in vivo is progesterone acting on an estrogen-primed uterus, however, in vitro in cultured endometrial stromal cells (ESC),1 progesterone only acts as a weak inducer of decidualization (1Daly D.C. Maslar I.A. Riddick D.H. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1983; 145: 672-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Its action is synergistically enhanced by a number of factors such as prostaglandin E2, corticotropin releasing factor, and gonadotropin free α-subunit (2Frank G.R. Brar A.K. Cedars M.I.

Cyclic AMP, which is a major decidualization stimulus in vitro, also controls dPRL gene transcription (12Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. DiMattia G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 356-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the cAMP response of the transfected dPRL promoter in ESC occurs in two phases. An early weak induction, mediated by an imperfect cAMP response element (CRE-L) at position −12 relative to the major transcriptional start site, is detectable within 6 h of treatment with 8-Br-cAMP. This is followed by a delayed strong induction which sets in after 12–18 h of stimulation and is dependent on the dPRL promoter region −332/−270 (17Telgmann R. Maronde E. Taskén K. Gellersen B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CRE-L abolishes the early, but not the delayed cAMP-mediated induction of promoter activity (17Telgmann R. Maronde E. Taskén K. Gellersen B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Computerized search for transcription factor binding sequences revealed two consensus sites for members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family in the dPRL-332/-270 promoter fragment.

From the single C/EBPβ mRNA, protein isoforms with different functions can be generated by a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism involving three methionine residues in the intronless C/EBPβ gene, Met1, Met24, and Met199. Proteins initiated at Met1 or Met24 have a calculated molecular mass of about 36 and 33.5 kDa and are referred to as LAP (liver-enriched activator protein) whereas translation initiation at Met199results in the 16-kDa isoform LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein) which lacks the transactivation domain of the longer forms. LIP readily heterodimerizes with LAP, counteracting its activation potential in substoichiometric amounts and therefore acts as a potent repressor (40Descombes P. Schibler U.

Deletion of the C/EBPβ gene in female mice leads to sterility, caused by the inability to form corpora lutea (20Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is also an essential factor for mammary gland differentiation and proliferation (21Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S.

In this study we demonstrate for the first time the presence of C/EBP transcription factors in human endometrial stroma, an interaction between C/EBP family members and the dPRL promoter, and their involvement in cAMP-induced dPRL gene expression. Primary cultures of purified human ESC were prepared and maintained as described previously (12Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. DiMattia G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 356-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Telgmann R. Maronde E. Taskén K. Gellersen B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells of the first passage were used for transfections and for extraction of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein and RNA. Primary cultures of myometrial smooth muscle cells were prepared as detailed elsewhere (42Bonhoff A. Gellersen B. Endocrine. 1996; 5: 241-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10−9m 17 β-estradiol. COS-7 cells were kept in the same medium but without estradiol. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method for ESC and myometrial cells and with DOTAP reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for COS-7 cells overnight as described previously (43Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in triplicates using 12-well dishes if not indicated otherwise, or 24-well dishes. Medium was replaced the next morning and 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Biolog, Bremen, Germany) added for stimulation experiments. Cell harvest was performed for ESC and myometrial cultures 48 h and for COS-7 cells 24 h after medium replacement. Luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase reagent kit (Promega) and expressed as relative light units. Transfections were repeated at least three times, and representative experiments are shown (mean ± S.D.). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (43Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) with minor modifications and protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein detection kit (Bio-Rad). For RNA isolation the method developed by Gough (45Gough M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) was applied, using the cytosolic lysate generated during protein extraction as the source. Rabbit antisera against rat C/EBPα (numbers 6 and 247) were kindly provided by Dr. Steve McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and diluted 1:10 for use as a working stock solution. Rabbit antibodies raised against rat C/EBPβ and human C/EBPδ (0.1 μg/μl) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A modified method of Rittenhouse and Marcus (46Rittenhouse J. Marcus F. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 442-448Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was used for protein analysis. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed for 1 h at 150 V. Gels were transferred for 1 h at 1.2 mA/cm2in a semi-dry chamber with a three buffer system (cathode buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 40 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 20% methanol; anode buffer I: 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.4, 20% methanol; anode buffer II: 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.4, 20% methanol) onto PVDF Immobilon membrane (Millipore) and stained with Fount India Ink (Pelikan) to control for even loading and transfer efficiency. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 136 mm NaCl), exposed to primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (dilution 1:1000 in Blotto), and then incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma), diluted 1:1000 in Blotto, for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed with the ECL system (Pierce). Total RNA was used for oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis with SuperScript RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.). PCR for dPRL and GAPDH cDNAs was performed as described previously (42Bonhoff A. Gellersen B. Endocrine. 1996; 5: 241-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For amplification of C/EBPβ cDNA (38Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar) Taq DNA polymerase and solution Q (Qiagen) were used. The sense primer TCTCCGACCTCTTCTCCGACGA spans cDNA positions 353–374 relative to the first start codon, and the antisense primer CAGCTGCTTGAASAASTKCCG anneals to the region 982–1002. After transfer of the electrophoresed PCR products to positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Southern blot hybridization was performed with internal oligonucleotides labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and detected with the DIG luminescent detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probe sequences were for GAPDH: TCGTCATGGGTGTGAACCATG; for hPRL: CAAGGGGGCCACGCTCTGGCA; for C/EBPβ: TTGCGCACGGCGATGTTGTTG (antisense to positions 840–860). All luciferase gene reporter constructs were generated in the pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega). The dPRL promoter/luciferase reporter fusion construct dPRL-332/luc3 contains the wild type dPRL promoter sequence −332 to +65 relative to the major transcriptional start site and has been described previously (12Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. DiMattia G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 356-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Telgmann R. Maronde E. Taskén K. Gellersen B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The minimal promoter construct dPRL-32/luc3 was generated by PCR using dPRL-332/luc3 as the template. Primers were: CCTGAAGCttGCCATAAAAGAATCCTCTGACGTTTC (sense), annealing at positions −39 to −4 of the dPRL promoter and including two mismatches (lowercase letters) to introduce a Hin dIII site (underlined) at position −32, and CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA (antisense), corresponding to positions 2–23 relative to the ATG start codon of the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic. The PCR product was cleaved with Hin dIII and ligated into Hin dIII digested pGL3-Basic. The fragment dPRL-332/-270 was amplified using primers with Bam HI overhangs (underlined): AGGATCCATTATGTTCTGAGGGCTG (sense) spanning the dPRL sequence −332/−315 (primer dPRL-332-S), and AGGATCCGAGCAGAGACCAGACATG (antisense), corresponding to positions −287/−270. The PCR products were digested with Bam HI, concatamerized, and cloned into pLucIAV Link V.4 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard N. Day, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Inserts with one or two copies were excised by digestion at 3′ with Pst I followed by polishing, and digestion at 5′ with Acc 65I, and then ligated into the Acc 65I and Sma I sites of dPRL-32/luc3 5′ to the minimal promoter element. The resultant constructs 1x(dPRL-332/-270)/-32/luc3 and 2x(dPRL-332/-270)/-32/luc3 carry the dPRL promoter fragment in 5′-3′ orientation. Plasmid dPRL(-332/-191)/-32/luc3 was constructed by PCR with Pwo polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), using dPRL-332-S (see above) as upstream primer and the downstream primer GTCAAGATCTCTCCCAGGAGACATTTGG (antisense), corresponding to positions −208/−191 and carrying an overhang with Bgl II recognition sequence (underlined). The PCR product was digested with Bgl II and inserted into the Ecl 136II (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) and Bgl II sites of dPRL-32/luc3. Plasmid dPRL(-332/-134)/-32/luc3 was generated with the sense primer ATTATGTTCTGAGGGCTGCTTGTGTTGT (positions −332/−302) and the antisense primer AGGATCCCATCAATCTAAATGAGTG (positions −154/−135) with Bam HI overhang (underlined). The PCR product was digested with Bam HI and inserted into Ecl 136II and Bgl II sites of dPRL-32/luc3. Plasmid dPRL-270/luc3 was generated by PCR, using dPRL-332/luc3 as template. The upstream primer AGGATCCACCAGATGCCAGCAGCAC spans positions −270 to −253 of the dPRL promoter and contains a Bam HI overhang (underlined); the antisense primer is anchored in exon 1A: CAAGAAGAATCGGAtCcTACAGGCTTT, covering positions +54 to +80 relative to the transcription start site, and containing two mismatches (lowercase letters) to introduce a Bam HI restriction site (underlined) at position +65. The PCR product was subjected to incomplete digestion with Bam HI to prevent restriction at the Bam HI site close to the 5′ end of the upstream primer. This created a dPRL−270/+65 fragment with 5′ blunt and 3′ Bam HI ends which was ligated into pGL3-Basic digested with Ecl 136II and Bgl II. Computerized searches for transcription factor consensus binding sites were performed with TFSEARCH v1.3 by Yutaka Akiyama using the TRANSFAC data bases (47Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Mutations of consensus sequences were introduced into the dPRL promoter by site-directed mutagenesis of dPRL-332/luc3 using the QuikChange system and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were transformed and plasmid DNA prepared to retrieve the mutated insert by Acc 65I/Nco I digestion and ligate it into native pGL3-Basic cleaved with the same enzyme combination. The sense sequences of the complementary oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis (D-B-mut, F-mut, G-mut) and the resultant constructs (dPRL-332/D-Bmut/luc3, dPRL-332/F-mut/luc3, dPRL-332/G-mut/luc3) are illustrated in Fig. 6. As a reporter control for C/EBP expression vectors NFIL6RE/luc3 was constructed. Complementary oligonucleotides with Acc 65I overhangs were annealed and inserted into the Acc 65I site of the dPRL-32/luc3 minimal promoter construct. The resultant insert sequence GGTACCCAGATCTGGCAGGATCC AGATTG CG CAATCT GCGGTACCcarries a palindromic NF-IL6 response element consensus sequence (bold faced) flanked by Acc 65I sites (underlined). Expression vectors for transient transfections were created in pSG5 (Stratagene) under the SV40 promoter. The human C/EBPα cDNA insert (48Antonson P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was excised from hCMV-C/EBPα (kindly provided by Dr. G. Darlington, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) with Bam HI and ligated into Bam HI cleaved pSG5 to give pSG-C/EBPα. Expression vectors for human C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (pCMV/NF-IL6, pCMV/NF-IL6β) were a gift from Dr. S. Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan) (29Kinoshita S. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 38Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Inserts were excised with Sal I, blunt-ended and cloned into pSG5 which had been linearized with Bam HI and blunt-ended. This yielded pSG-C/EBPβ, pSG-C/EBPδ, and pSG-C/EBPβrev, which carries the C/EBPβ cDNA in the reverse orientation and was used as a negative control. To generate pSG/LIP, pSG-C/EBPβ plasmid was cut with Eco RI (in the polylinker region of pSG5 upstream of the cDNA insert) and Sac II (in the insert). Released cDNA fragments were removed and the remaining plasmid polished with mung bean nuclease (Promega) and recircularized, retaining as the insert the C-terminal portion of CEBPβ cDNA extending from the Sac II site 49-base pair upstream of the Met199 codon to beyond the stop codon. To generate the expression vector pSG/LAP, Met199 was changed to Leu by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the following primers: LAP-H-S (CGCAGGC tTG GCGGCa aGC TTCCCGTAC, corresponding to positions 588–615 in the human C/EBPβ cDNA relative to the first Met codon; lowercase letters represent nucleotide changes, italicized triplets indicate codon mutations from Met199 to Leu and Gly202 to Ser, and underlined is a Hin dIII site introduced by mutation), LAP-H-AS (antisense to LAP-H-S), and NFIL6-H (TTGCGCACGGCGATGTTGTTG, antisense to positions 840–860 of human C/EBPβ cDNA). Two separate PCR reactions were performed with Pfu polymerase on template pSG-C/EBPβ. Primer pairs T7 (anchored in the polylinker of pSG5 5′ to the cDNA insert) and LAP-H-AS, and LAP-H-S and NFIL6-H were used to amplify overlapping portions of the C/EBPβ cDNA, introducing the mutations Met199 to Leu, Gly202 to Ser, and a Hin dIII site within the overlap. Both PCR products were digested with Hin dIII and ligated to one another to span the entire amplified region from the T7 to the NFIL6-H sequences. The purified ligation product was cleaved with Bsi WI to isolate an internal 495-base pair fragment containing the mutations. This Bsi WI fragment was used to replace the wild type Bsi WI fragment in pSG-C/EBPβ thus yielding pSG/LAP. The construct pABVP16 was kindly provided by Drs. Sergio Onate and Sophia Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). It contains coding region for the transactivation domain (AD) of herpes simplex virus VP16 under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and was used to generate pVP16/LAP-DBD. The sequence encoding the DNA-binding domain (DBD) was excised from pSG-C/EBPβ by digestion with Bsi WI (immediately downstream of the Met199codon), polishing with mung bean nuclease, and digestion with Bgl II in the polylinker 3′ to the cDNA insert. The fragment was ligated into pABVP16 which had been prepared as follows: the plasmid was cut with Xho I in the polylinker 3′ to the VP16 sequence, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and dTTP/dCTP only, polished with mung bean nuclease, and finally cleaved with Bam HI. The ligation resulted in an in-frame fusion of VP16-AD and LAP-DBD. All mutations and preservation of open reading frames were verified by sequencing. Fragments of the dPRL promoter used as probes or competitors for EMSA were: dPRL-332/-270, dPRL-301/-270 (subfragment B), dPRL-311/-291 (subfragment D), dPRL-332/-302 (subfragment A), dPRL-332/-312 (subfragment C), and dPRL-290/-270 (subfragment E). Recombinant proteins were produced from cDNAs cloned into pSG5, using the TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Per binding reaction 5 μg of nuclear protein or 2 μl of transcription/translation product and 30,000 cpm of end-labeled probe were used. Final concentrations of components in the binding reaction, including high salt nuclear extracts, were: 15 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 65 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.25 mm spermidine, 3.5% Ficoll,"

The αCP proteins appear to be multifunctional. Both αCP-1 and αCP-2 have been identified as components of a ribonucleoprotein complex that assembles on the 3′-UTR of a subset of long-lived mRNAs (3Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M Liebhaber S.A.

The sequences of the human (h) αCP-1 and hαCP-2 mRNAs have been previously established (12Aasheim H.-C. Loukianova T. Deggerdal A. Smeland E.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J.

With the aim of better understanding the potential roles of these related and highly abundant RNA-binding proteins as well as to establish a foundation for delineation of related genetic defects, we extended these analyses by establishing the structures of murine and human αCP-1 mRNAs and genes. The data were remarkable in that αCP-1 mRNA in both species was an exact colinear copy of the αCP-1 gene. This intronless structure of the human αCP-1 gene contrasted with the multiexon structure of the αCP-2 genes in both species. We have concluded from these and other data that the αCP-1 gene was most likely generated by retrotransposition of a fully processed αCP-2 mRNA prior to the mammalian radiation and that this processed gene was immediately recruited to serve a critical function distinct from that of its αCP-2 progenitor. Genomic clones containing the mαCP-2 gene (clones 4716 and 4717) and the hαCP-1 gene (clone 19548) were identified (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in 129SV mouse ES and human P1 libraries, respectively, by PCR screening with primers derived from the mαCP-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number L19661: 5′-GAC AGG TAC AGC ACA GGC-3′ (nucleotides 712–729 of the (+)-strand) and 5′-GTG GTC CCT CCA GGT CAG-3′ (nucleotides 773–796 of the (−)-strand)) and the hαCP-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession X78137: 5′-GCG ACG CTG TGG GCT AC-3′ (nucleotides 635–651 of the (+)-strand) and 5′-GGA ATG GTG AGT TCA TGG GT-3′ (nucleotides 871–890 of the (−)-strand)). Genomic clones containing the mαCP-1 gene (clones 12172 and 12173) were identified in 129SV mouse ES P1 libraries by PCR screening with the same primer set that had been used for isolation of hαCP-1 genomic clones.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). The coding region of the hαCP-1 gene was amplified from this DNA by PCR using sets of nested primers: INV6 and INV7 (first PCR) and INV6 and CP17 (second nested PCR). Sequences of the gene-specific primers and their positions on cDNAs are shown in Table I and Fig. 1. Polymerase chain reactions (200 ng of genomic DNA, 25 μm each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer)) were carried out using a thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer) programmed for 5 min of initial denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The amplicon of predicted size (1081 bp) was cloned in the pUC19 vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and confirmed as the hαCP-1 gene by sequencing. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, human epithelial cancer (HeLa) cells, and primary mouse tissues (RNeasy Mini kit, QIAGEN Inc.). RNA was treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion Inc.) prior to final isolation. To initiate RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 2 pmol of a gene-specific primer. The subsequent PCRs were then performed as described above. For selective amplification of αCP-1 mRNA, the RT step was carried out with primer CP17, which was specific for the αCP-1 mRNA (see Table Iand Fig. 1 ). The subsequent PCR was carried out with primers INV3 and INV4, which were universal for both αCP-1 and αCP-2. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out between a dT primer (5′-CGG AAT TCC T18-3′) and nested αCP-1-specific primers AM52 (first PCR) and AM50K (second PCR) (see Table I and Fig.1 ). The annealing temperature in PCRs with the dT primer was decreased to 42 °C; the number of cycles was increased to 35–40; and a final elongation step (7 min at 72 °C) was added. The final amplification product was cloned in the pUC19 vector and sequenced. 5 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA from different mouse tissues was used for first strand cDNA synthesis with 0.5 μg of dT18 primer using 10 units of avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was carried out with the INV2 and MH14 αCP-specific primers (see Table I and Fig. 2 ). Reverse primers were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Aliquots were removed every two cycles between cycles 16 and 30 and electrophoresed on a 2.5% MetaPhor-agarose gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts). The gel was dried, and signals were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and ImageQuantTM software. Logarithms of 32P activity incorporated into PCR products were plotted against the corresponding PCR cycle, and intercepts on the abscissa corresponding to the ratio of transcripts prior to PCR amplification were calculated (17Smith C.H.W.J. Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Scadden A.D.J. Krieg P.A. Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 411-440Google Scholar). Common reaction mixtures were used for all reactions, and exposures were done in parallel. P1 DNAs were prepared using a high molecular mass plasmid purification kit (MKb-100, Genome Systems, Inc.). Mouse genomic DNA (adult male BALB/c kidney tissue) and human genomic DNA (normal term placenta) were obtained fromCLONTECH. 100 ng of P1 DNA and 25 μg of genomic DNA were subjected to overnight restriction cleavage with stated enzymes (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The restriction fragments were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis at 20 V for 22 h, transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran Plus, Schleicher & Schüll) under alkaline conditions, and immobilized by baking for 2 h at 80 °C. DNA templates for the synthesis of αCP-1-specific RNA probes were obtained as PCR products of P1 clones 12172 (mαCP-1) and 19548 (hαCP-1) with primers T7-INV2 and MH14 (see Table I and Fig. 2 ). 32P-Labeled RNA probes were synthesized using a MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion Inc.). 50 μCi of [32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol) was added to 20 μl of transcription reaction mixture. RNA probes (specific activity of 10–20 Ci/mmol) were separated from unincorporated nucleotides on a Sephadex G-50 Quick Spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 0.5 m NaPO4buffer (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 7% SDS. The probes were hybridized to the membranes at 65 °C overnight. MEL cells were grown to subconfluence, lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and anti-protease mixture (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)), sonicated, and then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, supernatant protein concentrations were estimated using a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay kit. 50 μg of proteins was separated on each lane of a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protrane, Schleicher & Schüll) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. After overnight blocking in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% (w/v) dry milk, and 0.3% Tween, the membrane was incubated with rabbit antisera raised against αCP-1 (1:6000 dilution) or αCP-2 (1:6000 dilution) (gifts of Dr. G. Gamarnik, University of California, San Francisco, CA) (8Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were developed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (used at 1:7000 dilution; followed by ECL detection of immune complexes Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterially expressed recombinant αCP-1 and αCP-2 with His6 tags were prepared and purified as detailed (18Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), P1 plasmid DNA (clone 12173 for αCP-1 and clone 4716 for αCP-2) was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared mouse DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Chromosome identity was confirmed with probes specific to the telomere (chromosome 6) or centromere (chromosome 15). Interspecific backcross panels (Jackson Laboratory Mapping Resource) contained 95 progeny ((C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 × C57BL/6J) and 94 progeny ((C57BL/6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei) (19Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Using primers 5′-TGC TGG AGG TGG GGG TGA T-3′ and 5′-TGA ACT ACA ACA CAA CTG CTT T-3′, corresponding to one of the mαCP-2 gene introns, we identified a PCR product length polymorphism (C57BL/6J, ≈220 bp; M. spretus, ≈190 bp) with which to follow segregation of Pcbp2 alleles. The evolutionary distances between two homologous sequences were computed by “Method 1” of Ina (20Ina Y. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 190-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which includes a correction for multiple substitutions at single sites based on the two-parameter model of Kimura. Distances (K) were converted to rates (r) using the equation r =K/(2 T), where T is the divergence time between the two species (21Li W.-H. Molecular Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1997: 1-497Google Scholar). As part of our ongoing study of the αCP proteins, we initiated an analysis of the αCP-1 and αCP-2 genes. The entire 11-kilobase αCP-2 gene has been structurally defined and will be presented in detail elsewhere. 2A. V. Makeyev, A. N. Chkheidze, and S. A. Liebhaber, manuscript in preparation. This gene, which has been partially mapped by others (15Funke B. Zuleger B. Benavente R. Schuster T. Goller M. Stevenin J. Horak I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), contains at least 12 introns. Two distinct mouse genomic P1 clones containing the αCP-1 gene were identified (see “Experimental Procedures”). The full sequences of the mαCP-1 gene on the two clones were determined and were identical to each other. This mαCP-1 gene sequence was surprising in that it revealed an uninterrupted 1071-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1). The mαCP-1 ORF was highly similar (94% sequence identity) to that of the previously reported hαCP-1 mRNA, and the inferred protein structure of mαCP-1 was identical to hαCP-1 with the exception of a single valine-for-alanine substitution at position 205 (Fig. 1 ). Thus, in marked contrast to the multiexon αCP-2 gene, the mαCP-1 gene lacks introns. To determine whether the processed mαCP-1 gene that we had identified was a pseudogene or was expressed, we compared its sequence to that of the mαCP-1 mRNA. A 1.1-kDa fragment encompassing the entire ORF of mαCP-1 mRNA was generated by RT-PCR from poly(A) mRNA from MEL cells. The sequence of this amplified region was identical to that of the mαCP-1 gene (Fig. 1). This sequence comparison was extended to include the 3′-untranslated region by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amplified 345-nucleotide 3′-UTR terminated in a poly(A) tail located 14 bases 3′ to the second of two putative polyadenylation signals (AAUAAA). The sequence of this entire segment was an exact match to the corresponding region within the mαCP-1 gene (Fig. 2). A compilation of 55 reported mαCP-1 cDNA clones in the GenBankTM EST data base failed to reveal any additional or divergent sequences (see the list in Appendix 1). 3For further information, Appendices 1 and 2 may be obtained from the author upon request.These data supported the conclusion that mαCP-1 mRNA was transcribed from the intronless αCP-1 gene. Translation of the defined mαCP-1 mRNA was confirmed by detection of its protein product on Western blot analysis (Fig.3). Antisera specific for αCP-1 revealed a single band in MEL cell extracts that was of slightly higher mobility than the protein identified with the antisera specific for αCP-2 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4 ). These data, which were in full agreement with the predicted molecular masses (37.5 and 38.6 kDa, respectively), demonstrated that processed αCP-1 mRNA was translationally active. The identical sequences of the intronless mαCP-1 gene and the mαCP-1 mRNA could be explained by two distinct models. The first model would posit that the processed αCP-1 gene was a pseudogene generated so recently that there had not been sufficient time for its sequence to diverge from an originating retrotransposed mαCP-1 mRNA. This model would suggest that an expressed, intron-containing αCP-1 gene had been missed in the cloning survey. The second model would posit that the intronless αCP-1 gene was in fact functional and had brought with it or had acquired sufficient gene control elements to support substantial expression. To compare these two models, we estimated how long the processed αCP-1 gene had been in existence by searching for it in the human genome. A segment of the hαCP-1 gene encompassing the entire coding region was amplified from human genomic DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”), and in parallel, a P1 clone containing the αCP-1 gene was isolated from a genomic library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The αCP-1 gene sequences from both these sources were identical to each other and were perfect matches to hαCP-1 mRNA (GenBankTM accession numberX78137) (12Aasheim H.-C. Loukianova T. Deggerdal A. Smeland E.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the intronless αCP-1 gene was present in the human genome as well as the mouse genome. This finding established that the processed αCP-1 gene had been generated over 80 million years ago, predating the mammalian radiation (21Li W.-H. Molecular Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1997: 1-497Google Scholar). Multiple splice variants of the mαCP-2 transcript have been described. The most extensive alternative splicing of αCP-2 exons occurs in the region encoding the segment between the second and third KH domains (Fig. 4, exons B, C, and E )(15Funke B. Zuleger B. Benavente R. Schuster T. Goller M. Stevenin J. Horak I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 4A. V. Makeyev, A. N. Chkheidze, and S. A. Liebhaber, unpublished data. In contrast, an intronless αCP-1 gene would be expected to yield a single mRNA species. To confirm this prediction, total cytoplasmic mRNA was surveyed for αCP-2 and αCP-1 mRNAs. An initial RT-PCR analysis with primers universal to all αCP mRNAs (TableI and Fig. 1 ) revealed a complex set of mRNAs in MEL cells. The largest cDNA fragment (360 bp) corresponded to full-length mαCP-2 cDNA, the next to full-length mαCP-1 cDNA (330 bp), as well as the αCP-2 splice variant lacking the 39 ± 3-bp alternatively spliced segment, and the smallest fragment corresponded to mαCP-2 cDNA splice variants lacking the 93-bp segment (Fig. 4 B, lane 2 ). Each of these designations was confirmed by sequence analysis (data not shown). In HeLa cells, the same set of amplified cDNAs was observed, as well as several additional smaller fragments of undetermined structure (Fig. 4 B, lane 5 ). The presence of multiple αCP-2 mRNA spliced forms was further substantiated by the EST data base, which revealed that 67.5% of 30 mαCP-2 cDNAs and 70.4% of 71 hαCP-2 cDNAs were alternatively spliced between the second and third KH domains. We next carried out an amplification with an RT primer specific to αCP-1 mRNA. This analysis, which also encompassed the second and third KH domains, detected a single band (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 6 ). The sequence of this band (data not shown) confirmed its assignment as mαCP-1 mRNA. In agreement with these data, EST data base analysis revealed a single sequence for 55 mouse and 235 human αCP-1 cDNA clones. Thus, both mouse and human cells contained multiple spliced forms of αCP-2 mRNA and a single species of αCP-1 mRNA. The relative expression of αCP-1 and αCP-2 mRNAs was compared in a variety of tissues. RT-PCR was carried out with primers that were universal for human and mouse αCP-1 and αCP-2 mRNAs and that were positioned so as to amplify a slightly larger fragment for αCP-2 than αCP-1 (Fig.5, A and B ). The bands representing each of the two mRNAs were quantified, and αCP-1/αCP-2 mRNA ratios were established for each tissue (Fig. 5 C ). There were no major differences between the relative levels of αCP-1 and αCP-2 mRNAs in any of the tissues studied (Fig.5 C ). Thus, expression of the processed αCP-1 gene paralleled that of the intron-containing αCP-2 gene in all tissues examined. The formal possibility that a second intron-containing αCP-1 gene existed in the genome was tested by Southern blot analysis. The αCP-1 and αCP-2 loci in the mouse and human genomes were each specifically identified using discriminating probes corresponding to their unique 3′-UTRs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each probe hybridized to a single band in four different restriction digests of genomic DNA and to an identically sized set of hybridizing bands generated from the corresponding mouse and human αCP-1 (P1) clones (Fig.6 and data not shown). These data demonstrated that the αCP-1 and αCP-2 genes were each present as unique loci in the mouse and human genomes. The chromosome map positions of the mαCP-1 and mαCP-2 genes were determined by in situ hybridization and recombination mapping. The mouse αCP-2 gene (Pcbp2) was localized by FISH to cytoband 15F1 (Fig.7 C ). In full agreement with this assignment, an interspecific backcross analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated the Pcbp2 locus as nonrecombinant with the marker D15Mit16, placing Pcbp2 58–61 centimorgans distal to the centromere of mouse chromosome 15. This map position of the mαCP-2 locus shared an extensive region of synteny with the previously reported map position of the human αCP-2 gene (PCBP2) (human chromosome 12q13.12-q13.13; Oxford Grid) (22Tommerup N. Leffers H. Genomics. 1996; 32: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mαCP-1 gene was localized by FISH analysis to cytoband 6D1 (Fig. 7, A and B). This region was syntenic with human chromosome 2p12-p13 (Oxford Grid), which is the map position of the hαCP-1 gene (PCBP1) (22Tommerup N. Leffers H. Genomics. 1996; 32: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated synteny of corresponding αCP-1 and αCP-2 loci in mouse and human genomes and confirmed the orthologous nature of their relationships. The present report demonstrates that the highly conserved RNA-binding protein αCP-1 is encoded by a processed gene. This conclusion derived from the following three lines of evidence. 1) The sequence of the αCP-1 gene was colinear with and identical to its mRNA (Figs. 1 and 2). 2) This processed αCP-1 gene was the only αCP-1 locus in the mouse and human genomes (Fig. 6). 3) In contrast to the multiple alternatively spliced αCP-2 mRNAs, only a single αCP-1 mRNA could be identified (Fig. 4 and Appendix 1). This processed αCP-1 gene encodes an abundant and functionally active protein (Fig. 3) (8Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Based on the data presented, the most likely origin of the processed αCP-1 gene was via retrotransposition of a fully processed αCP-2 mRNA. For this gene to be vertically transmitted, such an event would have had to occur in the germ line. The observation that the αCP-2 mRNA is widely expressed (Fig. 5 ) and is present in testis, unfertilized mouse egg, and in two-cell stage mouse embryo (see EST data base data in Appendix 1) supports this model. Characteristic features of retroposons such as a remnant poly(A) tail and/or direct repeats flanking the region of homology between the processed gene and originating gene (23Vanin E.F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 24Wilde C.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 323-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) tend to be present in retrotransposed genes dating less than 40 million years and are uniformly absent in those whose origins preceded avian and mammalian divergence (≈300 million years ago). The absence of a convincing remnant poly(A) tail and direct repeats associated with the αCP-1 gene suggests a remote origin. We have estimated the date of origin for the αCP-1 gene based on the extent of its sequence divergence (TablesTable II, Table III, Table IV ). The accuracy of this approach was increased by supplementing the mouse and human sequence data with the rat αCP gene sequences identified from EST data bases (Appendix 2 ). The expected numbers of substitutions per 100 sites have very similar values for each orthologous pairing (TableIII ), and this divergence rate was much less than that observed in the paralogous pairings (αCP-1 versus αCP-2 in mouse, rat, and human) (TableIV ). The orthologous relationships of the αCP-1 and αCP-2 genes in these three species, along with the localization of the mouse and human αCP-1 genes within corresponding regions of known synteny (Fig. 7 ), supported the conclusion that the retrotransposition generating the αCP-1 gene predated mammalian radiation.Table IICoding sequence comparison of mouse and human αCP orthologsPropertyαCP-1αCP-2Identity (protein), %99.7100Identity (cDNA), %94.297.6Aligned length, bp10651095Synonymous distance, Ks (S.E.), substitutions/100 sites19.7 (2.7)7.5 (1.5)Synonymous rate (×10−9) (S.E.), substitution/site/year1.23 (0.17)0.47 (0.09)Nonsynonymous distance, Ka (S.E.), substitutions/100 sites0.3 (0.3)0Nonsynonymous rate (×10−9) (S.E.), substitution/site/year0.02 (0.02)0 Open table in a new tab Table III3′-UTR sequence comparison of mouse, human, and rat αCP orthologsPropertyMouse vs. humanRat vs. humanMouse vs. ratαCP-1αCP-2αCP-1αCP-2αCP-1αCP-2Identity, %96.496.497.997.298.898.6Aligned length, bp335356332"

We show that the cytoplasmic Ro ribonucleoprotein-associated Y RNAs are specifically and rapidly degraded during apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mechanism. This is the first study describing the selective degradation of a specific class of small structural RNA molecules in apoptotic cells. Cleavage and subsequent truncation of Y RNAs was observed upon exposure of cells to a variety of apoptotic stimuli and were found to be inhibited by Bcl-2, zinc, and several caspase inhibitors. These results indicate that apoptotic degradation of Y RNAs is dependent on caspase activation, which suggests that the nucleolytic activity responsible for hY RNA degradation is activated downstream of the caspase cascade. The Y RNA degradation products remain bound by the Ro60 protein and in part also by the La protein, the only two proteins known to be stably associated with intact Ro ribonucleoprotein particles. The size of the Y RNA degradation products is consistent with the protection from degradation of the most highly conserved region of the Y RNAs by the bound Ro60 and La proteins.

Morphologically, apoptotic cells are characterized by chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, fragmentation of the nucleus, and partition of cytoplasm and nucleus into membrane bound-vesicles (apoptotic bodies) (1Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Fadok V.A. Sellins K.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). During the last 5 years, many of the molecules that participate in the biochemical pathway mediating apoptosis have been identified. A major role in this pathway is played by caspases, cysteine proteases with aspartic acid substrate specificity (2Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). Proteins cleaved by caspases appear to be structural proteins essential for maintaining nuclear and cytoplasmic architecture and enzymes essential for repair of damaged cell components (reviewed in Ref. 3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). A prominent nuclear event during apoptosis is internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, recognized as a “DNA ladder” on conventional agarose gel electrophoresis (4Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). The endonuclease activity responsible for apoptotic degradation of chromosomal DNA has recently been identified (5Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The activity depends on two interacting proteins, one of which contains the endonuclease activity (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD)1), which is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to its association with the second protein (inhibitor of CAD). Caspase activation in apoptotic cells leads to cleavage of the inhibitor of CAD, thereby releasing active CAD resulting in DNA fragmentation in the nuclei (5Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 6Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Much less is known about cleavage and degradation of RNA in apoptotic cells. An increased rate of mRNA turnover has been suggested (7Mondino A. Jenkins M.K. J. Biol.

Schools G.P. Davies K.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but no nuclease associated with specific RNA cleavage has been described. Although an increasing number of protein components of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) have been reported to be modified during apoptosis, such as the U1-70K protein, which is a component of the U1 snRNP (10Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 72-kDa component of the signal recognition particle (11Utz P.J. Hottelet M.

Pruijn, submitted for publication.no data have been published on the fate of the RNA components of these particles during apoptosis. Therefore, we decided to examine the effects of apoptosis on the cytoplasmic Y RNAs and 7SL RNA, the RNA components of the Ro RNPs and the signal recognition particle, respectively. Ro RNPs are a class of small cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes of unknown function, which are present in cells of all species studied to date (reviewed in Ref. 12Pruijn G.J.M. Simons F.H.M. Van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). In human cells, Ro RNPs consist of one of four small RNA molecules, termed hY1, hY3, hY4, and hY5 (13Hendrick J.P.

The Y RNAs, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (13Hendrick J.P. Wolin S.L. Rinke J. Lerner M.R. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), are characterized by a conserved stem structure formed by extensive base pairing between the evolutionarily conserved 5′- and 3′-ends. In addition to Y RNAs, Ro RNPs contain at least two different proteins: the La protein and the 60-kDa Ro protein (Ro60), whereas the association of a third protein, the 52-kDa Ro protein (Ro52), is still a matter of debate (17Ben Chetrit E.

The La protein binds to the oligouridylate stretch at the 3′-end of the Y RNAs, whereas Ro60 interacts with the most highly conserved part of the stem structure (21Pruijn G.J.M. Slobbe R.L.

In this study, we observed an extensive, rapid, and selective nucleolytic degradation of small cytoplasmic RNAs, the Y RNAs, during apoptosis. This phenomenon was observed upon exposure of the cells to multiple apoptotic stimuli, and yRNA degradation appeared to be inhibited by the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and zinc, as well as by the caspase inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CMK, Z-DEVD-FMK, and Z-IETD-FMK. The results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments and size determination of the apoptotic Y RNA degradation products suggest that the most divergent regions of the Y RNAs are degraded and that the association of Ro60 with the conserved regions is not disrupted, whereas the association with La is partially lost.

HeLa cells and HEp-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2at 37 °C. Jurkat/Bcl-2 and Jurkat/Neo cells and WR19L cells expressing human Fas (24Cuppen E. Nagata S. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. J. Biol.

Robertson (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods prior to harvesting. HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm actinomycin D and HEp-2 cells with 10 μg/ml anisomycin. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol RNA reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In parallel, cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.25 mm dithioerythritol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Monolayer cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated as above. For experiments utilizing caspase inhibitors, Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence of either 2% Me2SO, 2 mmZnSO4, 2 or 20 μm Ac-YVAD-CMK (caspase-1 inhibitor 2, Calbiochem), 2 or 20 μm Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase-3 inhibitor 2, Calbiochem), 2 or 20 μmZ-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor 2, Calbiochem) and 2 or 20 μm Z-LEHD-FMK (caspase-9 inhibitor 1, Calbiochem). Subsequently, apoptosis was induced by the addition of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody followed by harvesting after incubations as indicated and lysis as described above. RNA was size-fractionated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond N+filters by electroblotting at 3 V/cm in 0.025 m phosphate, pH 6.5, for 2 h. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 65 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml sheared, denatured herring sperm DNA with a mixture of 32P-labeled antisense RNA transcripts of the four hY RNAs, antisense 7SL RNA (25Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. K. Strub (University of Geneva, Switzerland), or antisense U1 snRNA. Following hybridization, filters were washed twice at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and were subjected to autoradiography. Transcription of antisense hY1, hY3, hY4, hY5, 7SL, and U1 RNA was mainly performed as described (26Scherly D. Boelens W. Van Venrooij W.J. Dathan N.A. Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To obtain antisense RNAs, pTZ19-hY1, hY3, hY4, hY5, SP64–7SL, and pGEM-U1 RNA were linearized with Eco RI. In vitro transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase (antisense hY1, hY3, hY4, and hY5 RNA) or SP6 RNA polymerase (antisense U1 and 7SL RNA). Transcription and 3′-end labeling of tRNAHis was performed as described previously (27Brouwer R. Vree Egberts W. Jongen P.H. Van Engelen B.G.M. Van Venrooij W.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose filter. After blocking the filters in wash buffer (5% skim milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at room temperature, filters were incubated with patient serum H42 (anti-U1-70K) at a dilution of 1:5000 in wash buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 15 min, binding of antibodies was visualized by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human antibodies (Dako) followed by chemiluminescence detection. Jurkat/Bcl-2 and Jurkat/Neo cells were incubated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in labeling medium (RPMI without phosphate (ICN), 2 mmGlutaMAX (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and penicillin and streptomycin). 32P-labeled orthophosphate was added at a concentration of 33 μCi/ml. After incubating the cells at 37 °C for 18 h, an equal volume of RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and penicillin and streptomycin was added. Cells were treated with an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody 7C11 and incubated at 37 °C. RNA was isolated either immediately or after incubation for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 h. For protein analysis, radiolabeled cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at the indicated time points. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C at 12,000 ×g. To immunoprecipitate either unlabeled or radiolabeled RNA, protein A-agarose beads were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) for at least 1 h in IPP500 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). After washing three times with IPP500, the beads were incubated with an anti-Ro60 monoclonal antibody (2G10), an anti-La monoclonal antibody (SW5), or an anti-U1-A monoclonal antibody (9A9) by rotation for at least 1 h in IPP500. Incubation was followed by washing twice with IPP500 and twice with TKED (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). After rotating the coated beads with the extracts in TKED for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with TKED. RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction and was precipitated by adding 4 volumes of ethanol and analyzed by 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled RNA was subjected to autoradiography, whereas unlabeled RNA was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. To study the effects of apoptosis on the hY RNAs and 7SL RNA, we used two stably transfected Jurkat cell lines, one overexpressing the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 (Jurkat/Bcl-2) and the second a transfection vector control line (Jurkat/Neo). To induce apoptosis, the cells were treated with a monoclonal antibody reactive with Fas (7C11). Previous studies have demonstrated that these antibodies very effectively induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells (11Utz P.J. Hottelet M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Van Venrooij W.J. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35362-35370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).2 Cells were harvested either immediately or at the indicated time points after anti-Fas addition. Total RNA was isolated from cell extracts and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled antisense hY1, hY3, hY4, hY5, and 7SL RNA probes. The induction of apoptosis was monitored by the analysis of U1-70K protein cleavage, which leads to the appearance of a characteristic 40-kDa product. Cleavage of U1-70K, which is one of the prototypical proteins known to be cleaved during apoptosis (10Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was visualized by immunoblotting of cell extracts using a patient serum reactive with the U1-70K protein. Analysis of the hY RNAs revealed that during early stages of apoptosis, these RNAs were efficiently degraded in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat/Neo cells (Fig.1 A). Degradation products were already detectable 1.5 h after anti-Fas addition (lane 13), whereas a gradual decrease in the amount of intact hY RNAs was evident, with the majority of the hY RNAs being degraded within 4 h after anti-Fas addition (compare lane 18 with lane 11). Although all four hY RNAs were degraded upon induction of apoptosis, slight differences were observed in the rate of degradation. The rate of degradation appeared to be related to the size of the hY RNA; hY1 was degraded most quickly. In contrast, no degradation of 7SL RNA was observed in these cells (Fig.1 A). The selectivity of degradation of hY RNAs in apoptotic cells was further substantiated by the lack of detectable degradation of several other small RNAs, including U snRNAs, tRNAs, and 5 S rRNA (data not shown). Degradation of hY RNAs was inhibited in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2, because a slight decrease of the amount of hY RNAs was only detectable 6 h after anti-Fas addition, whereas degradation products did not appear during the first 3 h (lanes 1–10). The delayed degradation of hY RNAs in Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells in comparison with the Jurkat/Neo cells reflected the different efficiencies of apoptosis induction in these cells, which was monitored by cleavage of the U1-70K protein (Fig. 1 B) and by flow cytometry of annexin-V stained cells (results not shown).2The kinetics of hY RNA degradation appeared to be very similar to that of U1-70K cleavage, which is known to be mediated by caspase-3, suggesting that hY RNA degradation might also be dependent on caspase activation. To determine whether degradation of hY RNAs also occurs when apoptosis is triggered by other stimuli, and in cells derived from other species, we analyzed apoptotic cell extracts derived from human HeLa cells treated with actinomycin D (10 μm) (data not shown) or HEp-2 cells treated with anisomycin (10 μg/ml). Also, apoptotic cell extracts, derived from mouse WR19L cells expressing human Fas (24Cuppen E. Nagata S. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30215-30220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and treated with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, were analyzed. Total RNA was isolated and analysis of Y RNAs by Northern blot hybridization revealed that Y RNA degradation was observed in all cells tested (Fig.1 C). Induction of apoptosis in all cells was confirmed by cleavage of the U1-70K protein. Although the normal turnover rate of hY RNAs is known to be relatively low, a reduction of the hY RNA levels in apoptotic cells might in principle be due to either inhibition of RNA polymerase III transcription or to an increased rate of hY RNA degradation. To exclude the possibility that the reduction in hY RNA levels was caused by abrogation of their synthesis and to investigate the association of the Ro RNP with hY RNAs in apoptotic cells, RNA in Jurkat/Bcl-2 and Jurkat/Neo cells was radiolabeled by culturing the cells in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate for 18 h. After labeling, apoptosis was induced by anti-Fas addition in complete medium, i.e. in the presence of an excess of unlabeled phosphate. Cells were lysed either immediately or after incubation for the indicated time periods, and induction of apoptosis was monitored by cleavage of the U1-70K protein (data not shown). The results for the Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells illustrate the low turnover rate of hY RNAs (Fig.2, lanes 5–11). Even at 8 h after replacement of radiolabeled phosphate with unlabeled phosphate, little or no decrease of radiolabeled hY RNAs was observed, which is indicative of the relatively long half-life of these molecules. This result confirms that the observed decrease in hY RNAs levels during apoptosis is due to a strongly increased degradation rate rather than the abrogation of hY RNA synthesis. Because an immunoprecipitation step was required to isolate the low abundance hY RNAs from the total pool of radiolabeled RNAs, this experiment also provided information on the Ro RNP association of radiolabeled hY RNAs. Immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Ro60 monoclonal antibody (2G10), and co-precipitated RNAs were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The results in Fig. 2 show that co-immunoprecipitation of hY RNAs from apoptotic Jurkat/Neo cell extracts decreased during the first hours after anti-Fas addition and was hardly detectable at the 4 h time point (lanes 10–14). The decrease in hY RNA precipitation by anti-Ro60 antibodies is likely to be indeed caused by hY RNA degradation rather than by disruption of the interaction between hY RNAs and Ro60, because the analysis of Ro60 from apoptotic cells by Western blotting did not reveal detectable changes, such as proteolytic cleavage (Ref. 28Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and data not shown). Moreover, the RNA binding capacity of Ro60 was not abolished in apoptotic Jurkat cells, as demonstrated by the co-precipitation of hY RNA degradation products (see below). It should also be noted that the disappearance of full-length hY RNAs isolated by immunoprecipitation from radiolabeled cell extracts resembles the decrease of hY RNA signals obtained by Northern blot analysis of total RNA (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the disappearance of hY RNAs during apoptosis is indeed due to degradation and that hY RNAs remain in association with the Ro RNP in apoptotic cells until or even after the degradation process has been initiated. The differences in RNA ranging in size approximately from 5 to 5.8 S rRNA between total radiolabeled RNA isolated either immediately after anti-Fas addition (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3) or following 8 h of incubation (lanes 2 and 4) might be due to apoptotic degradation of ribosomal RNA and/or mRNA (7Mondino A. Jenkins M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26593-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Owens G.P. Cohen J.J.

Med. 1997; 22: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), resulting in higher background signals. Note that due to the low abundance of radiolabeled hY RNAs, relatively high background signals of much more abundant RNAs, such as 5 and 5.8 S rRNA (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3), were observed among the immunoprecipitated RNAs (lanes 5–14). Caspases are not only involved in the activation of apoptotic proteases; also, caspase-dependent activation of a deoxyribonuclease has recently been reported (5Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). To study the role of caspases in the activation of the nuclease activity responsible for hY RNA degradation during apoptosis, Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence of several caspase inhibitors, including zinc sulfate (29Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK, the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, or the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK for 1 h prior to and during anti-Fas treatment. Cells were harvested either immediately or 4 or 8 h after anti-Fas addition. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting using hY RNA probes and a 7SL RNA probe as a control. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that hY RNA degradation was completely inhibited in Jurkat cells cultured in the presence of zinc sulfate (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6). hY RNA degradation was also clearly inhibited by the addition of Ac-YVAD-CMK, Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-IETD-FMK (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8) in comparison with the control incubation with 2% Me2SO (Fig.3 B, lane 2). In contrast, the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK only poorly affected hYRNA degradation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9–10). As expected, the addition of these inhibitors had no effect on 7SL RNA signals (Fig. 3, lower panels). As a control for the inhibitory activity of the tetrapeptide inhibitors, the cell extracts were also analyzed for U1-70K cleavage, which is known to be sensitive to Ac-DEVD-CHO (10Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the U1-70K protein was indeed inhibited by ZnSO4 and the caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-8 inhibitors and to a lesser extent by the caspase-9 inhibitor (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the apoptotic degradation of hY RNAs is dependent on caspase activation. The results described above indicate that hY RNAs remain associated with the Ro60 protein until or possibly even during the degradation process. Therefore, it was possible that at least some of the degradation products were still bound by either the Ro60 or the La protein, the two proteins that are directly bound to the hY RNAs in Ro RNP complexes. To investigate the potential interaction of these proteins with the apoptotic degradation products hY RNAs, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with monoclonal anti-Ro60 (2G10) and anti-La (SW5) antibodies. Cell extracts were prepared at various time points after the addition of anti-Fas antibody and RNA was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization either directly isolated from cell extracts or following immunoprecipitation. Fig. 4 A shows RNA isolated from cell extracts, corresponding with 10% of the cell extracts used for immunoprecipitation. As is shown in Fig. 4, B and C, both the full-length hY RNAs and at least part of the degradation products were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Ro60 (Fig.4 B) and anti-La (Fig. 4 C) antibodies. This strongly suggests that both proteins remain associated with the hY RNAs during the nucleolytic process and thus with the respective binding site containing degradation products of the hY RNAs. The anti-Ro60 antibody co-precipitated the degradation products much more efficiently than the anti-La antibody, which might indicate that although both antibodies seem to co-precipitate the same set of degradation products, the La binding site might be partially lost. A control immunoprecipitation was performed with a monoclonal antibody (9A9) to the U1A protein, a protein specifically associated with the U1 snRNP. As expected, U1 snRNA was not co-precipitated with anti-Ro60 and anti-La antibodies, and no hY RNAs were co-precipitated with the anti-U1A antibodies (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, U1 snRNA was efficiently precipitated by the anti-U1A antibodies, substantiating the specificity of the immunoprecipitations. To determine the length of the apoptotic degradation products of the hY RNAs, 32P-labeled Jurkat/Neo cell extracts were used to isolate h"

Pretreatment with hyperosmotic stress also prevented the activation of S6K by both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and anisomycin. Comparison of sorbitol and rapamycin revealed that both agents inactivated S6K and caused dephosphorylation of Ser/Thr-Pro sites in the COOH terminus of S6K, including Thr412, a residue essential to S6K regulation, as determined by phospho-specific antibodies. Rapamycin-resistant S6K truncation mutants were similarly resistant to deactivation by sorbitol. Additionally, the PHAS-1 mobility shift, which is sensitive to rapamycin, was also found to be sensitive to osmotic stress. Experiments using the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and dominant negative mutants involving both stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 stress pathways indicated that these pathways are probably not involved in osmotic stress inhibition of S6K. Examining the potential involvement of a phosphatase, we found that sodium pyrophosphate, sodium vanadate, cyclosporin A, tautomycin, and okadaic acid had no effect on osmotic stress inhibition of S6K. However, calyculin A prevented both rapamycin- and sorbitol-mediated deactivation of S6K.

Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that S6K may be an integrator of signals from various kinase cascades. S6K function is also controlled via inhibitory domains at both the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus of the kinase (12Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deletion of these domains confers relative resistance of these truncated kinases to the inhibitory effects of rapamycin. A model that explains these findings is that phosphorylation of S6K negates the inhibitory effect of these domains. Rapamycin might thus promote dephosphorylation events within these domains, a principle first suggested by Ferrari et al. (5Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S.J. Totty N.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon activation, S6K phosphorylates the S6 protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit (14Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak H.I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated S6 directs the translational machinery toward increased translation of transcripts containing an oligopyrimidine tract (5′ TOP), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (15Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G.

A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Thus, the most well understood function of S6K involves a contribution to cell growth by increasing the production of translational machinery. It is possible, however, that S6K also regulates other cell processes such as transcription and cell cycle progression (18de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone C.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Whereas the activation and function of S6K have become more clear of late, the rapid inactivation of S6K that is induced by rapamycin or amino acid withdrawal is somewhat less well understood (20Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Rapamycin functions by binding to its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, and this complex can inhibit the activity of RAFT1/FRAP/mTOR without affecting other kinases such as Akt/PKB or MAP kinases (21Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 22Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Whereas the rapamycin target RAFT1/FRAP/mTOR is associated with an activity that phosphorylates S6K, rapamycin-mediated deactivation of RAFT1/FRAP/mTOR does not explain the rapid dephosphorylation of S6K (8Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). It is possible that rapamycin activates a S6K-specific phosphatase, or that continuously active phosphatases reduce S6K phosphate content once the activating kinases are blocked by rapamycin. While studying the effects of cell stress on the phosphorylation and activation of S6K, we were surprised to observe that whereas the cell stress agents anisomycin and UV light each activated S6K, osmotic stress inactivated the kinase. Consequently, we sought to characterize this method of S6K inhibition. We have found that osmotic stress inactivates S6K through a mechanism other than stimulation of MAP kinase stress cascades. This mechanism appears to be similar to that regulated by rapamycin and involves the activation of a calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and monkey kidney CV1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum (CS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. 293 cells (106) were transiently transfected with pEBG-based vectors (1 μg/expression vector) using the calcium phosphate method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). CV1 cells (106) were transfected with recombinant vTF7–3 vaccinia virus and co-transformed by lipofection with pTM1-based vectors (1 μg/expression vector) as described previously (27Yan M. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19067-19073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Moss B. Elroy S.O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R.

After transfection, the cells were serum-starved or fed as described in the figure legends. The following day, cells were treated with 500 nm anisomycin, 400 mm sorbitol, 1 μg/ml TPA, 10 ng/ml rapamycin (Suren Sehgal; Wyeth Ayerst), 20 μmSB203580 (Calbiochem), 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 nm calyculin A, 5 μm cyclosporin A, 1 μm okadaic acid, 100 μm tautomycin (Alexis Biochemicals), or various combinations of each for the incubation times described in the figure legends. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. UV light stimulation was performed by removing the media, exposing cells to 160 J/m2 of energy in a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800, and then replacing the media and allowing the cells to recover for 30 min before harvesting. Truncation vector mutants of S6K were constructed as described previously (13Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants were constructed using a variation of the megaprimer mutagenesis method as described previously (30Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Diagnostic restriction sites were engineered into mutant sites, and mutated sequences were subcloned into unmutagenized plasmids. The 5A mutant and NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal deletions of S6K have been described previously (13Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 5A mutant contains five alanine residues substituted for threonine or serine residues located at codons 434, 441, 444, 447, and 452. Amino acid numbering for S6K includes the NH2-terminal 23 amino acids present in the p85 isoform. Akt-encoding expression plasmids were obtained from Phil Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). SAPK-β1 and p85-S6K cDNAs were obtained from James Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). MKK6 and p38 clones were obtained from Brent Zanke (Ontario Cancer Institute), and SEK1 cDNA was obtained from Leonard I. Zon (Harvard Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Cells (106 unless otherwise noted) were lysed on ice for 25 min in MLB. Extracts were clarified in a microcentrifuge at 14 krpm at 4 °C for 10 min before immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. Endogenous S6K, SAPK, and PHAS-1 were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the polyclonal antibody CWR#23 (recognizing a COOH-terminal 12-amino acid peptide), CWR#17 (recognizing full-length p54 SAPKβ1), or P21NR (J. Lawrence; University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), respectively, and collected using 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen). Hemagglutinin-tagged S6K was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody 12CA5 and protein A-Sepharose as described above. S6K tagged with the EE epitope, which was derived from polyomavirus middle T antigen, was immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of EE antibodies (Gernot Walter (University of California, San Diego, CA); now available commercially from Babco (Richmond, CA)) covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). GST-S6K was purified by affinity chromatography using 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads. All immunoprecipitations took place at 4 °C for 1–4 h. Purified complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer MLB (containing 2 m LiCl for S6K precipitates) and washed once (twice for S6K precipitates) with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol before use in kinase assays. Endogenous S6K, endogenous PHAS-1, and EE-tagged and hemagglutinin-tagged proteins were detected using the same antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation described above. GST-tagged proteins were detected using polyclonal antibody 29.3. Detection of S6K phosphorylation on Thr412, Ser434, and Thr444/Ser447 was done using polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies (New England Biolabs). Detection of p38 phosphorylation of Thr180/Tyr182 from MLB lysate supernatants was performed using phospho-specific p38 antibodies (New England Biolabs). Bands were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies after SDS-PAGE (10% SDS-PAGE for phospho-S6K blots, 12.5% SDS-PAGE for phospho-p38 blots, and 15% SDS-PAGE for PHAS-1 blots) and transferring to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Washed precipitates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of kinase buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm ATP) containing 2 μg of 40S ribosomes (a gift of W. Merrick; Case Western Reserve University) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of Laemmli protein sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled S6 was quantified with a Packard Instant Imager. Washed precipitates were incubated as described above in kinase buffer containing 1 μg of GST-Jun (5–73) substrate (James Woodgett) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction. Reactions were stopped as described above, proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled GST-Jun was quantified with a Packard Imager. To investigate stress signaling to S6K, we treated CV1 cells with a variety of cell stressors (Fig. 1 A). Whereas all stress stimuli activated endogenous SAPK (bottom panel), only anisomycin and UV light stimulated endogenous S6K activity (middle panel). However, sorbitol did not stimulate S6K; in contrast, it appeared to decrease S6K activity below basal levels. This was apparent in both the loss of S6 phosphorylation activity in S6K immunoprecipitates and the loss of slowly migrating S6K species, which correlate with S6K activity, on immunoblot analysis (top panel). To determine whether osmotic stress could block stimulation of S6K in addition to blocking basal activity, we pretreated 293 cells with sorbitol and then activated S6K with anisomycin or TPA (Fig. 1 B). Osmotic stress pretreatment effectively blocked S6K stimulation by these agents to levels below basal activity. Osmotic stress blocked S6K activation even when added 15 min after the stimulus, and other osmotic stressors such as sodium chloride also inhibited S6K activation (data not shown). Thus, whereas chemical and DNA-damaging stress agents activate S6K, osmotic stress prevents S6K activation. To further understand how osmotic stress might inhibit S6K, we compared osmotic stress and rapamycin inhibition of S6K. First, CV1 cells were treated with sorbitol or rapamycin, and endogenous S6K activity and mobility shift were analyzed (Fig. 2 A). Both treatments inactivated S6K and caused a similar increase in the S6K mobility shift. Next we studied the kinetics of both S6K inactivation and recovery after treatments followed by withdrawal of these drugs. As seen in Fig. 2 B, both rapamycin and osmotic stress caused inactivation of endogenous S6K within 5 min after treatment (lanes 2 and 7). However, S6K activity recovered within 1 h after the removal of sorbitol (Fig. 2 C, lane 10), whereas S6K remained inactive for up to 2 h after the removal of rapamycin (lane 5). This result might mean that although rapamycin and osmotic shock may share a common mechanism, rapamycin forms a more stable inhibitory association with its target. This is further supported by a recent report that rapamycin dissociates from FKBP12 with a t12 of about 17.5 h (31Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of S6K to recover after the removal of osmotic stress implies that upon return to normal osmolarity, S6K is activated through a basal activation mechanism. We asked whether this kind of S6K activation could be inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 2 D). S6K activity recovered 1 h after the removal of sorbitol from the media (lane 3), but when rapamycin was added upon removal of the sorbitol, S6K activity did not recover (lane 4). This indicates that stimulation of S6K activity upon return to normal osmolarity is a rapamycin-sensitive event. Inhibition by rapamycin is associated with the removal of phosphates from a number of serine and threonine residues on S6K (4Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S.J. Totty N.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,32Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether osmotic stress and rapamycin cause dephosphorylation of similar residues, we used phospho-specific S6K antibodies. In the active state, S6K migrated on SDS-PAGE as a series of slow-migrating bands, the slowest of which were detected by S6K phospho-specific antibodies to Ser434 and Thr444/Ser447, as indicated by the arrows in lanes 4 and 7, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Neither of these antibodies detected the faster-migrating inactive S6K that was treated with rapamycin or sorbitol, indicating that both treatments cause dephosphorylation of these residues. Importantly, both sorbitol and rapamycin treatment caused dephosphorylation of Thr412, a residue essential to S6K regulation (4Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), as detected by a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). Consequently, S6K inhibition by sorbitol and rapamycin involves dephosphorylation of at least four of the same residues, implying that they may both act through a similar mechanism. Previous reports have shown that mutation or truncation of S6K can affect its activity and response to rapamycin (13Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mutation of five Ser/Thr-Pro sites in the COOH-terminal tail of S6K to Ala-Pro (S6K-5A) has been shown to partially reduce basal S6K activity while maintaining sensitivity to rapamycin. Similarly, sorbitol treatment of this mutant also inhibited its activity (Fig.4 A, lane 4). Truncation of the NH2-terminal 77 amino acids (ΔN77) or the NH2-terminal 77 amino acids and the COOH-terminal 78 amino acids (ΔN77ΔC434) caused a constitutive increase in S6K activity and relative rapamycin resistance. Likewise, these mutants were also relatively resistant to sorbitol treatment (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6 and 9). Thus, mutations in S6K that alter its response to rapamycin identically alter its response to osmotic stress. Another rapamycin-regulated protein involved in translational regulation is PHAS-1 (34Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rapamycin causes PHAS-1 dephosphorylation and mobility shift change through a pathway parallel to S6K inhibition. To determine whether osmotic shock affects PHAS-1, we analyzed PHAS-1 mobility shift in 293 cells after rapamycin or sorbitol treatment (Fig.5). In both cell lysates and PHAS-1 immunoprecipitations, sorbitol caused an even greater PHAS-1 mobility shift (lanes 3 and 6) than rapamycin (lanes 2 and 5), indicating that osmotic stress can also cause dephosphorylation of PHAS-1. Two kinase cascades that are activated by osmotic stress are the p38 pathway and the SAPK pathway (35Kültz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; : 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of these pathways by osmotic stress is a mechanism by which sorbitol inhibits S6K, we co-expressed dominant negative mutants of stress pathway components with S6K and measured S6K activity after osmotic shock (Fig. 6 A). Neither p38, MKK6, SAPK, nor SEK dominant negatives prevented the sorbitol inhibition of S6K (lanes 3–6). Additionally, blockade of both stress pathways by co-expression of dominant negative p38 and SAPK with S6K did not curtail sorbitol inhibition of S6K (lane 7). Another means of blocking the p38 pathway is through use of SB203580, a drug that causes deactivation and dephosphorylation of p38 (37Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Whereas treatment of CV1 cells with SB203580 did block the phosphorylation of p38 in response to sorbitol (Fig. 6 B, bottom panel, lane 4), it failed to abrogate inhibition of S6K (middle panel, lane 4). Unexpectedly, SB203580 alone partially inhibited S6K activity (lane 2). This may indicate that p38 positively regulates S6K activity or that SB203580 has effects other than inhibiting p38. However, our data suggest that the SAPK and p38 stress pathways are not involved in mediating sorbitol inhibition of S6K. To test the hypothesis that sorbitol inhibits S6K by activating a phosphatase, we pretreated 293 cells with phosphatase inhibitors before osmotic shock. Neither sodium pyrophosphate, sodium orthovanadate (Fig.7 A), nor cyclosporin A (Fig.7 B) restored S6K activity. However, calyculin A, which is a broad specificity phosphatase inhibitor that inhibits PP1 and PP2A equipotently (38Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 39Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), prevented both rapamycin and osmotic shock inhibition of S6K (Fig. 7 C, lanes 5 and 6). Neither okadaic acid, which is more specific for PP2A, nor tautomycin, which is more specific for PP1, was successful in preventing S6K inhibition by osmotic shock (Fig. 7 D, lanes 4 and 5) (40Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, they did cause a slight retardation in S6K mobility on Western blot. To date, we have been unable to effect specific dephosphorylation of S6K with extracts of osmotically shocked cells made in buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or 5 mmEDTA (data not shown). This suggests the existence of a calyculin A-sensitive but okadaic acid- and tautomycin-insensitive S6K phosphatase that is either insoluble or unstable in Nonidet P-40 or EDTA. Although it is not necessary for all means of S6K activation, Akt/PKB can activate S6K in co-expression experiments and is probably a mediator of S6K activation by stimuli such as insulin that pass through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (41Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; : E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar, 42Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Akt activation involves the phosphorylation of Thr473, and the mutation of this site to aspartate can increase Akt activity. We asked whether this mutationally activated Akt could stimulate S6K, and whether this stimulation could still be inhibited by sorbitol (Fig. 8). Co-expression of ΔN60-S473D Akt with S6K stimulated S6K activity 1.6-fold (lane 5) over co-expression with ΔN60, and stimulation of S6K by both Akt mutants was inhibited by sorbitol treatment (lanes 4 and 6). This suggests that sorbitol blocks S6K through a mechanism other than deactivation of Akt. Our results demonstrate the ability of hyperosmotic shock to inhibit both endogenous and transfected S6K in a manner similar to that of rapamycin. In two different cell types, basal activity as well as TPA- or anisomycin-stimulated S6K activity is inhibited by osmotic stress. Additionally, rapamycin and osmotic shock cause dephosphorylation of similar and crucial regulatory sites on S6K. This behavior is another similarity between osmotic shock and rapamycin. Furthermore, S6K mutants that are relatively resistant to rapamycin are also resistant to sorbitol. Taken together, these data imply that rapamycin and osmotic stress operate through common effector mechanisms, possibly through a common phosphatase. SAPK and p38 pathways do not appear to mediate inhibition of S6K in response to osmotic stress. Dominant negative co-transfections and chemical inhibitors of the p38 pathway have no effect on the osmotic stress inhibition of S6K. Because yeast studies have shown that primary osmosensors can regulate transcription without the use of MAP kinase pathways, it is quite possible that mammalian cells can also regulate osmotically stimulated cellular processes independent of SAPK or p38 pathway activation (35Kültz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; : 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such osmosensors and their mechanism of regulation of both MAP kinase-dependent and -independent processes remain to be elucidated in mammalian cells. Our data suggest that both rapamycin and osmotic stress inhibit S6K through stimulation of a calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase. This is in agreement with others who have shown that calyculin A can stimulate S6K activity and can separately increase PHAS-1 phosphorylation (44Lin T.A. Lawrence J.J. Diabetologia. 1997; : S18-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Because calyculin A is a broad specificity phosphatase that inhibits both PP2A and PP1 equipotently, we also tested the effects of okadaic acid, which is more specific for PP2A, and tautomycin, which is more specific for PP1, on osmotic stress inhibition of S6K (40Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Neither of these more specific phosphatase inhibitors appeared to block sorbitol inhibition of S6K, suggesting the possibility of a separate class of phosphatases or the necessity to block both PP2A and PP1 to effect the reversal of osmotic inhibition of S6K. Two recent reports describe a physical interaction between PP2A and S6K (46Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 47Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Curiously, the report by Westphal et al. (46Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) failed to observe a definitive okadaic acid effect on S6K activity, and the report by Peterson et al. (47Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), although documenting a reversal of rapamycin inhibition of S6K by calyculin A, did not show any data regarding okadaic acid effects on S6K. Consequently, speculation exists regarding the true nature of the S6K phosphatase based upon phosphatase inhibitor data. Recently, calyculin A has been shown to activate Akt and prevent osmotic stress inhibition of Akt (48Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The coincident inhibition of both Akt and S6K by sorbitol and the prevention of this inhibition by calyculin A suggest the possibility that sorbitol could inhibit S6K via Akt deactivation. Our data and those in the literature suggest that this is not the case. First, anisomycin and TPA stimulation of S6K can be prevented by sorbitol, but anisomycin and TPA have been reported to have no effect on Akt activity (42Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 49Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Commun. 1998; 249: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use of dominant negative Akt-S308A/T473A suggests that Akt does not participate in stimulation of S6K by agents such as TPA (50Kuroda S. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), although it may contribute to insulin- or heat shock-activated S6K. In addition, rapamycin and sorbitol have similar inhibitory effects on S6K, but rapamycin does not block Akt activation (22Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Finally, we observe that osmotic shock can block S6K activation by the constitutively active Akt mutant ΔN60-T473D. Consequently, our data and that of others suggest that S6K and Akt are regulated independently by osmotic shock. Osmotic stress has been known for decades to inhibit the translational machinery (51Saborio J.L. Pong S.S. Koch G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 85: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Data presented here suggest that translational inhibition by sorbitol may occur in part through the activation of a calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase that inactivates S6K and PHAS-1. The identification of this phosphatase will be important to further elucidate the mechanism of translational inhibition by osmotic stress and the negative regulatory mechanisms of the S6K pathway.

To better understand SNO-Hb, the oxygen binding properties of S-nitrosated forms of normal and sickle cell Hb were investigated. Spectral assays and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry were used to quantify the degree of S-nitrosation. Hb A0 and unpolymerized Hb S exhibit similar shifts toward their R-state conformations in response to S-nitrosation, with increased oxygen affinity and decreased cooperativity. Responses to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate were unaltered, indicating regional changes in the deoxy structure of SNO-Hb that accommodate NO adduction. A cycle of deoxygenation/reoxygenation does not cause loss of NO or appreciable heme oxidation. There is, however, appreciable loss of NO and heme oxidation when oxygen-binding experiments are carried out in the presence of glutathione. These results indicate that the in vivo stability of SNO-Hb and its associated vasoactivity depend on the abundance of thiols and other factors that influence transnitrosation reactions. The increased oxygen affinity and R-state character that result from S-nitrosation of Hb S would be expected to decrease its polymerization and thereby lessen the associated symptoms of sickle cell disease.

Another chapter in the study of the human health significance of Hb is beginning, focused on NO uptake and delivery by Hb and the role this plays in the control of blood pressure and other NO-dependent reactions. Nitrosation of sulfhydryl groups on the Hb tetramer creates S-nitrosated Hb (SNO-Hb), which has been shown to play an important role in NO uptake and delivery (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosated forms of proteins such as Hb can be formed via interaction with nitrosating agents formed upon interaction of NO and oxygen (NOx) and by NO-exchange reactions (transnitrosations) with nitrosated forms of low molecular weight thiols such as cysteine and glutathione. Conversely, the low molecular weight thiols can act as NO acceptors in transnitrosation reactions where NO is donated by S-nitrosated proteins (2Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 3Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Hb-based NO transport via SNO-Hb is significant because it can greatly extend the range of NO-dependent reactions. Unlike SNO-Hb, free NO is a very reactive molecule, whose lifetime in the complex cellular milieu would be expected to be very short. It is this characteristic of NO that delayed the discovery of NO-dependent reactions in smooth muscle relaxation, platelet inhibition, neurotransmission, and immune regulation (4Hogg N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 5Feelisch, M., and Stamler, J. S.

What is learned about Hb-based NO transport will have far-ranging applications in these disparate fields. The studies reported here concern the oxygen binding properties of variably S-nitrosated adult human hemoglobin (Hb A0) and sickle cell hemoglobin (Hb S) that has a Glu → Val substitution at β6. Although physiological levels of S-nitrosation of Hb are too low for oxygen transport to be significantly affected, the linkage between S-nitrosation and oxygen binding by Hb can affect the stability and subsequent vasoactivity of SNO-Hb. Understanding this linkage is critical for understanding the NO-dependent reactions of Hb in normal and sickle cell erythrocytes, in cell-free Hb-based blood substitutes, or in pharmaceuticals. As will be shown, S-nitrosation of Hb A and unpolymerized Hb S results in increased oxygen affinity via partial stabilization of their high affinity, R-state, conformations. Since R-state-stabilized Hb S does not readily polymerize (9Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), this finding prompts us to suggest that S-nitrosation of Hb S may be viewed as a possible therapeutic approach to alleviating sickle cell disease. Functional and crystallographic studies have shown that the Cys-β93 residues at which NO is bound as NO+ in SNO-Hb are more accessible in the high affinity conformation of oxy (R-state) Hb than in deoxy (T-state) Hb (10Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions With Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational sensitivity results in a rate dependence for SNO-Hb formation that mirrors the greater relative exposure of Cys-β93 in conditions that favor the R-state and was invoked to explain the decreased stability of the deoxy form of SNO-Hb (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Although deoxy SNO-Hb is less stable than the oxy form, we found that purified deoxy SNO-Hb is sufficiently stable to allow oxygen-binding studies to be carried out over a period of several hours. However, as will be documented, loss of NO from SNO-Hb during a cycle of deoxygenation/re-oxygenation can occur under simulated in vivo conditions where NO acceptors such as glutathione are present. Because the sulfhydryl groups at Cys-β93 are in a conformationally sensitive position on the Hb tetramer, the S-nitrosation of Hb would be expected to have heterotropic allosteric effects on ligand binding by the heme groups at the four active sites of the tetramer. The following results document the existence and nature of these thiosteric effects. We show that S-nitrosation promotes increased oxygen affinity and thus acts in opposition to anionic allosteric effectors that decrease oxygen affinity. Hb A0and Hb S show similar responses to S-nitrosation, as expected based on their similar structures in the region of Cys-β93 (13Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The shift of SNO-Hb forms toward higher oxygen affinity probably involves a regional conformational alteration of the deoxyHb tetramer that prevents His-β146 from making its normal contribution to T-state stability. This was previously shown to be the case in Hb in which the SH groups at Cys-β93 were modified by N-ethylmaleimide (11Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1982Google Scholar). We previously showed that increasing anion levels can modulate Hb function by decreasing the frequency and extent of conformational fluctuations that control the accessibility of the heme groups where oxygen is bound (15Bonaventura C. Tesh S. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Crumbliss A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report we show that these same considerations underlie the anion-dependence of oxygen binding to SNO-Hb and its decreased stability in the presence of low molecular weight thiols. Samples of Hb A0 and Hb S were prepared by using the ammonium sulfate method, stripped of organic phosphate cofactors and purified by chromatography as described previously (16Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Godette G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9250-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of oxidized Hb (metHb), oxygenated Hb (oxyHb), and hemichrome were determined by spectral analysis by methods published by Winterbourn and co-workers (17Winterbourn C.C. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples that contained any detectable hemichrome or greater than 5% metHb were discarded. For experiments with SNO-Hb, the stock Hb solutions, typically 1–3 mm in heme units (Fe porphyrin units), were made just before use and were never frozen. Other experiments where metHb formation was less critical used stock Hb solutions that were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to use. To generate samples with progressively higher levels of metHb, samples were repetitively deoxygenated and re-oxygenated with intervening periods of exposure to low oxygen levels. HEPES, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and KNO2 (from Sigma) and KCl (Fisher; >99%), were dissolved and adjusted to pH values indicated. The metal chelators used were 0.1 mm DTPA or 0.05 mm EDTA, which gave equivalent results in the studies reported here. Our protocol for generation of Hb with varied levels of S-nitrosation used purified oxygenated Hbs at 0.5–3 mm in heme in 2% borate buffer at pH 9.2 with 0.1 m DTPA or 0.05 m EDTA. These were kept in the dark at 4 °C and exposed to CysNO at varied levels (ratios of 0.5–4 CysNO to heme) and incubated for time periods of 0–5 min prior to chromatograhy. This range of conditions was found to be adequate for generation of samples with a wide span of S-nitrosation. The low molecular weight NO donor, CysNO, was removed by passage through a 22-cm Sephadex G25 column at 4 °C. The elution volumes for free Hb and free CysNO were determined, and controls were run to ensure that all low molecular weight materials were separated from the eluted SNO-Hb sample. The purified SNO-Hb was dialyzed against selected buffers for use in subsequent experiments. The variably S-nitrosated Hb samples were spectrally evaluated after dialysis to the desired pH and anion condition and rejected if they contained detectable hemichromes or more than 5% oxidized Hb A0 or 9% oxidized Hb S. The fraction of S-nitrosation was typically determined by spectral deconvolution analysis as described here. Prior to spectral evaluation, the samples were subjected to Sephadex G-25 chromatography with 2% borate, 0.1 mm DTPA buffer, pH 9.2 (carried out at 4 °C) to standardize the sample pH and buffer conditions and to remove any low molecular weight materials. The samples were degassed in tonometers and subjected to spectral analysis before and after treatment with 4 mg/ml dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite, Tech, Acros Chemical Co.). Dithionite addition rapidly removes any residual oxygen, reduces any metHb present and releases NO from the SNO linkage. The NO is effectively captured by the reduced heme, and the spectrum that results is that of partially NO-Hb. NO gas (National Welders, CP grade), further purified by passage through 5 m and then 1m NaOH, is added to the degassed, dithionite-treated sample, and the spectrum of fully NO-Hb is obtained after a 10-min equilibration period. Comparisons of the partially and fully NO-Hb spectra allow the fraction of S-nitrosation prior to dithionite treatment to be determined. The degree to which the dithionite-treated sample shows the presence of the NO-Hb spectrum is a direct result of NO released from SNO-Hb, since there was no prior NO ligation of the heme and all low molecular weight thiols and nitrogen oxides that could contribute NO have been removed. Accordingly, a sample that has 50% NO-Hb after dithionite treatment corresponds to 100% S-nitrosation of the two β93 SH groups. Samples with internal SH groups nitrosated can give higher than 50% NO-Hb readings after dithionite treatment. The dithionite-treated sample was analyzed 5 min after dithionite addition. Since the NO binding to deoxy heme is very fast (diffusion limited) and the NO dissociation rate is extremely slow, the fact that free NO liberated from the NO-Hb complex is slowly reduced by dithionite is not a serious detriment to this spectral assay (18Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This somewhat cumbersome protocol avoids experimental difficulties associated with troublesome dithionite reaction products and the pH and anion-dependent variation of the Hb-NO spectrum. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with some modifications of the method reported by Ferranti et al. (19Ferranti P. Malorni A. Mamone G. Sannolo N. Marino G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) confirmed that the sole effect of the transnitrosation treatment was S-nitrosation of β93 SH groups. This methodology also guided our choice of experimental conditions where internal SH groups were neither nitrosated nor cystinylated. The mass spectrometry method was done in aqueous solution using a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Z-spray ion source. The Hb samples were electrosprayed in 0.02 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.04. Oxygen binding measurements were performed tonometrically, with a modified spectrophotometric method based on that of Riggs and Wolbach (20Riggs A.F. Wolbach R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1956; 39: 585-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The S-nitrosated samples were kept in the dark except during spectral analysis (<30 s for data collection with a Hewlett-Packard model 8451A or model 8453 diode array spectrophotometer), and very few data points were collected in each set to minimize the time under low oxygen conditions where Hb oxidation was most pronounced. The total curves presented are composites of data points from multiple experiments, with each experiment limited to about 2 h. Since the presence of metHb can influence the binding curves, experiments that resulted in >12% metHb A0 or Hb S at the end of the experiment were not used. Modification of previously published procedures was required for generation of S-nitrosated Hb suitable for measurements of oxygen binding and anaerobic redox reactions. We found that exposing high (>500 μm) concentrations of oxyHb at 4 °C with low ratios of CysNO to Hb for short time intervals in the dark in 2% borate-EDTA or DTPA buffer, pH 9.2, largely avoided metHb formation and nitrosation of internal SH groups. These conditions also minimized metal or light-induced release of NO from CysNO and subsequent NO-induced Hb oxidation. Inclusion of a metal chelator in all buffers was essential to prevent the metal-catalyzed formation of disulfides (5Feelisch, M., and Stamler, J. S. (eds) (1996) Methods in Nitric Oxide Research, pp. 71-115, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The short half-life usually found for CysNO is due to artifactual contamination of buffers with copper or other redox-active trace metals (21McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. Askew S.C. Butler A.R. Russell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1758-1759Crossref Google Scholar). Free copper and iron in off-the-shelf buffers may frequently be in the nanomolar range, levels sufficient to alter reactions from the pathways they would take in the absence of redox metals. Transnitrosation reactions to create SNO-Hb have the net result shown simplistically in the equilibrium representation below, where R represents a low molecular weight thiol.RS­NO+Hb↔R­SH+SNO­HbREACTION1The extent of S-nitrosation of Hb samples after removal of the low molecular weight NO donor was typically determined by spectral deconvolution analysis under standard conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 shows representative spectra for deoxygenated SNO-Hb, the mixture of deoxy and NO-Hb that results from dithionite addition, and the final NO-Hb spectrum obtained after NO addition to fully occupy the heme binding sites. The spectrum of deoxygenated SNO-Hb indicates the presence of a low level of metHb that exceeds that of the deoxygenated control sample, but shows no evidence of NO ligation of the heme. The amount of NO liganded to the heme that appears after the NO-linkage to Cys-β93 is disrupted by dithionite is used to estimate the extent of S-nitrosation. For some samples the extent of S-nitrosation was also quantified by the Saville reaction (22Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar, 23Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10828) Google Scholar), with a standard curve generated with precisely determined quantities of nitrite. The results obtained were within 10% of the values obtained with our deconvolution assays. The experimental conditions used in our experiments were established by detailed studies of reactions between CysNO and Hb, in which we used an innovative approach to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry that avoided the use of organic solvents. 2C. Bonaventura, G. Ferruzzi, S. Tesh, and R. D. Stevens, manuscript in preparation. Using this technique, we obtained spectra of Hb samples after varied periods of exposure to CysNO and chromatographic removal of this low molecular weight NO donor. A representative spectrum is shown in Fig.2, in which the β chains are about 50%S-nitrosated. Under our reaction conditions, the mass change associated with NO addition to the β chains is the only mass change observed. We determined the effects of S-nitrosation on oxygen binding by Hb A0 in chloride-free HEPES buffer and in the presence of a 50-fold excess of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate over tetramer concentration. The extent of S-nitrosation of Hb A0 was measured before and after oxygen equilibria and found to be equivalent in these experiments. Readers are reminded that care was taken to avoid S-nitrosation of buried residues, which can result in shifts in log P50 larger than those shown. As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” these experiments were designed to minimize exposure to light and to time at low O2. In the results presented here, the Hb samples had low (<5%) initial levels of metHb and less than 10% metHb after completion of oxygen equilibria, even at high levels of S-nitrosation. The results presented in Fig.3 A are for approximately 30%, 40%, and 80% S-nitrosated Hb A0 and 0%S-nitrosated controls in chloride-free HEPES/EDTA buffer at pH 7.5. Our estimates of the degree of S-nitrosation of a sample varied by ±5%. The changes toward higher affinity are progressive with increases in degree of S-nitrosation. Fig.3 B shows similar data for 0% and approximately 80%S-nitrosated Hb A0 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) at 50-fold excess over tetramer concentration. The data shown are representative of many similar experiments and show shifts induced by S-nitrosation toward higher oxygen affinity in both the presence and absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. For approximately 80% S-nitrosated samples, the Δlog P50 values in the absence and presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate were 0.211 and 0.262, respectively. The initial stages of oxygenation are most affected by S-nitrosation (Δlog P10 > Δlog P50), resulting in asymmetric shifts away from the control data. The corresponding values of Δlog P10 were 0.408 and 0.365, again approximately the same for Hb in HEPES/DTPA and in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The asymmetric shifts in oxygen affinity associated with S-nitrosation result in decreases in cooperativity of oxygen binding as measured by the slope of Hill plots at the mid-point of the binding curves (n50). For samples in HEPES/DTPA, n50 decreased from 3.16 to 2.10, while for samples in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, n50 decreased from 3.33 to 2.54. These alterations of oxygen binding brought about by S-nitrosation are very similar to alterations reported for Hb in which the SH groups are modified with N-ethylmaleimide (24Imai K. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 798-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Some metHb is formed during S-nitrosation reactions as a result of NO (liberated from CysNO) interacting with oxygenated Hb. By limiting the levels of CysNO used and time of exposure, it was possible to generate SNO-Hb samples with low levels of metHb for use in oxygen binding experiments. To estimate the effect of increased levels of metHb, we carried out oxygen binding studies with unmodified Hb A0 with progressively higher levels of metHb. The Hill plots of Fig.3 C show that the R-state shifts induced by metHb formation are similar in character to those associated with S-nitrosation. The shifts associated with S-nitrosation are, however, much larger than can be attributed to metHb formation in the SNO-Hb samples. Under our assay conditions, where levels of metHb were minimized, the shifts in log P50 attributable to the presence of metHb in the S-nitrosated samples are less than 10% of the shifts observed. Prior studies have shown deoxy SNO-Hb to be less stable than oxy SNO-Hb (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Deoxygenation is a necessary step in the oxygenation studies reported here, a condition that was expected to cause some loss of NO due to instability of deoxy SNO-Hb. Our preparations, however, showed no appreciable loss of NO during oxygen binding experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, the preparations of oxy SNO-Hb used in these studies were stable for over a week without loss of NO when stored at 4 °C at high protein concentration. Samples stored in the deoxygenated condition or at lower protein concentration were less stable and had greater loss of NO and more metHb formation. The data shown in Fig. 4 are for aliquots withdrawn from oxy and deoxy samples of about 80%S-nitrosated Hb, 1 mm in heme, held at 4 °C. The aliquots were brought to standard conditions for spectral deconvolution assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stability of SNO-Hb as demonstrated in this figure is important in allowing for its storage or shipment prior to use in functional studies. In contrast to the stability noted above, appreciable diminution of S-nitrosation of Hb A0 occurs when experiments are carried out in the presence of a 5-fold excess of reduced glutathione (GSH). The bar graph of Fig.5 illustrates the destabilizing influence of GSH at several levels of S-nitrosation (achieved by exposure to different levels of CysNO for varied times). Previous work demonstrated that GSH can accept NO from SNO-Hb in transnitrosation reactions (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that SNO-Hb is partly but not completely destabilized when deoxygenation occurs in the presence of this high level of GSH. In vivo conditions may result in more loss of NO during the deoxygenation process. Fig. 5 also shows that the loss of NO from SNO-Hb is roughly the same in the presence and absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Appreciable increases in metHb levels occur when oxygenation of SNO-Hb is carried out in the presence of glutathione, with metHb levels typically 25–27% after oxygen equilibria, in contrast to <10% metHb in its absence. This is a consequence of GSH interactions with SNO-Hb, since control experiments showed no effect of GSH on oxygen affinity or metHb levels for unmodified Hb A0 (data not shown). The increase in metHb probably results from interactions between oxyHb and free NO that is released from either SNO-Hb or S-nitrosated glutathione during oxygen equilibria. We determined the effects of S-nitrosation on oxygen binding by purified Hb S in HEPES buffer containing EDTA or DTPA and in the presence of a 50-fold excess of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate over tetramer concentration. No aggregation of Hb S was expected or observed upon deoxygenation at the concentrations (60 μmin heme) used in these experiments. Aggregation-dependent effects that are evident at much higher protein concentration were not studied. The representative results presented in Fig.6 A are for approximately 80%S-nitrosated Hb S and 0% S-nitrosated controls in chloride-free HEPES/EDTA buffer at pH 7.5. Fig. 6 B shows a similar pair in the presence of DPG. In these studies, both control and S-nitrosated samples of Hb S were more prone to autoxidation than comparable samples of Hb A0. The sample handling required for our studies made it difficult to obtain data with low levels of metHb S, and many data sets were not useful due to high metHb levels. The results shown are for control and S-nitrosated forms of Hb S samples with relatively low levels of metHb measured before (≤9%) and after (≤15%) oxygen binding. The initial stages of oxygenation of unpolymerized Hb S are most affected by S-nitrosation (Δlog P10> Δlog P50), resulting in asymmetric shifts away from the control data. The leftward shift of log P10 is approximately the same in the presence and absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, resulting in equivalent decreases in cooperativity to about two thirds of the normal values. These results are very similar to those described above for S-nitrosation of Hb A0. Understanding the properties of SNO-Hb is critical for better understanding of the NO-dependent reactions moderated by Hb. Results presented here show that S-nitrosation stabilizes the high affinity R-state conformation of Hb, as previously reported for Hbs reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, and other SH group modifiers (11Perutz M.F.

Thiosteric effects brought about by S-nitrosation of Cys-β93 thus act in opposition to the well known allosteric effectors of Hb function (protons, chloride, organic and inorganic phosphates, bicarbonate, and carbon dioxide) that typically decrease oxygen affinity and thereby enhance oxygen delivery to respiring tissues. For SNO-Hb, as found for other SH-modified Hbs, it is probable that the Cys-β93 residues do not assume their normal position in the deoxygenated molecule, with the consequence that formation of the salt bridge between His-β146 and Asp-β94 is inhibited. This critical salt bridge is oxygen-linked, and its pH-dependent formation accounts for about half of the normal Bohr effect (11Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,12Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational sensitivity of SNO-Hb was shown in an earlier publication to be involved in a dynamic cycle in which SNO-Hb was formed in the lungs and decomposed when NO was delivered to the tissues. The greater accessibility of the Cys-β93 residues in the oxy (R-state) conformation compared with the deoxy (T-state) conformation of Hb was invoked to account for the more facile S-nitrosation of liganded (R-state) Hb and the greater stability of SNO-Hb in the liganded form (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). The results presented here expand upon these earlier findings and illustrate that deoxygenation alone is not sufficient to cause release of NO from SNO-Hb. NO is accommodated in the altered deoxy structure of SNO-Hb, making it possible to deoxygenate the protein without significant loss of NO. However, we show that the presence of glutathione destabilizes SNO-Hb and allows for NO transfer away from SNO-Hb during a cycle of deoxygenation and re-oxygenation. In red cells, where thiols such as GSH can serve as NO acceptors, the conformational sensitivity of SNO-Hb would facilitate NO release upon deoxygenation. These findings are relevant to the increased vasodilatory action reported for oxy SNO-Hb in the presence of glutathione (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Differences in thiosteric and anionic mechanisms of control of Hb function are indicated by the results presented here and by previous studies on other SH-modified Hbs. Notably, S-nitrosation results in equivalent shifts of log P10 in the presence or absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, the responses of normal and SNO-Hb to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate are equivalent, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate does not significantly affect the release of NO from SNO-Hb in a cycle of deoxygenation/re-oxygenation in the presence of glutathione. These observations indicate the existence of regional rather than global effects associated with thiosteric and anionic effectors, a conclusion reached earlier by Perutz and co-workers in regard to the anion sensitivity of Hb in which the SH groups at Cys-β93 were modified by N-ethylmaleimide (11Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This regional control of oxygen affinity makes it possible for SNO-Hb forms to exhibit varied oxygen affinities, dependent on the nature of the parent Hb and its environment. The regional effects associated with SH group modification have been shown to result, in large part, from disruption of the normal salt bridge between His-β146 and Asp-β94, which in turn decreases the proximal-side pull on the heme-iron that normally confers T-state character on deoxygenated Hb (11Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev.

It does not appear that SH group modification by S-nitrosation appreciably alters the β chain anion-binding site in Hb A0 or in Hb S, since in both proteins the magnitude of the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effect is equivalent for the normal and S-nitrosated forms. The similarity of responses of Hb A0 and Hb S to S-nitrosation mirrors their structural similarities as shown by x-ray crystallography (13Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Anion-induced shifts in the Hill plot asymptotes are not interpretable as solely due to their preferential binding to the T-state, a feature that led Minton and Imai (30Minton A.P. Imai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to suggest that a minimum of three states was required to describe Hb function. We recently advanced a new paradigm of Hb function in which anion-induced shifts in the apparent T-state are explained by anion-dependent alterations in the conformational fluctuations that expose “buried” sites (15Bonaventura C. Tesh S. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Crumbliss A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The functional properties of SNO-Hb as described above are supportive of this paradigm. This paradigm also rationalizes the absence of a 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effect on the loss of NO from SNO-Hb in the presence of glutathione, since Cys-β93 in the altered deoxy state of S-nitrosated Hb is relatively free of steric hindrance and is thereby insensitive to anion-induced decreases in conformational fluctuations. Differences in thiosteric and anionic mechanisms of control of Hb function may be of considerable significance for understanding the linkage between the oxygen affinity and polymerization of Hb S and for designing better treatments to alleviate sickle cell disease. Treatments that increase the oxygen affinity of Hb S generally decrease polymerization and the associated red cell morphological changes associated with sickle cell disease (9Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Significantly, Hb S derivatives with SH groups modified with glutathione (26Garel M.-C. Domenget C. Caburi-Martin J. Prehu C. Galacteros F. Beuzard Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14704-14709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or other thiol reagents (25Domenget C. Garel M.-C. Rhoda M.-D. Caburi-Martin J. Galacteros F. Beuzard Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 830: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 27Garel M.C. Caburi-Martin J. Domenget C. Kister J. Craescu C.T. Poyart C. Beuzard Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have decreased tendencies to polymerize. Accordingly, the results reported here lead us to anticipate that new approaches to sickle cell therapies may involve ways to increase the S-nitrosation of Hb S and thereby reduce its tendency to form polymers. At the relatively low protein concentrations used in the experiments reported here, Hb A0 and Hb S exhibit similar oxygen affinities and similar responses to S-nitrosation. In contrast, at protein concentrations like those in red cells, the protein concentration-dependent formation of Hb S polymers is accompanied by decreases in its oxygen affinity that may result in distinctive responses to S-nitrosation. The lowering of oxygen affinity associated with polymerization of Hb S (31Benesch R.E. Edalji R. Kwong S. Benesch R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and with crystallization of Hb A0 (32Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) may reflect decreases in the conformational fluctuations that expose the sterically restricted active sites. Readers will recognize this interpretation as another facet of the conformational fluctuations paradigm described above. Inhalation of low concentrations of NO was recently reported to increase the oxygen affinity of sickle erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo (33Head C.A. Brugnara C. Martinez-Ruiz R. Kacmarek R.M. Bridges K.R. Kuter D. Bloch K.D. Zapol W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After treatment, the oxygen affinity of the sickle erythrocytes was approximately equal to that of the normal controls, where polymerization does not occur. This result implies that the NO treatment brought about a reduction in the polymerization of Hb S, as would be expected to occur if the non-polymerizing R-state of Hb S was partially stabilized, as it is in SNO-Hb. Partial heme ligation by NO or heme oxidation induced by NO would also result in higher oxygen affinity. Accordingly, we have initiated studies to determine if Hb S gelation is significantly inhibited by NO ligation or S-nitrosation at levels that might be achievable in vivo. The data thus far available on the vasodilatory effects of SNO-Hb show that oxidation of the metal center affects NO release and thereby the NO-dependent physiological reactions associated with SNO-Hb (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, Hb S oxidation was much more pronounced than that of Hb A0, suggestive of altered NO uptake and delivery for this variant form of Hb even in its unpolymerized state. The greater tendency of Hb S to autoxidize has been noted previously, and the resistance to malaria associated with Hb S has been postulated to arise in part as a consequence of greater oxidative events in red cells containing Hb S than for red cells containing only Hb A0 (34Nagel R.L. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 321-339PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schacter L.P. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 16: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consequently, the R-state shifts in Hb S induced by S-nitrosation and by oxidation may be joint determinants of the role played by Hb S in malarial resistance, Hb-linked vasodilation, and sickle cell disease. A paper by Patel et al. (28Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), published subsequent to acceptance of this manuscript, supports our finding that S-nitrosation of Hb A increases its oxygen affinity. A major difference in results reported is that these researchers found unaltered cooperativity for SNO-Hb A. This is in marked contrast to our observation that cooperativity is reduced in SNO-Hb relative to unmodified Hb and also in contrast to the pattern of behavioral alterations commonly associated with β93 modification by other SH-specific reagents. A difference in methodology is that we overcame problems of metHb formation during exposure of Hb to CysNO, while they compensated for this problem by use of a metHb reductase system after SNO-Hb formation. There is, however, agreement that the SH group modification with NO does not abolish the quaternary conformational changes associated with oxygenation and deoxygenation that underlie allosteric control of NO delivery from SNO-Hb.

On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the Epo-Epo fusion protein migrated as a broad band with an average apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa, slightly more than twice the average apparent molecular mass of Epo, 37 kDa. Enzymatic N-deglycosylation resulted in an Epo-Epo species that migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a narrow band with an average apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa. The specific activity of the Epo-Epo fusion protein in vitro (1,007 IU/μg; 76 IU/pmol) was significantly greater than that of Epo (352 IU/μg; 13 IU/pmol). Moreover, secretion of Epo-Epo by COS cells was 8-fold greater than that of Epo. Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of Epo-Epo to mice resulted in a significant increase in red blood cell production within 7 days.

A problem encountered in their use is the frequency with which injections must be made in order to maintain a therapeutic level in the circulation. One means of increasing the plasma half-life of injected proteins is chemical conjugation with polyethylene glycol (“pegylation”) (1Delgado C. Francis G.E. Fisher D. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 1992; 9: 249-304PubMed Google Scholar). Although apparent success has been achieved with some proteins (2Tsutsumi Y. Tsunoda S. Kamada H. Kihira T. Kaneda Y. Ohsugi Y. Mayumi T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this method can sometimes alter protein structure, reduce biological activity, or cause unanticipated changes in specificity and function (3Mabrouk P.A.

We hypothesized that an alternative approach would be the production of a multivalent molecule consisting of two or more biologically active units of the same protein. We speculated that these molecules would exhibit an increased plasma half-life and would also possess enhanced activity due to facilitated binding of the repeating units to their cognate receptors and to amplification of the intracellular signaling pathways. We and others have shown previously that such molecules could be produced by chemical cross-linking (6Sytkowski A.J. Lunn E.D. Davis K.L. Feldman L. Siekman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1184-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Mockridge J.W. Aston R. Morrell D.J. Holder A.T. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, a fusion protein with two human erythropoietin (Epo)1 domains linked by three to seven amino acids exhibited reduced in vitro activity compared with the wild-type monomer (8Qiu H. Belanger A. Yoon H.-W.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11173-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We now report the production of a recombinant fusion protein consisting of two complete human Epo molecules in tandem separated by a 17-amino acid linker. Both Epo domains of the fusion protein are equally biologically active. Importantly, the protein has substantially enhanced potency and efficacy over conventional recombinant Epo in vitro and in vivo and is efficacious after a single subcutaneous injection. Two different Epo cDNA constructs were produced by amplifying pSV2-Epo (9Chern Y. Chung T. Sytkowski A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and then ligated to form the Epo-Epo fusion protein cDNA. The initial preceding (Domain A) Epo DNA strand (Epo A1) was produced by amplifying pSV2-Epo using primers EpA5′ and EpA3-3 (see below). The 3′ end was sequentially extended by amplifying with EpA3-4 and EpA3-5. Epo A2 was produced by amplifying Epo A1 with primers EpA5′ and EpA3-4, and Epo A3 was produced by amplifying Epo A1 with primers EpA5′ and EpA3-5. The succeeding (Domain B) Epo DNA strand (Epo B) was obtained by amplification of pSV2 Epo using EpB5-1 and EpB3′. Gel-purified Epo A3 and Epo B were ligated into the cloning vector pCR-blunt (InVitrogen) using a vector:insert ratio of 1:10. Kanamycin-resistant colonies (50 μg/ml) were plucked, and positive clones were identified by restriction digest analysis using Bgl I. The resulting constructs were designated Epo A (blunt and Epo B) blunt. The primer sequences were as follows: (a) EpA5′, 5′-AGGCGCGGAGATGGGGGTGCAC; (b) EpA3-3, 3′-CCAGATCCACCACCGCCGGCTCTGTCCCCTGTCCTGCAGG; (c) EpA3-4, 3′-CGCCACCGGATCCACCGCCACCAGATCCACCACCGCCGGC; (d) EpA3-5, 3′-TGGTGGGGCAGTACTGCCGCCGCCACCGGATCCACCGCC; (e) EpB5-1, 5′-GCGGCAGTACTGCCCCACCACGCCTCATCTGTGACAGC; and (f) EpB3′, 3′-CAGGTGGACACACCTGGTCATC. Epo A/blunt was digested with Sca I and Xho I, whereas Epo B/blunt was digested with Sca I and Bam HI. Gel-purified Epo A/blunt and Epo B/blunt digests were ligated in a 1:1 molar ratio. The resulting 1.2- and 1.4-kilobase bands were gel-purified and then ligated into expression vector pCDNA3.1(−) (InVitrogen) that had been digested previously with Bam HI and Xho I and gel-purified. Ampicillin-resistant colonies (10 μg/ml) were plucked, and positive clones were identified by restriction digest analysis using Ngo M. The reactions (50 μl) contained 0.5 m 5′ or 3′ primer; 10 ng of pSV2-Epo; 200 μm dATP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8; 2 mm MgCl2; 10 mmKCl; 6 mm (NH4)2SO4; 0.1% Triton X-100; 10 g/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin; and 2.5 units/plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase (Stratagene). They were subjected to 25 cycles of (a) 1-min denaturation at 95 °C, (b) 1-min annealing at 58 °C, and (c) 1-min extension at 72 °C. Ligation reactions for pCR-blunt contained 25 ng of vector and a 10-fold molar excess of either Epo A3 or Epo B. 10-μl reactions contained 6 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 7 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, and 4 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase (InVitrogen). Incubations were carried out for 1 h at 16 °C. pcDNA 3.1(−) ligations contained a vector:insert ratio of 5:1, and the reaction conditions described above were used. 50 μl of One Shot TOP10 competent cells (InVitrogen) were transformed with 2 μl of ligation reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's procedure. An Epo mutant with arginine 103 replaced by alanine, pSV2-Epo 103 (R103A) (10Grodberg J. Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was spliced into Epo A/blunt to produce Epo 103A/blunt. Epo 103B/blunt was produced by amplifying pSV2-Epo103 using primers EpoB-51 and EpoB3. Restriction sites used to insert the mutant strand were Bcg I and Acc I for Epo 103A/blunt. The procedure for ligating Epo A, Epo B, Epo 103A, and Epo 103B was described above. Three mutant fusion constructs were produced: (a) Epo A-Epo 103B/pcDNA 3.1(−), (b) Epo 103A-EpoB/pcDNA 3.1(−), and (c) Epo 103A-Epo 103B/pcDNA 3.1(−), resulting in fusion proteins Epowt/EpoR103A, EpoR103A/Epowt, and EpoR103A/EpoR103A, respectively. The mutant Epo 103 was also spliced into pcDNA3.1(−) in the Eco NI restriction sites. Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The manufacturer's protocol was followed, and the RNA obtained was separated on 1.2% agarose containing 5.5% formaldehyde and transferred to GeneScreen Plus. The DIG-labeled probe was generated according to the procedure described by the manufacturer. COS1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown to 70% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 6 mm glucose, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/glucose to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 10 μg of DNA were added to 0.5 ml of cells, and the cells were electroporated at 0.3 kV, 250 farads (Bio-Rad Electroporator). The cells were plated into 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Supernatant medium was harvested, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C, and then dialyzed against α- minimum Eagle's medium. These samples were assayed for Epo protein and biological activity. Epo and Epo-Epo fusion proteins were measured by Western blot and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were then rinsed twice with distilled water and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST and 10% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.5. The membranes were rinsed twice with TBST, washed once with TBST for 15 min and washed twice with TBST for 5 min each. The membranes were then incubated with anti-erythropoietin monoclonal antibody AE-7A5 (11Sytkowski A.J. Fisher J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14727-14731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Genzyme); 0.7 μg/ml TBST, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 23 °C. Rinsing and washing were carried out as described above, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) diluted 1:1000 in TBST and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 23 °C. Rinsing and washing were again carried out as described above, plus two additional washes for 5 min each. Protein bands recognized by the primary antibody were detected using a luminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ELISA (Genzyme) was calibrated with recombinant human Epo. SDS (0.5%) and 5% β-mercaptoethanol were added to a COS1 cell culture supernatant containing the Epo-Epo fusion protein, and the solution was heated at 100 °C for 2 min. After cooling, 0.5 volume of 5% Nonidet P-40 (to counteract the inhibitory effects of SDS on N-glycanase) and 1 volume of incubation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) were added to the supernatant. Specified concentrations of N-glycanase (peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase; Genzyme) were added to 100-μl aliquots of the prepared supernatants. All samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then prepared for SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic transfer and Western blotting were performed essentially as described above. The bioactivity of samples (in IU) was determined in vitro essentially as described by Krystal (12Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar). The laboratory standard of recombinant Epo used to generate the standard curve was calibrated against the World Health Organization Second International Reference Preparation. Each sample was diluted with bioassay medium containing 78% α-minimum Eagle's medium, 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three groups of C57BL/6J mice (8–10-week-old females) were used. Before administration of Epo or Epo-Epo, each animal was anesthetized, and its hematocrit was determined using blood obtained by filling two heparinized microhematocrit tubes from the retro-orbital venous plexus. An identifying mark was placed on each animal to permit the determination of its pre- and post-treatment hematocrit individually. The animals were weighed, and each received an identical amount (in IU) of Epo or Epo-Epo fusion protein by subcutaneous injection. The biological activities of the treatment samples were verified in triplicate by in vitro bioassay. The frequency of treatment was once only (day 1). On day 8, the post-treatment hematocrit of each animal was determined. Student's t test was used to determine whether the mean changes between the pre- and post-treatment hematocrits of each treatment group were different. An α level of 0.05 (two-sided test) was used. Two groups of female CD-1 mice (8–10 weeks old) were used. Before the administration of Epo or Epo-Epo, 40–50 μl of blood were collected from the tail vein into heparinized microhematocrit tubes. The tubes were centrifuged, and the plasma was collected and frozen at −80 °C. Each animal received 6 IU of Epo or Epo-Epo by intravenous injection, and blood samples were obtained at 5 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h thereafter. The injections were performed by a technical specialist staff member of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Animal Research Facility. The integrity of each injection and the absence of extravasation were confirmed by an independent observer. We constructed an Epo-Epo fusion protein cDNA (Fig.1) beginning at the 5′ end with the complete coding region of the 193-amino acid human Epo pre-protein (13Jacobs K. Shoemaker C. Rudersdorf R.

Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). Epo migrated as a broad band with an average apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa, consistent with the glycosylation of the 18.4-kDa polypeptide (15Sytkowski A.J. Feldman L. Zurbuch D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at each of its four sugar attachment sites. In contrast, Epo-Epo migrated with an average apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa. This is what would be predicted from efficient glycosylation of the four sugar attachment sites in each domain (37 kDa + 37 kDa) with the addition of the 17-amino acid peptide linker sequence (1.8 kDa). This result implies little or no steric hindrance of the co-translational glycosylation and oligosaccharide processing of the fusion protein. The results of N-deglycosylation support this conclusion. Treatment of Epo-Epo with an optimal concentration of N-glycanase (16Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) yielded a species that migrated on SDS-PAGE as a narrow band with an average apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa, consistent with the removal of six highly branched complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 4). The use of sub-optimal amounts of the enzyme resulted in a typical ladder pattern, consistent with stepwise removal of multiple N-linked oligosaccharides. The magnitude of the reduction in average apparent molecular mass (∼34 kDa) achieved by complete N-deglycosylation of Epo-Epo is twice that reported for N-deglycosylation of the Epo monomer (15.5–18 kDa) (15Sytkowski A.J.

Biochem. 1990; 188: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the N-deglycosylated Epo-Epo migrated on SDS-PAGE as a closely spaced doublet, suggesting that some molecules lack the O-linked sugar. This has also been reported for monomeric Epo (15Sytkowski A.J. Feldman L. Zurbuch D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results are consistent with an Epo-Epo polypeptide backbone to which six N-linked complex oligosaccharides similar in molecular mass to those reported for monomeric Epo are attached. Additionally, as with monomeric Epo, the degree of O-linked glycosylation of Epo-Epo exhibits some variability. Epo-Epo is highly biologically active in vitro. We transfected COS1 cells with either conventional Epowt cDNA or Epo-Epo (Epowt/Epowt) cDNA. After 3 days, the supernatants were harvested and subjected to an in vitro bioassay. Protein was measured by ELISA calibrated against recombinant human Epo (Table I). Epowtwas expressed at modest levels (3.5–9.2 IU/ml; 0.010–0.026 μg/ml) and exhibited a mean specific activity of 352 IU/μg (13 IU/pmol). This specific activity is slightly higher than that obtained by us previously for wild-type Epo expressed in COS1 cells (201–284 IU/μg) (10Grodberg J. Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, we found a much higher level of expression of Epowt/Epowt (110–195 IU/ml; 0.109–0.194 μg/ml), which exhibited a substantially higher mean specific activity (1007 IU/μg; 76 IU/pmol).Table IBiological activities and protein concentrations of Epo and Epo-Epo fusion protein in transfected COS1 cell mediumConstructProtein secreted1-aEpo and Epo-Epo in COS1 cell supernatants were quantified by in vitro bioassay and by ELISA.

Open table in a new tab Both Epo domains of Epowt/Epowt are biologically active. We showed this by mutation of arginine 103 (or the arginine 103 equivalent in Domain B, which is arginine 223 of the fusion protein) to alanine (R103A). This mutation results in complete inactivation of the Epowt protein (19Wen D. Boissel J.-P. Showers M. Ruch B.C. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Matthews D.J. Topping R.S. Cass R.T. Giebel L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9471-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We prepared three different constructs that incorporated this R103A mutation: (a) EpoR103A/Epowt, (b) Epowt/EpoR103A, and (c) EpoR103A/EpoR103A. We reasoned that if each of the two domains were active, then mutating only one domain would result in a protein that still retained biological activity, but with some decrease in specific activity. Only the double mutant EpoR103A/EpoR103A should be inactive. As seen in Table I, both EpoR103A/Epowt and Epowt/EpoR103A were expressed efficiently, and both exhibited biological activity. Interestingly, the mean specific activities of the two mutants were 480 (36 IU/pmol) and 516 IU/μg (39 IU/pmol), respectively, essentially one-half that of the non-mutated Epowt/Epowt (1007 IU/μg; 76 IU/pmol). This result strongly suggests that introduction of the R103A mutation into each Epo domain resulted in inactivation of that domain, allowing the other, wild-type domain to activate the receptor. This indicates that both Epowt domains of Epowt/Epowtare biologically active, i.e. independently capable of receptor activation, and nearly equally so. The double mutant EpoR103A/EpoR103A was expressed at the mRNA level (data not shown). However, no activity or protein was detected in the COS1 supernatant. Epo-Epo exhibited enhanced activity in vivo compared with monomeric Epo (Fig. 5). We obtained individual pretreatment hematocrits from three groups of four mice. Each animal in the first group received 300 IU Epo-Epo/kg subcutaneously in the form of COS1 cell supernatant, whereas each animal in the second group received a single injection of 300 IU Epo/kg subcutaneously. Supernatant medium from COS1 cells transfected with vector alone was administered to the third group as a control. Seven days later, the post-treatment hematocrit of each animal was determined. A substantial increase in hematocrit was observed in all four animals treated with Epo-Epo. In contrast, none of the Epo-treated animals exhibited a significant increase in hematocrit, an expected result in view of the relatively short half-life of Epo. The hematocrit of the Epo-Epo-treated animals increased an average of 2.5% compared with a mean decrease of −0.2% in the Epo-treated group and a mean decrease of −0.8% in the control group. The mean change in hematocrit of the Epo-Epo-treated group was significantly different from that of the Epo-treated group (p = 0.015) and that of the control group (p = 0.008). We showed that the pharmacokinetic behavior of Epo-Epo is markedly different from that of monomeric Epo (Fig.6). We injected two groups of mice intravenously either with 6 IU of monomeric Epo or with 6 IU Epo-Epo. At specified times, blood samples were obtained, and the plasma concentration of Epo or Epo-Epo was determined by ELISA. The plasma levels of mice injected with monomeric Epo decreased rapidly (Fig.6 A). In three of the four animals, the Epo concentration decreased to less than half of the peak (5 min) level within 1 h. Epo was detected in the plasma of only one animal after 4 h. In contrast, the plasma levels of all four animals injected with Epo-Epo remained high for many hours after injection (Fig. 6 B). Epo-Epo levels remained detectable after 8 h in all four animals and were above 50% of the peak in two of the four animals. Epo-Epo was detectable in the plasma of two of the four animals even after 24 h. Epo-Epo also exhibited another, unexpected pharmacokinetic property. In three of the four animals, Epo-Epo levels continued to rise after the 5-min time point, peaking at 2 h after injection. This unanticipated finding was not due to variations in injection technique. All intravenous injections were performed by skilled technical personnel and monitored independently. In the present study, we have shown that a fusion protein consisting of two complete human Epo domains separated by a flexible peptide linker has significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo biological activity compared with the monomeric form of recombinant Epo. This enhanced activity appears to be due to an increased specific activity (Table I) coupled with a different pharmacokinetic profile. The unusual geometry of the Epo-Epo pharmacokinetics observed in three of the four animals injected with Epo-Epo (Fig. 6) remains unexplained. We carried out the ELISA analysis of the plasma samples twice at several dilutions and ruled out the possibility of the “high dose hook effect,” that is, the paradoxical increase in signal with an increasing dilution of highly concentrated samples (21Ryall R.G. Story C.J. Turner D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The possibility exists that Epo-Epo may associate with itself or with one or more other proteins in the plasma, especially at higher Epo-Epo concentrations. Such an association could interfere with antibody binding in the assay, resulting in a spuriously low reading. The unusual pharmacokinetic behavior of Epo-Epo might also be explained by a rapid and reversible interaction with receptors or other binding sites on cells in close apposition to the plasma, viz., vascular endothelial cells. Both the presence of erythropoietin receptors on these cells and a cellular response to its binding have been documented (22Anagnostou A. Liu Z. Steiner M. Chin K. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Noguchi C.T.

Hypertension. 1997; 10: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previously, we produced chemically linked Epo dimers and showed that we could achieve an increase in potency and a decreased frequency of injection, all leading to enhanced in vivo action (6Sytkowski A.J. Lunn E.D. Davis K.L. Feldman L. Siekman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1184-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These chemically linked dimers are, in all likelihood, a mixed population of molecules, presumably consisting of more highly active isoforms and, possibly, less active ones. The use of the fusion protein strategy in the present study provided reasonable assurance of structural homogeneity. Although the construction of the Epo-Epo cDNA was relatively straightforward, there were several uncertainties about the ultimate success of the design that could only be answered through experimentation. Specifically, they related to (a) biological activity, (b) potency, (c) the possibility of intramolecular steric hindrance, (d) post-translational processing, (e) stability, and (f) in vivo action. Based upon our earlier studies, we had concluded that the amino terminus of erythropoietin is not involved in its biological activity because antibodies directed to the first 26 amino acids are not neutralizing (27Sue J.M. Sytkowski A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3651-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, others have shown that arginine 14 may be important in the action of Epo (19Wen D. Boissel J.-P. Showers M. Ruch B.C. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was unclear whether the second Epo domain (Domain B), that which is tethered by its amino terminus to the peptide linker, would exhibit biological activity. An even greater uncertainty existed regarding the first Epo domain (Domain A) with a tethered carboxyl terminus, because Fibi et al. (28Fibi M.R. Stuber W. Hintz-Obertreis P. Luben G. Krumwieh D. Siebold B. Zettlmeissl G. Kupper H.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of erythropoietin are neutralizing. Furthermore, the proximity of cysteine 161 of Domain A to the linker peptide raised questions regarding the fidelity with which the disulfide bond between cysteine 161 and cysteine 7, which is essential for biological activity, would be formed. However, the data show that both Epo domains are active. Presumably, utilization of the flexible linker sequence similar to that used for an interleukin-3/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor fusion protein (29Curtis B.M. Williams D.E. Broxmeyer H.E. Dunn J. Farrah T. Jeffery E. Clevenger W. DeRoos P. Martin U. Friend D. Craig V. Gayle R. Price V. Cosman D. March C.J. Park L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5809-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) permitted proper folding of both Epo domains into their native conformations. The recent publication of the crystal structure of Epo bound to two extracellular binding domains of the EpoR (30Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) shows that the amino acids Ser9, Arg10, Glu13, Leu16, and Leu17 of Epo have minor interactions with EpoR in forming the site 1 intermolecular contact area, whereas Leu5, Asp8, and Arg10 of Epo have minor interactions in forming site 2. In contrast, Val11and Arg14 of Epo have major interactions at site 2. Near the carboxyl terminus of Epo, residues Asn147, Arg150, and Gly151 have major interactions in forming site 1. These observations would suggest that the length of the peptide linker separating the two Epo domains may be critical in allowing sufficient steric freedom so that each Epo domain of Epowt/Epowt can bind to and induce dimerization of two EpoR. Curtis et al. (29Curtis B.M. Williams D.E. Broxmeyer H.E. Dunn J. Farrah T. Jeffery E. Clevenger W. DeRoos P. Martin U. Friend D. Craig V. Gayle R. Price V. Cosman D. March C.J. Park L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5809-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) constructed a fusion protein (designated PIXY321) consisting of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 linked by an 11-amino acid linker of the sequence (G)4-S-(G)5-S (≈40 Å) and another fusion protein consisting of interleukin-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor linked by a 15-amino acid linker of the sequence (G-G-G-G-S)3 (≈55 Å). Both of these fusion proteins could bind to cell surface receptors through either cytokine domain, and both exhibited biological activity in vitro consistent with unimpeded function of both cytokine domains. In contrast, a recent study by Qiu et al. (8Qiu H. Belanger A. Yoon H.-W.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11173-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) used shorter linkers of the sequence (G)3–7 (≈10–25 Å) to form fusion proteins of the structure EpoR103A/EpoR103A or Epowt/Epowt. Interestingly, these EpoR103A/EpoR103A fusion proteins were biologically active (although less so than Epowt), apparently because the site 1 intermolecular contact area of each EpoR103A domain bound one EpoR, and because the linkers were short and flexible enough to allow receptor dimerization by the (theoretically) inactive fusion protein. However, in contrast to our results, Qiu et al. (8Qiu H. Belanger A. Yoon H.-W.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11173-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) observed no increase but rather a moderate decrease in the activity of their Epowt/Epowt fusion proteins compared with Epowt. Taking into consideration the results of Curtis et al. (29Curtis B.M. Williams D.E. Broxmeyer H.E. Dunn J. Farrah T. Jeffery E. Clevenger W. DeRoos P. Martin U. Friend D. Craig V. Gayle R. Price V. Cosman D. March C.J. Park L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5809-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the results of the present study, along with the structural data (23Yamaji R. Okada T. Moriya M. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the short linkers used by Qiu et al. (8Qiu H. Belanger A. Yoon H.-W.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11173-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) probably allowed each Epowt domain of their Epowt/Epowt fusion proteins to bind just one EpoR, resulting in an activity similar to that observed by them for Epowt and for their EpoR103A/EpoR103A. Apparently, the 17-amino acid linker (A-[G-G-G-G-S]3-T) (≈63 Å) used in this study of Epo-Epo allowed both Epo domains to function unimpeded and resulted in enhanced activity. The potency of our Epo-Epo in vitro is significantly higher than that of conventional recombinant Epo. It is 3-fold higher per microgram and 6-fold higher on a per mole basis. There are several possible explanations for this observation. It may be due to an increased stability of Epo-Epo or to a difference in endocytotic efficiency. Alternatively, this increase in potency may reflect an increase in receptor affinity. Although speculative, the possibility exists that the binding of one domain of Epo-Epo facilitates the binding of the second domain, i.e. positive cooperativity. In this regard, we have shown previously that the induction of EpoR clustering by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment of Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells resulted in positive cooperativity and an enhanced biological response (31Chern Y. Yonekura S. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1990; 76: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yonekura S. Chern Y. Donahue K.A. Feldman L. Vanasse G.J. Sytkowski A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2535-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sequential or simultaneous binding of both Epo domains of the fusion protein might also induce such receptor clusters, thereby leading to increased local concentrations of signal transduction mediators that could result in enhanced signaling. It is notable that the secretion of Epowt/Epowtin this study was 8-fold that of Epowt (Table I). However, the transcript levels seen on Northern blots were approximately equal (Fig. 2), indicating that an increase in transcription was not responsible. Other potential causes for the difference in secretion include more efficient translation, an increased intracellular trafficking, and enhanced stability during biosynthesis and secretion. Interestingly, both EpoR103A/Epowt and Epowt/EpoR103A were secreted at levels greater than that of Epowt/Epowt itself. This finding supports the hypothesis that protein stability may play a role in the enhanced secretion of the fusion protein. Our previous work showed that mutations at arginine 103 of Epo could lead to a molecule with increased stability (10Grodberg J. Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Grodberg J. Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, because single R103A mutations in the fusion protein (which presumably enhance its stability) lead to increased rates of secretion, it seems plausible that the enhanced stability of Epowt/Epowt over Epowtplays a role in the higher levels of secretion of the fusion protein. Although our EpoR103A/EpoR103A mutant was expressed at the mRNA level, we detected no protein by either bioassay or ELISA. This result is in contrast to that reported by Qiu et al. (8Qiu H. Belanger A. Yoon H.-W.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11173-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for their dimeric R103A fusion proteins with relatively short Gly3, Gly5, or Gly7 linkers that were secreted efficiently by COS7 cells. Although speculative, we believe that these differing results suggest that the length and composition of the linker may play a role. Substitutions at R103 affect the activity and thermal stability of the monomer. They may also influence potential interactions between and among the Epo domains of the fusion protein and the linker itself, thereby altering the protein's interaction with chaperonins and its folding and secretion efficiency. We thank Dr. Wolfgang Martin for the gift of purified recombinant human erythropoietin and Rosemary Panza for expert editorial work."

Other proteoglycan core proteins bearing heparan sulfate (HS) chains have been identified and characterized, using both biochemical and immunological approaches, as potentially being gene products unique from perlecan (3Hagen S.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), none have been characterized at the molecular level. The cell and molecular biology of CSPG present in basement membranes has not been as thoroughly investigated as their HSPG counterparts. Previous work by ourselves (9McCarthy K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 suppl. (abstr.): 61aGoogle Scholar, 10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and from the laboratories of other investigators (11Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. Histochemistry. 1987; 88: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6658-6669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) demonstrated the possibility of the existence of several unique gene products for which core proteins bear chondroitin (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Little was known about the core protein structure of this species until the molecular characterization of one member of this group, bamacan, by Wu and Couchman (14Wu R.R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, although the bamacan core protein is presently thought to be a “full time” CSPG, the core protein of perlecan also qualifies as inclusion into the basement membrane CSPG family, since it has been shown to be secreted in certain tissues and cell lines in culture as a proteoglycan core protein with CS/DS chains (15Hassell J.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9595-9602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, there is some evidence that highlight the fact that basement membranes might, in fact, contain other CSPG proteoglycans for which core proteins might differ from those reported above. In earlier reports, using core protein-specific monoclonal antibodies to BM-CSPG/bamacan, we showed that BM-CSPG/bamacan was a component of the mesangial matrix and not present in the walls of capillaries within the glomerulus (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18McCarthy K.J. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, two studies using monoclonal antibodies directed against chondroitin carbohydrate-specific epitopes have shown specific immunostaining the wall of the glomerular capillary for the presence of CS chains (13Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19Goode N.P. Shire M. Crellin D.M. Aparicio S.R. Davison A.M. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report by Schittny et al. (20Schittny J.C. Kresse H. Burri P.H. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a heterodimeric proteoglycan bearing DS chains in some but not all basement membranes. These findings imply the possibility that CS/DS-bearing proteoglycans, other than BM-CSPG/bamacan, might also exist in basement membranes, or at the very least, within the glomerular capillary basement membrane. The present report fulfills in part this premise, describing the molecular characterization of a novel proteoglycan, leprecan (leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan), the protein core of which bears CS chains and which can be immunolocalized to basement membranes. L-2 cells, a rat parietal yolk sac tumor cell line (a generous gift from Dr. Ulla Wewer, Institute of Pathology and Anatomy, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark), were grown to confluence in roller bottle culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 4 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The culture medium was changed weekly and the cultures maintained in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. The total proteoglycan pool from the conditioned culture medium was isolated using a combination of ion exchange chromatography and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 liters of conditioned medium were concentrated under positive pressure at 4 °C in an ultrafiltration cell (100,000 Mr cut-off, Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final volume of 250 ml. Guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 4 m, and solid CsCl (Fisher) was added to give a final starting density of 1.3 g/ml. 4% CHAPS (Sigma), 10 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol (DTE), and the protease inhibitors 0.2 mm PMSF and 5 mm benzamidine were added to the solution to result in the final concentrations listed above. The solution was aliquoted into individual ultracentrifuge tubes and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm, for 40 h at 10 °C using a 50.2TI rotor (Beckman Instruments) in a RC-80 ultracentrifuge (Sorvall). Subsequently, each tube was divided into five fractions, the density of each fraction measured, and fractions of approximately the same density pooled. SDS-PAGE analysis of the pooled fractions indicated that the two most dense fractions 4 (1.35 g/ml, low buoyant density proteoglycan) and 5 (1.42 g/ml, HD-PG) contained proteoglycans. These were subsequently dialyzed into 8 m urea, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2 EDTA, 1 mm DTE, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with the above protease inhibitors. Afterward, each fraction was further purified by ion exchange chromatography, initially loading each at a rate of 1 ml/min onto a 2.5 × 10-cm column of DEAE Trisacryl (IBF Biotechnics, Villeneuve-la-Garrenne, France) equilibrated in 8 m urea, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mmNa2EDTA, 1 mm DTE, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (as above). After loading, the column was rinsed with 250 ml of the same buffer, then 250 ml of 8m urea, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mm DTE, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.2) with protease inhibitors. Afterward, the column was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.15–2.0m in the same base buffer as the latter column rinse buffer) monitored by an in-line conductivity meter, and the eluent collected in 2-ml fractions. The elution of proteoglycans in the gradient was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. A subsequent Western blot immunoassay using a polyclonal antibody, R44, which recognizes the carbohydrate “stubs” remaining on proteoglycan core proteins after prior digestion with chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4, Seikagaku America) (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was used to confirm the presence of CSPGs within the respective fractions. In order to identify HSPGs and CSPGs in the pool, 50-μl samples of the HD-PG pool were digested overnight either with heparitinase/heparinase (EC 4.2.2.8 and 4.2.2.7, respectively) in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0), 1 mm calcium acetate, 10 units of leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, or with chondroitinase ABC in 50 mm Tris, 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm n-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mm PMSF. Afterward, both untreated samples and digested samples were characterized by SDS-PAGE using a 4–15% resolving gel. The separated proteoglycans were subsequently visualized by silver staining after electrophoresis. An aliquot of the HD-PG pool was used as an antigen for the production of monoclonal antibodies as described previously (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tissue culture supernatants from the resultant hybridomas were screened by Western blot immunoassay with the HD-PG pool. Those clones for which supernatants were positive in the screening procedure were further subcloned by limiting dilution, expanded to high density, and injected into pristane-primed BALB/c mice for the production of ascites fluid. The determination of mAb subclass was done using a commercially available isotyping kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The monoclonal antibody, Mo27, was subsequently characterized and used during the course of this study. The identity of the epitope recognized by Mo27 on proteoglycan core proteins present in the HD-PG preparation is not certain, but the data (see below) indicate that it is shared by three of the core proteins present within the preparation (180, 130, and 100 kDa). For the production of polyclonal antibodies against the 100-kDa proteoglycan core protein, an aliquot of the HD-PG pool was fractionated using gel filtration chromatography (CL-4B, 0.5 × 120 cm) in denaturing conditions (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.35m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.2 mmPMSF, 5 mm NEM, 10 mm EDTA), the elution of the target proteoglycan from the column identified in the collected fractions using the monoclonal antibody, Mo27, in a Western blot assay (data not shown). A polyclonal antiserum (Rb4127) was raised against the isolated native proteoglycan in rabbits using biweekly immunization protocol. 500 μg of antigen suspended in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) was used in the initial immunization, followed by a second immunization after 2 weeks using a comparable amount of antigen suspended in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). The resultant polyclonal antibody was a polyvalent antibody, recognizing the 180-, 130-, and 100-kDa proteoglycan core proteins present in the HD-PG preparation. A polyclonal antibody (Rb2096) directed against a fusion protein (see below) representing the carboxyl half of the molecule was developed using the same immunization protocol. A cDNA library developed from the mRNA of rat parietal endoderm cells (oligo(dT)- and random-primed) in the Uni-ZAP XR vector was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and screened as an expression library according to the developer's instructions using the polyclonal antiserum Rb4127. Clones found positive after a third round of preliminary screening were subcloned into appropriate host bacteria. To identify putative clones for further development, all positive clones from the third round of screening were initially sequenced (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar) using both a −20 universal primer and a forward primer (5′-ATTAACCTCACTAAAG-3′) with BST polymerase (Bio-Rad). Extension of sequence information was managed using a primer walking strategy. The obtained sequence information from all clones was compared for homology to a data base constructed from known proteoglycan sequences using the data base search and analysis routine in MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell, CA). Contigs from DNA sequencing were aligned using AssemblyAlign (Oxford Molecular Group). To obtain a full-length cDNA, an aliquot of the L-2 cDNA library was amplified and mass excised according to the manufacturer's (Stratagene) directions. This DNA was subsequently used in a solution hybridization screening strategy (Genetrapper cDNA Positive Selection System™, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the developer's instructions. The capture oligonucleotide (5′-TCCTGGCACTCGTCATCA-3′) used in this procedure was obtained from Oligos Etc, Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). After completion of the cDNA capture protocol, the captured single-stranded DNA was converted to double-stranded DNA using a different oligonucleotide (5′-TCCTTGATACACACGAGGGATTCG-3′) as a repair primer, according to the developer's instructions. The repaired double-stranded DNA were transformed by electroporation into ElectroMAX DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 0.8 kV in 0.1-cm gap chamber at settings of 200 ohms and 25 microfarads. The cells were then plated on LB/ampicillin plates (100 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resultant plates contained four dominant colonies that were selected and grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids were purified using a Wizard Miniprep DNA system (Promega), and the identity of the isolated clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. One clone, SJ3, was found to encode the full length of the leprecan molecule. An 850-base pair fragment of clone P2 was excised from P2 cDNA by digestion with Bam HI. For probe development, 250 ng of the isolated probe DNA was biotinylated using a NEBlot phototope kit according to the developer's directions (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). The specificity and sensitivity of the probe was tested by dot blot assay prior to use on in the Northern blotting protocol. Total RNA was isolated from L2 cells using TRIzol™ LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (18.75 μg/lane) was electrophoresed at 5 V/cm on a 1.0% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel. Afterward, the gel was rinsed five times with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and the RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran™, Schleicher & Schuell) following the manufacturer's protocol for neutral transfer using a downward transfer system (Turboblotter™, Schleicher & Schuell) overnight in 20× SSC. The next day, membrane was rinsed in 5× SSC for 20 min and the lanes cut into individual strips and cross-linked with UV irradiation (Gene Linker, Bio-Rad) for total delivery of 125 mJ of energy. One strip was stained with 0.02% methylene blue, 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5 to visualize the 28 and 18 S rRNA bands. The adjacent lane was incubated in prehybridization solution (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 65 °C for 1.0 h. Afterward, the biotinylated P2 probe was added to the prehybridization solution and allowed to hybridize overnight at 65 °C. Afterward, the membrane was rinsed as follows: 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature twice for 5 min each; 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 25 °C twice for 10 min; 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 58 °C twice for 15 min; 2× SSC at 25 °C for 10 min. Detection of the biotinylated probe was done using a NEBlot photodetection kit (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications; the blocking and rinsing times were increased to 1.0 h and 30 min, respectively. The membrane was exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Corp., Rochester, NY) and subsequently developed in an automatic film processor. The experiment was repeated using duplicate strips from the same blot. The sequence encoded by clone P2, which represents the carboxyl half of the core protein, was expressed as a fusion protein by subcloning a Kpn I and Sac I restriction fragment of the sequence into a commercially available fusion protein expression system (Qiaexpress™, Qiagen) that incorporates a 6×His tag 5′ to the polylinker region allowing affinity purification of the fusion protein product on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Competent M15 (pREP4) cells (Qiagen) were transformed with the appropriate vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression of fusion proteins in liquid cultures was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside according to the developer's instructions. Afterward, the cells were harvested, centrifuged, and the cell pellet stored at −70 °C until processing. For purification of fusion proteins, cell pellets were solubilized in 8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purification of the fusion protein (P2E) was performed using a low pressure chromatography system (Econo-System™; Bio-Rad) to load, rinse, and elute the expressed protein. The protein was loaded at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min onto a 0.5 × 0.5-cm nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity column equilibrated in 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, rinsed with 8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 5.9, and eluted in 1-ml fractions with 8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5. The fractions containing the P2E protein, as measured by absorbance at 280 nm, were subsequently characterized by 10–20% SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot assays using polyclonal antibody Rb4127. The fractions for which proteins were immunoreactive with Rb4127 on immunoblot assay were pooled, dialyzed extensively against PBS, concentrated to a 2 mg/ml concentration, and used to immunize a rabbit to develop a polyclonal antiserum directed against the fusion protein (Rb2096, see above). Four T-75 flasks were seeded with equal numbers of CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) in Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) incubated with 10% CO2, at 37 °C 24 h prior to transfection. Each flask represented one of the following treatment groups: 1) control, no transfection; 2) sham transfection, i.e. the cells exposed to transfection agent only; 3) inappropriate transfection, i.e. cells transfected with the control plasmid vector pZeoSVLacZ (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA); 4) cells transfected the pZeoSV plasmid bearing the SJ3 cDNA, representing the full-length coding region for the 100-kDa protein. Protocol for transfections followed that provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) adjusting all volumes and ratios of the components in accordance to the relative surface area of the flasks. Conditioned culture medium from each flask was harvested 24 h and again at 48 h following the start of the transfection, the medium placed in 50-ml tubes and clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the cleared supernatants aspirated to new tubes. For morphology studies, a similar transfection protocol was used for CHO-K1 cells seeded in six-well plates, adjusting all volumes and component ratios to the relative surface area of the wells. For immunoprecipitation assay, affinity-purified Rb2096 antiserum was biotinylated using the EZ-link sulfo-NHS biotinylation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturers' protocol. The biotinylated antibody was subsequently tested for sensitivity in dot blot assays and also for specificity via Western immunoblot analysis using the P2E fusion protein. Cell culture medium (1.75 ml) representing each transfection condition (normal, sham transfection with LipofectAMINE, lacZ transfection, and SJ-3 transfection) was precleared in microcentrifuge tubes with 50 μl of protein A plus resin (Pierce Chemical Co,) with gentle shaking for 2.0 h at room temperature. Afterward, the supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 2.0 min, and 1.70 ml of each aspirated and dispensed into fresh tubes. 100 μl of affinity-purified polyclonal antibody Rb2096 (2.2 mg IgG/ml) was added to each tube and the immunoprecipitation carried out overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The next morning 50 μl of protein A resin/buffer slurry was added to each of the tubes and the supernatants incubated an additional 3.5 h with gentle agitation. The supernatants were subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 2.0 min, the resin pellets removed from the tubes and rinsed with TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for a total of seven 2-min rinses, followed by a final rinse step with 500 μl of sterile water. The supernatant was aspirated, and 25 μl of chondroitinase buffer and 2 μl of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America) enzyme were added directly to the suspension. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently, the resin was rinsed twice with 500 μl of sterile water and the proteins eluted from the resin by incubating at 100 °C with two 25-μl aliquots of DTE mixture for 5 min each. After each incubation, the resin was spun at 2000 × g for 2.0 min and the sample aspirated and placed in a clean tube. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4–15% gradient resolving gel (Bio-Rad) and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Afterward, the blot was rinsed in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then blocked for 1.0 h at room temp. in Superblock™ blocking buffer (Pierce). Afterward, the blot was rinsed three times for 2 min each in TBS and incubated with biotinylated antibody Rb2096 at 1:1000 dilution in TBS buffer. The blot was then rinsed twice for 5 min each with TTBS, three times for 10 minutes each in immunoblot wash buffer (0.0125% Nonidet P-40, 0.0125% SDS, 0.0312% deoxycholic acid in TBS, pH 7.5), and twice for 5 min each with TTBS. The blot was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with neutravidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at 1:10,000 dilution in TBS. Following incubation, the blot was then rinsed twice for 5 min in TTBS, twice for 10 min in immunoblot wash buffer, twice for 5 min in TTBS, and five times for 2 min each in TBS. The blot was developed via chemiluminescence using the Biomax chemiluminescent detection system (Eastman Kodak Corp.). Immunoblots of electrophoretically transferred 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels of secreted proteoglycan (as described above) and cell layer preparations isolated during several stages of the study were performed as described previously (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the determination of the presence of the KDEL signal in native leprecan, cell layer extracts were prepared as follows. Confluent monolayers of L-2 cells were rinsed three times for 10 min each with PBS followed by extraction with 4 murea, 250 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Na2EDTA, 100 mm n-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm PMSF. After extraction, 10-μl aliquots of cell extract were diluted with water to 50 μl, and some aliquots subjected to overnight treatment with chondroitinase ABC. Both cell layer aliquots and secreted proteoglycan (± chondroitinase ABC digestion) were electrophoretically separated on a 4–15% gradient gel and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The resultant blots were probed with either Rb2096 or with a monoclonal antibody directed against the sequence SEKDEL (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Detection of binding of primary antibodies was done using species- or isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, followed by color development with an alkaline phosphatase color development kit (Bio-Rad). CHO-K1 cells in six-well plates were fixed for 10 min in Clark's solution (22Luna L.G. Manual of Histologic Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. McGraw-Hill, New York1968Google Scholar), rinsed three times in PBS, and the wells blocked for 20 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Afterward the wells were rinsed three times for 10 min each with PBS, and incubated with the primary antiserum Rb2096 (1/100 dilution in PBS) for 45 min. The wells were subsequently rinsed three times for 10 min each with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1/100 dilution in PBS, Jackson Immunoresearch, Malvern, PA) for 45 min. The wells were rinsed three times for 10 min each with PBS, mounting medium applied, and then coverslipped. Frozen sections from rat tissues were immunostained with polyclonal antiserum Rb2096 using single label immunohistochemistry protocols described previously (10McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18McCarthy K.J. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The resultant plate wells or slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert-35 inverted microscope equipped with epifluorescent illumination. Images were digitized using a Photometrics SenSys camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tuscon, AZ) and ported to a Macintosh PowerPC 9500 hosting the image processing software IPLabSpectrum (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). The total pool of HD-PG was isolated using a protocol combining cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation and ion exchange chromatography"
https://openalex.org/W2073585098,"The Glut1 glucose transporter is one of over 300 members of the major facilitator superfamily of membrane transporters. These proteins are extremely diverse in substrate specificity and differ in their transport mechanisms. The two most common features shared by many members of this superfamily are the presence of 12 predicted transmembrane segments and an amino acid motif, R-X-G-R-R, present at equivalent positions within the cytoplasmic loops joining transmembrane segments 2–3 and 8–9. The structural and functional roles of the arginine residues within these motifs in Glut1 were investigated by expression of site-directed mutant transporters in Xenopus oocytes followed by analyses of intrinsic transport activity and the membrane topology of mutant glycosylation-scanning reporter Glut1 molecules. Substitution of lysine residues for the cluster of 3 arginine residues in each of the 2 cytoplasmic pentameric motifs of Glut1 revealed no absolute requirement for arginine side chains at any of the 6 positions for transport of 2-deoxyglucose. However, removal of the 3 positive charges at either site by substitution of glycines for the arginines completely abolished transport activity as the result of a local perturbation in the membrane topology in which the cytoplasmic loop was aberrantly translocated into the exoplasm along with the two flanking transmembrane segments. Substitution of lysines for the arginines had no affect on membrane topology. We conclude that the positive charges in the R-X-G-R-R motif form critical local cytoplasmic anchor points involved in determining the membrane topology of Glut1. These data provide a simple explanation for the presence of this conserved amino acid motif in hundreds of functionally diverse membrane transporters that share a common predicted membrane topology.

However, removal of the 3 positive charges at either site by substitution of glycines for the arginines completely abolished transport activity as the result of a local perturbation in the membrane topology in which the cytoplasmic loop was aberrantly translocated into the exoplasm along with the two flanking transmembrane segments. Substitution of lysines for the arginines had no affect on membrane topology. We conclude that the positive charges in the R-X-G-R-R motif form critical local cytoplasmic anchor points involved in determining the membrane topology of Glut1. These data provide a simple explanation for the presence of this conserved amino acid motif in hundreds of functionally diverse membrane transporters that share a common predicted membrane topology. modified Barth's saline The Glut1 glucose transporter (1Mueckler M.

Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The superfamily is comprised of 18 groups and over 300 individual members expressed in organisms ranging from archaebacteria to humans and includes both passive transporters and secondary active transporters. Uniporters, symporters, and antiporters for a wide variety of compounds are included in the superfamily. Two of the most distinguishing features of the major facilitator superfamily are the presence of 12 predicted transmembrane segments and the occurrence of a highly conserved pentameric amino acid motif (R-X-G-R-R, where X can be any amino acid and R may be replaced by K) that lies within the cytoplasmic loops separating transmembrane segments 2–3 and 8–9. The presence of this conserved motif at equivalent positions in the two halves of these proteins lends support to the hypothesis that the members of this superfamily arose via the tandem duplication of a primordial ancestral gene (4Maiden M.C. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C. Henderson P.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The functional role of the pentameric motif within the 2/3 loop has been examined in the Escherichia coli lac permease (5Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the E. coli metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (6Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the residues within the motif appeared to be critical for active transport by the lac permease when examined individually, and only 1 of the 5 residues (Arg70) within the motif was found to be critical for function of the metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter. The role of the pentameric motifs in transport function has not yet been investigated for any eucaryotic member of the major facilitator superfamily, and a putative role of the motifs in structure or biosynthesis has not yet been addressed for any member of the superfamily. The Glut1 transporter provides an excellent model system to study the role of the pentameric motif in the structure and biosynthesis of a major eucaryotic facilitator. Glut1 was the first membrane transporter proposed to possess 12 transmembrane segments (1Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). This topological model is strongly supported by protease mapping (1Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment is important in determining the orientation of the first transmembrane segment only, suggesting that other sequence information is involved in specifying the membrane topology of downstream regions of the protein (11Sato M. Hresko R. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because most members of the major facilitator superfamily share the same predicted 12-transmembrane segment topology and the dual pentameric amino acid motifs, one possibility is that the motifs act as critical cytoplasmic anchor points for the 12-helix topology. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by the analysis of site-directed mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our data indicate that the positive charges in the R-X-G-R-R motifs located within loops 2 and 8 of Glut1 are important in determining the proper orientation of the two cytoplasmic loops as well as each of their two flanking transmembrane segments. Human Glut1 cDNA was previously subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pSP64T (12Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 14: 7057-7070Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The aglyco-Glut1 construct (Asn45 mutated to Thr), into which the glycosylated exofacial domain of rat Glut4 was inserted independently into each of the putative hydrophilic soluble domains using engineered Kpn I restriction sites, was previously subcloned into either the vector pSP64 or pSP64T and used as a probe for determining the Glut1 topology (10Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the inserted epitope is as follows: GTNAPQ K VI E QSYNATWLG R QGPGGP D SIPQGTLTTL WAGT. The epitope contains an N-linked glycosylation site, underlined above and is flanked by Gly-Thr, the translated amino acid sequence corresponding to the Kpn I restriction site. Two positively charged residues and 2 negatively charged residues shown in bold type were mutated to glycine residues to neutralize the charges within the reporter sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the CLONTECH Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The sequences of the mutant transporters were verified using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Mutant Glut1 mRNAs were synthesized from pSP64 or pSP64T cDNAs linearized at a unique restriction site in the polylinker using the MEGAscript SP6 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The manufacturer's conditions were modified by adding 4 mm GpppG and 0.625 mCi/ml [35S]UTPαS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and by reducing the GTP concentration to 1 mm. Ovarian lobes were resected from adult female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) anesthetized with 3-aminobenzonic acid ethyl ester (1 g/liter) in ice-cold water. The lobes were digested with 2 mg/ml type I collagenase (Worthington, Freehold, NL) in calcium-free modified Barth's saline (MBS)1 at room temperature for 2 h. The oocytes were washed six times in MBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and incubated at 4 °C in the same medium until injection. Stage V or IV oocytes were visually selected, injected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 μg/μl) and then incubated at 18 °C for 3 days in the same medium. Oocyte plasma membranes were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Glut1 as described previously (13Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of 15 oocytes were microinjected with the appropriate mutant Glut1 mRNA, incubated at 18 °C for 2 h, and then labeled with 2 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, Irvine, CA) in MBS at 18 °C for 1 h. The oocytes were extensively washed with MBS supplemented with 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 15 mm cold methionine, and 2 mm cysteine, and then intracellular membranes were prepared as described previously (13Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in 80 μl of 1% SDS and then diluted with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Transporters were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1.25 μg of a monoclonal Glut1 antibody (14Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8668-8675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. G. E. Lienhard, Dartmouth Medical School) precoupled to 40 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG affinity gel (Cappel, Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA). After washing the resin six times in phosphate-buffered saline, transporters were eluted with 50 μl of 1% SDS. 20 μl of eluted transporters were digested with endoglycosidase H at 37 °C for 1 h with the addition of 0.5 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 0.3 milliunits of enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gels were destained, radiochemically enhanced with 1 m salicylic acid, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Stage 5 Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng of wild-type or mutant Glut1 mRNA. 3 days after injection, groups of ∼30 oocytes were used for the determination of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C) as described in detail previously (15Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of the pentameric amino acid motif, R-X-G-R-R, within loops 2 and 8 of Glut1 are illustrated in Fig. 1. Four mutant Glut1 cDNAs were produced by site-directed mutagenesis in which all 3 arginines within each motif were changed to either lysine or glycine (see TableI). These substitutions were designed to test the hypothesis that the positive charges within the motifs are critical determinants of the Glut1 membrane topology. The glycine substitutions eliminate the positive charges, and the lack of a side chain produced by this substitution should be structurally tolerated at these positions, which are predicted to form tight β turns between two transmembrane domains. The lysine substitutions act as a positive control for the positive charge requirement, and should also reveal any strict requirement for an arginine side chain within the motif.Table IMutations introduced into wild-type Glut1 and into glycosylation-scanning reporter moleculesDesignationAmino Acid ChangesL2RGR89, R92, R93 → glycinesL2RKR89, R92, R93 → lysinesL8RGR330, R333, R334 → glycinesL8RKR330, R333, R334 → lysinesAmino acids are given by the single letter code.

Mutations were introduced into wild-type Glut1 and into glycosylation-scanning Glut1 reporter cDNAs using oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Messenger RNAs were transcribed from wild-type Glut1 and the four mutant Glut1 cDNAs, and the mRNAs were then injected into Xenopus oocytes. The relative level of expression of each of the proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis of purified oocyte plasma membranes (see Fig. 2) and transport activities were measured using 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (see Fig.3 A). These data allowed calculation of the transport activities of the mutant proteins relative to wild-type Glut1 (see Fig. 3 B). Substitution of glycines for arginines within the loop 2 motif or the loop 8 motif completely abolished transport function. In contrast, substitution of lysines for the arginines in the loop 2 motif had little if any affect on transport activity, and the equivalent substitutions in the loop 8 motif decreased intrinsic transport activity by ∼58%. These data suggest an absolute requirement for positively charged side chains within loop 2 and loop 8 but that the arginine side chain per se is not critical for transport activity.Figure 3Transport activity of Glut1 pentameric motif mutants. Messenger RNAs encoding wild-type Glut1 and each of the 4 arginine mutants defined in Table I were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and 3 days later the oocytes were used for 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent mean ± S.E. for ∼20 oocytes per group.

These reporter cDNAs encode chimeric Glut1 molecules in which a modified Glut4-glycosylated exofacial loop is inserted into one of the cytoplasmic or exoplasmic domains of Glut1. The native glycosylation site at Asn45 of Glut1 was mutated in the reporter molecules so that the presence or absence of N-linked glycosylation is a function of the exoplasmic or cytoplasmic disposition of the Glut4 reporter domain only. We previously demonstrated that the glycosylation status of these reporter molecules accurately reflects the local topology of the Glut1 molecule when the glycosylation epitope is inserted into any of the 13 predicted soluble domains (10Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sato M. Hresko R. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The precise insertion points for each of the glycosylation-scanning reporter molecules is illustrated in Fig. 1. Wild-type Glut1 with its native glycosylation site at Asn45acts as the reporter molecule for the disposition of loop 1. The two loop 2 motif mutants were each introduced into 5 reporter molecules providing the disposition of the N terminus and loops 1, 2, 3, and 4. The two loop 8 motif mutants were each introduced into 6 reporter molecules providing the disposition of loops 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Messenger RNAs encoding the arginine mutants in the reporter molecule backgrounds were injected into Xenopus oocytes. 2 h later the oocytes were pulse-labeled for 1 h with Tran35S-label and total membranes were then prepared. Glut1 was immunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized membranes and then equal aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were either treated with endoglycosidase H or not. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Substitution of lysines for the arginines in the pentameric motif within loop 2 or loop 8 did not alter the topology of Glut1. For the loop 2 lysine mutant (L2RK), the N terminus and loops 2 and 4 lie in the cytoplasm as indicated by the complete lack of N-glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecules, and loops 1 and 3 lie in the exoplasm as indicated by the nearly quantitative N-glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecules. For the loop 8 lysine mutant (L8RK), loops 6, 8, and 10 lie in the cytoplasm as indicated by the complete lack of N-glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecules, and loops 1, 7, and 9 lie in the exoplasm as indicated by the nearly quantitative glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecules. These results are exactly in accord with the known topology of native Glut1 (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 11Sato M. Hresko R. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, elimination of the positive charges in the pentameric motif by the substitution of glycines for the arginines in either loop 2 or loop 8 caused local perturbations in the membrane topology. For the loop 2 glycine mutant (L2RG), the N terminus and loops 1, 3, and 4 were all properly localized to the appropriate compartment, but in ∼75% of the mutant molecules loop 2 was improperly localized to the exoplasmic compartment, as indicated by the extent of N-glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecule (Fig. 4). Likewise, for the loop 8 glycine mutant (L8RG), loops 1, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were all properly localized to the correct compartment, but in ∼75% of the mutant molecules loop 8 was improperly localized to the exoplasm, as indicated by the extent of N-linked glycosylation of the corresponding reporter molecule. These data indicate that the positively charged arginine side chains in loops 2 and 8 represent critical local topological determinants in Glut1. The R-X-G-R-R motifs are conserved in many of the 300+ members of the major facilitator superfamily (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are predicted to possess identical 12 transmembrane segment topologies, but the possible role of these motifs as topological determinants has not been previously investigated. Our data indicate that removal of the positive charges in these motifs causes an aberrant “flipping” of the corresponding cytoplasmic loop into the exoplasmic compartment. The data also indicate that the aberrant topology in each case is localized to the mutated loop and the two flanking transmembrane segments, and that the remainder of the molecule upstream and downstream of the mutated loop exhibits a normal topological disposition. The abnormal structures that are most consistent with the pattern of glycosylation shown in Fig. 4 are illustrated in Fig.5. Local perturbations in membrane topology as reported here for Glut1 resulting from the alteration of charges in flanking domains have been observed for bacterial (16von Heijne G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and eucaryotic (17Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) polytopic membrane proteins. These data are consistent with our previous data indicating an important role for the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment in determining the local topological disposition of Glut1 (11Sato M. Hresko R. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with our prediction that topological determinants are distributed throughout the Glut1 molecule, in contradiction to the original charge difference hypothesis (18Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Additionally, these data are consistent with observations made for other bitopic (19Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polytopic (20Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) eucaryotic membrane proteins, indicating an important role for charged amino acid side chains in determining membrane topologies. Our data also provide a simple explanation for the presence of the conserved pentameric motif in members of the major facilitator superfamily that differ radically in their substrate specificity and mode of transport, i.e. facilitated diffusion versus secondary active transport (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The one striking characteristic shared by these otherwise distinct membrane transporters is their identical predicted membrane topologies. Thus, the R-X-G-R-R motifs likely play no direct role in the transport mechanism, but may only function as cytoplasmic anchor points for the generation of the correct membrane topology."

These findings represent the first demonstration of a link between a viral oncogene-sensitized cytolysis and ROS. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding whether TNF-induced cytolysis of L929 cells is through necrosis or apoptosis.

We confirmed that the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone markedly increased the susceptibility of L929 cells to TNF, and further demonstrated that E6 enhanced this susceptibility, which again correlated with increased ROS accumulation. We showed that the expression of E6 in L929 cells did not alter the stability of p53, and the cells retained a p53 response to actinomycin D. Furthermore, two E6 mutants defective for p53 degradation in other systems exhibited differential effects on TNF sensitization.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).The murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929 is widely used to study responses to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF). TNF, produced mainly by activated macrophages during immune and inflammatory responses, exerts pleiotropic effects on a wide range of cells. In addition to the inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, TNF exerts cytolytic activity on a variety of tumor cell lines in vitro (9Fransen L. Ruysschaert M.R. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Cell Immunol. 1986; 100: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), including L929. Depending on the cell type, TNF-mediated cytolysis may occur either through apoptosis or necrosis. TNF cytolysis of most cell types is through apoptosis (10Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2629-2634PubMed Google Scholar), and is characterized by morphological and biochemical changes including cellular shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial depolarization, activation of caspases, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (for review, see Ref. 11White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). However, there have been conflicting observations regarding TNF-induced cytolysis of L929. One group (12Grooten J. Goossens V. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that TNF-treated L929 cells rapidly died in a necrotic manner, characterized by swelling of the cytoplasm followed by disruption of the plasma membrane accompanied by cellular collapse without breakdown of the DNA. The recent finding that caspase inhibitors increase rather than decrease the susceptibility of L929 cells to TNF further supports the necrotic mode of cell death in TNF-treated L929 cells (13Vercammen D.

Regardless of the discrepancy on the mode of cell death, both groups have shown that TNF-induced cytolysis of L929 cells is mediated by mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (15Shoji Y. Uedono Y. Ishikura H. Takeyama N. Tanaka T. Immunology. 1995; 84: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar).Alterations in the structure and function of mitochondria are implicated in apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondria generate ROS as by-products of molecular oxygen consumption in the electron transport chain (for reviews, see Refs. 21Vercesi A.E. Kowaltowski A.J. Grijalba M.T. Meinicke A.R. Castilho R.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar and 22Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of ROS in cell death has been intensively examined (for reviews, see Refs. 23Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar and 24Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Through indirect approaches, earlier studies suggested involvement of mitochondrial production of ROS in TNF-induced cytolysis of L929 cells (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Recently, direct evidence indicated that TNF-induced necrosis in L929 cells was due to increased ROS formation in mitochondria (20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Using dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123), a cell-permeable ROS-specific fluorogenic marker, in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry, it was demonstrated that TNF-induced ROS formation occurred shortly before the commencement of irreversible cell damage (20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TNF-induced ROS formation occurred exclusively under conditions where cells were sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Therefore, TNF-induced ROS formation is thought to be causally related to TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells (20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggested that the TNF-induced mitochondrial production of ROS was mainly generated at the ubisemiquinone site, as implied by the different effects observed with the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the effect of HPV-16 E6 expression on necrosis or apoptosis using the TNF sensitive L929 cell line as a model. We found that E6-expressing cells were more susceptible to TNF-induced cytolysis. Following the lead of increased ROS formation in TNF-mediated cytotoxicity (20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the enhanced susceptibility to TNF by E6 was due to its effect on ROS. Our results indicate that HPV-16 E6-enhanced susceptibility to TNF correlates with increased ROS accumulation in mitochondria.DISCUSSIONIn this report we show that expression of HPV-16 E6 sensitizes TNF-induced cytolysis of fibrosarcoma L929 cells. Similarly, HPV-16 E6 was recently shown to exert moderate sensitization of human primary keratinocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis (59Stoppler H. Stoppler M.C. Johnson E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Smulson M.E. Iyer S. Rosenthal D.S. Schlegel R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). TNF plays an important role in host defenses against viral infection by selectively killing cells infected with viruses (49Mestan J. Digel W. Mittnacht S. Hillen H. Blohm D. Moller A. Jacobsen H.

Of particular relevance, TNF has been demonstrated to down-regulate transcription of the HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes by repressing the p97 promoter from which these genes are expressed (57Kyo S. Inoue M. Hayasaka N. Inoue T. Yutsudo M. Tanizawa O. Hakura A. Virology. 1994; 200: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes, the natural target of HPV infection, secrete TNF as well as other cytokines that regulate host responses to infection and growth/differentiation. Interestingly, cervical cells immortalized by HPV-16 or -18 exhibited significantly reduced expression of specific cytokines including TNF, suggesting that the down-regulation of cytokine secretion may contribute to persistence of HPV-infected cells (58Woodworth C.D. Simpson S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1544-1555PubMed Google Scholar).Similar to the sensitization effect observed for HPV-16 E6, polyomavirus middle T antigen also sensitized L929 cells and C127 cells to TNF-induced cytolysis (61Bergqvist A. Soderbarg K. Magnusson G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 276-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and adenovirus E1A sensitized NIH 3T3 cells (38Crook T. Tidy J. Vousden K. Cell. 1991; 67: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 55Duerksen-Hughes P. Wold W.S. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4193-4200PubMed Google Scholar, 62Shisler J.

Nature. 1987; 330: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, E6 is the first viral oncoprotein demonstrated to exert its sensitizing effect through ROS. However, E6 alone does not seem to affect the basal level of ROS in L929 cells. Whether similar E6-enhanced TNF-induced cytolysis via ROS also occurs in human keratinocytes remains to be determined. Various classes of viruses manifest the ability to increase ROS levels upon infection, which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of viral infections (for review, see Ref. 65Schwarz K.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It has recently been argued that ROS may contribute to the carcinogenic process because tissue destruction resulting from ROS leads to compensatory cell proliferation (for review, see Ref. 66Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Thus, it should be of great interest to investigate whether the previously observed sensitization effect by E6 of human keratinocytes to TNF-induced apoptosis (59Stoppler H. Stoppler M.C. Johnson E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Smulson M.E. Iyer S. Rosenthal D.S. Schlegel R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is also through ROS and its possible relevance to E6's oncogenic potential.Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding whether TNF-induced cytolysis of L929 cells is through necrosis or apoptosis. In the present study we were able to detect DNA fragmentation in TNF-challenged L929 cells. However, double staining with Hoechst and PI failed to reveal blue nuclei with condensed/fragmented nuclear morphology in our TNF-treated L929 cells. One study reported that TNF-treated L929 cells exhibited condensed/fragmented nuclei (18Powell C.B. Herzog T.J. Scott J.H. Collins J.L. Gynecol. Oncol. 1995; 58: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, whether plasma membrane disruption occurred at the time was not addressed. The discrepancy regarding the presence or absence of TNF-induced nuclear condensation/fragmentation may reflect subtle differences in the strains of L929 cells being investigated. From our data, necrosis rather than apoptosis accounted for the cytolysis of the L929 cells. Moreover, we confirmed the recent finding that the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk markedly increased susceptibility of L929 cells to TNF (14Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and demonstrated that E6 enhanced this susceptibility. Caspase inhibitors normally protect against caspase-mediated apoptosis, although the inability of zVAD-fmk to prevent cytolysis provoked by multiple different apoptosis inducers is not unprecedented (67Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 68McCarthy N.J. Whyte M.K. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, the sensitization effect by the caspase inhibitor would argue against apoptosis. E6 is the first oncoprotein shown to act like zVAD-fmk in that both increased ROS and cytolysis, although it differed from zVAD-fmk by doing so in an TNF-dependent manner.How HPV-16 E6 increases TNF-induced ROS accumulation and cytolysis is at present unclear. The increased ROS levels may result from an enhanced production of ROS or an impaired mitochondrial scavenging system. We found that the E6-expressing cells retained competence for scavenging ROS by glutathione, 3Y. Liu, V. Tergaonkar, S. Krishna, and E. J. Androphy, unpublished observations. which has been suggested as the major mitochondrial scavenger of TNF-induced ROS (20Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). However, E6 did not affect exogenous H2O2-induced ROS accumulation,3indicating that species of ROS other than H2O2may be responsible for the E6-enhanced TNF-induced ROS accumulation. One such ROS species may be superoxide (O⨪2), which can be converted to H2O2 by manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme. TNF has been well documented to induce the synthesis of MnSOD (69Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and overexpression of MnSOD has been shown to protect against TNF-mediated cell death (70Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 71Li J.J. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1991-1998PubMed Google Scholar). Human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells failed to show TNF-induced MnSOD expression, which may account for the increased sensitivity of the infected cells to heat and radiation (53Wong G.H. McHugh T. Weber R. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4372-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,71Li J.J. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1991-1998PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma cells possess impaired ROS scavenging capacities, establishing conditions permissive for the intracellular retention of ROS (72Mallery S.R. Ng-Bautista C.L. Lantry L.E. Ness G.M. Hegtvedt A.K. Lazo A. Bailer R.T. Hout B.L. Stephens R.E. Brierley G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 73Mallery S.R. Bailer R.T. Hohl C.M. Ng-Bautista C.L. Ness G.M. Livingston B.E. Hout B.L. Stephens R.E. Brierley G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since E6 possesses transcriptional repression and protein degradation-promoting activities (for review, see Ref. 2Rapp L. Chen J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F1-F19PubMed Google Scholar), an intriguing possible mechanism for E6-enhanced ROS accumulation and cytolysis is down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD. On the other hand, since E6 also exhibits transcriptional activation activities (for review, see Ref. 2Rapp L. Chen J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F1-F19PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that E6 up-regulates the expression of TNF-RI, the TNF receptor, or a downstream effector(s), thereby amplifying the signals leading to ROS formation. Experiments are under way to address these possibilities.Given that p53 plays a positive role in ROS generation (43Lee J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1653-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although in a cell-type specific manner (44Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and that HPV-16 E6 promotes p53 degradation, as demonstrated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in various cell types (36Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar, 37Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6237-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were surprised to find that E6 enhanced ROS accumulation. Our data strongly imply that E6-enhanced ROS accumulation is a p53-independent event. Our data also suggest that the enhanced effect by E6 is not through the modulation of NF-κB activation, compatible with the recent demonstration that the signaling pathways leading to cytolysis and to NF-kB activation are segregated in L929 cells (35Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 74Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ratter F.

Recently it was reported that an activated form of oncogene c-Myc induced mouse Rat1 fibroblasts to produce ROS in response to TNF treatment (75Kinnula V.L. Aito H. Klefstrom J. Alitalo K. Raivio K.O. Cancer Lett. 1998; 125: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HPV-16 E6 has been shown to activate the c-Myc promoter (76Kinoshita T. Shirasawa H. Shino Y. Moriya H. Desbarats L. Eilers M. Simuzy B. Virology. 1997; 232: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to increase c-Myc protein in human mammary epithelial cells (77Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the c-Myc gene was increased in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells and HPV-16-immortalized cervical cells (78Yang X. Nakao Y. Pater M.M. Tang S.C. Pater A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 79Dellas A. Schultheiss E. Holzgreve W. Oberholzer M. Torhorst J. Gudat F. Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol. 1997; 16: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that E6 may enhance ROS accumulation by up-regulating Myc. Paradoxically, Myc has recently been reported as a degradation target of E6 (80Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8058-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several other potential cellular targets of E6 have been identified recently (reviewed in Ref. 2Rapp L. Chen J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F1-F19PubMed Google Scholar; see Refs. 81Kukimoto I. Aihara S. Yoshiike K. Kanda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), including E6TP1 (83Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and Bak (4Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Analogous to p53, a subset of these proteins have been reported to be targeted for degradation by E6 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (4Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 80Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak by E6 again seems to be contradictory to E6-enhanced cytolysis. Interestingly, E6TP1 has been suggested as a potential GTPase-activating protein for small G proteins (83Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and thus may inactivate G proteins. Given that the activated forms of the small GTP-binding proteins Ras or Rac1 play a positive role in TNF-induced ROS accumulation (84Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), the E6-targeted degradation of E6TP1 seems to be in concordance with our present finding of E6 sensitization. Other E6-binding proteins, such as E6BP/ERC-55 (29Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 85Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V.

It has been well documented that calcium stimulates ROS production in mitochondria by the respiratory chain (for review, see Ref. 21Vercesi A.E. Kowaltowski A.J. Grijalba M.T. Meinicke A.R. Castilho R.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Further experimentation will be needed to delineate the mechanism by which E6 enhances TNF-induced ROS accumulation and the subsequent cytolysis. Among the over 90 human papillomavirus (HPV)1 types, HPV type 16 is the most prevalent type associated with cervical cancers. The E6 oncoprotein from the “high risk” HPV genital types, including HPV-16, along with the other major oncoprotein E7, is selectively retained and expressed in HPV-positive cervical carcinomas and derived cell lines (for review, see Ref. 1zur Hausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). E6 has multiple functions including cellular transformation, immortalization, telomerase activation, and induction of resistance to calcium/serum-induced terminal differentiation (for review, see Ref. 2Rapp L. Chen J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F1-F19PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, E6 has been reported to suppress or enhance apoptosis depending on the cell type and stimulus (3Brown J. Higo H. McKalip A. Herman B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66:"
https://openalex.org/W2090017570,"RNA polymerase II stalled at a lesion in the transcribed strand is thought to constitute a signal for transcription-coupled repair. Transcription factors that act on RNA polymerase in elongation mode potentially influence this mode of repair. Previously, it was shown that transcription elongation factors TFIIS and Cockayne's syndrome complementation group B protein did not disrupt the ternary complex of RNA polymerase II stalled at a thymine cyclobutane dimer, nor did they enable RNA polymerase II to bypass the dimer. Here we investigated the effect of the transcription factor 2 on RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase I stalled at thymine dimers. Transcription factor 2 is known to release transcripts from RNA polymerase II early elongation complex generated by pulse-transcription. We found that factor 2 (which is also called release factor) disrupts the ternary complex of RNA polymerase II at a thymine dimer and surprisingly exerts the same effect on RNA polymerase I. These findings show that in mammalian cells a RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase II transcript truncated by a lesion in the template strand may be discarded unless repair is accomplished rapidly by a mechanism that does not displace stalled RNA polymerases.

The single most significant contributor to preferential repair is transcription. It has been found that pyrimidine dimers in the template strand of transcribed sequences in Escherichia coli and in humans are repaired at a fast rate relative to the nontranscribed strand and the rest of the genome (2Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 3Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of coupling transcription to repair in E. coli is relatively well understood (5Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). A protein called transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF)1 displaces stalled RNA polymerase while simultaneously recruiting the excision repair complex to the site of damage and thus accelerates the rate of damage recognition and removal (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, transcription-coupled repair depends on the CSA and CSB proteins (7Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The CSB protein, like the TRCF of E. coli, has the so-called helicase motifs (8Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoejimakers J.H.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 9Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and initially it was suspected that it may function in a manner similar to that of TRCF in coupling repair to transcription. However, the purified CSB protein, in contrast to TRCF, does not disrupt the ternary complex of stalled RNA polymerase II but instead it appears to function as a transcription elongation factor for RNA polymerase II (10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a study aimed at uncovering the mechanism of stimulation of repair by transcription, it was found that human RNA polymerase II stalled at a thymine dimer was rapidly dissociated from the template/substrate by human cell-free extract without detectable stimulation of repair (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This observation raised the possibility that the basic mechanism of coupling repair to transcription in humans may be different from that of E. coli. Hence, we wished to investigate the effect of other factors known to act on stalled RNA polymerase II in order to gain some insight on the parameters that affect the accessibility of transcription-blocking lesions to repair enzymes, the stability of the ternary complex that forms at such lesions, and the fate of the truncated transcript during and after repair. Factor 2 is a well characterized transcription factor that acts during elongation. The factor was first identified in Drosophila Kc cells as an activity that suppressed the appearance of incomplete transcripts by unknown mechanism (12Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later factor 2 was identified as one of the negative transcription elongation factors, N-TEF (13Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), that are responsible for the production of short, prematurely terminated transcripts. Factor 2 has been shown to be an ATP-dependent RNA polymerase II termination factor (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Its activity resides in a 154-kDa polypeptide with DNA-stimulated ATPase but no helicase activity (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3771-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, the human homolog of factor 2 (HuF2) was isolated and characterized (17Liu M. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25541-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It exhibits essentially the same properties as the Drosophila factor 2. Since RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion is a key component for most models for transcription-coupled repair, we wished to investigate the effect of factor 2 on RNA polymerases I and II stalled at thymine cyclobutane dimers. We found that factor 2 releases both polymerases. Thus, any model for transcription-coupled repair in humans must account for the presence of a relatively abundant nuclear factor that disrupts ternary complexes rapidly and efficiently. pMLU112 and pPU192 have been described (9Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Both constructs have the adenovirus major late promoter. pMLU112 has been constructed such that there is no U in the first 112 nt of the transcripts (“U-less cassette”; Ref. 19Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and there is a cleavage site for restriction endonuclease Pvu II at 330 bp downstream of the transcription start site. pPU192 has a single thymine-thymine dimer (T<>T) in the template strand at nucleotide positions 149–150 downstream of the transcription start site. pHr163-T<>T was prepared by hybridization of the 5′-32P-labeled T<>T oligonucleotide to the single strand form of pHr163 followed by second strand synthesis by T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (20Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To construct pHr163, pIBI25 (International Biotechnologies, Inc.) was modified to contain sequence complementary to a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (T<>T) containing oligonucleotide by site-specific mutagenesis (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), and this construct was named pMLH100. Then a DNA fragment containing sequence from nucleotide position −285 to +83 of human ribosomal RNA gene promoter sequence with respect to the transcription start site (22Miesfeld R. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3933-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Learned R.M. Tjian R. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from prHu3 (23Learned R.M. Tjian R. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into pMLH100. The prHu3 plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California at Berkeley). pHr163-T<>T has a single T<>T in the template strand at nucleotide positions 164 and 165 downstream of the transcription start site. Both pPU192 and pHr163-T<>T were radiolabeled at the 13th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the dimer. “Template 1” (24Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has the T7 A1 promoter and is constructed such that 20-nt-long transcripts are obtained by including ApU, ATP, GTP, and CTP in the transcription reaction. Polymerase chain reaction was used as described by Krummel and Chamberlin (24Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to synthesize Template 1 from pAR1707. Recombinant protein of human homolog of Drosophila melanogaster RNA polymerase II release factor (HuF2) was prepared as described (17Liu M. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25541-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Native (RNA polymerase II and TFIIH) and recombinant factors (TBP, IIB, IIE, and IIF) for RNA polymerase II transcription reaction were prepared as described previously (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant CSB protein was prepared as described (9Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The partially purified RNA polymerase I fraction was prepared as described elsewhere (23Learned R.M. Tjian R. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 200 mg of whole cell extract from HeLa cells was prepared as described (26Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and applied to a 20-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Sigma), which was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer TM (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl and step-eluted with 280 mm KCl. This fraction was dialyzed against TM buffer containing 100 mmKCl and loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-agarose column (Sigma); the column was washed with TM buffer containing 100 mm KCl and eluted with 200, 400, and 600 mm KCl in TM buffer. A single fraction, eluted with 400 mm KCl in TM buffer supported transcription from the human ribosomal RNA gene promoter. This fraction was dialyzed against 100 mm KCl in TM buffer and used for transcription experiments as partially purified RNA polymerase I fraction. The mutant E. coli Mfd C-X, the transcription-repair coupling factor, which lacks amino acids 1–378 but possesses RNA polymerase dissociating activity, was prepared as described previously (27Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). E. coli RNA polymerase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Transcription by human RNA polymerase II was carried out with purified recombinant (TBP, IIB, and IIE) and native (IIH and RNA polymerase II) human transcription proteins (except yeast TBP) as described previously (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To test negative transcription elongation activity of HuF2 on reconstituted RNA polymerase II transcription system, RNA polymerase II ternary complex was formed on pMLU112 by nucleotide starvation as described (10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ng of pMLU112 was transcribed in the absence of UTP with transcription factors in 3.3 μl of transcription buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 108 mm KCl, 6.4 mm MgCl2, 2.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 2.8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5.5% glycerol, and 3% polyethylene glycol, 625 μm each ATP and GTP), resulting in the formation of the ternary complex at the end of U-less cassette. 1.5 μm CTP and several μCi of [α-32P]CTP were also included in the reaction so that the transcripts were radiolabeled. The reactions were then brought to 10 μl in repair buffer (8.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 61 mm KCl, 13 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.9 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 1% polyethylene glycol, 1.9 mm ATP, 208 μm GTP, 20 μm each dNTP, 133 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 17 μg/ml carrier DNA) and incubated with restriction endonuclease Pvu II (New England Biolabs, MA) for 60 min at 30 °C to cut pMLU112 at 330 bp downstream of the transcription start site. HuF2 was then added to the reactions, and the reactions were further incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. UTP (to 400 μm) and cold CTP (to 800 μm) were then added to the reactions to elongate the ternary complex to the Pvu II cleavage site generating run-off transcripts of defined size. The reaction products were then extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on a 5% sequencing gel. To test the effects of CSB protein on the release activity of HuF2, CSB protein was added to the reactions after the formation of stalled ternary complex, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C before the addition of 4 nm of HuF2. To test the release activity of HuF2 on stalled RNA polymerase II at the T<>T site on the transcribed strand by DNase I protection assay, stalled RNA polymerase II ternary complex was formed on pPU192 template/substrate as described previously (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of pPU192 was transcribed by the RNA polymerase II transcription system in 10 μl of transcription buffer as described above with 625 μm each ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP but without [α-32P]CTP, and the RNA polymerase II ternary complex was blocked at the dimer site and formed a stable complex on the transcribed strand. The reactions were brought to 30 μl in repair buffer and incubated with HuF2 for 15 min at 30 °C. 30 units of the DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) was then added to the reactions, and the reactions were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. The DNA was extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. 20 μg/ml α-amanitin was included in the reaction mixture when used. Transcription reactions were carried out essentially as described by Learned and Tjian (23Learned R.M. Tjian R. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze blockage of transcription by a T<>T, we used a linearized template/substrate. The pHr163-T<>T plasmid and the unmodified template/substrate, pHr163, were digested with Hin dIII restriction endonuclease (Promega, WI), which cuts these plasmids at 331 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site. 50 ng of linearized pHr163 and pHr163-T<>T were incubated individually with 30 μg of whole cell extract in 10 μl of transcription buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml α-amanitin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 0.05 mm CTP, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]CTP) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of stop buffer (10 mm EDTA, 300 mm sodium phosphate, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 25 μg of yeast tRNA). The reaction products were then extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. For footprinting experiments, 50 ng of template/substrate DNA was incubated with 3 μg of partially purified RNA polymerase I fraction in 10 μl of transcription buffer as described above except that 0.05 mm CTP and 2 μCi of [α-32P]CTP were replaced by 0.5 mm CTP. After 45 min of incubation at 30 °C, 30 units of DNase I (Life Technologies) was added directly to the reactions and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. The DNA was then phenol-extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Control reactions (Trn−) were performed by omitting CTP from the reaction mixture. To test the release activity, HuF2 was added directly to the reactions after forming stable RNA polymerase I ternary complex, and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before DNase I digestion. For T4 DNA polymerase 3′-5′ exonuclease protection experiments, pHr163-T<>T was first transcribed with partially purified RNA polymerase I fraction and nonradioactive ribonucleotides at 30 °C for 45 min as described above to form a ternary complex at the T<>T site. The reactions were brought to 30 μl in T4 DNA polymerase buffer (42 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 12.5 mm(NH4)2SO4, 7.8 mmMgCl2, 16.7 mm KCl, 0.33 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 1.7 mm creatine phosphate, 33.3 μg/ml α-amanitin, 8.3 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 3.3% glycerol, 16.7 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 μg of pUC18), and 1 unit of the T4 DNA polymerase plus 10 units of Hin P1I restriction endonuclease were added.Hin P1I restriction endonuclease digestion generated a DNA fragment of 115 nucleotides containing the stalled elongation complex and radiolabel in the transcribed strand. After incubating the reactions at 30 °C for 30 min, reaction products were extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. For lambda 5′ to 3′ exonuclease protection experiments, after forming ternary complex at the T<>T site, 4.5 units of lambda exonuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 units of Hin P1I restriction endonuclease were added directly to the reactions. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed as described above. CTP was omitted from the control reactions (no transcription). To measure the lifetime of the RNA polymerase I·RNA·DNA complex formed at a T<>T, pHr163-T<>T was first incubated with partially purified RNA polymerase I fraction and cold ribonucleotides as described above to form a ternary complex at the T<>T site. Ten units of Hin P1I restriction endonuclease (New England Biolabs, MA), which has three cleavage sites between the transcription start site and the T<>T site, was then added directly to the reactions to sever the stalled complex from the promoter and thus prevent formation of new complexes during the course of the experiment. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and at the indicated time points, samples were taken and incubated with 30 units of DNase I at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction products were then extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Control reactions (no transcription) were performed by omitting CTP from the reaction mixture. To calculate the fraction of ternary complexes at the T<>T site, the intensities of DNase I footprints were quantified using a PhosphorImagerTM with a Storm 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The intensities of footprints of ternary complexes were normalized by subtracting the background bands appearing in the same region in reactions with no transcription. The band intensities at various time points were expressed relative to that at time 0 on a first-order rate plot. E. coli RNA polymerase ternary complex was formed on Template 1 by nucleotide starvation as described previously. Briefly, 20 ng of Template 1 was transcribed with 0.01 unit of E. coli RNA polymerase in the same transcription buffer as for RNA polymerase II as described above in the presence of ApU dinucleotide to allow elongation from the transcription start site but in the absence of UTP to form ternary complex stalled at position +20 with respect to the transcription start site (27Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 2 μCi of [α-32P]CTP was also added to the reactions to radiolabel transcripts. To test the effects of prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription release factors, the reactions were then brought to 30 μl in repair buffer, and either HuF2 or mutant E. coli Mfd C-X (27Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was added to the reactions. Rifampicin was also added to the repair buffer to 22 μg/ml to avoid reinitiation of transcription. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, UTP (to 400 μm) and CTP (to 800 μm) were added to the reactions to elongate transcripts, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The RNA was extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on a 20% sequencing gel. Previous work has shown that two distinct classes of complexes form after transcription initiation with RNA polymerase II. One class undergoes abortive elongation giving rise to short transcripts (28Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). A factor called N-TEF2 was shown to promote this abortive termination (12Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies showed that one of the components of N-TEF2 called factor 2 was responsible for release of prematurely terminated transcripts (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Liu M. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25541-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We wished to know if factor 2 dissociates RNA polymerase II ternary complex stalled because of “nucleotide starvation” at a U-less cassette or because of a physical block in the template strand in the form of a thymine dimer. To test for the effect of HuF2 on RNA polymerase II, transcription was carried out with U-less cassette template, pMLU112 (Fig.1), then HuF2 was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was supplemented with UTP and incubated further. The products were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). In the absence of HuF2, nearly 50% of the short transcripts are converted to the full-length transcripts, indicating that at least this fraction of ternary complex remained stable during nucleotide starvation. In contrast, when HuF2 was included in the reaction mixture in sufficient quantities, nearly all of the transcripts remained truncated (lanes 3–5), indicating that all of the ternary complexes were disrupted by HuF2. These results confirm the previous studies on factor 2 using nuclear extracts for transcription (17Liu M. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25541-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By conducting our experiments with highly purified RNA polymerase II and recombinant factor 2, however, we have greatly reduced the possibility of contribution of other proteins to the release of RNA polymerase II by HuF2.Figure 2Negative transcription elongation activity of recombinant human RNA polymerase II transcript release factor, HuF2. pMLU112 was transcribed by RNA polymerase II in the presence of [α-32P]CTP and the absence of UTP. Stalling of RNA polymerase II at the end of the U-less cassette generated the 112-nt-long transcript labeled Stalled. Then the template was digested with Pvu II, which cleaves downstream from the stall site, and the reactions were incubated with increasing amounts of HuF2 as indicated for 15 min. Finally, RNA polymerase II was chased by adding UTP and CTP and incubating for another 15 min. RNA polymerase II was not chased in the control reaction (lane 1). The reaction products were extracted and analyzed on a 5% sequencing gel. The 330-nt-long run-off transcription product is indicated.Lane M, DNA markers of the sizes indicated, which have a slightly different mobility from RNA. Schematic representations of the assay are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of HuF2 on RNA polymerase II stalled at a thymine dimer was determined by different strategy. pPU192, which contains a single T<>T at 149–150 bp in the transcribed strand downstream of the transcription start site and radiolabel at the 13th phosphate 5′ to the dimer, was employed for this purpose (Fig. 1). pPU192 was digested with DNase I after transcription with highly purified RNA polymerase II to prove the existence of RNA polymerase on the template/substrate DNA. It must be noted that because of poor template utilization (1–10% of template is transcribed), we could not perform conventional DNase I footprinting. Instead, by having radiolabel in the vicinity of damage, we relied on the protection of the region containing the radiolabel from DNase I degradation. RNA polymerase II ternary complex stalled at the dimer on pPU192 protected a 29–46-nucleotide region centered near the T<>T site including the radiolabel from DNase I digestion, thus generating a “footprint” (Fig. 3, lane 2) as reported previously (11Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The addition of HuF2 eliminates this protection (Fig. 3, lane 3). Thus, HuF2 is capable of disrupting ternary complexes at lesion sites as it does for early elongation complex generated by pulse-transcription (17Liu M. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25541-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HuF2 is known to act on RNA polymerase II in elongation mode. However, there were no data on whether or not HuF2 had affected any other class of RNA polymerase. We therefore were interested in the effect of HuF2 on RNA polymerase I stalled at a thymine dimer. Toward that end, we first determined the effect of thymine dimer in the template strand on RNA polymerase I. A template/substrate consisting of a plasmid with a ribosomal RNA gene promoter (HrP) located 163 nucleotides upstream of a cyclobutane thymine dimer, pHr163-T<>T, was used in our experiments (Fig. 1). In order to analyze the effect of T<>T on transcription by RNA polymerase I, we linearized the plasmid with Hin dIII restriction enzyme, which incises the DNA 166 nucleotides downstream of the dimer in order to obtain transcripts of defined size resulting from run-off transcription. Fig. 4 shows the results of transcription experiments carried out with control and dimer-containing templates. With the control template/substrate, run-off transcripts of 310–320 nucleotides in length are produced"

To analyze the mechanism of OSM function, we isolated immediate early responsive genes upon OSM stimulation. Here we describe the novel OSM-inducible gene OIG37 that is related to MyD118 and GADD45. The MyD118 gene has been described as an immediate early gene induced by IL-6 in M1 monocytic cells, and GADD45 was identified as a gene induced by UV or γ-ray irradiation. Both are considered to function in growth arrest and/or DNA repair. Although the expression of OIG37, MyD118, and GADD45 was rather ubiquitous, it was differentially regulated. As the gp130 mutant defective for activating the STAT3 pathway showed the reduced induction of OIG37 by cytokine stimulation and expression of dominant negative STAT3 inhibited the induction of OIG37 by OSM, STAT3 is involved in OIG37 induction by IL-6 family cytokines. To examine the function of OIG37, we expressed it in NIH3T3 and IL-3-dependent BaF3 cells and found that OIG37 suppressed cell growth without any evidence of apoptosis. Whereas both MyD118 and OIG37 suppressed cell growth in both cell lines, suppression by OIG37 was more efficient than by MyD118. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that OIG37 associates with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

It is a member of the IL-6 family cytokines that include IL-6, IL-11, OSM, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1 (6Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 8Du X.X. Williams D.A.

Henderson C.E. Neuron. 1996; 17: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These cytokines exhibit very similar biological activities when they act on the same cells. This functional similarity is now explained by gp130, the common signaling subunit of the receptors for these cytokines (11Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OSM receptor (OSMR) consists of gp130 and the OSM-specific subunit that is structurally similar to gp130. In the human, the LIF receptor (LIFR), which consists of gp130 and the LIF-binding protein (known as LIFRβ), also serves as an OSMR (12Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J.

Thus, OSM and LIF exhibit the same effects through the LIFR, and OSM induces its unique activity through the OSM-specific receptor. Although the human OSM gene was isolated a decade ago, mouse OSM had not been isolated until we cloned the mouse OSM cDNA as a cytokine-inducible gene in hematopoietic cells (14Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). OSM expression is regulated by the STAT5 transcription factor that is activated by various cytokines including IL-3, GM-CSF, EPO, and IL-2 (14Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Ihle J.N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Biological as well as biochemical analysis of mouse OSM and its receptor revealed that unlike human OSM, mouse OSM utilizes only the OSM-specific receptor but not the LIFR, indicating that the functions of LIF and OSM are segregated in the mouse (17Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1997; 90: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, however, human OSM functions through the mouse LIFR but not the mouse OSMR. Although OSM mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the bone marrow cells, the role of OSM in bone marrow hematopoiesis still remains unknown. However, we recently found that OSM stimulates development of hematopoietic cells in the aorta/gonad/mesonephros region of developing mouse embryos (18Mukouyama Y. Hara T. Xu M. Tamura K. Donovan P.J. Kim H. Kogo H. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. Miyajima A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is now known that definitive hematopoietic stem cells arise in the aorta/gonad/mesonephros region before they massively generate various lineages of hematopoietic cells in the fetal liver (19Medvinsky A. Dzierzak E. Cell. 1996; 86: 897-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). In an in vitro culture of the aorta/gonad/mesonephros cells, OSM was demonstrated to markedly stimulate development of hematopoietic cells and also endothelial cells. Recent results suggest that hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells are derived from a common precursor termed hemangioblast and OSM appears to stimulate hemangioblasts rather than the hematopoietic stem cells. To understand the role of OSM in hematopoiesis, we attempted to clone OSM-inducible genes from a hemangioblastic cell line, LO, that we recently established. 2T. Hara, Y. Mukouyama, and A. Miyajima, manuscript in preparation. Here we describe one of the OSM-inducible genes, OIG37, which exhibits a significant homology with two known sequences, GADD45 and MyD118. GADD45 and MyD118 are known as growth suppressive genes. The GADD45 gene was originally cloned as a UV-inducible gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells (20Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GADD45 in HeLa cells effectively suppressed their growth (21Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). MyD118 was first identified as an immediate early responsive gene induced by IL-6 in the murine myeloid cell line M1 (22Abdollahi A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 and some of its family members are known to suppress the growth and to induce differentiation of M1 cells to macrophages (23Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Bruce A.G. Hoggatt I.H. Rose T.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1271-1275PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of MyD118 also resulted in growth suppression of the H1299 human carcinoma cells (21Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of growth arrest by these genes remains unknown, it was demonstrated that both GADD45 and MyD118 associate with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (25Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), which are implicated in the cell cycle regulation (26Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B.

In the present study we describe that OSM-inducible OIG37 also binds with p21 and PCNA and that it suppresses cell growth. Murine IL-3-dependent BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/ml IL-3, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. NIH3T3OR cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. M1 cells, a murine myeloid leukemia cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. The murine hemangioblast-like cell line LO was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% FBS, 10 ng/ml of OSM, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. LO cells cultured without OSM for 24 h were stimulated with or without 100 ng/ml OSM for 1 h. Messenger RNA was extracted from LO cells by using the Fast track kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA was used for constructing a cDNA library primed by oligo(dT) using the Time Saver kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The OSM-unstimulated LO cDNA library was subtracted from the OSM-stimulated library as described previously (29Hara T. Harada N. Mitsui H. Miura T. Ishizaka T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1994; 84: 189-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Candidate OSM-inducible cDNA clones were randomly isolated from the subtracted library and sequenced by an automated sequencer (PE Biosystems). Among the several unknown clones, OIG37 was chosen for subsequent analyses. The partial cDNA fragment of OIG37 obtained from the subtraction was labeled with Digoxigenin (DIG) using the high-prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was used to isolate the full-length cDNA clones from a randomly primed LO cDNA library. The isolated clone was sequenced and the 5′ end of the cDNA was determined using a 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends using the kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). LO cells, NIH3T3OR cells, and BaF3 cells transfected with the OSMR were deprived of OSM and serum (LO), serum (NIH3T3OR), or IL-3 (BaF3) for several hours, respectively, and stimulated with OSM. M1 cells were directly stimulated with IL-6 without factor depletion. Cells were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after the stimulation. Stress-inducible expression was tested by the addition of methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) at 100 μg/ml to these cells under the same condition as cytokine stimulation. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of total RNA for each sample were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose electrophoresis gel containing 2.4% formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane and hybridized with DIG-labeled probe in high SDS buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2% DIG blocking reagent, 0.1% lauroylsarcosine) at 50 °C for overnight. After washing the filter to remove the nonspecifically bound probe, the blot was incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody. Bound alkaline phosphatase was detected by a chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA probes used for blotting were prepared from the DNA fragments encoding the regions that are most diverged among the GADD45 family members (amino acids 1–30), and therefore the probes did not cross-hybridize each other. The DNA fragment encoding the chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor and the intracellular domain of gp130 was inserted into a retroviral vector (30Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 31Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). The vector was transfected into the retrovirus packaging cells Bosc23 by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The supernatant of these cells was used to infect NIH3T3. Two days after the infection, the cells expressing the G-CSFR/gp130 chimeric receptor were selectively sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using anti-G-CSFR antibody. Thus, the levels of chimeric receptor expression were not significantly different among various chimeric receptors. The NIH3T3 transfectants expressing the dominant negative form of STAT3 (32O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were also established by the retrovirus infection carrying the dn STAT3 cDNA with internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (33Chida D. Miura O. Yoshimura A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell sorting was done by using GFP as a marker. COS7 cells transfected with the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged OIG37, MyD118, and GADD45 expression vectors were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin)). 2 μg of anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the lysate, followed by the addition of protein A (Pierce). Proteins in the immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was incubated with anti-p21 antibody or anti-PCNA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunecomplex was detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LO cells, NIH3T3OR cells, and BaF3 cells were infected with retrovirus carrying OIG37 cDNA. The OIG37 cDNA was placed upstream of the IRES sequence followed by GFP so that GFP positive cells are expected to express OIG37. GFP-positive cells sorted by using FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson) were plated in 96-well plates at 1 cell/well. Cells in the 96-well plates were cultured for 20 days, and the wells with the growing cells (colonies) and the number of cells in each colony was counted. NIH3T3OR cells were transfected with pMAM-OIG37 vector and cultured in G418 selection medium (0.4 mg/ml) for 3 weeks to establish the stable transfectants. NIH3T3OR cells or NIH3T3OR-OIG37 transfectants were plated in a 6-well plate at a starting cell number of 5 × 104. These cells were cultured with 5 × 10−7m dexamethasone (Dex) or without it, and the cell number was counted for every 12 h up to 72 h when cells became confluent. The cell number at each time point was counted in three different wells, and the average of the three wells are presented. To isolate OSM-inducible genes, we prepared two cDNA libraries from OSM responsive LO cells stimulated with or without OSM for 1 h. The cDNA inserts excised from the cDNA library of the OSM-unstimulated LO cells were subtracted with those from the OSM-stimulated LO library by the subtraction method that we developed previously (29Hara T. Harada N. Mitsui H. Miura T. Ishizaka T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1994; 84: 189-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subtracted cDNA inserts were recloned in a plasmid vector, and the cDNA clones randomly isolated from the subtracted cDNA library were subjected to sequence analysis. Among these genes, the OSM-inducible gene OIG37 encoded a novel protein and showed a clear response to OSM stimulation in LO cells as well as in NIH3T3OR cells (see below) (Fig.1 A). The OIG37 cDNA encodes a protein of 143 amino acids that shows 55% identity with GADD45 and MyD118 at the amino acid level and 60% at the nucleotide level. Although these three proteins do not possess any protein motifs to predict their function, they clearly form a new family of proteins (Fig. 1 B). The family members have highly conserved regions in the middle part of the protein at around amino acids 40–100. There is a putative PCNA-binding motif in the conserved region (Fig.1 B) (34Warbrick E. Heatherington W. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3925-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure showed at least two α helices and a few small β sheets in that region. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues with the OIG37 probe demonstrated that OIG37 mRNA is expressed in all tissues we tested: brain, liver, heart, bone marrow, thymus, spleen, testis, kidney, small intestine, muscle, and lung (Fig. 2 A). Expression of GADD45 and MyD118 was also detected in most tissues, although the levels of their expression were different in different tissues, suggesting that expression of the three family members is differentially regulated. (Fig. 2 A). We also examined the induction of OIG37 in various OSM responsive cells. The LO cell line used for the cDNA subtraction is an OSM-dependent hemangioblast-like cell line derived from the aorta/gonad/mesonephros region of mouse embryos. Depletion of OSM from the LO cells for 24 h eliminated the OIG37 mRNA, and readdition of OSM resulted in a rapid increase of the OIG37 mRNA within 30 min. Although MyD118 mRNA was not completely eliminated by depletion of OSM for 24 h, it was induced by OSM within 30 min and returned to the basal level after 1 h of OSM stimulation (Fig.2 B). In contrast, GADD45 mRNA was constitutively expressed in LO, and its level was not affected by OSM. NIH3T3OR is a subline of NIH3T3, and its growth is suppressed by OSM as reported previously (17Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1997; 90: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of OSM induced the OIG37 mRNA expression within 30 min, and the OIG37 level was decreased to the basal level within 2 h. In contrast, although the basal levels of MyD118 and GADD45 mRNA expression were detected, neither MyD118 nor GADD45 was significantly induced by OSM. M1 is a murine myeloid cell line that is induced to differentiate into macrophages in response to IL-6 and was originally used to isolate the MyD118 gene. M1 cells are unresponsive to mouse OSM because of the lack of OSMR (17Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1997; 90: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 induced OIG37 mRNA in 1 h, and the mRNA level was maintained at least 4 h after the stimulation. However, the level of OIG37 expression was lower than those of OSM-stimulated LO and NIH3T3OR cells. In contrast, induction of MyD118 by IL-6 was faster than OIG37 and was clearly detected in 30 min, whereas the GADD45 mRNA level was only slightly decreased in 1 h after the IL-6 stimulation and returned to the basal level after 4 h. BaF3/OSMR, a transfectant of the murine IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line BaF3, expresses the mouse OSMR and proliferates in response to OSM (35Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells deprived of cytokines for 6 h were stimulated with OSM. Interestingly, no OIG37 mRNA was expressed at any time points in the cells under this condition. In contrast, MyD118 expression was slightly induced in 30 min in response to OSM, and GADD45 mRNA was present at a constant level regardless of the presence or absence of OSM. These results indicate that expression of the three members of this novel gene family is differentially regulated and that while signaling by gp130 plays a major role in expression of OIG37 as well as MyD118 by OSM and IL-6, expression of these genes requires an additional cell type-specific factor(s). GADD45 family genes including OIG37 were also induced by stresses, such as UV, γ-ray, and genotoxic agents. In NIH3T3OR cells, OIG37 was weakly induced in 4 h after MMS treatment, whereas GADD45 was induced in 1 h after stimulation (Fig. 2 C). This is also consistent with M1 cells in which OIG37 mRNA appeared 8 h after the MMS stimulation, whereas GADD45 mRNA was induced in 2 h after the MMS stimulation (data not shown). Thus, the induction of GADD45 family members in these cells is regulated by stress signals as well as cytokine stimulation, although the levels of induction and kinetics of these family members seemed to be different depending on the cell types. In addition, induction of the GADD45 family by MMS was rather slow compared with very rapid induction by OSM, suggesting that the mechanism of induction by cytokines and stress are different. To dissect signaling pathway emanating from gp130 that leads to OIG37 expression, we utilized the chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the human G-CSFR and the intracellular domain of gp130. The chimeric receptor was previously shown to be activated by homodimerization induced by G-CSF (30Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). There are 6 tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of gp130, and among them the tyrosine residues at 118 and 126 from the transmembrane domain are critical for signaling. The truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal part from 133 is still capable of inducing growth promoting signals, whereas the truncation mutant at the 25th amino acid is totally inactive. G25 and G133 are hGCSFR/gp130 chimeric receptors with truncation at the 25th and 133rd amino acid residue of gp130, respectively. G133F2 and G133F3 are substitution mutants of G133 in which tyrosine residues at 118 and 126 are substituted with phenylalanine, respectively. Both tyrosine residues at 118 and 126 are substituted with phenylalanine in G133F2/3. G-CSF activates STAT3 but does not activate the Ras pathway through G133F2. Conversely, G133F3 activates the Ras pathway but not STAT3 in response to G-CSF. G133F2/3 fails to activate both signaling pathways. The chimeric receptors were expressed in NIH3T3OR cells by the retrovirus vector, and the receptor expressing cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter; the expression levels of the G-CSFR/gp130 chimera were comparable in all the chimeric receptors examined. The induction of OIG37 in response to G-CSF was observed in a mutant G133 expressing NIH3T3OR cells. Expression of OIG37 by the G133F2 mutant was rather enhanced compared with G133, whereas OIG37 expression by G133F3 was remarkably reduced, indicating that induction of OIG37 is dependent on the STAT3 pathway (Fig.3 A). Consistently, expression of the dominant negative form of STAT3, a truncation mutant lacking the transactivation domain (32O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), in NIH3T3 cells reduced the expression level of OIG37 in response to OSM stimulation. These results suggest that expression of OIG37 is regulated by STAT3 (Fig.3 B). To analyze the cellular function of OIG37, the cDNA was introduced in three cell lines, LO, NIH3T3OR, and BaF3. As MyD118 was induced by OSM and IL-6, the MyD118 function was also examined. We utilized the retrovirus expression vector that has IRES derived from polioma virus followed by the GFP gene (36Borman A.M. Deliat F.G. Kean K.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3149-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The OIG37 and MyD118 cDNAs were inserted upstream of the IRES so that the inserted genes are coexpressed with GFP. GFP positive cells were sorted from the retrovirus-infected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and the GFP positive sorted cells were seeded in three 96-well plates at one cell/well. After 20 days of culture, the numbers of the wells with growing cells (colonies) were counted. The numbers of the positive wells of the cells infected with the OIG37 expression virus vector were reduced to 60–70% of the cells infected with the empty vector (Fig.4 A). This effect was observed in all three cell lines tested. Likewise, expression of MyD118 also reduced the colony forming efficiency, but the inhibitory effect was rather less than that of OIG37. We also examined the size of each colony by counting the cell number in each positive well. Interestingly, the colony size (the number of cells in each colony) was also reduced in the cells infected with the OIG37 or MyD118 cDNA (Fig. 4 B). The growth inhibitory effect was more profound in NIH3T3OR and BaF3 than in LO cells. These results indicate that enforced expression of OIG37 and MyD118 results in suppression of cell growth. To further demonstrate the growth suppressive function of OIG37, we inducibly expressed it in NIH3T3OR cells by using the Dex-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (37Lee F. Mulligan R. Berg P. Ringold G. Nature. 1981; 294: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To monitor the expression of OIG37, the FLAG peptide was attached to OIG37. We established two independent transfectants in which OIG37 expression was inducible by Dex (Fig. 5 A). Both clones expressed almost the same level of OIG37. The level of OIG37 expression by Dex was comparable with that induced by OSM (data not shown). The cells were grown in the presence or absence of Dex, and the cell numbers were monitored. The growth rates of both NIH3T3OR transfectants expressing OIG37 were clearly reduced when Dex was added. The levels of growth suppression were almost the same between the two clones, because both expressed the same level of OIG37 (Fig. 5 B). The growth suppressive effect was also seen in the BaF3 transfectants when OIG37 is induced by Dex (data not shown). Growth suppression induced by OIG37 expression did not accompany apoptotic cell death based on trypan blue exclusion and DNA ladder formation (data not shown). Because GADD45 and MyD118 were previously shown to associate with p21 and PCNA, we wished to know whether OIG37 also interacts with these cell cycle regulators. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors with HA-tagged OIG37, MyD118, or GADD45 cDNA, and anti-HA antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate these gene products from the extracts. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p21 and anti-PCNA antibodies, and both proteins were clearly detected (Fig. 6), suggesting that the binding affinities of GADD45 family members to p21 or PCNA may be comparable. We have isolated OIG37 as an OSM-inducible gene in a hemangioblastic cell line and found that OIG37 is related to two growth suppressive genes, MyD118 and GADD45. During preparation of this manuscript, Takekawa and Saito (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) published isolation of human GADD45-related genes, GADD45α (GADD45), GADD45β (MyD118), and GADD45γ as MTK1/MEKK4-binding proteins. OIG37 appears to be mouse GADD45γ based on the sequence homology with human GADD45γ (96%). In addition, the CR6 gene identified as an IL-2-inducible gene might be identical to OIG37/GADD45γ (39Beadling C. Johnson W.K. Smith K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These three genes show extensive sequence homology and clearly form a new gene family. The middle part of these proteins, which potentially forms an α helix and a β sheet, is particularly well conserved. Because Takekawa and Saito (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) demonstrated that all members of the GADD45 family bind to MTK1/MEKK4 and we and others show that they interact with p21 and PCNA, the conserved motifs of these proteins may be involved in the interaction with MTK1/MEKK4, PCNA, and p21. PCNA-interacting proteins such as p21 (40Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) have the motif, Q XXhXXaa, (where h indicates a hydrophobic amino acid and a indicates an aromatic amino acid), and OIG37 contains the sequence QGCLTAGVY (between 36th and 44th amino acid residues), which is similar to the PCNA-binding motif (45Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This motif is also well conserved in GADD45 and MyD118 (Fig.1 B). It was also reported that the N-terminal half of GADD45, which contained this motif, was sufficient for the PCNA binding (27Hall P.A. Kearsey J.M. Coates P.J. Norman D.G. Warbrick E. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2427-2433PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that binding of the GADD45 family members to PCNA is mediated by the conserved motif around amino acids 30–45. OIG37 was highly inducible by OSM in LO and NIH3T3OR cells but was completely absent in BaF3/OSMR cells. MyD118 expression was rather constitutive and was slightly induced by OSM in LO and BaF3/OSMR but not in NIH3T3OR. GADD45 expression was constitutive in all these cells. In M1 cells, MyD118 was highly inducible by IL-6, but the OIG37 induction was much weaker, and expression of GADD45 was rather suppressed by IL-6. These results indicate that expression of OIG37 and MyD118 is regulated by signaling through gp130, the common signaling subunit of the OSMR and the IL-6 receptor, whereas GADD45 expression is independent of gp130 signaling. We have also tested stress-induced expression of OIG37 by the addition of MMS to NIH3T3OR and M1 cells. In contrast to the rapid induction of OIG37 by OSM, MMS-induced expression of OIG37 required a much longer time and the extent of expression was lower than that by cytokine stimulation. These results indicate that the mechanism of OIG37 induction by MMS is quite different from that by cytokines. We have investigated cytokine signals that lead to OIG37 expression by using the chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor and the intracellular domain of gp130. By expressing mutant chimeric receptors in which the cytoplasmic domain is mutated, we found that STAT3 is involved in the OIG37 induction. This possibility was further supported by suppression of OSM-induced expression of OIG37 by the dominant negative form of STAT3. On the other hand, the mutant receptor G133F3 defective for Ras activation showed a slightly higher induction, and Ras is known to inhibit activation of STATs such as STAT3 and STAT5 in certain cells (46Happ B. Hynes N.E. Groner B. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar, 47Jehn B. Costello E. Marti A. Keon N. Deane R. Li F. Friis R.R. Burri P.H. Martin F. Jaggi R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 48Chida D. Wakao H. Yoshimura A. Miyajima A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1792-1806PubMed Google Scholar); Ras may negatively regulate OSM-induced OIG37 expression. However, because expression of OIG37 by OSM is cell type-specific, a cell type-specific factor(s) may be involved in OIG37 induction in addition to the signaling molecules activated by gp130. Inducible expression of OIG37 using the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter clearly established that OIG37 reduces the growth rate of NIH3T3OR, although it does not completely inhibit proliferation. Although OIG37 clearly suppresses proliferation of LO, NIH3T3OR, and BaF3 when it is expressed, growth suppressive activity of OIG37 is not necessarily correlated with the expression pattern in untransfected cells. Further, cell cycle analysis using the NIH3T3 transfectants showed that the transition from G1 to G2/M phase was delayed when OIG37 was induced (data not shown). OSM stimulates proliferation of LO and induces OIG37 expression, whereas it inhibits proliferation of NIH3T3OR, which expresses OIG37. In contrast, OSM does not induce OIG37 and stimulates proliferation of BaF3/OSMR. Likewise, MyD118 is expressed regardless of whether cell proliferation is stimulated (LO and BaF3/OSMR) or suppressed (NIH3T3OR and M1) by OSM or IL-6. Growth suppressive activity of OIG37 and MyD118, as clearly shown in transfected cells, may depend on the levels of their expression; perhaps OIG37 and MyD118 suppress cell proliferation only when their expression levels reach to a certain threshold. Takekawa and Saito (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 49Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) recently described that stress induces expression of the members of the GADD45 family, which in turn induce p38/JNK activation and apoptosis through MTK1/MEKK4 activation in HeLa cells. However, controlled expression of OIG37 in NIH3T3 (Fig.5 A) and BaF3 (data not shown) by using the Dex-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter clearly indicated that expression of OIG37 only reduced the growth rate, but we never observed apoptosis induced by OIG37 (data not shown). These apparently contradictory results may be due to the difference in the expression levels, because Takekawa and Saito observed apoptosis when GADD45 members were transiently overexpressed, whereas our results were obtained with stably transfected cell lines. We therefore tested trypan blue staining and DNA ladder formation in COS7 cells transiently overexpressed OIG37 and found apoptotic cells. Thus, the physiological significance of apoptosis induced by OIG37 remains to be established. Induction of apoptosis by the GADD45 family members through MEKK4 and p38/JNK is an attractive hypothesis to elucidate the stress-induced responses (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 49Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that the GADD45 family members interact with MEKK4 in transiently transfected COS7 cells (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Likewise, we were able to demonstrate the association of OIG37 with p21 and PCNA in transiently transfected COS7 cells. However, it still remains uncertain whether MEKK4, p21, and PCNA interact with GADD45 family members under physiological conditions. It is possible that GADD45 family members interact with these proteins only when their expression reaches a certain level. This partly explains why the effect of OSM was variable depending on cells. Roles of MEKK4, p21, and PCNA in the function of the GADD45 family members await further investigation. We thank Takashi Sekiguchi for excellent support for cell sorting."

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). These results indicate the important functions of voltage-gated K+channels in neuronal signal transduction and processing. Their contribution to behavioral phenotypes such as learning and memory have also been studied (2Ben-Ari Y. Represa A. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 312-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 3Engel J.E. Wu C.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2254-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, many voltage-gated K+ channel genes have been identified from different tissues such as heart and brain, and constitute an evolutionarily related multigene superfamily (4Strong M. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 221-242PubMed Google Scholar, 5Deal K.K. England S.K. Tamkun M.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 76: 49-67Google Scholar, 6Warmke J. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). This superfamily is classified into two groups, the Shaker and the ether-à-go-go (eag)1 families. The Shaker family is quite heterogeneous and mainly consists of four subfamilies, Kv1–Kv4. Their protein structures are characterized by six transmembrane regions (S1–S6) with a voltage-sensing S4 region and an ion-conducting pore region located between S5 and S6. K+ channels in the eag family also have similar structural features. However, overall sequence similarity between eag and Shaker-type K+ channels is very low. Members of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels and plant hyperpolarization-activated K+ channels, rather than Shaker-type channels (6Warmke J. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Indeed, a common feature of the C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain, a characteristic of such ion channels. The eag family consists of eag, eag-related gene (erg), and elk (6Warmke J. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 7Warmke J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, genetic mutations of eag or erg induces a hyperexcitable phenotype (9Ganetzky B. Wu C.F. J. Neurogenet. 1983; 1: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Titus S.A. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 875-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang X. Reynolds E.R. Deak P. Hall L.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 882-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human erg maps to LQT2, the locus of inherited long-QT syndrome, an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential (12Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). This gene is expressed not only in the heart but also in the brain and parasympathetic ganglia (8Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a dorsal root ganglionic cell line, pharmacological blocking of erg currents causes the disappearance of spike-frequency adaptation of firing (13Chiesa N. Rosati B. Arcangeli A Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. 1997; 501: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that mammalian erg also contributes to the regulation of neuronal excitability. Consequently, we attempted to identify other novel erg-related genes expressed in mammalian brain. As a result, a new gene encoding a voltage-gated K+ channel was isolated, which is more closely related to elk than erg and is exclusively expressed in the human telencephalon. This study reports the molecular cloning, distribution, and channel activity of this gene, BEC1. In addition, the identification of another novel gene closely related to BEC1 is described, indicating the existence of a new subfamily in the eag K+ channel family. A BLAST search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base of GenBank, using human erg as a query amino acid sequence, retrieved two sequences with the accession number R35526 (387 bases) and M79045 (231 bases). To identify the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA corresponding to each EST, 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were performed using the Human Brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) and primers derived from each EST sequence. Amplified fragments were directly cloned into the plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Sequencing the RACE products revealed that the two EST were part of a cDNA. Determined sequences were assembled into a large contig (3610 bases) with an open-reading frame encoding 1083 amino acids, which we called human BEC1. Finally, to verify that human BEC1 cDNA including the entire open-reading frame could be cloned from an independent source, human poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Reverse transcriptase reaction was primed with the random hexamer. Primers for PCR were designed from the 3610-bp contig as follows: 5′-GGAATTCC CTA AGA TGC CGG CCA TGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGC ACT CTG AGG TTG GGC CGA AC-3′, which contains artificial sequences with Eco RI and Xba I sites, respectively (italic). Cycles were as follows: initial denature at 96 °C for 1 min; and 35 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 10 s, annealing at 68 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used. The RT-PCR exclusively generated a 3.3-kb fragment. The amplified fragment was digested with Eco RI and Xba I, and cloned into pME18S, a plasmid for mammalian expression (14Maruyama K. Takebe Y. Med. Immunol. 1990; 20: 27-32Google Scholar). The resulting BEC1 expression vector was termed pME-E1. To isolate rat homolog cDNAs of BEC1, RT-PCR was performed using primers derived from two nucleotide sequences of BEC1 conserved with elk, 5′-ACc TTC CTG GAC ACC ATC GC-3′ and 5′-CCa AAc ACC ACc GCg TGC AT-3′, in which lowercase letters are indicated mismatches with elk. These sequences correspond to amino acid residues 13–19 (TFLDTIA) and 492–498 (MHAVVFG) of human BEC1, which are shared only with elk among the eag family (Fig. 1). Rat brain poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by guanidine thiocyanate extraction followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (15Sugimoto T. Saito M. Mochizuki M. Tahara A. Watanabe U. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. Saito T. Kurokawa K. Yoshida S. Neurohypophysis: Recent Progress of Vasopressin and Oxytocin Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 409-413Google Scholar), and converted into random-primed cDNA. The RT-PCR amplified two fragments of 1.5 and 1.4 kb, which encode polypeptides with 97% and 59% identities to human BEC1, respectively. Because the N and C termini were missing, 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed on the basis of each determined sequence using the Rat Brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH). Sequences of the 1.5-kb fragment and its 5′- and 3′-RACE products were assembled into a contig (3715 bases) with an open reading frame of 1087 amino acids, while sequences of the 1.4-kb fragment and its RACE were merged a contig (3736 bases) with an open reading frame of 1017 amino acids. The 1087-amino acid sequence is extremely similar (95%) to human BEC1, indicating that this is the rat counterpart of BEC1. Another sequence shares 48% sequence similarity with BEC1. We estimated that the latter gene was a homolog to BEC1, which we named BEC2. BEC1 sequences are markedly conserved between the human and the rat. Nucleotide identity is 89% between both open reading frames of human and rat BEC1. If human BEC2 cDNA is also extremely similar to the rat one, human BEC2 cDNA will be amplified by RT-PCR using some primer sets derived from rat sequence. Thus, to identify human BEC2, RT-PCR with human poly(A)+RNA was performed using primers designed from the sequences around the initiation and stop codon of rat BEC2 cDNA, 5′-GCC ATG CCG GTC ATG AAG G-3′ and 5′-GCC AGG GTC AGT GGA ATG TG-3′. A 3.1-kb fragment was specifically amplified by the RT-PCR (35 cycles of 98 °C, 15 s and 68 °C, 3 min) with TaKaRa LA Taq (Takara Shuzo, Japan), directly cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The sequence has an open reading frame encoding 1017 amino acids with 89% identity to rat BEC2, suggesting that this cDNA encodes human BEC2. Both 5′- and 3′-cDNA ends were determined by RACE. The results revealed a contig (3920 bases) of human BEC2 cDNA and the presence of only a silent mismatch (T17C) in the reverse primer. To construct an expression vector for human BEC2, the open reading frame of human BEC2 cDNA in pCR2.1 was subcloned into pME18S. This vector was named pME-E2. Both strands of each fragment were sequenced using ABI PRISM DNA sequencing reagents and an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed using the Clustal W program, version 1.7 (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55989) Google Scholar), and neighbor-joining method of the Phylip program, version 3.572c (17Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Northern blot analysis of mRNA was performed using Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH), on which about 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane had been immobilized. BEC1 distribution was determined using a random-primed32P-labeled probe corresponding to amino acids 701–984 of BEC1. The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C, in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and then finally washed twice for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The blots were exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm-MP; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with two intensifying screens at −80 °C for 5 days. To determine BEC2 distribution, the membranes were hybridized as described above with a random-primed32P-labeled probe corresponding to amino acids 747–965 of BEC2, finally washed twice for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, and exposed to x-ray films for 10 days. Distribution of human erg was determined as a control gene using a probe corresponding to amino acids 1050–1159. For RT-PCR analysis of human BEC2, the primers 5′-TCC GGC TCG CTT GAG GTG CT-3′ and 5′-CCA GTG GGG GAA TGA GAA GC-3′ were used. This primer set amplifies a 655-bp fragment corresponding to amino acids 598–815 of BEC2. Random-primed cDNAs were synthesized from each human tissue poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg,CLONTECH). An aliquot (1/100 volume) of each cDNA was amplified by 33 cycles of PCR (94 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 15 s; 72 °C, 1 min) with AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer). Ten-microliter aliquots of amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained by ethidium bromide. The plasmid (0.1 ng) carrying BEC1 or BEC2 cDNA was used as a control template. The efficiency of cDNA synthesis was estimated by RT-PCR (23 cycles) of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (18Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Takemoto Y. Akuzawa S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described (19Okumura K. Kaneko Y. Nonoguchi K. Nishiyama H. Yokoi H. Higuchi T. Itoh K. Yoshida O. Miki T. Fujita J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using rat brain sections and a digoxigenin-labeled single strand RNA probe corresponding to amino acids 840–1013 of rat BEC1. The brains of adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 μm thickness. Before hybridization, the sections were dewaxed, fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml), 0.2 n HCl, 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1m triethanolamine, dehydrated with ethanol, and dried. The RNA probe was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), from a partial fragment of BEC1 cDNA with a T7 promoter sequence incorporated by PCR. Hybridization was performed overnight at 45 °C with the digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe (approximately 0.5 μg/ml) in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10× Denhardt's solution, 600 mm NaCl, and 250 μg/ml E. coli transfer RNA. After hybridization, sections were treated with ribonuclease A (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed twice at 45 °C with 2× SSC and 0.2× SSC for 20 min each. The hybridized digoxigenin-labeled probe was detected with a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization with the sense probe was performed under identical conditions served as a negative control. L929 and CHO cells were transfected with BEC1 cDNA for electrophysiological studies as described (20Mochizuki S. Miyake A. Furuichi K. Amino Acids. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 21Matsumoto M. Nomura T. Momose K. Ikeda Y. Kondou Y. Akiho H. Togami J. Kimura Y. Okada M. Yamaguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27217-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). L929 cells were co-transfected with the BEC1 expression vector pME-E1 described previously and the green fluorescent protein expression vector phGFP S65T (CLONTECH) using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected cells were determined by observing green fluorescent protein fluorescence with an epifluorescence microscope. For stable transfection, BEC1 cDNA was subcloned into pEF-BOS(dhfr), a derivative incorporating the dihydrofolate reductase gene of the mammalian expression plasmid pEF-BOS (22Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). CHO cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase gene were transfected with this plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cultured in medium without nucleotides. BEC1 expression was amplified with methotrexate (Sigma) at 0.1–3 μm. For electrophysiological studies of BEC2, L929 cells were co-transfected with pME-E2 and phGFP S65T as described previously. Electrophysiological recordings were performed from BEC1 transfectants using voltage-clamp technique in whole-cell configurations (20Mochizuki S. Miyake A. Furuichi K. Amino Acids. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Currents were recorded using Axopatch ID patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes had resistances of 2–5 megohms. The internal pipette solution contained 125 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.2). The external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 15 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.4). All recordings were done at room temperature (25 °C). Tetraethylammonium (TEA) chloride and quinidine sulfate were purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Japan). Two erg-related sequences, the accession numbers R35526 andM79045, were identified in the EST data base of GenBank using a BLAST search with an amino acid sequence of human erg (6Warmke J. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). R35526 (387 bases) has two regions encoding amino acid sequences with 45% and 52% identities to 42- and 23-amino acid portions around the S1 and S2 regions of human erg, respectively (smallest sum probability p = 1.1 × 10−8). M79045 (231 bases) encodes a sequence with 64% identity to a 28-amino acid portion of the S5 region (p = 0.0032). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a series of RACE studies using primers derived from each EST sequences caused to identification a cDNA (3610 bases) with an open-reading frame encoding 1083 amino acids (Fig.1), showing 28–46% identity to K+ channels of the eag family. The greatest similarity (46% identity) is to rat elk, which has been identified only recently (23Shi W. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rat eag and human erg share 30% and 33% sequence similarity with BEC1, respectively. We named this new protein thebrain-specific eag-like channel1, BEC1. Additionally, rat counterpart of the BEC1 gene was identified in rat brain mRNA, which encodes 1087 amino acids with 95% identity to human BEC1. Another related gene, termed BEC2, was identified in rat or human brain mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both human and rat BEC2 consist of 1017 amino aids with 48% identity to BEC1. Amino acid sequences of BEC2 proteins are highly conserved between human and rat (89% identity), although the C-terminal part of BEC2 with about 400 amino acids is rather divergent, compared with BEC1. The sequence alignment of BEC1 and BEC2 is shown in Fig. 1. BEC1 and BEC2 contain a hydrophobic core corresponding to the six transmembrane regions, S1–S6, and the pore region of voltage-gated K+ channels. The hydrophobic core is highly conserved between BEC1 (residues 227–508) and BEC2 (residues 229–482) with 70% identities. This sequence similarity is comparable to that among members in a given subfamily of all the known K+ channel superfamily genes. The putative voltage-sensing S4 and ion-conducting pore regions are also shared by BEC1 and BEC2. In the S4 region, only three amino acids are different between BEC1 and BEC2. The S4 regions of both BEC1 and BEC2 contain five positively charged residues found at every third position. Additionally, other two positively and one negatively charged residues are found at common positions. The pore regions of BEC1 and BEC2 have a GFG triplet, a common motif of eag-type K+ channels (6Warmke J. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), and contain four distinct amino acids from each other. Potential N-glycosylation sites were found in the hydrophilic segments between the S5 and pore region; BEC1 contains three sites and BEC2 one site. An additional site was identified between the S3 and S4 region of BEC2. In the C-terminal region, there is a sequence with significant similarity to the CNB domain of cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation channels. Although the CNB domains of BEC1 and BEC2 are homologous to eag-type K+ channels, they are markedly similar to each other (57% identity) among the cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins. These results indicate that BEC1 and BEC2 may be members of a new subfamily of eag-type K+channels. Also, phylogenetic analysis suggests that these novel genes have a common ancestor with eag-type channels and represent an additional branch in the eag family (Fig.2). Human EST R35526, which corresponds to BEC1, is a partial sequence of the clone 37299 in the human infant brain cDNA library 1NIB arrayed by IMAGE consortium (24Soares M.B. Bonaldo M.F. Jelene P. Su L. Lawton L. Efstratiadis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This clone has been termed DRES61 and assigned to the 12q13 region of the human genome using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis by Banfi et al. (25Banfi S. Borsani G. Rossi E. Bernard L. Guffanti A. Rubboli F. Marchitiello A. Giglio S. Coluccia E. Zollo M. Zuffardi O. Ballabio A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of DRES61 was recently submitted to GenBank (accession number U69184), and consists of 1088 bases, except a sequence of the adapter used in constructing the library. We performed sequence alignment of human BEC1 and DRES61. The alignment revealed that the 3′-end sequence of DRES61 with 879 bases was identical to the 5′-end sequence of human BEC1 upstream of codon 282, except a silent mismatch in codon 10 (CCT to CCG) of BEC1. An unique chromosomal region has been identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization with DRES61 cDNA, indicating that BEC1 is derived from an identical gene to DRES61. Taken together, the BEC1 locus is located in the 12q13 region. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a 4-kb BEC1 transcript in human brain poly(A)+ RNA (Fig.3 A). The size of the mRNA concurs with the length of our identified cDNA. No signals were detected in other human tissues including the heart, placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Within human brain, 4-kb transcripts of BEC1 were detected in cortical structures such as the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, and the striatal regions including the putamen and caudate nucleus (Fig. 3 B). In these brain regions, an additional 6-kb transcript was identified, but it possessed weak signals. Expression of only the 6-kb transcript was found in human cerebellum, but the expression level was very low. BEC1 transcripts were not detectable in the spinal cord or in the corpus callosum, which contains primarily axons and glia. Thus, the expression of the BEC1 transcripts is largely restricted to the telencephalon in human tissues. The expression pattern of BEC1 contrasts with that of human erg, which displays a more ubiquitous distribution in the brain (Fig. 3 B). Tissue distribution of BEC2 was also elucidated by Northern blot analysis of human poly(A)+ RNA. Multiple signals were detected only in the brain, with 4.4, 7.5, and ∼10 kb (Fig.3 A). We have identified BEC2 cDNA with 3920 bases, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Considering an addition of a poly(A) tail, the 4.4-kb transcript probably corresponds to the identified cDNA. Since the signals were weak, tissue distribution of BEC2 was further determined by RT-PCR analysis. A 655-bp fragment corresponding to BEC2 was amplified only from the brain mRNA (Fig.4). This fragment was generated when the plasmid carrying BEC2 cDNA was used as a template, but not BEC1 cDNA. These results suggests that BEC2 is exclusively expressed in the brain, as well as BEC1. Northern blot analysis of the brain regions indicated the BEC2 expression restricted to the telencephalon, similar to BEC1 (Fig. 3 B). All size BEC2 transcripts were predominantly detected in the striatal regions such as the putamen and caudate nucleus. In addition, hybridization signals for BEC2 were detected in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The expression pattern of BEC2 is nearly parallel to that of BEC1, although the expression levels appear to be different in each region. In situ hybridization was performed using rat brain sections to determine the cellular localization of BEC1 within the brain. Hybridization signals were prominently found in the hippocampus, when only the antisense probe specific to BEC1 was used (Fig. 5 A and B). Specific signals were also detectable in the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, in situ hybridization showed that BEC1 transcripts were concentrated in the pyramidal cell body layers of the CA1 and CA3 field and in the granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus. In the cerebral cortex, BEC1 signals were widely present from layer II to layer VI. Specific signals were detected in cell bodies of neurons with typical pyramidal shapes in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 5, C and D). To characterize electrophysiological properties of BEC1 using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method, L929 cells were transiently transfected with the BEC1 expression vector. The cells were clamped at a holding potential of −90 mV and were depolarized to voltages between −60 and 100 mV. Depolarizing steps induced an outward current in BEC1-transfected cells (Fig.6 A, lower traces). When the voltage was stepped to potentials above 20 mV, the outward current was rapidly inactivated and relaxed to a sustained plateau. The peak current amplitude induced by depolarization to 100 mV was 0.14–7.3 nA (n = 41). Such responses were not observed in control cells (Fig. 6 A, upper traces). Fig.6 B shows averaged current-voltage curves for the peak current within 40 ms and the current at the end of the 200-ms voltage pulse, which correspond to transient and steady-state currents, respectively. The transient current amplitude increased from −60 to 100 mV voltage-dependently. In contrast, the steady-state current amplitude increased up to ∼20 mV and then decreased with further depolarization. For tail current analysis of BEC1, transfectants were depolarized to 80 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV, and then were repolarized to voltages between −20 and −120 mV (Fig. 6 C). The BEC1 current was activated and inactivated by the 200-ms-long depolarizing steps. Following repolarization allowed recovery from inactivation and induced a tail current. The tail current reversed at approximately −80 mV in the bath solution containing 5.4 mm K+. Considering the Nernst potential (−87 mV, 25 °C) for K+, this result supports that BEC1 is a member of the K+ channel family. We examined the effect of two classical K+ channel blockers, TEA and quinidine, on the BEC1 channel. Kv2.1 was used as a control K+ channel. TEA (10 mm) reduced current amplitude of the Kv2.1 channel but did not affect that of the BEC1 channel in response to depolarization pulses (data not shown). In general, K+ channels of the eag family are less sensitive to TEA, compared with the Shaker family (26Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 27Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Brüggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marguardt A. Stühmer W. Pong O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that BEC1 also has the common feature. Conversely, sensitivities to quinidine are heterogeneous in the eag family. Quinidine potently inhibits the erg current with an IC50 value of 0.9 μm (28Yang T. Snyders D.J. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas the sensitivity of eag current is low (27Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Brüggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marguardt A. Stühmer W. Pong O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). BEC1 was insensitive to 10 μm quinidine, which inhibited the channel activity of Kv2.1 (data not shown). Stable BEC1 transfectants were constructed using dihydrofolate reductase gene-deficient CHO cells and the gene amplification induced by methotrexate. The 5C1–5 clone was selected as a transfectant expressing high amount of BEC1. This cell produced an outward current in response to depolarization steps (data not shown), just as L929 cells transiently transfected with BEC1 cDNA. The parent CHO cells showed no responses. These results suggest that the identified current is caused by BEC1. The transient transfection of L929 cells and the whole-cell voltage-clamp method were used to identify channel activity of BEC2, as well as BEC1. As shown in Fig.7, depolarization steps induced an outward current in BEC2-transfected cells, indicating that the BEC2 gene also encodes a channel protein. The inactivation process such as the BEC1 current was not observed in the BEC2 current. This study describes new members of the voltage-gated K+ channel superfamily, BEC1 and BEC2, which are exclusively expressed in human brain. Although a number of voltage-gated K+ channel genes have been isolated from the mammalian brain, almost all of those genes are also expressed in other tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle. Among the Shaker-type channel genes identified in the brain, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv3.2, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 are detectable in heart or skeletal muscle (29Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Serodio P. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. J.

Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar; Fig.3 A). Exclusive expression in the brain is a remarkable feature of BEC1 and BEC2. In addition, both messages are highly concentrated in the telencephalon of the human brain, suggesting that this channel may contribute to excitability of restricted neurons in the central nervous system. BEC1 messages in the hippocampus are prominently detected in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and the dentate gyrus granule neurons, which constitute the trisynaptic excitatory pathway, a neural circuit important to establish long term synaptic potentiation and depression (34Levitan I.B. Kaczmarek L.K. The Neuron: Cell and Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1991Google Scholar). Given the contribution of voltage-gated K+ channels to learning and memory, it is of high interest to study involvement of BEC1 channel in this neural circuit. BEC1 belongs to the eag family of voltage-gated K+ channels. Identification of BEC2, a gene closely related to BEC1, reveals the existence of a new subfamily of eag-type channels. Both BEC1 and BEC2 are homologous to elk, a Drosophila putative K+ channel gene. The recently identified rat homolog of elk, rat elk1 (23Shi W. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), is not identical but is the most closely related to BEC1 and BEC2. Intriguingly, we have already isolated a full-length cDNA of a third human gene, BEC3. 2A. Miyake and S. Mochizuki, unpublished observation. Rat elk1 seems the rat ortholog of BEC3, since this gene is 91% identical to BEC3. Thus, this subfamily consists of at least three mammalian homologs of elk. BEC1 elicits an outward current with a fast inactivation component. Fast inactivating currents are also elicited by Shaker-type channels such as Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 (5Deal K.K. England S.K. Tamkun M.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 76: 49-67Google Scholar). However, unlike these Shaker-type channels, the BEC1 current has not only the transient component but also a steady-state component showing the bell-shaped current-voltage relationship. The difference between voltage dependence of both components is a feature of the BEC1 channel. In contrast, BEC2 elicits a non-inactivating outward current. Sequence similarity between BEC1 and BEC2 is high (70% identity) in the hydrophobic core region important to channel properties. Comparing two sequences may be considerable to identify amino acids determining the difference between these channel properties. Genetic mutations in several K+ channel genes have been identified as genes responsible for inherited disorders (12Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T.

Thus, the possibility that BEC1 mutants associate with diseases should be considered. The BEC1 gene maps to the 12q13 region of the human genome. To date, several unsolved genetic disorders have been assigned to the 12q13 region, for example a late-onset form of familial Alzheimer disease (38Pericak-Vance M.A. Bass M.P. Yamaoka L.H. Gaskell P.C. Scott W.K. Terwedow H.A. Menold M.M. Conneally P.M. Small G.W. Vance J.M. Saunders A.M. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. JAMA. 1997; 278: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nocturnal enuresis (39Arnell H. Hjalmas K. Jagervall M. Lackgren G. Stenberg A. Bengtsson B. Wassen C. Emahazion T. Anneren G. Pettersson U. Sundvall M. Dahl N. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Genotype analyses using polymorphic markers within the BEC1 gene are necessary to analyze whether BEC1 is genetically linked to such disorders. The nucleotide T at position 3 of codon 10 of BEC1 is replaced by G in DRES61, as described under “Results.” This substitution is perhaps a single nucleotide polymorphism within BEC1. In summary, the identification of BEC1 and BEC2 genes further extends to the diversity of the K+ channel multigene superfamily. We have demonstrated that both genes are localized in human telencephalon and encode channel proteins. Delineating their physiological roles may provide new insights into neuronal signal transduction and processing in human telencephalon. We thank Drs. Toshiyuki Takemoto, Fumikazu Wanibuchi, and Masamichi Okada for helpful discussion, and we thank Ayako Matsuo and Hiroko Mukaiyama for expert technical assistance. We also thank Steven E.

Most of the work described in the previous paragraph was carried out with crystals obtained in the presence of Mg2+ and spermine. Recently we discovered (14Liu J. Malinina L. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that, in the presence of a high concentration of Ca2+ ion, this oligonucleotide could crystallize in the R3 space group. Here we report the results we have obtained under the latter crystallization conditions at a higher resolution than that previously reported (14Liu J. Malinina L. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results show that the central sequence GAATTC is practically identical in both cases, whereas the conformation of the terminal CGC/GCG sequences is much more variable because of the interaction with neighbor molecules in the crystal. The crystal was grown by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. The crystallization solution contained 0.4 mm dodecamer (NH4+ salt), 300 mm CaCl2, 10% MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), and 20 mm cacodylic acid (pH 7.0). The concentration of monovalent cations (Na+ from the buffer and NH4+ from the dodecamer) was considerably smaller than the Ca2+ ion concentration. It was equilibrated against a reservoir of 48% MPD at 20 °C. A 0.8 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 crystal was obtained in about two months. In some cases, the crystallization solution also contained either a basic peptide or protamine. However, they are neither found in the crystal structure nor essential for crystallization. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a 345 mm MAR Research image plate scanner using the beamline X11 in the DESY synchrotron radiation station in Hamburg, Germany. An Oxford Cryo-systems Cryostream was used to flash cool the crystal at 120 K under a nitrogen vapor stream. A high resolution (1.20 Å) dataset was collected with long exposure, and a second dataset at low resolution (2.65Å) was collected with short exposure to avoid saturation of some strong low resolution reflections that are important for the interpretation of the electron density map during the structural refinement. Both datasets were processed with the program DENZO (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar) and then reduced and merged with the program SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of the title compound at low resolution (3.0 Å) was used as the initial model to start refinement with CNS 0.3 (16Brunger A.T. Crystallography and NMR System (CNS), Version 0.3. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1998Google Scholar). First a rigid body refinement was performed with 8.0–3.0-Å resolution data. Then alternate positional and B-factor refinements were carried out while extending the resolution of the data as well as adding calcium ions and water molecules stepwise. It was noticed during data processing that the diffraction of the crystal is rather anisotropic, which is probably because of the nature of crystal packing and the disordered terminal cytosine residues. It diffracts to 1.2 Å in the z direction but to a lower resolution in perpendicular directions. In view of this situation, the data were cut to 1.45 Å to avoid overestimating the resolution. Overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent corrections were introduced throughout the refinement. The two terminal cytosine residues were not detected in the electron density map and were thus excluded from the refinement. At this point, the R factor was 0.252 and R free 0.262. Then the model was further refined with SHELXL (17Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Anisotropic overall scaling of the data and diffuse solvent corrections were applied. Phosphorus atoms and calcium ions were refined anisotropically. The R free test with 10% of the reflections was used to monitor the progress of the refinement, leading to R factor 0.210 and R free 0.247. Finally the model was refined with the complete dataset, resulting in R factor 0.211. The structural refinement statistics are also listed in Table I. Given the apparent resolution of the data, a lower R factor was expected, but the anisotropy of the data as well as the disorder of the cytosines probably prevented further improvement. The R factor could be substantially reduced to 0.157 by using anisotropic atomic B factors for all atoms, but the quality of our data did not warrant such an approach as the free R factor was only reduced to 0.231. Conformational parameters were calculated with NEWHELIX93 (courtesy of Dr. R. Dickerson, University of California, Los Angeles). In the R3 space group, the dodecamers crystallize as infinite parallel columns as shown in Fig.1. The columns are stabilized by an interaction between consecutive dodecamers as demonstrated in Fig.2. This interaction was first described by Spink et al. (18Spink N. Nunn C.M. Vijtechovsky J. Berman H.M. Neidle S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10767-10771Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for decamers and since then has been found in other cases (19Nunn C.M. Garman E. Neidle S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4792-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Abrescia N.G.A. Malinina L. Fernandez L.G. Huynh-Dinh T. Neidle S. Subirana J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The terminal guanine of each dodecamer penetrates into the minor groove of the neighbor duplex and forms a set of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the columns of duplexes shown in Fig.1. A Ca2+ ion that is associated with a guanine from a neighbor column is also involved in this interaction, as shown in Fig.2. On the other hand, the terminal cytosines are disordered and cannot be detected in the electron density map, as found in other cases in which this interaction is present (18Spink N. Nunn C.M. Vijtechovsky J. Berman H.M. Neidle S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10767-10771Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Nunn C.M. Garman E. Neidle S.

The stereopair shows the two terminal Watson-Crick base pairs of consecutive duplexes and the terminal guanines that interact with the minor groove of the next duplex. A Ca2+ ion and an associated water are shown as black dots. A guanine from a neighbor column of duplexes also interacts with this Ca2+ion. Dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Neighbor duplexes along each column do not form pseudocontinuous helices. There is a rotation of about −70.5° between the terminal base pairs. Because of this rotation, stacking of the neighbor C·G base pairs is very limited, although the planes of the base pairs are rather parallel. The overall helical axis of each duplex is approximately parallel to the z direction of the crystal, with an angle of 2.0°, but the axes are laterally displaced in neighbor duplexes by about 3.8 Å. The interaction between neighbor columns is stabilized by the presence of two types of Ca2+ ions that occur at regular intervals. One of them lies on the ternary axis of the unit cell and stabilizes the interaction of three duplexes at the level of phosphate 5, as shown in Fig. 3. Another Ca2+ ion stabilizes the interaction between phosphates 12 and 24 at the ends of neighbor duplexes, as shown in Fig. 2. The latter interaction is also apparent at the lower end of Fig. 1. It should be pointed out that there are occasionally short contacts (<2.5Å) between some of the water molecules. Some of them may correspond to disordered calcium ions. Because there is no extra electron density, we have treated them as water molecules. The central region of the duplex has a spine of hydration (5Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 535-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 6Kopka M.L. Fratini A.V. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 9Shui X.Q. McFail-Isom L. Hu G.G. Williams L.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8341-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) identical to that found in the P212121 structure, as it has been discussed in detail elsewhere (21Soler-López M. Malinina L. Liu J. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23683-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At both ends of the spine of hydration, there are two heavily hydrated Ca2+ ions. In contrast, in the case of the P212121 structure, crystallized in the presence of Mg2+, no divalent cations are found in the minor groove. Thus the minor groove of the duplex is fully occupied, with guanines at both ends (shown in Fig. 2) followed by Ca2+ ions and a spine of hydration in the central region. An additional characteristic feature of the P212121 structure is the narrow minor groove at the level of the central AATT sequence. As shown in Fig. 4, this feature is also present in the structure reported here. It is also apparent from the figure that the R3 structure is more symmetric, as it will be shown in more detail below. A comparison of some of the conformational parameters is given in Fig.5. It is clear that the central GAATTC sequence is practically identical in the two structures compared, using any of the parameters shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, the three terminal base pairs at both ends of the dodecamer show a mixed behavior. For example, the values of roll angles are practically identical in both cases, whereas rise and twist follow similar but not identical trends. Propeller twist and some δ values are rather different in both cases. These differences are undoubtedly related to the interactions between duplexes in the crystal, which occur mainly at the terminal base pairs. Another feature of interest is the higher degree of symmetry of the R3 structure. This feature is most clear in the values of the propeller twist and in the δ angles, related with the sugar pucker. Ideally, the two chains of the duplex should have identical δ angles in all the positions of the dodecamer. In Fig. 5, it is clear that the plots of δ values deviate much more in the P212121 than in the R3 structure. In the P212121space group, the duplex is found to be bent (1Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8341-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), although the bromine derivative has a straight helical axis (1Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bending is demonstrated by the normal vector plot presented in Fig.6. In the same figure, it is shown that the R3 structure only has small distortions, it is practically straight. The overall helical axis calculated with NEWHELIX93 forms an angle of 2° with the z direction of the unit cell and is displaced about 2 Å from the 3-fold screw axis that relates consecutive duplexes in a column. The results reported here for the d(CGCGAATTCGCG) dodecamer under very different packing constraints show that the central GAATTC sequence has a very stable conformation, very similar to that reported in the P212121 structure several years ago (1Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E.

A. 1982; 79: 4040-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We can therefore conclude that crystal packing constraints do not have much influence on the conformational parameters of that sequence. On the other hand, the conformation of the 3 terminal base pairs at both ends of the duplex is strongly influenced (Fig. 5) by the packing interactions between the terminal regions of the duplexes, which have been shown above for the R3 structure (Fig. 2). In the P212121 structure, guanine-guanine interactions between different duplexes are also present, as they have been analyzed in detail elsewhere (7Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D.S. Kopka M.L. Pjura P.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1987; 5: 557-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Tereshko V. Subirana J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this context we should point out that the average twist of the R3 structure corresponds to about 10.5 base pairs/turn, very close to the average value in solution (23Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1980; 286: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As we have shown elsewhere (22Tereshko V. Subirana J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the constraints imposed on dodecamers in the P212121 space group result in an average twist which must be close to 10 base pairs/turn. On the other hand, in the R3 space group, the stacking interactions among neighbor duplexes in a column are less extensive, and apparently the duplexes have enough freedom to acquire an average twist closer to that found in solution. A final question to consider is why Ca2+ ions promote a different packing than the typical P212121 space group found in most dodecamers crystallized up to now (8Berman H.M. Olson W.K. Beveridge D.L. Westbrook J. Gelbin A. Demeny T. Hsieh S.-H. Srinivasan A.R. Schneider B. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 751-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Two reasons may be invoked. One is that Mg2+ ions, at least in the lower concentration used for crystallization of dodecamers, do not penetrate the narrow groove. Penetration of the narrow groove by Ca2+ makes it wider toward the end of the dodecamer (Fig. 4) and may prevent the guanine-guanine interaction characteristic of the P212121 dodecamers (7Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D.S. Kopka M.L. Pjura P.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1987; 5: 557-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Tereshko V. Subirana J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The second reason is that the interaction among duplexes which are stabilized by the divalent cations are very different in the presence of Ca2+ (Figs. 2 and 3) than in the presence of Mg2+ (11Tereshko V. Minasov G. Egli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 470-471Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Tereshko and Minasov for advice and discussion."

We used human 14-3-3ζ as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a murine embryonic cDNA library. One interacting clone was found to encode the carboxyl terminus of a putative protein kinase. The coding sequence of the human form (protein kinase Uα, PKUα) of this protein kinase was found in GenBankTMon the basis of sequence homology. The two-hybrid clone was also highly homologous to TOUSLED, an Arabidopsis thaliana protein kinase that is required for normal flower and leaf development. PKUα has been found by coimmunoprecipitation to bind to 14-3-3ζ in vivo. Our confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopic experiments revealed that PKUα colocalizes with the cytoplasmic intermediate filament system of cultured fibroblasts in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. PKUα is found in the perinuclear area of S phase cells and in the nucleus of late G2 cells. Transfection of cells with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3η promotes the nuclear localization of PKUα. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of PKUα is regulated, at least in part, by its association with 14-3-3. 14-3-3 proteins are intracellular, dimeric molecules that bind to and modify the activity of several signaling proteins.

They have been identified in many eukaryotic organisms, including plants and fungi, and are primarily found in the cytoplasmic compartment of eukaryotic cells. The biological function of 14-3-3 is best modeled in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain yeast strains that lack both 14-3-3 homologues, BMH1 and BMH2, are inviable (3Gelperin D. Weigle J. Nelson K. Roseboom P. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Lemmon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11539-11543Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, strains that lack BMH1 and BMH2 can be partially “rescued” by overexpression of the Ras-stimulated kinase TPK1 or by overexpression of clathrin heavy chain. These results suggest that BMH proteins play a role in both the Ras pathway and the membrane sorting pathway. In Drosophila, 14-3-3 proteins positively regulate Ras signaling in R7 photoreceptor development (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M.

Genetic epistasis analyses in Drosophila suggest that 14-3-3 acts between Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M.

In one, 14-3-3 binding alters the conformation of a target protein, altering its enzymatic activity. The ability of 14-3-3 to promote the activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases in vitro supports this hypothesis (6Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In another model, 14-3-3 functions as a “competitive inhibitor” that prevents the binding of other proteins to the target. This model is supported by data demonstrating that 14-3-3 binding to BAD inhibits the ability of BCL-XL to bind to BAD (19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that 14-3-3 is a scaffolding protein that promotes the assembly of oligomeric signaling complexes. Indeed, Raf-1 and BCR can form a complex that is mediated by 14-3-3 protein (23Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A fourth possibility is that 14-3-3 is an attachable nuclear export signal that promotes the ability of binding partners to translocate out of the nucleus (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a requirement that suggests that serine kinases play a critical role in the regulation of 14-3-3 binding. Indeed, in the case of the apoptosis-promoting protein BAD, the serine kinase Akt or other serine kinases may be required for BAD phosphorylation that leads to 14-3-3 binding (38del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Not only do serine kinases regulate 14-3-3 binding, but it also appears that 14-3-3 regulates the activity of a variety of serine kinases, such as Raf-1 and protein kinase C.In this work, we sought new binding partners of 14-3-3 by performing a yeast two-hybrid screen. The carboxyl-terminal portion of a murine serine/threonine kinase, named PKUα, was found to interact with 14-3-3ζ. PKUα is homologous to an A. thaliana protein, TOUSLED, that is required for normal flower and leaf development (25Roe J.L. Rivkin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The identity of the signal transduction cascade in which TOUSLED participates is unclear; there is a homologue of TOUSLED in C. elegans, but the function of the worm protein is unknown.In this study, we documented in Northern blot experiments that the PKUα gene is highly expressed throughout murine embryonic development and is widely expressed in adult murine tissues. GST/14-3-3β and GST/14-3-3ζ fusion proteins were used to determine that PKUα binds to 14-3-3 in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PKUα and 14-3-3 form a complex in vivo.PKUα is found in the cytoplasmic intermediate filament system of cells at the G1/S border, in the perinuclear area of S phase cells, and in the nucleus of late G2 cells. This localization differs from that of TOUSLED protein, which is found entirely in the nuclei of plant cells at all phases of the cell cycle (26Roe J.L. Durfee T. Zupan J.R. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). TOUSLED lacks a putative 14-3-3-binding site and this may explain the difference in subcellular localization. In transfected COS1 cells, previous work has demonstrated that overexpressed PKUβ is found in the nucleus with some cytoplasmic localization (30Yamakawa A. Kameoka Y. Hashimoto K. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Tanihara K. Date T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the subcellular localization of native PKUβ and PKUα has not been previously determined.In order to test the ability of 14-3-3 to regulate the subcellular localization of PKUα, NIH/3T3 cells were transfected with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3η that is mutated at two arginine residues (R56A and R60A). Dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 were first identified by a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, where Chang and Rubin (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) demonstrated that three missense mutant forms of Dm14-3-3ε inhibited wild type 14-3-3. Subsequent mutagenesis studies with human 14-3-3η and 14-3-3ζ established that additional mutant forms of 14-3-3, including the R56A and R60A double mutant form of 14-3-3η, were potent at inhibiting the activity of wild type 14-3-3 (15Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W.K. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that arginine 56 and arginine 60 are located in the phosphoserine binding pocket of 14-3-3 and that mutating these residues does not inhibit the ability of 14-3-3 monomers to dimerize nor does it result in the production of an unstable protein (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The presumed mechanism of dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 is that they form inactive heterodimers with wild type 14-3-3 proteins (40Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although this remains to be proved. Our findings indicate that transfection of cultured cells with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3η promotes the nuclear localization of PKUα, and this is consistent with the attachable nuclear export signal model of 14-3-3 action (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that dominant negative 14-3-3η indirectly causes PKUα to accumulate in the nucleus.Recently, a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequence in the fission yeast 14-3-3 protein Rad24 was described that regulates the subcellular localization of Cdc25 (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The nuclear export factor Crm1 binds to NES-like sequences, but it has not been established whether Crm1 binds to 14-3-3 (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The NES-like sequence in Rad24 is conserved in mammalian forms of 14-3-3, and crystallographic analysis suggests that several key residues, including leucine-216 and leucine-220 of 14-3-3ζ, are located on one side of the amphipathic groove that binds to phosphoserine-containing peptide motifs (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of leucine 220 of 14-3-3ζ to aspartic acid abrogates binding to Raf-1 kinase, and this demonstrates that residues in the NES-like sequence are important for phosphoserine motif binding (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One hypothetical model that explains our results is that wild type 14-3-3 forms a oligomeric complex with PKUα and Crm1 in the nucleus of cultured cells that mediates PKUα export into the cytoplasm and that DN-14-3-3 forms inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind simultaneously to both PKUα and Crm1. Experiments are ongoing to test this model of 14-3-3-mediated nuclear export.The intranuclear substrates of PKUα and TOUSLED, if any, have not been identified. The intranuclear biochemical function of TOUSLED is obscure, although its role in proliferative events in plant development suggests that it may have a cell cycle-related activity (25Roe J.L. Rivkin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Roe J.L. Durfee T. Zupan J.R. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to investigate this possibility. 14-3-3 proteins are intracellular, acidic dimeric molecules that play a role in signal transduction pathways (1Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2Aitken A. Jones D. Soneji Y. Howell S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). They have been identified in many eukaryotic organisms, including plants and fungi, and are primarily found in the cytoplasmic compartment of eukaryotic cells. The biological function of 14-3-3 is best modeled in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain yeast strains that lack both 14-3-3 homologues, BMH1 and BMH2, are inviable (3Gelperin D. Weigle J. Nelson K. Roseboom P. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Lemmon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11539-11543Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, strains that lack BMH1 and BMH2 can be partially “rescued” by overexpression of the Ras-stimulated kinase TPK1 or by overexpression of clathrin heavy chain. These results suggest that BMH proteins play a role in both the Ras pathway and the membrane sorting pathway. In Drosophila, 14-3-3 proteins positively regulate Ras signaling in R7 photoreceptor development (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Kockel L. Vorbruggen G. Jackle H. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Genetic epistasis analyses in Drosophila suggest that 14-3-3 acts between Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In vertebrate organisms, 14-3-3 proteins regulate several facets of cell physiology, including binding to and promotion of the activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases that are important in neurotransmitter synthetic pathways (6Ichimura T.

Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 41-49Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and are thought to modulate the activity of these kinases. In the case of protein kinase C, most data demonstrate that 14-3-3 binding inhibits its activity (13Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 41-49Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interaction of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 is required for the Ras-dependent activation of Raf (14Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M.

Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar) and the apoptosis-promoting protein BAD (19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

These interactions may play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle. 14-3-3 preferentially binds to serine-phosphorylated proteins (14Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), but the biochemical significance of this is not clear, and there are several models of 14-3-3 “behavior” that are not mutually exclusive. In one, 14-3-3 binding alters the conformation of a target protein, altering its enzymatic activity. The ability of 14-3-3 to promote the activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases in vitro supports this hypothesis (6Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In another model, 14-3-3 functions as a “competitive inhibitor” that prevents the binding of other proteins to the target. This model is supported by data demonstrating that 14-3-3 binding to BAD inhibits the ability of BCL-XL to bind to BAD (19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that 14-3-3 is a scaffolding protein that promotes the assembly of oligomeric signaling complexes. Indeed, Raf-1 and BCR can form a complex that is mediated by 14-3-3 protein (23Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A fourth possibility is that 14-3-3 is an attachable nuclear export signal that promotes the ability of binding partners to translocate out of the nucleus (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify additional 14-3-3-binding partners, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with human 14-3-3ζ as a bait.

Indeed, in the case of the apoptosis-promoting protein BAD, the serine kinase Akt or other serine kinases may be required for BAD phosphorylation that leads to 14-3-3 binding (38del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Not only do serine kinases regulate 14-3-3 binding, but it also appears that 14-3-3 regulates the activity of a variety of serine kinases, such as Raf-1 and protein kinase C.In this work, we sought new binding partners of 14-3-3 by performing a yeast two-hybrid screen. The carboxyl-terminal portion of a murine serine/threonine kinase, named PKUα, was found to interact with 14-3-3ζ. PKUα is homologous to an A. thaliana protein, TOUSLED, that is required for normal flower and leaf development (25Roe J.L. Rivkin C.J. Sessions R.A. Feldmann K.A. Zambryski P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The identity of the signal transduction cascade in which TOUSLED participates is unclear; there is a homologue of TOUSLED in C. elegans, but the function of the worm protein is unknown.In this study, we documented in Northern blot experiments that the PKUα gene is highly expressed throughout murine embryonic development and is widely expressed in adult murine tissues. GST/14-3-3β and GST/14-3-3ζ fusion proteins were used to determine that PKUα binds to 14-3-3 in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PKUα and 14-3-3 form a complex in vivo.PKUα is found in the cytoplasmic intermediate filament system of cells at the G1/S border, in the perinuclear area of S phase cells, and in the nucleus of late G2 cells. This localization differs from that of TOUSLED protein, which is found entirely in the nuclei of plant cells at all phases of the cell cycle (26Roe J.L. Durfee T. Zupan J.R. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). TOUSLED lacks a putative 14-3-3-binding site and this may explain the difference in subcellular localization. In transfected COS1 cells, previous work has demonstrated that overexpressed PKUβ is found in the nucleus with some cytoplasmic localization (30Yamakawa A. Kameoka Y. Hashimoto K. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Tanihara K. Date T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the subcellular localization of native PKUβ and PKUα has not been previously determined.In order to test the ability of 14-3-3 to regulate the subcellular localization of PKUα, NIH/3T3 cells were transfected with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3η that is mutated at two arginine residues (R56A and R60A). Dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 were first identified by a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, where Chang and Rubin (4Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) demonstrated that three missense mutant forms of Dm14-3-3ε inhibited wild type 14-3-3. Subsequent mutagenesis studies with human 14-3-3η and 14-3-3ζ established that additional mutant forms of 14-3-3, including the R56A and R60A double mutant form of 14-3-3η, were potent at inhibiting the activity of wild type 14-3-3 (15Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W.K.

Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that arginine 56 and arginine 60 are located in the phosphoserine binding pocket of 14-3-3 and that mutating these residues does not inhibit the ability of 14-3-3 monomers to dimerize nor does it result in the production of an unstable protein (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The presumed mechanism of dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 is that they form inactive heterodimers with wild type 14-3-3 proteins (40Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although this remains to be proved. Our findings indicate that transfection of cultured cells with a dominant negative form of 14-3-3η promotes the nuclear localization of PKUα, and this is consistent with the attachable nuclear export signal model of 14-3-3 action (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that dominant negative 14-3-3η indirectly causes PKUα to accumulate in the nucleus.Recently, a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequence in the fission yeast 14-3-3 protein Rad24 was described that regulates the subcellular localization of Cdc25 (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The nuclear export factor Crm1 binds to NES-like sequences, but it has not been established whether Crm1 binds to 14-3-3 (24Lopes-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The NES-like sequence in Rad24 is conserved in mammalian forms of 14-3-3, and crystallographic analysis suggests that several key residues, including leucine-216 and leucine-220 of 14-3-3ζ, are located on one side of the amphipathic groove that binds to phosphoserine-containing peptide motifs (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of leucine 220 of 14-3-3ζ to aspartic acid abrogates binding to Raf-1 kinase, and this demonstrates that residues in the NES-like sequence are important for phosphoserine motif binding (39Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One hypothetical model that explains our results is that wild type 14-3-3 forms a oligomeric complex with PKUα and Crm1 in the nucleus of cultured cells that mediates PKUα export into the cytoplasm and that DN-14-3-3 forms inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind simultaneously to both PKUα and Crm1. Experiments are ongoing to test this model of 14-3-3-mediated nuclear export.The intranuclear substrates of PKUα and TOUSLED, if any, have not been identified. The intranuclear biochemical function of TOUSLED is obscure, although its role in proliferative events in plant development suggests that it may have a cell cycle-related activity (25Roe J.L.

Further studies are needed to investigate this possibility. 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitously expressed intracellular dimeric proteins that regulate several aspects of cellular physiology and bind to signaling, cell cycle, cytoskeletal, and apoptotic proteins (1Aitken A.

Recently, we established that Staf binding to the human U6 snRNA (hU6) and Xenopus selenocysteine tRNA (xtRNASec) genes requires different sets of the seven C2–H2 zinc fingers. In this work, using a combination of oocyte microinjection, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and missing nucleoside experiments with wild-type and mutant promoters, we demonstrate that the hU6 gene requires zinc fingers 2–7 for Staf binding and Oct-1 for maximal transcriptional activity. In contrast, the xtRNASec gene needs the binding of the seven Staf zinc fingers, but not Oct-1, for optimal transcriptional capacity. Mutation in the binding site for Staf zinc finger 1 in the tRNASec promoter reduced both Staf binding and transcriptional activity. Conversely, introduction of a zinc finger 1 binding site in the hU6 promoter increased Staf binding but interfered with the simultaneous Staf and Oct-1 binding, thus reducing transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results show that the differential utilization of Staf zinc finger 1 represents a new, critical determinant of the transcriptional activation mechanism for the Xenopus tRNASec and human U6 snRNA genes.

Protein-protein interactions are also involved between additional components and the DNA-protein complexes. Protein motifs such as zinc fingers of the C2–H2 type, basic helix-loop-helix, basic leucine zippers, and POU/homeodomains are shared by DNA-binding proteins and serve as an interface for DNA protein recognition (for review, see Ref. 1Patikoglou G. Burley S.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Genes for vertebrate small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)1 are transcribed by either RNA polymerase II (Pol II) or RNA polymerase III (Pol III), depending on the type of promoters they harbor (for review, see Ref.2Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription, Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). In the Pol II snRNA promoters, basal transcription is afforded by a single element, the proximal sequence element. The basal Pol III-dependent promoters possess, additionally, a TATA box that acts as a major determinant for Pol III specificity (3Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.

The proximal sequence elements of RNA Pol II and Pol III promoters are interchangeable and recruit a stable protein complex containing five subunits, known as SNAPc or PTF (5Murphy S. Yoon J.-B.

Conaway J.W. Transcription, Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). The DSEs are composed of several functional submotifs, two of which are the octamer and the Staf motifs (2Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription, Mechanisms and Regulation.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The submotif composition of the DSE is characteristic for each type of promoter, containing either both the octamer and Staf motifs or only one of these. For example, optimal transcription of the human U6 snRNA promoter (hU6) depends on the simultaneous presence of the octamer and Staf motifs (10Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Danzeiser D.A. Urso O. Kunkel G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, that of the Xenopus laevis tRNASecpromoter (xtRNASec) relies on the Staf motif only (8Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Seven contiguous zinc fingers of the C2–H2 type, located in the central part of the protein, contain the Staf DNA binding domain (9Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that not all of the seven zinc fingers are required by Staf for binding to the Staf DNA motifs. In particular, the zinc finger 1 requirement is flexible, because it does contact the DNA at the xtRNASec but not at the hU6 Staf motifs (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The objective of the work described here was to delineate the functional significance of the flexible utilization of zinc finger 1 for the binding of Staf to the hU6 and xtRNASecpromoters. Our results show that this flexibility promotes maximization of transcriptional activation from both promoters. They also indicate that the nonutilization of zinc finger 1 at the hU6 DSE enables the simultaneous binding of Staf and Oct-1 to their cognate DNA motifs. Formation of the resulting ternary complex correlates downstream to maximal transcriptional activity from the human U6 basal promoter. pSK(−)-Staf, pGST-Zf 1–7 and pGST-Zf 2–7 have been described (16Schaub M.

Crude bacterial extracts were prepared from Escherichia coli TG2 strain containing pSK(−)-Staf, essentially as previously described (9Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P.

Probes were prepared as follows. The non-template strand of human U6 (positions −272 to −193) and Xenopus tRNASec (positions −242 to −159) were 5′-end-labeled by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the corresponding gene using distal 32P-labeled primers. For binary complex formation, gel retardation assays were performed in a total volume of 10 μl in the presence of 20 fmol (0.4 × 104 dpm) of labeled DNA fragments and the amount of Oct-1 and Staf required to retard 25 and 50% of the wt probe, respectively. Complexes were formed in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 μmZnCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Other conditions were as described previously (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical cleavage reactions were carried out as described by Hayes and Tullius (19Hayes J.H. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For ternary complex formation, gel retardation assays were performed in a total volume of 11.5 μl in the presence of 20 fmol of hU6 probe, 6 μl of Oct-1 programmed lysate, and the amount of Staf required to retard 90% of the probe. Other conditions were the same as for binary complex formation. X. laevis oocyte nuclei were coinjected with 4 ng of wild-type or mutant template, 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol), and 100 pg of 5 S RNA maxigene as an internal control for oocyte nuclei injection and RNA recovery. Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 3 h (tRNASec gene) or 5 h (U6 snRNA gene). RNA were extracted from batches of 10 oocytes; 1/2 oocyte eq was loaded onto 10% sequencing gels. The relative transcription efficiencies of the Xenopus tRNASec and human U6 genes relative to 5 S RNA maxigene expression were quantitated with a Fuji Bioimage Analyzer BAS 2000. Sequence comparisons of xtRNASec and hU6 Staf binding sites with the consensus sequence derived from binding site selection revealed that the GCG sequence located in the 3′ part of the xtRNASec Staf binding site and in the consensus was not found in the hU6 site (positions 18–20 in Fig.1) (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, we discovered that zinc finger 1 is involved in contacting the DNA at the xtRNASec but not the hU6 promoters (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the flexible utilization of zinc finger 1 had functional significance, the mutant tRNASec and U6 templates shown in Fig. 2, A and B, were constructed. Constructs 1 are the wild-type xtRNASecand hU6 templates from which the others were derived. In construct 2 (Fig. 2 A), the ACCA sequence in the Staf binding site of xtRNASec was replaced by CAAC (mut ACCA). In the hU6 Staf binding site, the CCCA was replaced by AAAC to create mut CCCA (Fig.2 B, construct 2). The GCG sequence located in the 3′ part of xtRNASec DSE was changed to CAT, a sequence naturally found in the hU6 DSE, yielding mut GCG (Fig. 2 A, construct 3). Conversely, the CAT sequence in the hU6 DSE was replaced by the GCG sequence found in the xtRNASec and consensus Staf binding sites (mut CAT, Fig. 2 B, construct 3). The transcriptional capacities of the various constructs were assayed by microinjection into X. laevis oocyte nuclei. Substituting ACCA by CAAC in xtRNASec and CCCA by AAAC in hU6 resulted in a significant reduction of the transcriptional activities of the two promoters. Normalized residual values dropped to 20 and 5% of the wild-type levels for the xtRNASec and hU6 promoters, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, compare lanes 1 and 2). Substitution of the GCG sequence in the xtRNASec Staf element (mut GCG in Fig.2 A) resulted in a marked decrease in template activity to 40% of the wild-type level (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Surprisingly, the mutant hU6 template carrying the GCG sequence (mut CAT in Fig. 2 B), exhibited a 2-fold reduction of template activity relative to the wt template (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that the presence of a GCG sequence at identical locations in tRNASec and U6 DSEs can lead to opposite effects on transcriptional activities, depending on the gene promoter context.Figure 2Structure and template activities of different Xenopus tRNASec and human U6 genes carrying mutations in the DSEs.

The identity of the injected template is indicated above each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that full activation of the hU6 promoter also requires an octamer motif of sequence ATGCAAAT located in the reverse orientation at positions −215 to −222 (Fig. 2 B) and at close proximity to the Staf binding site (15Danzeiser D.A. Urso O. Kunkel G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether the deleterious effect of the CAT to GCG substitution 3′ to the hU6 Staf binding site is linked to the presence of the octamer sequence, we constructed U6 templates in which the octamer was disabled by the double point mutation ATGCAAAT to ATGCACGT either alone (mut oct in Fig.2 B, construct 4) or in combination with the CAT to GCG substitution (mut CAT/oct in Fig.2 B, construct 5). Mutation of the octamer motif resulted in a severe drop of transcriptional efficiency to about 10% of the wt level (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 and 4). Surprisingly, when the octamer motif was mutated in combination with the CAT to GCG substitution, the transcription signal was 4-fold higher than with the octamer motif alone (Fig.2 D, compare lanes 4 and 5). Hence, the CAT to GCG substitution enhances the transcriptional capacity of the hU6 DSE if this mutation is associated with a mutant octamer motif. Finally, another hU6 template was constructed in which the spacing between the octamer motif and the CAT to GCG mutation was incremented by the CTAT 4-bp insertion (mut CAT + I4 in Fig.2 B, construct 6). This template was efficiently transcribed to 85% of the wt level. From these results, it appears that the deleterious effect of the CAT to GCG mutation on hU6 transcription is linked to the presence of the octamer motif adjacent to the Staf binding site. This effect can be partially relieved by disabling the octamer motif or increasing the spacing between the mutated Staf binding site and the octamer sequence. Templates that exhibit a reduced transcriptional activity because of mutations in the Staf binding site and octamer motif would be expected to have a reduced affinity for the binding of Staf and Oct-1, respectively. Therefore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using Staf or Oct-1 and DNA fragments encompassing the DSEs of wild-type and mutant xtRNASec and hU6. As established in a previous work, when the wild-type xtRNASecor hU6 DSEs were incubated with bacterial extracts expressing Staf and then analyzed on polyacrylamide gels, two major (C1, C2) and a minor (C3) binary complexes were obtained (Fig.3, A and B, lanes 2) (9Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The C2 and C3 complexes arose from proteolytic cleavages of Staf that could not be prevented by inclusion of any inhibitor (9Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The C1–C3 complexes are specific because they are competed by an excess of unlabeled Staf consensus binding site (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 3) but not by an excess of mutated xtRNASec Staf binding site (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 4). The addition of preimmune sera had no effects on the C1–C3 complexes (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 6). In contrast, Staf antisera led to the disappearance of complexes C1–C3 and affected to a large extent the intensity of complex C2 (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 5), thus demonstrating that Staf is a component of the retarded complexes. The relative efficiency with which Staf bound to wild-type and mutant versions of the xtRNASec and hU6 DSEs was estimated by comparing the amount of shifted complexes formed with the different probes. Each xtRNASec or hU6 probe was made using the same tRNASec or hU6 labeled primer, ensuring that a family of probes possesses the same specific activity. Thus, comparison of the shifted complexes produced in the presence of a constant amount of Staf represents an easy way to assess the relative efficiency of Staf binding. A 5-fold decrease in the efficiency of Staf binding in each of the complexes was observed with mut GCG xtRNASec (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 2 and 4). As expected, the substitution (mut oct) in the octamer motif of the hU6 DSE was without effect on the efficiency of Staf binding (Fig.3 D, compare lanes 2 and 8). On the contrary, we observed a 2-fold increase in the binding of Staf to the hU6 DSE bearing the CAT to GCG substitution, alone or associated with either the substitution in the octamer motif (mut CAT/oct) or the insertion (mut CAT + I4) between the octamer motif and the mutated Staf binding site (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 2 with lanes 6, 10, and 12). We next examined the binding of Oct-1 to wild-type and mutant versions of the hU6 DSE. When the wild-type hU6 DSE was incubated with in vitro translated Oct-1 and then analyzed on polyacrylamide gels, a major retarded complex was obtained (Fig.4, compare lanes 1 and 2). This complex reflects a specific Oct-1·DNA interaction because an excess of the wt but not of the mutant octamer motif could compete for Oct-1 binding (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4). A complete loss of Oct-1 binding was detected when the mutant versions of the hU6 DSE containing the disabled octamer motif were used as probes (Fig. 4, lanes 10 and 12). As predicted, mutations within the Staf binding site (mut CCCA) as well as the 4-bp insertion between the octamer motif and the mutated Staf binding site (mut CAT + I4) had no effect on the efficiency of Oct-1 binding (Fig. 4, lanes 6, 8, and 14). Regarding xtRNASec whose transcriptional activation depends on the sole Staf motif, no binding of Oct-1 could be detected on wt or mutant xtRNASec DSEs (Fig. 4, lanes 14-18). Significantly, there was a good correlation between transcription levels and the abilities of wild-type and mutant xtRNASecand hU6 templates to be recognized by Staf or Oct-1. However, the increased level of the Staf·DNA binary complex formed on the mut CAT hU6 template does not correlate with the diminution of transcription from this template. To obtain more information on the interaction of Staf with mut GCG xtRNASec and mut CAT hU6 DSEs, missing nucleoside experiments with hydroxyl radicals were performed with the entire or truncated Staf zinc finger domains. For the Staf constructs, we used two recombinant polypeptides containing GST fusions to zinc fingers 1–7 (Zf 1–7) and 2–7 (Zf 2–7). The labeled DNA fragments containing the xtRNASec and hU6 mutant DSEs were subjected to a mild cleavage treatment with hydroxyl radicals so that each DNA fragment was cleaved at no more than one position. The Zf 1–7 and Zf 2–7 proteins were incubated with the modified DNAs and the DNA-bound fragments separated from unbound DNAs by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNAs eluted from regions of the gel containing the bound and free fragments were electrophoresed on a sequencing gel. In such an assay, a nucleoside that is important for forming the DNA-protein complex yields a weak or missing band in the lane containing the DNA that was bound to the protein. Conversely, a high intensity band appears in the lane where the free DNA was applied. The pattern of DNA fragments resulting from these experiments is shown in Fig. 5, A and B. Compilation of the data in comparison with previous results obtained with the wild-type xtRNASec and hU6 DSEs is shown in Fig.5 C; the 21-bp Staf consensus binding site (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) stands as a numbering reference, the base pairs of the xtRNASec and hU6 sites being numbered −1 to 22, starting at the 5′-end of the non-template strand (see Fig. 5 C). Obviously, removal of any nucleoside from positions 1 to 15 (xtRNASec) and −1 to 20 (hU6) on the non-template strand of the mutant DSEs strongly interfered with the binding of Zf 1–7 (Fig. 5). These results are quite different from those obtained with the wild-type tRNASec and hU6 DSEs where the interference pattern in the 3′ part, is extended by 6 nucleosides for the wt xtRNASec site (positions 16–20 and 22) and 5 nucleosides shorter for the wt hU6 site (positions 16–20). Deletion of zinc finger 1 in Zf 2–7 provoked a reduction of the interference pattern of 5 nucleosides on the non-template strand of the mutant hU6 site, and this pattern was identical to that previously observed (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) where Zf 2–7 was added to gapped wild-type hU6 sites (Fig. 5, B and C). In stark contrast, the same zinc finger 1 deletion did not alter the missing nucleoside pattern on the mutant xtRNASec site (Fig. 5, A and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that zinc finger 1 contacts the DNA at the 3′ part of the site in the mutant hU6 DSE bearing a CAT to GCG substitution. Conversely, the GCG to CAT substitution in the xtRNASec DSE results in the loss of binding of zinc finger 1 to the mutated site. Thus, these results strongly suggest that the GCG triplet at positions 18–20 on the non-template strand (or CGC on the opposite strand) of the Staf binding site represents a critical determinant for zinc finger 1 binding. Because maximal hU6 transcriptional activation is strictly dependent on the integrity of the wild-type Staf and Oct-1 binding sites, we asked whether this property reflected the capabilities of Staf and Oct-1 to bind simultaneously to the DNA and form a Staf·Oct-1·DNA ternary complex. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that, as anticipated, Staf and Oct-1 bound separately to the hU6 DSE to form the binary complexes C1–C3 and C4, respectively (Fig. 6, lanes 1-4). These complexes are specific by the same criteria used previously in Figs. 3 and 4 (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and 5). When Staf and Oct-1 were added together, three new complexes of lower electrophoretic mobilities were formed, termed C5–C7 (Fig. 6, lane 6). Complexes C5–C7 are specific because their formations were abrogated by an excess of unlabeled Staf consensus (Fig. 6, lane 7) or Oct-1 (lane 9) binding sites but not by an excess of mutated Staf or Oct-1 binding sites (data not shown). As for C1–C3, complexes C5–C7 result from full-length and truncated Staf polypeptides generated by proteolytic cleavages in the bacterial extracts. Additionally, we could show by competition assays that complexes C5–C7 arose from the formation of a ternary complex between Staf, Oct-1, and the probe. Effectively, competition with an oligonucleotide corresponding to a high affinity Staf binding site resulted in their conversion to the Oct-1 complex C4 (Fig. 6, compare lanes 6 and 7), whereas competition with an excess of an oligonucleotide corresponding to the Oct-1 binding site induced the conversion of complexes C5–C7 to the Staf C1–C3 complexes (Fig. 6, compare lanes 6 and 9). The presence of Staf in these complexes was further demonstrated by the reactions with antisera specific for Staf, leading to the disappearance of complexes C5–C7 (Fig. 6, compare lanes 6 and 8). The assumption that the C5–C7 complexes contain both Staf and Oct-1 was confirmed by using hU6 labeled probes containing point mutations either within the Staf (mut CCCA) or the Oct-1 binding sites (mut oct). Staf failed to interact with the mutant Staf binding site (mut CCCA), whereas Oct-1 could still form the same C4 complex as with the wild-type probe (Fig. 6, lane 11). Conversely, using a probe containing the mut oct binding site, the C1–C3 complexes did form with Staf, but the C4 complex with Oct-1 was not detected (Fig. 6, lane 13). Thus, formation of the slowest migrating complexes requires the intact Staf binding site and octamer motif. Taken together, these results strongly argue that complexes C5–C7 are generated by Staf and Oct-1 binding simultaneously to the hU6 DSE to form a ternary complex. In the presence of the Oct-1-specific competitor DNA, about 90% of the wild-type hU6 probe was found in complexes C1–C3 (Fig. 6, lane 9), whereas about 25% of the probe was found in complex C4 in the presence of the Staf-specific competitor DNA (Fig. 6, lane 7). In an attempt to analyze the fashion with which Staf and Oct-1 bind the DNA, we measured the total intensity in the bands corresponding to complexes C5–C7 (Fig. 6, lane 6) and found 20% of the input probe. If Staf and Oct-1 interact cooperatively with the hU6 DSE, one would expect to find more than 22% (90 × 25%) in the complexes C5–C7 in the absence of any competitor instead of the actual 20%. Conspicuously, this finding implies that Staf and Oct-1 do not cooperate in binding to the hU6 DSE under the assay conditions. We next examined whether the mut CAT, mut CAT/oct, or mut CAT + I4 mutant versions of the hU6 DSE can lead to ternary complex formation. When Oct-1 was mixed with the quantity of Staf allowing formation of the same amount of C1–C3 complexes (as in Fig.7A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), the ternary complex formation was profoundly impaired with mut CAT (Fig. 7 B, compare lanes 2 and 4) but restored with mut CAT + I4 (Fig. 7 B, compare lanes 2 and 6). As expected, no ternary complex was observed with mut CAT/oct containing mut CAT associated with the crippled octamer (Fig. 7 B, compare lanes 2 and 8). In conclusion, these experiments conclusively demonstrate that the acquisition of the zinc finger 1 binding site in the hU6 Staf binding site is strongly inhibitory to the formation of the Staf·Oct-1·DNA ternary complex. A large number of DSEs in vertebrate snRNA-type promoters are composed of the octamer and Staf motifs constituting the binding sites for Oct-1 and Staf, respectively (8Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P.

These factors activate transcription through interactions with the DSE. Staf contains seven contiguous zinc fingers of the C2–H2 type. Such zinc finger motifs have been shown to carry many key functions. They were first recognized as DNA binding motifs. Indeed, structural studies of the Zif 268·DNA complex showed that each of the C2–H2 finger represents a structurally and functionally independent domain contributing to the recognition of three consecutive nucleotides in the DNA major groove (20Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar, 21Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Later, solving the crystal structure of the five zinc finger GLI·DNA complex established that the different zinc fingers can play distinct roles. Zinc finger 1 in the GLI·DNA complex does not contact the DNA, but rather it makes extensive protein-protein interactions with adjacent zinc fingers (22Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Finally, an additional role has been uncovered for C2–H2 zinc fingers in the formation of an intermolecular protein-protein interaction (23Mackey J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we have shown that the alternative binding of Staf zinc finger 1 to DNA profoundly influences the transcription activity of snRNA-type promoters. In fact, binding of this zinc finger to the Xenopus tRNASec promoter maximizes transcriptional activation, whereas in the case of the human U6 snRNA promoter, it is precisely the lack of zinc finger 1 binding that leads to maximization of transcription. Thus, our data suggest that the alternative usage of a same zinc finger motif represents a new critical determinant for the mechanism of transcriptional activation. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing that the same transcription factor can achieve maximization of transcriptional activation, from two different promoter contexts, by the alternative binding of the same zinc finger. Conceivably, this finding introduces a new dimension to the functional versatility of zinc finger motifs. We have found that substitution of the wt hU6 DSE CAT sequence by GCG, or that of the wt xtRNASec DSE GCG sequence by CAT, at the same positions 18–20 on the non-template strand of the Staf binding sites was sufficient to promote the binding of zinc finger 1 to the hU6 DSE or instead to abolish it in the xtRNASec counterpart. In a previous work (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we established that Staf associates more closely with the non-template than with the template strand of the Staf binding site. From this work, it looks as though the GCG triplet is critical to zinc finger 1 binding. With regard to the CAT sequence, binding site selection experiments performed with Staf showed that the selected sequences never contained a CA motif at positions 18–19 (16Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If a CA sequence without being strictly necessary were simply acceptable for the binding of Staf, it would have appeared in the selection, even at a low rate. Obviously, this was not the case. Therefore, we propose that the CA motif in the hU6 DSE CAT sequence is not only unable to bind zinc finger 1 but in all likelihood constitutes a sequence bearing repulsive determinants for binding. The addition of the transcription levels afforded by the human U6 mutant promoters containing either the Staf or the octamer motif yielded a much weaker value than that of the wild-type U6 promoter containing both the Staf and octamer motifs. Obviously, this interesting finding can be interpreted to mean that Staf and Oct-1 act synergistically to activate transcription from the human U6 promoter. The possibility for this synergistic role in transcriptional activation from other snRNA promoters was already predictable from our and other studies (24Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Roebuck K.A. Szeto D.P. Green K.P. Fan Q.N. Stumph W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism has not yet been understood. Nevertheless, bandshift experiments and microinjection assays in this work provided evidence for a role of the Staf·Oct-1·DNA ternary complex in the maximization of hU6 transcriptional activation, suggesting that the synergistic activation is mediated by this complex. Knowing that the nonbinding of zinc finger 1 to DNA is mandatory for formation of the ternary complex, two possibilities can be entertained to explain its formation on the human U6 promoter. In the first one, zinc finger 1 sterically blocks access to the Oct-1 homeodomain at the octamer motif, resulting in an impairment of complex formation and subsequent repression of transcriptional activation. In the second scenario, formation of the Staf·Oct-1·DNA ternary complex involves an interaction between the DNA-unbound zinc finger 1 and Oct-1. However, this second possibility seems improbable because formation of the ternary complex was still obtained with the hU6 mutant DSE containing a 4-bp insertion between the octamer and the Staf motifs and a mutation actually promoting the binding of zinc finger 1 to the DNA. Bandshift experiments attested to the lack of cooperative binding between Staf and Oct-1 to the human U6 DSE. Therefore, if cooperativity of binding is not involved in the synergistic activation, two other possibilities can be invoked to explain this fact: (i) the simultaneous presence of Staf and Oct-1 creates a unique surface for interaction with a coactivator(s) of the basal transcription complex; or (ii) Staf and Oct-1 each interacts with a distinct coactivator or protein surface of the basal transcription complex. However, the case of the Xenopus tRNASec promoter, where the DSE function is mediated only by Staf, suggests that this transcription factor possesses per se the capacity to contact alone, or via a coactivator, the basal transcription complex. In conclusion, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that the Staf zinc finger 1 can influence the binding of another transcription factor, Oct-1, thus unraveling a mechanism by which Staf can modulate transcription levels from snRNA-type promoters.

Truncation of the last 9 C-terminal amino acids, Glu-895 to stop, did not significantly impair functional expression in HeLa or HEK 293 cells. Truncation, however, of 10 amino acids (Leu-894 to stop; mutant C10) reduced Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake to 35–39% relative to the wild type parent exchanger, and further truncation of 13 or more amino acids resulted in expression of trace amounts of transport activity. Western analysis indicated that Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein was produced whether transfection was carried out with functional or non-functional mutants. Immunofluorescence studies of HEK 293 cells expressing N-Flag epitope-tagged wild type and mutant Na+-Ca2+exchangers revealed that transport activity in whole cells correlated with surface expression. All cells expressing the wild type exchanger or C9 exhibited surface expression of the protein. Only 39% of the cells expressing C10 exhibited surface expression, and none was detected in cells transfected with non-functional mutants C13 and C29. Since functional and non-functional mutants were glycosylated, the C terminus is not mandatory to translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Endoglycosidase H digestion of [35S]methionine-labeled protein derived from wild type Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and from C10 indicated that resistance to the digestion was acquired after 1 and 5 h of chase, respectively. C29 did not acquire detectable resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion even after 10 h of chase. Taken together, these results suggest that the “cellular quality control machinery” can tolerate the structural change introduced by truncation of the C terminus up to Ser-893 albeit with reduced rate of ER→Golgi transfer and reduced surface expression of the truncated protein. Further truncation of C-terminal amino acids leads to retention of the truncated protein in the ER, no transfer to the Golgi, and no surface expression.

Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This was supported by microsequencing of the N terminus of the purified bovine heart Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (3Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C.E. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that the first amino acid of the mature protein corresponds to amino acid 33 of the cloned gene. By carrying out a series of deletions between the initiating methionine and Asp-33 (the first amino acid of the mature protein RBE-1), 1RBE-1 stands for rat brain Na+-Ca2+ exchanger-1. The accession number of clone rbe-1 in the EBI/GenBank™ is X68812. The corresponding protein is denoted by uppercase letters. It has been suggested (1Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J.

Throughout this paper, the original name of the isoform was retained. we have shown (4Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol.

Similar results have also been reported in HEK 293 cells (5Loo T.W. Ho C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

We have also shown that the signal peptide truncated protein is glycosylated in vitro when dog pancreatic microsomes are added to a reticulocyte lysate expression system (4Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19120-19127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the nascent protein translocates into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)2 also in the absence of its signal peptide. To explore further the involvement of different domains of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in its functional expression, we have examined the role of its C terminus. To do so we have sequentially truncated 9–29 of its 903 amino acids, starting with mutant C9 (see Table I) in which the putative extramembraneous tail of the protein was missing. Our results show that functional expression is severely impaired when 11 or more amino acids are truncated from the exchanger's C terminus. Immunoreactive protein derived from the non-functional mutants translocates to the lumen of the ER, where it is glycosylated. However, unlike the wild type exchanger protein, it does not proceed further to the Golgi and is not expressed in the surface membrane.Table IThe amino acid sequence of the C-terminal truncated mutants derived from the rat brain Na+-Ca2+ exchanger RBE-1Amino acid sequenceName875 894 903AKLLTSSLFVLLWLLYIFFSSL EAYCHIKGFRBE-1AKLLTSSLFVLLWLLYIFFSSLC9AKLLTSSLFVLLWLLYIFFSSC10AKLLTSSLFVLLWLLYIFFSC11AKLLTSSLFVLLWLLYIFC13AKLLTSSLFVLLWLC17AKC29The amino acid sequence of the C terminus of the rat brain Na+-Ca2+ exchanger RBE-1 (4,8), amino acids 873–903, is shown in the table.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was used to prepare C-terminal truncated mutants of the rat brain clone rbe-1 (8Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The antisense primers were planned to be composed at least 15 bases upstream and downstream from the point of the desired mutation. The following primers were used (5′ → 3′): C9, CTTGATTGTTCCTTTACAGGGAGGAGAAGAA; C10, CTTGATTGTTCCTTTAGGAGGAGAAGAAAATG; C11, CTTGATTGTTCCTTTAGGAGAAGAAAATGTAC; C13, CTTGATTGTTCCTTTAGAAAATGTACAAGAGCC; C17, CTTGATTGTTCCTTTAGAGCCACAGGAGCAC; C29, ATCTTGATTGTTCCTTTACTTGGCAGTCCGGGG. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing 300–600 bases upstream and downstream of the mutation. To ensure that no other mutation beyond the planned occurred, Bgl II-Sac I fragments containing the desired mutation were subcloned into Bgl II-Sac I-digested parent clone rbe-1. Subcloning into pcDNA3 involved preparation of Hin dIII-digested arms of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) into which Hin dIII-digested clone rhe-1 (9Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was ligated. Orientation was ensured by identification of appropriate restriction fragments. This construct was digested with Eco 47III-Age I and ligated with Eco 47III-Age I-digested rbe-1. C-terminal truncated mutants in pBluescript were excised with Hin dIII and Not I and ligated to Hin dIII-Not I-digested arms derived from in pcDNA3. This strategy ensured that both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of all the mutants were identical. Insertion of the Flag epitope into the N terminus of the cloned rat brain Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (in pBluescript) after Gly-8 has been described (10Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From this construct the cloned gene was excised with Kpn I-Not I and ligated with Kpn I-Not I-digested pcDNA3. This clone was digested with Age I-Not I and ligated with the insert derived from Age I-Not I-digested C-terminal truncated mutants. The Qiagen Midi plasmid preparation kit was used to prepare plasmid DNA. HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were transfected by the CaPi (11Sambrock J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) method. 10 μg of plasmid DNA was used to transfect about 0.8 × 106cells. Transfection of HeLa cells was done as described (4Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 12-well or 60-mm dishes. 48 h after transfection, intracellular Na+ was raised in the cells by 10-min incubation at 37 °C with 0.16m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02m MgCl2, 25 μm nystatin, and 1 mm ouabain. The cells were washed with the same solution but without nystatin and MgCl2.45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by overlaying the cells for the time specified in each experiment with 0.16 mKCl or 0.16 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 μm45CaCl2, and 1 mmouabain. The Na+-independent component of the45Ca2+ flux (external NaCl solution) was subtracted from the 45Ca2+ taken up by the cells in the presence of a driving Na+ gradient (external KCl). Transport was terminated by two washes with 0.16 mKCl and 1 mm EGTA at 4 °C, after which the cells were solubilized with 0.3 m NaOH and neutralized with 0.2m KH2HPO4 and their45Ca2+ content was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, the Na+-preloaded cells were collected by centrifugation, and suspended in a minimal volume of the Na+ preloading solution (without nystatin and MgCl2,). Part of these cells was used to determine Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake, part for protein determination, and part for Western analysis. Transport was determined by suspending 1.6 μl of cells (about 50 μg of protein) into 50 μl of either 0.16m NaCl or 0.16 m KCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 μm45CaCl2, and 1 mm ouabain. Reactions were terminated by filtration through Schleicher & Schuell BA-85 0.45-μm filters, and their45Ca2+ content was determined. Mutants were always tested in parallel with the parent wild type clone. Each transport measurement was done in triplicate. Determination of Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake was carried out exactly as described previously (4Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol.

Quantitative analysis of the protein profile was carried out with the Fujix Bas 1000 phosphorimager using the Tina 2.07 analysis program. 42 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were washed twice with methionine-free DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and kept with the same solution for 2 h in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Labeling of cell proteins was carried out by replacing the medium with fresh methionine-free DMEM to which 6 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml of medium was added. Unless stated otherwise, labeling was carried out for 45 min. The chase was started by aspiration of the [35S]methionine-containing medium, followed by three washes with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubation in fresh DMEM to which 10% fetal calf serum and 0.2 mg/ml methionine were added for the times specified. The cells were washed twice rapidly in 2 ml of PBS at 4 °C and dissolved in a minimal volume of RIPA (0.15m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.001 mm EDTA), to which 100 μg/ml PMSF was added (12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The cells were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 19,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the solubilized cell extract was used for immunoprecipitation. Tunicamycin at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml was added to the methionine-free starvation medium and to the [35S]methionine labeling medium for 120 min. The cells were washed twice rapidly with 2 ml of PBS at 4 °C and dissolved in a minimal volume of RIPA containing PMSF, after which they were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 19,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the solubilized cell extract was used for immunoprecipitation. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) loaded with purified antiserum overnight at 4 °C by gentle shaking were used to immunoprecipitate the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein. For cell extract obtained from a confluent 60-mm culture dish, 30 mg of Protein A-Sepharose beads and 30 μl of antiserum were used. The antibody-loaded beads were washed once in RIPA and incubated with the RIPA cell extract overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were pelleted, washed four times with 1 ml of RIPA, and washed once with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.001 m EDTA. The proteins were eluted from the beads with 10× Laemmli sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Endoglycosidase Hf(recombinant) was purchased from New England Biolabs. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 5% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, after which the concentrations of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were reduced to 1% and 0.5%, respectively. Digestion with the enzyme was carried out as specified by the manufacturer. NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce 21331) was used to biotinylate surface membrane proteins of transfected HEK 293 cells in situ as described in Ref. 13Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. rbe-1- or C29- transfected cells grown in 6- or 12-well plates were used to determine the surface expression by biotinylation in situ. After solubilization the entire contents of the well were loaded on streptavidin beads. The amount of NH-SS-Biotin and streptavidin needed to capture the biotinylated proteins was precalibrated by varying their amounts relative to RBE-1-transfected cells. At the end of the biotinylation reaction, excess reagent was quenched with PBS, which also contained 0.1 mmCaCl2 , 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine. The cells were lysed with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.1 mmPMSF, 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), and 0.02 mm leupeptin (Sigma). SDS concentration was lowered by a 10-fold dilution of the lysate with the same solution but without SDS. The lysate was loaded on ImmunoPure streptavidin beads (Pierce 20349), and was gently shaken overnight at 4 °C. The biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by heating 10 min at 85 °C with Laemmli sample buffer, and Western analysis was carried out as described above. Indirect immunofluorescence of N-terminal Flag-tagged wild type and mutated Na+-Ca2+ exchangers expressed in HEK 293 cells was carried out as described for HeLa cells in Ref. 10Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Nuclei were stained in 1 μg/ml Hoechst (bisbenzimide, Sigma). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using epifluorescence optics (ZeissAxioscope) or confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 410 system) attached to the Zeiss Axiovert 135M inverted microscope. The system was equipped with a 25-milliwatt air-cooled argon laser (488-nm excitation line with a 515-nm long pass barrier filter) for the excitation of green (fluorescein isothiocyanate) fluorescence. Blue fluorescence was excited with 364-nm line UV laser with LP 397 barrier filter. Double-labeled specimens were excited with both laser lines and monitored simultaneously using dual detectors and the Zeiss-supplied filter block combination with dichroic beam splitter and emission filters. The fluorescence was collected by employing a 63×/1.2 C-Achromat water immersion lens (Zeiss). Autofluorescence of the specimens was set to background level. To reduce the visual noise, each confocal optical section was performed in the fast line-scan acquisition mode (512 pixels/line) by averaging of 8 images, before the final image was produced on the monitor. Images simultaneously scanned on the two channels were automatically merged to produce false single multicolor profile. The image analysis of the confocal images including pseudo color representation, brightness, and contrast level were carried out using the standard Zeiss software package and the Adobe Photoshop 4.0 program (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA).

Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and an extramembraneous tail. To examine the role of this protein segment in functional expression, sequential deletions starting with the last 9 amino acids, Glu-895 to stop (mutant C9), and ending with Leu-875 to stop (mutant C29) were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Truncation of the last 9 C-terminal amino acids (C9) impaired only slightly functional expression (Fig. 1, A or B) of the cloned exchanger. Its transport activity in HeLa cells was 96.87% (S.D. = 11.37) and in HEK 293 cells 82.8% (S.D. = 15) when compared with that of the wild type exchanger RBE-1 (100%). Further truncation, however, of a single amino acid (mutant C10) resulted in a sharp decrease in transport activity, to about 35–39%, relative to that of the wild type exchanger. Truncation beyond the last 11 amino acids resulted in expression of trace amounts of transport activity. The reduced transport activity of the C-terminal truncated mutants did not depend on mode of transfection, cell line, or the plasmid used for expression. In Fig. 1 A, transport activity was determined in the DOTAP-mediated transfection of VTF-7-infected HeLa cell expression system, using pBluescript (Stratagene) as the cloning vector. In Fig. 1 B, the transport activity was measured in CaPi-mediated transfection of HEK 293 cells using pcDNA3 as the cloning vector. Similar results to those shown in Fig. 1 were obtained when proteins derived from HeLa or HEK 293 cells transfected with RBE-1 or its C-terminal truncated mutants were reconstituted into exogenous brain phospholipids. Table II shows the relative transport activities of proteins derived from HeLa and HEK 293 cells transfected with the parent Na+-Ca2+exchanger (taken in each experiment as 100%) and that of each of its C-terminal truncated mutants (presented in relative values). It can be seen that reconstitution did not rescue the Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake of the C-terminal truncated mutants, although following reconstitution the transport activity of C13 and C29 expressed in HEK 293 cells was somewhat higher than in HeLa cells and than in whole cells. Moreover, the relative transport activities of C9 and C10 were lower than in whole cells.Table IITransfected HeLa and HEK 293 cell proteins were reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each experiment the numerical value of the Na+-dependent Ca2+uptake of the wild type exchanger RBE-1 was taken as 100%, and that of the C-terminal truncated mutants that were expressed in parallel is presented in relative values. The data are compiled from three separate transfection experiments.NameRelative Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptakeHeLa cellsHEK 293 cells%RBE-1100100C949.3338.2C1020.031.4C132.119.4C292.17.2 Open table in a new tab To examine whether the decrease in transport activity of the C-terminal truncated mutants resulted from impaired Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein synthesis, Western analysis was carried out. Fig. 2 shows that similar amounts of immunoreactive exchanger protein were detected whether HeLa or HEK 293 cells were transfected with wild type DNA or with any of the C-terminal truncated mutant DNAs. To study the cellular distribution of immunoreactive Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein, the Flag epitope was inserted into the extracellular N terminus (10Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of the wild type and C-terminal truncated clones. The transport activity of the N-Flag-tagged (FN) exchangers was similar to that of the corresponding parent clones (not shown). Fig. 3 shows the immunofluorescence detected in HEK293 cells expressing FN-RBE-1 (Fig. 3 A), FN-C10 (Fig. 3 B), and FN-C29 (Fig. 3 C). It can be seen that only in FN-RBE-1- and in FN-C10-expressing cells is immunofluorescence detected without permeabilizing the cells (panels 1 and 2 of Fig. 3, A and B). No such staining is detected in FN-C29-expressing cells (panels 1 and 2, Fig. 3 C). When, however, cells were permeabilized, fluorescence was detected not only in RBE-1- and C10-expressing cells (panels 3 and 4 of Fig. 3, A and B), but also in C29-expressing cells (panels 3 and 4, Fig.3 C). Studies with FN-C9-expressing cells were similar to those with FN-RBE-1-expressing ones and with FN-C13-expressing cells were similar to those with C29-expressing cells (data not shown). These experiments suggest that only in cells expressing the parent exchanger RBE-1, C9, or its partially functional mutant C10 is the transporter in the surface membrane. Moreover, in RBE-1-expressing cells and in C9, similar numbers of cells were stained without and with permeabilization, whereas, in C10-expressing cells, considerably fewer cells stain in the absence of permeabilization than in its presence. Counting 10 different fields from each of three separate transfection experiments revealed that 23.33% (S.D. = 5.49) and 23.4% (S.D. = 3.32) of RBE-1-expressing HEK 293 cells light up without and with permeabilization, respectively, and 18.81% (S.D. = 2.71) and 17.43% (S.D. = 3.72) of the cells expressing C9. Hence, practically all the cells that express RBE-1 and C9 exhibit surface expression. When the counting is carried out with C10-expressing cells, 9% (S.D. = 2.8) of the cells light up without permeabilization and 23.16% (S.D. = 5.87) light up with permeabilization. This suggests that, unlike in rbe-1- and C9- transfected cells, in only 39% of the C10-expressing cells can the exchanger protein be detected in the plasma membrane. In C29 (or C13)-expressing cells, no immunoreactive protein is detectable in the plasma membrane. Permeabilization reveals that 17.31% (S.D. = 4.5) of the FN-C29-transfected cells express the protein. The results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence of non-permeabilized cells are consistent with the expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity in whole cells as shown in Fig. 1. We have also tested the possibility that surface expression of N-Flag-tagged C29 was not detected since its topology was “scrambled” and its N-Flag-tagged N terminus projected into the cytoplasm rather than outside the cell. Were this the case, the epitope would not be accessible to the externally added antibody and immunoreactive C29 exchanger protein in the surface membrane would not be detected. We chose, therefore, an alternative method to test the surface expression of C29, by using the impermeant reagent NHS-SS-biotin (13Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to covalently modify the amino residues in the surface membrane of transfected HEK 293 cells. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger RBE-1 contains 46 lysine residues and C29 contains 45 lysines. Based on experimental evidence (10Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and topological analysis (16Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 4 lysine residues are modeled to face the cell exterior. In addition, 2 lysines derived from the Flag epitope are external as well (10Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All other lysines, except 2 that are intramembraneous, face the cell interior. Hence, even if the topology of C29 is “scrambled” but the mutant protein is present in the plasma membrane, some of the lysines should be accessible to the biotinylating reagent. Fig. 4 shows an immunoblot of the biotinylated cell proteins and total cell proteins derived from rbe-1- and C29-transfected cells. Quantitative analysis indicates that in this experiment a 3-fold higher amount of total immunoreactive C29 was expressed than in parallel RBE-1-expressing cells. Biotinylated Na+-Ca2+exchanger protein, however, is detected only in the surface of cells expressing the parent exchanger RBE-"

In addition, the chimeras were transiently expressed at the cell surface and rapidly internalized to the Golgi region in a fashion similar to PAM. Membrane-tethered PC1 and PC2 exhibited changes in pro-domain maturation rates, N- glycosylation, and in the pH and calcium optima required for maximal enzymatic activity against a fluorogenic substrate. In addition, the PC chimeras efficiently cleaved endogenous pro-opiomelanocortin to the correct bioactive peptides.

The PCs have highly conserved catalytic domains consisting of catalytically essential Asp, His, and Ser residues (Fig. 1, D, H, and S).

Although all members of the PC family show a requirement for calcium and cleave following basic amino acids, they differ in the presence or absence of a TMD as discussed above. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses indicate that PC8, which contains a TMD, is the primordial mammalian PC (20Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 54Siezen R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 379: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that loss of the TMD in other members of this family of enzymes occurred later in evolution. It is known that removal of the TMD domain of furin results in a soluble active form of furin (22Vidricaire G. Denault J.B. Leduc R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but this is not true for all enzymes. For example, missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of the Lewis enzyme, an α(1,3/1,4)-fucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of type-1 Lewis antigens, leads to decreased Golgi retention and reduced enzymatic activity (55Nishihara S. Hiraga T. Ikehara Y. Kudo T. Iwasaki H. Morozumi K. Akamatsu S. Tachikawa T. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, peptidylglycine-α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (one of the two catalytically active domains of PAM) is more active when expressed as a soluble enzyme than in its membrane-bound form (56Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the differences between the membrane-bound and soluble PCs, we asked what effects the addition of a TMD has on the biosynthesis and enzymatic activity of normally soluble PC1 and PC2. PC1 and PC2 were expressed as integral membrane proteins by fusing the C-terminal TMD and CD of PAM in-frame with each PC (Fig. 1). The TMD/CD of integral membrane PAM is a suitable candidate to address this question since PAM is expressed in the same compartments as the soluble PCs and the intracellular routing of PAM has been well characterized. We expressed the PC chimeras in endocrine (AtT-20) and non-endocrine (HEK-293) cells and examined whether PC1 and PC2 were enzymatically active as membrane-bound enzymes. The effects of the PAM TMD/CD on the intracellular localization, routing, protease activation, and substrate specificity of PC1 and PC2 were also examined. The mammalian expression vector pCI.neo (Promega) was used to generate expression constructs for membrane-tethered versions of PC1 and PC2. A Myc epitope tag (MEQKLISEEDLNG), followed by 5 glycine residues, was inserted C-terminal to the PCs (57Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The resulting PC1 and PC2 chimeras were termed PC1-Myc-CD and PC2-Myc-CD, respectively. To create PC2-Myc-CD, full-length PC2 was fused in-frame to the Myc epitope tag plus the Gly5 linker followed by the terminal 116 amino acid residues of PAM-1 (53Milgram S.L. Chang E.Y. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 837-846PubMed Google Scholar). This region of PAM-1 consisted of 9 lumenal residues followed by the TMD and CD. The PC1-Myc-CD chimera was created using rat PC1 C-terminally truncated at residue 616 (PC1ΔC) (Fig. 1) to reduce the possibility of endoproteolytic cleavage between PC1 and the C-terminal tag during protein maturation (35Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a control for the effects of the Myc tag on the rerouting of the PC chimeras, a construct encoding only the signal peptide (residues 1–26) and the N-terminal pro-region of PAM (residues 27–50) was fused in-frame directly to the Myc tag followed by the Gly5spacer and the TMD/CD of PAM-1. This construct was termed Myc-TMD/CD (Fig. 1). Two additional TMD/CD constructs were also examined as controls. The first construct contained only the pre- and pro-domains of PAM (terminating at amino acid 35), followed by a Myc tag and the TMD/CD of PAM. The second expression construct also used the pro-domain of PAM but contained the hemagglutinin epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) (58Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) instead of the Myc tag. All expression constructs were transfected into mouse pituitary (AtT-20) and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells. Stable cell lines were selected by resistance to G418 (0.5 mg/ml), and subclones expressing high levels of the desired protein (as determined by immunostaining) were maintained in 0.1 mg/ml G418. As controls, AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 or sense PC2 (sPC2) were used as well as HEK-293 cells expressing soluble PC1 (sPC1) (8Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

All cell lines were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against rPAM-1-(898–976) (antibody 571) and rPAM-1-(463–864) (antibody 471) were used to detect the cytoplasmic domain (CD) and peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL) domains of PAM, respectively (60Yun H.Y.

(Burlingame, CA). Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL). For antibody internalization assays, cells were washed and pre-equilibrated in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation in CSFM containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antiserum against PC1 (1:50), PC2 (1:50), or Myc (1:5) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed, chased for a further 60 min at 37 °C in CSFM containing 2 mg/ml BSA, fixed and immunostained as described (48Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J.

Proteins detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies were visualized using Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAR-Cy3) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and proteins detected using mouse monoclonal antisera were visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed under epifluorescence optics with an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, MT) and photographed under identical conditions using a Princeton Instruments Micromax digital camera. Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were washed with an isotonic solution containing 4.5 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.7 mmNa2PO4, and 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and resuspended in a hypotonic solution of 20 mm NaTES (pH 7.4), 10 mm mannitol containing protease inhibitors (10 μm E-64, 10 μm pepstatin A, 100 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (63Lindberg I. van den Hurk W.H.

The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 435,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the particulate fraction (pellet) and remaining soluble fraction (supernatant). The particulate fraction was resuspended in 20 mm NaTES (pH 7.4), 10 mm mannitol containing protease inhibitors or was treated with 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 11.5) to remove peripheral membrane proteins (65Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The carbonate-treated fractions were homogenized using a hand-held homogenizer, kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 435,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant soluble fraction was neutralized by addition of one-tenth volume of 2 mNaTES, whereas the carbonate-washed membranes were resuspended and homogenized in 10 mm NaTES, pH 7.5.

https://openalex.org/W2038078500,"The Drosophila insulin receptor (INR) homolog includes an extension of approximately 400 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of its β subunit containing several tyrosine-based motifs known to mediate interactions with signaling proteins. In order to explore the role of this extension in INR function, mammalian expression vectors encoding either the complete INR β subunit (β-Myc) or the INR β subunit without the carboxyl-terminal extension (βΔ) were constructed, and the membrane-bound β subunits were expressed in 293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in the absence of the ligand-binding α subunits. β-Myc and βΔ proteins were constitutively active tyrosine kinases of 180 and 102 kDa, respectively. INR β-Myc co-immunoprecipitated a phosphoprotein of 170 kDa identified as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), whereas INR βΔ did not, suggesting that the site of interaction was within the carboxyl-terminal extension. IRS-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine to a much greater extent in cells expressing INR β-Myc than in parental or INR βΔ cells. Despite this, a variety of PTB or SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins, including IRS-2, mSos-1, Shc, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP-2, Raf-1, and JAK2, were not associated with the INR β-Myc·IRS-1 complex. Overexpression of INR β-Myc and βΔ kinases conferred an equivalent increase in cell proliferation in both 293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating that this growth response is independent of the carboxyl-terminal extension. However, INR β-Myc-expressing cells exhibited enhanced survival relative to parental and βΔ cells, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal extension, through its interaction with IRS-1, plays a role in the regulation of cell death.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) indicate that the INR β subunit is larger than its mammalian homolog and exhibits an apparent molecular mass of ∼180 kDa. The increased mass is due to the presence of a 400-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension (2Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the majority of INR β subunits are processed to 92/102-kDa forms in Drosophila embyros and some cell lines, the difference being due to proteolytic cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal extension (5Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Marin-Hincapie M. Garofalo R.S.

Both truncated and full-length β subunits are autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to insulin binding (1Fernandez-Almonacid R. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell.

The 400-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension of the β INR contains clusters of motifs known to be involved in the interaction with SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins (2Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this domain in signaling through interaction with other signaling molecules. Interestingly, four tyrosines are found in “hybrid” amino acid motifs in which residues amino-terminal to each tyrosine form the motif NP X Y, resembling known PTB domain binding sites, and residues carboxyl-terminal to the same tyrosines form the motifs Y XX M, YM X M, or Y X LLD, known to be involved in binding to SH2 domains (7Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosines 1993 and 2030 appear in the motif S X NP X Y XX M , tyrosine 2009 is part of S X NP X YM X M, and tyrosine 1969 appears in the sequence SDNP X YRLLD (2Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whether these motifs serve to bind SH2 or PTB domain-containing proteins upon tyrosine phosphorylation and whether one is preferred over the other is not clear. The cytoplasmic domain of the INR expressed in cells lacking IRS-1 has been shown to bind PI3-kinase (8Yenush L. Fernandez R. Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H.

However, a similar construct expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that contain IRS-1 failed to do so (4Yamaguchi T. Fernandez R. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4962-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since a significant percentage of the INR β subunit undergoes tissue- or stage-specific proteolytic processing in Drosophila embryos to remove the carboxyl-terminal extension (6Marin-Hincapie M. Garofalo R.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and once it is removed it appears not to be phosphorylated (5Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), its role in signal transduction by the INR is not clear. Therefore, the signaling capacity conferred by the β INR carboxyl-terminal extension was explored in the following studies by expressing either full-length or truncated INR β subunit forms in mammalian cells and determining the effect on protein-protein interactions and cell growth.

Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine Abs PY20 and horseradish peroxidase-PY20 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, and Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY, respectively. For in vitro autophosphorylation, 293 or MDCK cells and transiently or stably transfected 293 or MDCK β-Myc and 293 βΔ cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6; 1% Triton X-100; 5 mm EDTA; 2.5 mm EGTA; 150 mm NaCl; 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 25 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) per 100-mm dish for 1 h at 4 °C and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. Solubilized membranes, prepared as described previously (14Garofalo R.S. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2806-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), or total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies (1:100 dilution) and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin in autophosphorylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8; 2.5 mm MnCl2) for 1 h at 4 °C. Autophosphorylation was carried out in the immune complex by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (20 μm final, 20 μCi/nmol). Reactions were terminated as described previously (14Garofalo R.S. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2806-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of sodium orthovanadate was increased to 100 μm in the autophosphorylation reaction and 800 μm in the stop mix. Autophosphorylated receptors were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6.0–6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. For whole cell experiments, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate at 37 °C and 5% CO2for 4–6 h, followed by incubation in HEPES/saline (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.8; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with or without 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were lysed as described above, and after immunoprecipitation with the indicated Abs, proteins were separated on 6.0–6.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting (see below). After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose (16Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar), membranes were incubated with the primary Ab for 1 h at 22 °C followed by horseradish peroxidase-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for polyclonal primary Abs and goat anti-mouse Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in the case of monoclonal Abs. When blots were probed with the horseradish peroxidase-PY20 Ab, the use of a secondary Ab was not necessary. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was utilized for detection. As a first step in the construction of a plasmid to express the β subunit of INR, a signal sequence was added to the β subunit amino terminus to direct it to the membrane.

Cell. 1991; 64: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were annealed, and a fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase was used to synthesize the double-stranded, 124-base pair-long DNA fragment. This was subcloned into the plasmid p19-β, after Eco RI and Xho I digestions. p19-β contains the cDNA sequence encoding the β subunit of the INR (nucleotides 3277–6447, according to Ref. 2Ruan Y.

The new construct termed p19 β-myc, was digested with Eco RI and Pvu II, and the resulting DNA fragment containing the complete INR β subunit and its new signal sequence was cloned into the vector pcDNA3 at the Eco RI and Eco RV sites to form pc3-β-myc. To construct a plasmid that lacked the 1143 carboxyl-terminal nucleotides of the INR β subunit, the plasmid p19-β-myc was digested with Eco RI and Ssp I. The 2151-base pair-long DNA fragment (nucleotides 3277–5304, according to Ref. 2Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol.

Transient transfections were performed with LipofectACE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and stable transfections with Lipofectin reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 14 μg of DNA in 34 μl of the liposome reagent. For transient transfection, cells were grown for 60–65 h after DNA addition. Total cell lysates or crude membranes were prepared, and the presence of endogenous insulin receptors and transfected β-INR was demonstrated by autophosphorylation, in the presence or absence of insulin, following immunoprecipitation of receptors with Abs P5, dp1040, and 9E10. Stable transfectants were grown for 65 h after transfection before adding selective agent. Neomycin-resistant colonies were selected using 200 μg/ml geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in DMEM. Total cell death was achieved in 7 days in nontransfected cells used as controls. Single cell-derived clones were picked, grown, and tested for the expression of β INR by autophosphorylation reactions. 5 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes in their respective growth medium. Cell number was measured at the indicated times from 0 h to 4 weeks after seeding, using the Cell Titer 96AQueous kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 490 nm was read in a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad). Deletion of the α subunit of mammalian insulin receptors leads to the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the β subunit (19Lebwohl D.E. Nunez I. Chan M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 386-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shoelson S.E. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4852-4860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural homology between the mammalian and Drosophila insulin receptors suggested that the INR would be similarly activated by removal of its α subunit. Therefore, in order to express constitutively activated receptors to explore the role of the 400-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension in INR function, expression vectors encoding either the complete β subunit (amino acids 1093–2148, pc3-β-myc) or the β subunit without the carboxyl-terminal extension (amino acids 1093–1768, pc3-βΔ) were constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). pc3-β-myc encodes the complete INR β subunit preceded by a Drosophila signal sequence and an epitope tag recognized by a c-Myc antibody (9E-10) (Fig. 1). pc3-βΔ is derived from pc3-β-myc by deletion of the sequence encoding 380 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal extension (1769–2148) (Fig. 1). 293 and MDCK cells were transiently and stably transfected with these recombinants giving rise to 293 β-Myc and 293 βΔ cells, MDCK β-Myc and MDCK βΔ cells, respectively. Consistent with the finding that the INR β subunit is longer than that of the HIR (1058 versus 619 amino acids) (2Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), in autophosphorylation experiments Ab dp1040 and monoclonal Ab 9E10 immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins of 170 and 180 kDa from total cell lysates of 293 β-Myc cells (Fig. 2 lanes 5 and 7, arrowheads). The same Abs immunoprecipitated a phosphoprotein of 102 kDa from lysates of the 293 βΔ cells (lanes 8–10, arrow). Immunoprecipitation of β-Myc and βΔ with Ab dp1040 was blocked by an excess of peptide dp1040 (lanes 6 and 9). From 293 cell lysates Ab P-5 immunoprecipitated the 97- and 102-kDa β subunits of the endogenous human insulin or hybrid insulin/IGF-1 receptors, which were autophosphorylated in an insulin-dependent manner (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated proteins from both transfected cell lines was independent of insulin. Neither of the endogenous human proteins were immunoprecipitated by Abs dp1040 or 9E10 from lysates of 293 cells (lanes 3 and 4) nor from lysates of cells transfected with only the vector, pcDNA3 (293 pc3) (data not shown). The same results were obtained when MDCK β-Myc and MDCK βΔ cells were tested for the presence of the INR proteins (data not shown). In order to determine if the 170- and 180-kDa bands in Ab dp1040 immunoprecipitates from 293 β-Myc cells represent different forms of β INR or distinct proteins, immunoblotting assays of proteins immunoprecipitated with Abs dp1040 and 9E10 from total lysates of 293, 293 pc3, 293 β-Myc, and 293 βΔ cells were performed (Fig.3 A). In contrast to the results obtained in autophosphorylation experiments (Fig. 2), Ab dp1040 directly recognized only one protein of 180 kDa in immunoprecipitates from 293 β-Myc lysates (lanes 5, 6, and 8, upper arrow). Immunoprecipitation of this protein was blocked when carried out in the presence of an excess of peptide dp1040 (lane 7), indicating that it corresponds to the INR β subunit. In samples from the 293 βΔ cells, Ab dp1040 recognized the 102-kDa βΔ INR (lanes 9, 10, and 12, lower arrow), and immunoprecipitation of this protein was also blocked by an excess of peptide dp1040 (lane 11). As expected, Ab dp1040 did not recognize any protein in 293 (lanes 1–4) and 293 pc3 cell lysates (data not shown). Thus, Abs dp1040 and 9E10 immunoprecipitate two phosphoproteins of 170- and 180-kDa from 293 β-Myc lysates (Fig. 2), yet only one, the 180-kDa protein, is directly recognized by Ab dp1040 (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, when autophosphorylation and immunoprecipitation with Abs dp1040 and 9E10 were carried out utilizing solubilized membrane proteins rather than total cell lysates of 293 β-Myc cells, only one protein of 180 kDa was detected (Fig. 3 B, arrow). This suggests that the 170-kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitates with the INR β subunit from total cell lysates is a cytoplasmic or peripheral membrane protein, and its interaction with the INR β subunit is not stable enough to persist during the membrane preparation process. The above experiments indicate that the 170-kDa protein is immunologically distinct from β INR, co-immunoprecipitates with it, and is phosphorylated in vitro. To examine if the 170-kDa protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the INR kinase in intact cells, 293 β-Myc cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated with Ab dp1040 without in vitro autophosphorylation. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4) with Abs PY20 (lane 1) and dp1040 (lane 2). Anti-phosphotyrosine Ab PY20 reacted with both 170- and 180-kDa proteins in immunoblots (Fig. 4 A, lane 1, arrowheads), whereas Ab dp1040 recognized only the β subunit of the INR (lane 2, arrowhead). The same results were obtained when the protein phosphorylation reaction was performed in vitro (Fig. 4 B). In this case, proteins from 293 β-Myc total cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with Ab dp1040, and then protein phosphorylation was performed in the presence of unlabeled ATP for 10 min. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in 293 β-Myc cells a cytoplasmic protein of 170 kDa, distinct from the INR β subunit, associates with the β subunit and is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The inability of this interaction to withstand the process of membrane preparation suggests that it is not covalent. IRS-1, a major substrate of HIR, is a cytoplasmic protein that migrates in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 160–190 kDa (21Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Arki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). If the 170-kDa phosphoprotein that binds directly to the INR β subunit is IRS-1, then INR β subunits should be recovered in samples immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1 Abs. αIRS-1 immunoprecipitates from total cell lysates of 293, 293 pc3, and 293 β-Myc cells were probed with the αIRS-1 Ab (Fig. 5 A), and similar amounts of 170-kDa IRS-1 were recovered in all cases (Fig. 5 A, arrow). The same nitrocellulose membrane was then stripped of bound Abs and reprobed consecutively with Abs PY20 and dp1040. The anti-phosphotyrosine Ab recognized phosphorylated IRS-1 in the cell lysates of insulin-treated 293 cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 2, arrow), but the phosphorylated endogenous receptors were not observed, indicating that they do not co-immunoprecipitate with IRS-1. The same Ab recognized a broad band from 293 β-Myc cells that contains two phosphoproteins, one co-migrating with IRS-1 (Fig.5 B, lane 4, arrow), and one larger protein of ∼180 kDa (Fig. 5 B, lane 4, arrowhead). IRS-1 was not phosphorylated in either untreated 293 cells or in 293 pc3 cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 3). Reprobing the membrane with Ab dp 1040 identified the higher molecular weight phosphoprotein in the 293 β-Myc immunoprecipitates as the INR β subunit (Fig. 5 C, arrowhead), indicating that IRS-1 associates directly with the full-length INR β subunit. A 170-kDa protein is not detected in Ab dp1040 immunoprecipitates from βΔ cell lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 8–10). This result was confirmed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of total cell lysates immunoprecipitated with Abs dp1040 and 9E10 and phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 6 A). No phosphoprotein of 170 kDa was recovered along with the 102-kDa βΔ INR (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1, 2, and 4) whether or not insulin was present. Similarly, when phosphoproteins in Ab dp1040 immunoprecipitates from intact cells were examined, only the βΔ INR was observed in immunoblots probed with Ab PY20 (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). In order to determine the phosphorylation state of IRS-1 in 293 βΔ cells, total cell lysates from 293 β-Myc and 293 βΔ cells were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1 Ab. Immunoblotting with αIRS-1 and PY20 Abs was used to assess the amount of IRS-1 and its state of phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 7). A similar amount of IRS-1 was present in both 293 β-Myc and 293 βΔ cell lysates (Fig. 7 B). However, IRS-1 in 293 βΔ cells was phosphorylated to a much lower extent than in 293 β-Myc cells (Fig. 7 A). Thus, despite the presence of constitutively activated INR β subunit kinases in 293 β-Myc and 293 βΔ cell lines, increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 and association with the INR β subunit was only observed in 293 β-Myc cells. This suggests that the carboxyl-terminal extension in the full-length INR β subunit is the site of interaction with IRS-1. In order to determine if other signaling proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with the full-length or truncated INR β subunits, total cell lysates of 293, 293 pc-3, 293 β-Myc, and 293 βΔ cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IRS-2, mSos-1, Shc, p85 subunit of PI3′-kinase, SHP-2, Raf-1, and JAK2 and probed with Ab dp1040. These experiments failed to demonstrate co-immunoprecipitation of β INR with any of these proteins (data not shown). The opposite experiments were also performed, in which the total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Ab dp1040 and probed with antibodies against each protein. Likewise, in these experiments no co-immunoprecipitation of any of these proteins with the INR β subunits was detected (data not shown). All of the signaling proteins examined were present in all cell lines in similar amounts as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with Abs against the respective proteins (data not shown). Thus, neither direct interaction between these proteins and the constitutively active INR β subunits nor alteration in the content of these proteins in the different cell lines was found. One of the physiological functions of insulin receptors is to regulate mitogenesis and cell proliferation. In fact, a defect in regulation of cell growth or proliferation may underlie the growth deficiency phenotype observed in flies harboring inr mutations, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of imaginal disc cells observed (22Chen C. Jack J. Garofalo R.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to test if the constitutively active β-Myc or βΔ receptors had an effect on cell growth and if there was a difference in the regulation of this biological response between these two receptors. These experiments were carried out on both 293 and MDCK stably transfected cell lines. 293 β-Myc and 293 βΔ cell lines both exhibited similar increases in the rate of cell proliferation relative to the parental 293 cells (Fig.8 A). Between days 5 and 10, the transfected cells grew more rapidly and to a higher cell density. Maximum cell number was reached on day 10, as compared with day 14 for the untransfected 293 cells (Fig. 8 A). The maximum cell number was 37 and 26% higher than that of the parental 293 cells for 293 β-Myc, and 293 βΔ cells, respectively. In contrast, the behavior of the β-Myc and the βΔ cell lines was remarkably different upon prolonged incubation (up to 4 weeks). β-Myc cells were able to survive significantly longer than the parental"

The rate-limiting step in the de novo pathway, which involves the initial synthesis of ribonucleotides from ribose-5-phosphate, amino acids, and CO2, is the irreversible removal of the 2′-hydroxyl group from ribonucleotide diphosphates, catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway for dNTP synthesis involves phosphorylation of deoxynucleosides derived from either endogenous dNTP breakdown or their uptake from the extracellular space. In this pathway, the rate-limiting reaction is the first phosphorylation step catalyzed by cytoplasmic deoxynucleoside kinases (2Arner E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Because the dNTP pools produced by both pathways are in rapid equilibrium, the actual contribution of the de novo or salvage pathway for nuclear DNA synthesis depends on several factors such as cell type, cell cycle, or the physiological state of the cell (3Bianchi V.

There is no definitive evidence for the existence of enzymes involved in the de novo pathway inside the mitochondria. Therefore, the main supply of dNTPs for DNA synthesis in this organelle seems to be deoxynucleoside salvage regulated by two recently cloned mitochondrial enzymes: (a) deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), and (b) thymidine kinase (TK)-2 (5Wang L.

Human dGK can efficiently phosphorylate deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine, whereas TK2 phosphorylates deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that the combined action of the two enzymes is sufficient for the synthesis of all four dNTPs for mitochondrial DNA replication. Human dGK and dCK have overlapping but not identical substrate specificities toward both natural substrates and therapeutic nucleoside analogues (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S.

For example, certain analogues, such as 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine, are phosphorylated mainly by dGK, whereas others, such as 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine or 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-guanine, are substrates for both dCK and dGK. These characteristics are important for understanding the toxic side effects of some widely used anti-viral drugs and raise a new concept regarding the development of drugs specifically targeted to interfere with mitochondrial DNA replication. An in-depth understanding of the regulation and biochemical properties of this enzyme is therefore of particular interest, not only in its basic biological aspect, but also for further pharmacological exploitation.Here we report the cloning, expression, and functional characterization of mouse dGK cDNA. We present evidence for the expression of a cytoplasmic isoform of mouse dGK. This activity may play a role in dNTP synthesis for nuclear DNA replication or repair. In addition, it may have important implications in the evaluation of the contribution of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA damage induced by certain drugs in mouse models.RESULTSWe have screened a mouse spleen cDNA library with the human dGK cDNA probe and isolated six positive clones. Sequence analysis revealed two types of clones, mdGK-1 and mdGK-2. The mdGK-1 cDNA sequence contained a 831-nt-long open reading frame encoding a protein of 277 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig.1). The amino acid sequence exhibited a 75% identity to human dGK, with 58 conservative and 11 nonconservative amino acid substitutions throughout the coding region. Amino acid changes were most frequent at the amino-terminal region containing the mitochondrial translocation signal sequence (20 substitutions out of 39 amino acids), whereas certain domains such as the putative ATP binding site, the substrate specificity site, and the arginine-rich domain were almost identical (Fig. 1). These motifs are highly conserved in several deoxynucleoside kinases of different species (16Eriksson S. Wang L. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 653-659Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), underlining their functional significance.The nucleotide sequence of the mdGK-2 clone was identical to mdGK-1 cDNA from nucleotide position 43 (which corresponds to nt 14 of mdGK-1) throughout the rest of its coding and 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2). However, the sequence divergence in the 5′ end region eliminates the first ATG codon found in mdGK-1, generating an open reading frame starting from a downstream ATG codon that corresponds to amino acid position 32 of mdGK-1. The two in-frame stop codons in the divergent part of mdGK-2 exclude the possibility of potential start sites upstream of the cloned cDNA (Fig. 2). mdGK-2 cDNA therefore encodes an amino-terminally truncated isoform of dGK, lacking the first 31 amino acids of the putative mitochondrial signal sequence. Although it contains some of the amino acids of the consensus mitochondrial cleavage site (Fig. 2), the characteristic feature of most mitochondrial targeting sequences, an upstream α-helical region followed by a stretch of positively charged amino acids (17Neupert W. Clin. Investig. 1994; 72: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), is absent. This raised the possibility that mdGK-2 may encode a cytoplasmic isoform of dGK. To confirm this possibility, we investigated the subcellular localization of mdGK-1 and mdGK-2. Two plasmids were constructed to express mdGK-1 and mdGK-2 as fusion proteins with the GFP. The GFP moiety was inserted into the carboxyl-terminal part to avoid interference with the amino-terminal signal sequence. Fluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected Cos-1 cells revealed dramatic differences in the localization of the two fusion proteins. Transfection of mdGK-1-GFP gave rise to several dot-like fluorescent structures in a nonfluorescent cytoplasmic background (Fig. 3), characteristic of the mitochondrial location of proteins (19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 20Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Namchai C. Yamaizumi M.

In contrast, transfection of mdGK-2-GFP produced a diffused fluorescent signal throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). In both cases, no fluorescence was detected in the nucleus. These data strongly suggest that mdGK-2, even when overexpressed, does not translocate into the mitochondria.Figure 2Sequence comparison of the amino-terminal region of mdGK-1 and mdGK-2. The nucleotide sequence of mdGK-2 cDNA is identical to mdGK-1 from nt position 43. The divergent upstream sequence eliminates the first ATG codon of mdGK-1, placing the translation initiation site at the downstream ATG at nt position 130. Asterisks indicate in-frame stop codons in the 5′ end of mdGK-2. The presumed consensus motif and the site for mitochondial cleavage (18Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Northern blot analysis of total RNAs with the coding region of mdGK-1 showed a broad band around 1.3 kb in all tissues tested (Fig.4). However, the relative strength of the signals varied greatly, suggesting clear tissue-specific differences in dGK expression. The highest levels were observed in the spleen and thymus, whereas much lower levels of dGK mRNA were detected in the brain and liver (Fig. 4).Figure 4Tissue-specific expression of mouse dGK.

A 194-nt-long antisense riboprobe containing the 1–185-bp region of mdGK-2 cDNA was synthesized, which should give rise to a 185-bp protected fragment when hybridized to mdGK-2 mRNA and to a 142-bp fragment when hybridized to mdGK-1 mRNA. The results of this assay demonstrate a substantial expression of the mdGK-2 isoform, which accounts for about 14% of the total dGK (mdGK-1 + mdGK-2) mRNA population (Fig. 5).Figure 5Determination of the relative abundance of dGK isoforms in the mouse spleen.

The histidine tag allowed a one-step affinity purification of the recombinant proteins, giving highly pure products of ∼33 kDa as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The phosphoryl transfer assay was used to compare the activities of the human and mouse dGK using various substrates. The substrate specificity of mouse dGK was similar to that of the human enzyme (Table I). Both enzymes phosphorylate deoxyguanosine, deoxyadenosine, and their analogues at both low (5 μm) and high (100 μm) concentrations. The phosphorylation of the cytostatic nucleoside analogues 2-chloro-2-deoxyadenosine, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine, and 2′-2-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine was achieved to about the same extent with both enzymes. The anti-human immunodeficiency virus compound 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine was also phosphorylated to about 10% of that of deoxyguanosine at a physiological concentration. The major difference observed here was that the human enzyme showed a greater affinity toward deoxyadenosine and was able to phosphorylate deoxycytidine at a high substrate concentration. Both enzyme preparations showed specific activities similar to that reported previously for the human dGK enzyme (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAn important property of all four mammalian deoxynucleoside kinases, especially in the case of the enzyme family comprising dCK, dGK, and TK2, is their broad substrate specificity (16Eriksson S. Wang L. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 653-659Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This enabled the development of a large number of anti-cancer and anti-viral nucleoside analogues whose metabolism to their active cytotoxic forms depends on the activity of these enzymes. The need for the establishment of relevant animal models is enormous because most of our knowledge of dNTP metabolic pathways and their pharmacological exploitation comes from studies using immortalized cell lines. A prerequisite of such models is to compare the main biochemical properties of the enzymes involved between different species. Human and mouse TK1 or TK2 appear to have similar substrate specificities against several deoxyribonucleoside analogues (21Habteyesus A. Nordenskjold A. Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, significant differences in the capacity to phosphorylate a number of substrates were observed between human and mouse dCK (21Habteyesus A. Nordenskjold A. Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24374-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have cloned and analyzed the mouse homologue of dGK as an initial step to compare its biochemical properties and contribution to dNTP metabolism with those of its human counterpart. The amino acid sequence of mouse dGK showed a 75% identity to human dGK, significantly lower than the identity observed between mouse and human TK1 (87%) (23Bradshaw H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or dCK (94%) (22Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24374-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a lower selective pressure on the dGK coding region that may relate to its functional redundancy. On the other hand, all motifs initially identified in herpesvirus thymidine kinases and subsequently found in dCK and TK2 (24Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J. Melitz C. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are highly conserved. These include the putative ATP binding site, the substrate recognition site, and the arginine-rich site (Fig. 1). Therefore, the substrate preferences of deoxynucleoside kinases should depend on their different active conformations, determined in part by other, less conserved regions. We found similar specificities between mouse and human dGK for most of the substrates studied. This information, together with careful comparative sequence analyses of the less conserved regions, will help to design domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to elucidate the structural basis of the overlapping but not identical substrate specificities of these enzymes.The high variations of dGK mRNA in different mouse tissues suggest different cell type-specific requirements for this enzyme. dGK mRNA levels were highest in mouse spleen and thymus and were very low in the brain and liver. This pattern is similar to the previously reported expression pattern of mouse dCK mRNA, which was shown to be most abundant in lymphoid tissues and relatively rare in other tissues (22Karlsson A. Johansson M. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24374-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the expression of the two enzymes is not regulated to compensate for each other but rather to provide increased rates of salvage biosynthesis in certain cell types.dGK has been considered to be located exclusively in the mitochondria. This assumption is based on two important findings: (a) the highest dGK enzyme activity was found in purified mitochondrial extracts (26Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and (b) human dGK cDNA contained a functionally active mitochondrial targeting sequence (6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7258-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mouse spleen cells express an unusual mRNA species of dGK (mdGK-2) whose open reading frame codes for an amino-terminally truncated, active isoform that lacks a mitochondrial signal peptide. The perfect identity with mdGK-1 in the rest of the sequence corroborates the idea that this isoform is probably generated by an alternative splicing mechanism. When expressed as a GFP fusion protein, mdGK-2 cannot enter the mitochondria, suggesting that it represents a cytoplasmic isoform of dGK.Although the majority of the mouse spleen dGK mRNA population (86%) encodes for the characteristic mitochondrial isoform (mdGK-1), the amount (14%) of the truncated isoform coding mRNA (mdGK-2) is high enough to suggest a significant functional importance. It is interesting to note that the cDNA isolated for the other mitochondrial kinase, human TK2, also lacks a mitochondrial signal sequence (7Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Wang L. Munch-Petersen B. Sjoberg A.H. Hellman U. Bergman T. Jornvall H. Eriksson S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the structure of full-length TK2 cDNA remains to be determined, the reported TK2 cDNAs may also represent true non-mitochondrial isoforms rather than simply corresponding to partial cDNA clones. The expression of a cytoplasmic dGK raises several concerns with respect to our view of dNTP metabolism. It may participate in the supply of purine deoxynucleotides for nuclear DNA replication and repair. In this way, nucleoside analogues phosphorylated by dGK may exert their cytotoxic effects by interference with both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA synthesis. The location of dCK (28Hatzis P. Al-Madhoon A.S. Jullig M. Petrakis T.G. Eriksson S. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30239-30243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and some of dGK in the cytoplasm also raises speculations of potential heterodimer formation between the two proteins that may generate novel enzyme properties. The recent identification of a functional mitochondrial dCTP carrier protein adds a further level of complexity to cellular dNTP metabolism (29Bridges E.G. Jiang Z. Cheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activity of this carrier protein may make cytoplasmic pools of dNTPs available to mitochondria. This possibility is further strengthened by the mitochondrial toxicity observed with dideoxycytidine, a nucleoside analogue phosphorylated by cytoplasmic dCK (30Chang C.N. Skalski V. Zhou J.H. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems that mammalian cells acquired several interdependent mechanisms that involve multiple redundant activities for both nuclear and mitochondrial dNTP supplies. The actual abundance and activities of these enzymes in distinct cellular compartments may thus provide important regulatory means for the cell to accommodate different physiological requirements. Given the pharmacological importance of cellular deoxynucleoside kinases, additional studies aimed at the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that control their cell type-specific expression and subcellular location-dependent contribution to different metabolic pathways are clearly warranted. In mammalian cells, the synthesis of dNTP1 precursors for nuclear DNA synthesis is performed by two pathways: (a) the de novo pathway, and (b) the salvage pathway. The rate-limiting step in the de novo pathway, which involves the initial synthesis of ribonucleotides from ribose-5-phosphate, amino acids, and CO2, is the irreversible removal of the 2′-hydroxyl group from ribonucleotide diphosphates, catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway for dNTP synthesis involves phosphorylation of deoxynucleosides derived from either endogenous dNTP breakdown or their uptake from the extracellular space. In this pathway, the rate-limiting reaction is the first phosphorylation step catalyzed by cytoplasmic deoxynucleoside kinases (2Arner E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Because the dNTP pools produced by both pathways are in rapid equilibrium, the actual contribution of the de novo or salvage pathway for nuclear DNA synthesis depends on several factors such as cell type, cell cycle, or the physiological state of the cell (3Bianchi V. Borella S. Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Calderazzo F. Bianchi L.C. Skog S. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16118-16124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Xu Y.-Z. Huang P. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 631-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to the nucleus, the inner membrane of the mitochondria is impermeable to charged molecules such as deoxyribonucleotides. There is no definitive evidence for the existence of enzymes involved in the de novo pathway inside the mitochondria. Therefore, the main supply of dNTPs for DNA synthesis in this organelle seems to be deoxynucleoside salvage regulated by two recently cloned mitochondrial enzymes: (a) deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), and (b) thymidine kinase (TK)-2 (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Human dGK can efficiently phosphorylate deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine, whereas TK2 phosphorylates deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This suggests that the combined action of the two enzymes is sufficient for the synthesis of all four dNTPs for mitochondrial DNA replication. Human dGK and dCK have overlapping but not identical substrate specificities toward both natural substrates and therapeutic nucleoside analogues (5Wang L. Hellman U. Eriksson S.

In all cases a first step in the inhibition process is acylation of the active site serine by the β-lactam ring to generate a covalently bound acyl-enzyme intermediate. Thereafter, the inhibitor may undergo a further fragmentation resulting in a more stable entity that is resistant to deacylation and hence regeneration of enzyme activity. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel mode of action of a class of monocyclic β-lactams, which results in a particularly stable acyl-enzyme intermediate. The proposed mechanism, which is based on the x-ray structures of the elastase-ligand complexes presented below, may be generally applicable to other related serine proteases. Human leukocyte elastase is an important therapeutic target in view of its implied role in diseases such as emphysema (5Kerrigan J.E. Oleksyszyn J. Kam C.M. Selzler J. Powers J.C. J. Med.

In the latter case, the monocyclic β-lactam simply acylates the active site serine residue without further fragmentation. The class of monocyclic β-lactams reported herein contain an aryloxy substituent at the C-4 position (Fig. 1) that departs subsequent to acylation of the serine residue. We have compared two related members of this class of β-lactam that differ primarily in the nature of the C-3 substituent. This difference results in distinct modes of action upon reaction with elastase. The crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at room temperature. Porcine pancreatic elastase at 10 mg/ml was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of inhibitor for 1.5 h at room temperature before drops were laid. The well solution contained 0.1 msodium acetate buffer at pH 5.1 and 55 mm sodium sulfate. The drops consisted of 2 μl of protein and 2 μl of well solution.

All water and ligand molecules were removed from the model structure. Initial difference Fourier maps using phases calculated from the molecular replacement solutions showed clear electron density for both ligands. Subsequent refinement of all atom positions and individual isotropic thermal parameters was carried out using SHELX-97 (11Sheldrick G.M. SHELX-97. University of Goettingen, Germany1997Google Scholar) (TableI). A total of 282 water molecules were added to JD261 and 275 to EI116 using the program SHELXWAT (11Sheldrick G.M. SHELX-97. University of Goettingen, Germany1997Google Scholar). Both structures contained a calcium and a sulfate ion as described in other published structures. Despite the short (5 s) soaking time in the cryoprotectant solution, a well ordered glycerol molecule was located in the JD261-elastase complex. Rounds of conjugate gradient least squares refinement were alternated with examination of sigma weighted (2 F (obs) −F (calc)) Fourier maps. This, along with the excellent quality high resolution data, ensured that any model bias was minimized. Once the R-factor had refined to a value of less than 0.18 using all data, hydrogen atoms were added in calculated positions. This reduced both the R-factor and the free R-factor for both structures by more than 1% leading to final R-factors of 0.16 with excellent geometries (Table I). Coordinates of both structures have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data bank. The ligand was clearly visible in an initial electron density difference map. The excellent quality of the electron density calculated with data to a resolution of 1.60 Å shows that the ligand derived from JD261 is planar between the ester carbon attached to the serine and the nitrogen preceding the naphthalene ring system (Fig.2). Furthermore, there is no trace of substituents on positions 3 and 4 of the β-lactam. These observations are consistent with the structures and mechanism shown in Fig.1 a. The amide nitrogen atoms from Gly-201(193) 2The numbering nomenclature for PPE is taken from Mattos et al. (18Mattos C. Giammona D.A. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which amino acid residues of PPE are numbered sequentially beginning with Val-16(16) and ending with Asn-255(245). In this scheme, residues of the catalytic triad are Ser-203(195), His-60(57), Asp-108(102). and Ser-203(195) act as hydrogen bond donors to the ester carbonyl oxygen atom, which lies in the oxyanion pocket. (TableII and Fig.3). The planar all trans configuration of JD261 places constraints upon the orientation of the urea moiety and only one other direct hydrogen bond can be formed between the urea oxygen atom and Gln-200(192) (Fig. 3). The urea nitrogen (N-1) is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule that forms a bridging hydrogen bond to the amide nitrogen of Val-224(216). The active site His-60(57) does not make any direct hydrogen bonds with JD261 but does form a hydrogen bond to W751 (Nε-2 … W = 2.7Å). This water molecule is only 3.3 Å from the carbon of the ester carbonyl and is well positioned to carry out a nucleophilic attack along the Burgi-Dunitz trajectory (Fig. 3).Table IIHydrogen bond distances as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4EI116 ContactsÅJD261 ContactsÅEI116(O)–W6113.13JD261(O)–W7593.16EI116(O)–Ser-203/N2.93JD261(O)–Ser-203/N2.75EI116(O)–Gly-201/N3.16JD261(O)–Gly-201/N3.07EI116(OH)–His-60/Nɛ22.85JD261(N1)–W7492.95EI116(OH)–W7022.71JD261(O11)–Gln-200/N2.90EI116(N1)–W5702.96W751–W7562.80EI116(N2)–W5703.04W751–W7592.40W702–W7182.67W751–W7642.56W718–W7512.95W751–W7783.12 Open table in a new tab The EI116 ligand product was clearly visible in an initial electron density difference map and showed the presence of both ethyl groups on C-3. The refined structure also showed clearly that position 4 is tetrahedral with a 1 atom substituent, consistent with the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 b. There are three hydrogen bonds linking the ligand directly to the protein (Table II and Fig. 4). The β-lactam carbonyl group of the EI116 complex occupies almost the same position in the oxyanion pocket as in JD261 and makes the same hydrogen bonds. The Nε-2 atom from His-60(57) acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the hydroxyl oxygen atom bonded to C(4). Additionally this hydroxyl group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to Oγ of the active site serine. Binding of the ligand is also stabilized by van der Waals interactions with Ser-222(214) and Phe-223(215) in binding pocket S2, with Val-224(216) and Gln-200(192) in binding pocket S3 and by a stacking interaction of the aromatic ring with the guanidinium group of Arg-226(217A) in binding pocket S4. The x-ray structures of the complexes are consistent with the mechanisms outlined in Fig. 1. The mechanism shown for the reaction of EI116 with elastase is similar to that proposed for a related series of compounds binding human leukocyte elastase (12Underwood D.J. Green B.G. Chabin R. Mills S. Doherty J.B. Finke P.E. Maccoss M. Shah S.K. Burgey C.S. Dickinson T.A. Griffin P.R. Lee T.E. Swiderek K.M. Covey T. Westler W.M. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14344-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In that work, mass spectrometry and NMR were used to show acylation of the Ser-203(195), loss of the substituent on C-4 of the lactam ring, and subsequent formation of the carbinolamine. We can now show that the addition of water to the intermediate imine results in a carbon with (S) configuration as predicted by modeling studies (12Underwood D.J. Green B.G. Chabin R. Mills S. Doherty J.B. Finke P.E. Maccoss M. Shah S.K. Burgey C.S. Dickinson T.A. Griffin P.R. Lee T.E. Swiderek K.M. Covey T. Westler W.M. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14344-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond to His-60(57) and may play a role in the reactivation mechanism. Indeed this hydroxyl group may be derived from the hydrolytic water molecule that is required for deacylation and hence reactivation of elastase. The new mechanism revealed by the binding of JD261 to elastase involves initial acylation of Ser-203(195) followed by loss of the OAr group from C-4. Thereafter, the hydroxyethyl substituent on C-3 provides an alternative pathway for reaction by a retro-aldol reaction to generate the acyl-enzyme intermediate with the concomitant release of acetaldehyde. This results in the planar conjugated intermediate shown in Fig. 1 and as a consequence there is no possibility of addition of water to C-4. The identity of the acylated enzyme complexes have both been verified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and the masses of these covalent intermediates correspond to the major molecular species.

Science. 1995; 269: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all cases the elastase active site maintains the same shape, and typical root mean square differences between backbone atoms are less than 0.3 Å. The side chains Gln-200(192) and Arg-226(217A) can adopt different conformations and these changes are particularly pronounced in the complex with JD261 where a very different conformation of the Gln-200(192) is required to make way for the naphthyl group of the ligand (Figs. 3 and 4). The unique placement of this ligand compared with all other published classes of inhibitor gives an indication of the relative lack of flexibility caused by its all-trans configuration and charge delocalized structure. The x-ray structure of trifluoroacetyl-Lys-Phe-p-isopropylanilide/PPE defined a new subsite for the anilide group, which was located under the side chain of Gln-200(192) (19Mattos C. Rasmussen B. Ding X.C. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One ring of the naphthyl group of JD261 partly overlaps this site; however, the uniquely different conformation of Gln-200(192) in this structure provides a rather differently shaped pocket. The position of EI116 in the active site resembles the binding adopted by other peptide-type inhibitors (16Bode W. Meyer E. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) in which the peptide side chains fill the specificity pockets S1 to S4. The closest similarity occurs with the trifluoroacetyl dipeptidyl isopropylanilide family of inhibitors (18Mattos C. Giammona D.A. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The S1 pocket is filled in this family by the trifluoroacetyl group, whereas EI116 fills the S1 pocket quite efficiently with one of the ethyl groups on what was C-3 of the β-lactam. The S4 subsite accommodates the aromatic anilide group, which lies in the same place as the bromphenyl group of EI116. The presence of the aromatic group causes a significant shift in the position of the side chain of Arg-226(217A), which forms van der Waals contacts with the group. The main-chain structures of elastase bound to EI116 and JD261 show an unexpected conformational difference from residues Asn-99(95)-Thr-100(96)-Asp-101(97)-Asp-102(98). All 26 available published x-ray structures of PPE complexes show these residues in a type I β-turn. The electron density in the EI116 complex clearly shows a βII turn despite the fact that there are no direct interactions with the ligand that may have induced the change. It has been shown that reactivation of human leukocyte elastase-inhibitor complexes, of a series of substituted mono-β-lactams, results in a half-life of between 3 and 15 h. Stability of the complex is insensitive to increasing ionic strength and also to the nature of the leaving group on C-4 but does however depend on the nature of the substituted urea (1Green B.G. Chabin R. Mills S. Underwood D.J. Shah S.K. Kuo D. Gale P. Maycock A.L. Liesch J. Burgey C.S. Doherty J.B. Dorn C.P. Finke P.E. Hagmann W.K. Hale J.J. Maccoss M. Westler W.M. Knight W.B.

Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has been found to form an acyl-complex with Ser-203(195) through the C-terminal carboxy group. The x-ray crystal structure of this complex shows the presence of a water molecule hydrogen bonded to Nε-2 of His-60(57) and in an ideal position to attack the carbon of the ester carbonyl. A mechanism has been proposed that explains the cleavage of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by a hydroxide ion that is derived by deprotonation of a water molecule by His-60(57) (15Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The structure of the JD216 complex has an identically positioned water molecule. However, the presence of the conjugated double bond is likely to confer hydrolytic stability on the acyl-enzyme intermediate as has been previously noted by the inhibition of β-lactamase by clavulanic acid (27Knowles J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1985; 18: 97-104Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Chen C.C.H. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). JD261 is therefore an example of a new class of serine protease inhibitor that provides a novel chemical mechanism for resisting reactivation. We are currently exploring the generality of this mechanism with proteases other than elastase."
https://openalex.org/W1990253374,"For an animal model to predict a compound's potential for treating human disease, inhibitor interactions with the cognate enzymes of separate species must be comparable. Rabbit and human isoforms of stromelysin-1 are highly homologous, yet there are clear and significant compound-specific differences in inhibitor potencies between these two enzymes. Using crystal structures of discordant inhibitors complexed with the human enzyme, we generated a rabbit enzyme homology model that was used to identify two unmatched residues near the active site that could explain the observed disparities. To test these observations, we designed and synthesized three chimeric mutants of the human enzyme containing the single (H224N and L226F) and double (H224N/L226F) mutations. A comparison of inhibitor potencies among the mutant and wild-type enzymes shows that the mutation of a single amino acid in the human enzyme, histidine 224 to asparagine, is sufficient to change the selectivity profile of the mutant to that of the rabbit isoform. These studies emphasize the importance of considering species differences, which can result from even minor protein sequence variations, for the critical enzymes in an animal disease model. Homology modeling provides a tool to identify key differences in isoforms that can significantly affect native enzyme activity.

Homology modeling provides a tool to identify key differences in isoforms that can significantly affect native enzyme activity. matrix metalloproteinase catalytic domain 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases Cell-matrix interactions provide cells with an assessment of their immediate environment and afford signaling events that result in proliferation, differentiation, migration, or programmed cell death (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1345-1350PubMed Google Scholar). These matrix interactions can be altered through the activities of a family of extracellular zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).1 Collectively, these enzymes are responsible for the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules with the subsequent release of stromal contacts (2Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). MMP activity is essential for tissue remodeling or cellular migration and is required for physiological processes such as fetal development, wound healing, angiogenesis, or inflammatory cell trafficking. However, it is critical to these processes that the matrix degradation be locally confined and temporally limited. Consequently, MMPs are highly regulated enzymes and, in general, are induced only in response to specific stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors. When induced, they are transiently expressed as latent enzymes that require complex interactions for activation (3Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated they are subject to rapid autodegradation. In addition, enzyme activity is modulated in situ by potent and specific natural inhibitors, the TIMPs that are expressed under many of the same conditions that induce MMP activity (4Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). If the balance between induction, activation, and inhibition processes becomes even slightly dysregulated, the result can be chronic and debilitating diseases such as cancer, arthritis, inappropriate angiogenesis, autoimmune disease, aneurysm, atherosclerosis, or heart failure (5Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Because MMP expression in normal tissue is very low, enzyme activity can be associated with specific disorders through the correlation of disease severity with either mRNA or active protein expression. Stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) has been directly implicated in the pathologies of osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis and many types of cancers through these kinds of correlations (6Keyszer G. Redlich A. Haupl T.

Biol. 1996; 3: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, this enzyme provides the initial step in the activation cascades for many members of the MMP family and as such may play a less direct role in other disease states as well (9Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, London1996: 153-204Google Scholar). As a result, MMP-3 inhibition has been an attractive target for pharmaceutical drug discovery.The MMPs are a homologous family of enzymes with a conserved multidomain structure that serves functionally to enable the proteolytic degradation of complex matrix macromolecules. The enzyme structure comprises a prodomain, which maintains enzyme latency, the catalytic domain that contains the active site, and a C-terminal domain, which is responsible for matrix interactions and substrate and TIMP recognition (10Borkakoti N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain can be expressed independently and functions as a competent protease with substrate and inhibitor specificities typical of the full-length parent enzyme (11Marcy A.I.

This consists of an open-face α-β sandwich made up of three α-helices packed against a 5-stranded β-sheet. The overall structure is ellipsoidal with a flat, surface-exposed substrate-binding cleft on one face of the surface. The zinc-binding active site is contained in the second helix and adjacent loop, followed by a characteristic 1–4 β-turn (Met-turn) which positions an invariant methionine near the catalytic zinc to support the active site substructure. After a series of turns that define the S1′ pocket, the structure terminates in the third helix.The substrate-binding cleft is quite shallow, and most of the binding energy of synthetic inhibitors comes from two functional groups, a substituent that chelates the catalytic zinc and a hydrophobic portion that binds in the S1′ pocket (34Browner M. Prospectives Drug Dis. Design. 1994; 2: 343-351Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The most variable region among MMP structures is this deep, hydrophobic pocket (35Massova I. Kotra L. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Sequence differences within the S1′ region define the shape and character of the pocket and appear to be responsible for much of the observed substrate specificity of a given MMP (32Lovejoy B. Welch A.R. Carr S. Luong C. Broka C. Hendricks R.T. Campbell J.A. Walker K.A.M. Martin R. Van Wart H. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These differences have been exploited to develop inhibitors with increased selectivity for (ideally) a single MMP, or (more realistically) a limited subset of family members. Targeting an MMP inhibitor to the specific enzyme(s) associated with a disease should limit the potential side effects of therapeutic use and allow safe, long-term drug treatment for chronic disorders.With the development of MMP inhibitors with improved enzyme selectivity, it has become increasingly important not only to identify the enzyme associated with a given disease, but also to characterize animal models to assure that they are dependent on that particular MMP. However, even with an established correlation for the disease model, cognate MMPs from different species may differ in the composition of the S1′ pocket, and inhibitor activity in an animal model may not adequately predict efficacy for the human disease.The rabbit and human isoforms of stromelysin-1 are highly homologous enzymes, and, in general, inhibitors demonstrate comparable potencies when tested against the purified enzymes. However, we have found that certain very selective human stromelysin inhibitors possess reduced potency against the rabbit enzyme. Using crystal structures of human stromelysin catalytic domain-inhibitor complexes as guides, we constructed a rabbit stromelysin catalytic domain homology model, which was used to identify specific amino acid interactions within the S1′ pocket that could explain the observed disparity in inhibitor potencies. We then synthesized chimeric mutants of human stromelysin-1, which allowed us to characterize the inhibitor interactions predicted from homology modeling and to identify the specific region of the S1′ pocket that was responsible for the observed differences in inhibitor selectivity of the wild-type isoforms.DISCUSSIONThe recent burst of structures for matrix metalloproteinases complexed with small molecule inhibitors has shown that the S1′ pocket is critical in defining inhibitor selectivity. Minor sequence differences within this region can change the shape and hydrophobic character of the pocket resulting in wide variations in inhibitor potencies for a particular compound among members of this family of homologous enzymes (32Lovejoy B. Welch A.R. Carr S. Luong C. Broka C. Hendricks R.T. Campbell J.A. Walker K.A.M. Martin R. Van Wart H. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These binding interactions have been exploited to develop increasingly potent and selective inhibitors through structure-based drug design processes. Improving selectivity for the human target, however, may result in altered activity for the cognate enzyme in a given animal model of disease. Since it is impractical to test all inhibitors against the purified enzymes from all species used for animal models, it may be possible to predict the species-specific activity of synthetic inhibitors using computer-generated homology models of the animal enzymes.The rabbit and human isoforms of stromelysin-1 are highly homologous enzymes, demonstrating over 90% identity for the primary amino acid sequence of the catalytic domains. Catalytic efficiencies for synthetic substrates are similar, and, in general, inhibitors show comparable potencies when tested against the purified enzymes. Unexpectedly, one class of very selective inhibitors for human stromelysin-1 was much less potent against the rabbit enzyme. Using crystal structures of these inhibitors complexed with the human catalytic domain, we generated a rabbit homology model that was used to identify specific amino acids within the S1′ pocket that might be responsible for the disparity in inhibitor potencies. The model showed that of the several amino acid differences between the two enzymes, only asparagine 224 and phenylalanine 226 of the rabbit enzyme were positioned within the S1′ pocket, and both could potentially impact the binding efficiency of the diphenylpiperidine class of inhibitors. Using human to rabbit chimeric mutants, we showed that the mutation of a single amino acid, histidine 224 to asparagine, changed the inhibitor selectivity of the human enzyme to that of the rabbit isoform. This indicated that the disparity of inhibitor potencies observed for the diphenylpiperidine inhibitors was due to the loss of positive stacking interactions with histidine 224 of the human enzyme, as predicted by the homology model.Murine and rat stromelysin-1 have a lysine residue at position 224 (45Sang Q.A. Douglas D.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 137-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and those isoforms would be expected to have diminished activity against the diphenylpiperidine inhibitors as well. Since both rabbit and rodent models are commonly used in preclinical studies, it is noteworthy that inferences about stromelysin inhibition in the corresponding human disease may not be valid for at least some classes of compounds.As a family the MMPs are neutral endopeptidases, demonstrating broad bell-shaped curves for the dependence of catalysis on pH with generally uniform and robust activity from pH 5–9. Human stromelysin is unique among the MMP family members in that it has a sharp catalytic optimum between pH 5.5 and 6.0 (46Holman C. Kan C-C. Gehring M. Van Wart H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Harrison R.K. Chang B. Niedzwiecki L. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fall-off of catalytic efficiency at neutral pH is dramatic with proteolytic activity at pH 7.0 about 32% of the activity at pH 6.0 (Table I). This appears to be an intrinsic property of stromelysin-1 since this effect is observed for both peptide and natural substrates, using either the catalytic domain or full-length enzyme (37Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Baragi V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 46Holman C. Kan C-C. Gehring M. Van Wart H.

Latent stromelysin-1 activates spontaneously at pH 5.5 (51Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner J.F. Agents Actions. 1993; 40: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and is subject to much more rapid autodegradation (37Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Baragi V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, TIMP interactions with active MMP-3 are weakened at acidic pH (52Woessner J.F. Gunja-Smith Z. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18 Suppl. 27: 99-101Google Scholar), indicating that the exceptional pH dependence of stromelysin activity may serve as an additional layer of post-translational regulation in vivo.Holman and co-workers (46Holman C. Kan C-C. Gehring M. Van Wart H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) constructed the H224Q mutant of human MMP-3 CD and showed that this single mutation released the enzyme from its acidic pH optimum resulting in strong catalytic activity over a broad pH range. In this case, the effect of the mutation was believed to be the stabilization of a pH-dependent S1′ substructure that is required in the wild-type enzyme for efficient substrate binding and catalysis. His-224 has been shown to form a hydrogen bond across the S1′ pocket with the alanine 217 carbonyl, an interaction that tethers the flexible outer loop of the S1′ pocket and, in effect, serves to stabilize the S1′ subsite (26Dhanaraj V. Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Ortwine D.F. Dunbar Jr., J.B. Rubin J.R. Pavlovsky A. Humblet C. Blundell T.L.

Williams M. Dhanaraj V. Blundell T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The unprotonated form of His-224 cannot form this bond, and, above its p Ka (predicted to be near pH 6), this interaction would be lost in the wild-type but not the mutant enzyme. In our characterization of the rabbit isoform (asparagine at position 224), we have also observed a broad pH dependence for catalytic activity that is, not surprisingly, very similar to the H224Q mutant activity. Considering these results, it is possible that human stromelysin-1 has somewhat different physiologic regulation and substrate activity than the corresponding rabbit and rodent enzymes, and disease models in these species may not accurately describe the underlying mechanism of human disease if indeed stromelysin-1 plays a key role in the pathology.The studies described here emphasize the importance of understanding inhibitor and substrate interactions with species isoforms of the enzymes believed to be active in a given model of human disease. This goes beyond a simple accounting of primary amino acid sequence similarity or identity, since even a single amino acid difference can result in significant differences in potency between the human and animal enzymes. Using a homology model of rabbit stromelysin-1 based on the crystal structure of the human enzyme, we predicted specific amino acid interactions within the S1′ pocket that could be responsible for the differences in inhibitor potency between the rabbit and human enzymes. The biochemical analyses of chimeric mutants confirmed and clarified the model predictions. These data support the use of homology modeling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis to assess inhibitor interactions that may be due to minor sequence differences between cognate enzymes from separate species. Cell-matrix interactions provide cells with an assessment of their immediate environment and afford signaling events that result in proliferation, differentiation, migration, or programmed cell death (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1345-1350PubMed Google Scholar). These matrix interactions can be altered through the activities of a family of extracellular zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).1 Collectively, these enzymes are responsible for the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules with the subsequent release of stromal contacts (2Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). MMP activity is essential for tissue remodeling or cellular migration and is required for physiological processes such as fetal development, wound healing, angiogenesis, or inflammatory cell trafficking. However, it is critical to these processes that the matrix degradation be locally confined and temporally limited. Consequently, MMPs are highly regulated enzymes and, in general, are induced only in response to specific stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors. When induced, they are transiently expressed as latent enzymes that require complex interactions for activation (3Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated they are subject to rapid autodegradation. In addition, enzyme activity is modulated in situ by potent and specific natural inhibitors, the TIMPs that are expressed under many of the same conditions that induce MMP activity (4Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). If the balance between induction, activation, and inhibition processes becomes even slightly dysregulated, the result can be chronic and debilitating diseases such as cancer, arthritis, inappropriate angiogenesis, autoimmune disease, aneurysm, atherosclerosis, or heart failure (5Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because MMP expression in normal tissue is very low, enzyme activity can be associated with specific disorders through the correlation of disease severity with either mRNA or active protein expression. Stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) has been directly implicated in the pathologies of osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis and many types of cancers through these kinds of correlations (6Keyszer G. Redlich A. Haupl T. Zacher J. Sparmann M. Engethum U. Gay S. Burmester G.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Lochter A. Srebrow A. Sympson C.J. Terracio N. Werb Z.

Biol. 1996; 3: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, this enzyme provides the initial step in the activation cascades for many members of the MMP family and as such may play a less direct role in other disease states as well (9Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, London1996: 153-204Google Scholar). As a result, MMP-3 inhibition has been an attractive target for pharmaceutical drug discovery. The MMPs are a homologous family of enzymes with a conserved multidomain structure that serves functionally to enable the proteolytic degradation of complex matrix macromolecules. The enzyme structure comprises a prodomain, which maintains enzyme latency, the catalytic domain that contains the active site, and a C-terminal domain, which is responsible for matrix interactions and substrate and TIMP recognition (10Borkakoti N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain can be expressed independently and functions as a competent protease with substrate and inhibitor specificities typical of the full-length parent enzyme (11Marcy A.I.

X-ray crystallography studies identified a major calcium-binding site involving Asp438, Ala457, Glu485, and Glu490.

Alanine substitution mutants of these residues were constructed, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli. The Kactvalues for calcium ions increased by 3-, 8-, and 21-fold for E485A, E490A, and E485A,E490A, respectively. In addition, susceptibility to proteolysis was increased by 4-, 9-, and 10-fold for E485A, E490A, and E485A,E490A, respectively. Aspartic acids 472, 476, and 479 are not involved directly in calcium binding since the Kact values were not changed by mutagenesis.

X-ray crystallography studies revealed that the FXIII A-chain is composed of four distinct structural domains. Starting from the N terminus, there is a β-sandwich domain (residues 43–184) followed by a catalytic core (residues 185–515) and two β-barrels (residues 516–628 and 629–727) at the C terminus (4Yee V.C.

The activation peptide (residues 1–37) of each A-subunit crosses the dimer interface and partially occludes the opening to the active site in the catalytic core of the other subunit. Thrombin cleavage of the A-chains at the Arg37–Gly38 bond is required for the A-chains to express FXIIIa (the FXIII A-chain with the activation peptide (Met1–Arg37) removed) activity in vivo (1Lorand L.

Detailed biochemical studies of purified plasma XIII established that calcium ions dissociate B-chains from the thrombin-cleaved A-chains of plasma FXIII (1Lorand L. Losowsky M.S. Miloszewski K.J.M. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1980; 5: 245-290PubMed Google Scholar). Then, a calcium-dependent conformational change in the thrombin-cleaved A-chain is required to expose the active-site Cys314 (1Lorand L. Losowsky M.S. Miloszewski K.J.M. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1980; 5: 245-290PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium ions are essential for FXIIIa to catalyze intermolecular isopeptide bonds between protein molecules (1Lorand L. Losowsky M.S.

There are two distinct biochemical steps that occur during FXIIIa catalysis. In the first step, the active-site Cys314 of FXIIIa binds the peptide-bound glutamine substrate, forming a thioester bond intermediate and releasing ammonia (5Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the enzyme-substrate complex interacts with either a primary amine or a peptide-bound lysine residue, producing an isopeptide bond (5Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium ions are required for both steps of catalysis (6Chung S.I. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

McDonagh R.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 30: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Mary A. Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. Arch. Biochem.

A. 1986; 83: 8019-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The precise location and number of calcium-binding sites in factor XIII A-chains are hampered by the relative low affinity of the calcium binding (12Lewis B.A. Freyssinet J.-M. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies performed by Lewis et al. (12Lewis B.A. Freyssinet J.-M. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the FXIII A-chain binds 1.2–1.5 calcium ions with low affinity (Kd ∼ 10−4m) and up to 8 calcium ions/molecule of plasma FXIII at higher calcium concentrations. A putative calcium-binding site was first proposed by Takahashi et al. (11Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8019-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as an EF-hand-like structure located in a fragment between Gln467 and Asp479. This area is rich in the negative charged amino acid residues that are postulated to bind calcium ions. Recent x-ray crystallography studies of factor XIII A-chain crystals grown in the presence of Sr2+ or Yb3+ demonstrated there is no EF-hand-like motif (13Pedersen L.C. X-ray Structure Determination of Factor XIII.Doctoral dissertation. University of Washington, 1994Google Scholar, 14Yee V.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Pedersen L.C. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography identified a major cation-binding site containing Asp438, Ala457, Glu485, and Glu490 and a minor site containing Asp270 and Glu272 (13Pedersen L.C.

Interestingly, there were no major conformational changes between the cation-bound factor XIIIa and the zymogen structures (13Pedersen L.C. X-ray Structure Determination of Factor XIII.Doctoral dissertation. University of Washington, 1994Google Scholar, 14Yee V.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Pedersen L.C. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Semin.

The role of these cation-binding sites in expression of FXIIIa activity and regulation of the conformation of the protein in solution remains unclear. In addition, there were differences in coordinating ligands between the Sr2+- and Yb3+-bound structures, and fewer than the ideal number of coordinating ligands were reported (14Yee V.C. Le Trong I.

These data suggest that other amino acids are also involved in the binding of cations. Since high calcium concentrations (>50 mm) enable the platelet factor XIII zymogen to express enzymatic activity in the absence of thrombin cleavage, there may be other lower affinity calcium-binding sites that play a role in regulating catalysis and protein conformation. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues identified by x-ray crystallography studies and other potential calcium-binding residues is necessary to confirm their role in regulating catalysis and protein conformation. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis analysis of two calcium-binding ligands (Glu485 and Glu490) identified by x-ray crystallography. These amino acid sequences are conserved in other transglutaminases such as human tissue transglutaminase (TGase), bovine endothelial TGase, and guinea pig TGase (16Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya Y. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 2898-2905Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akanda O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J.A.

The substitution mutants were expressed, purified, and analyzed for their catalytic properties and sensitivity to thrombin proteolysis. The effects of these mutations on the structure and function of FXIIIa will be discussed. All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, bacteria alkaline phosphatase, LB medium, and yeast extract were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Human α-thrombin was supplied by Dr. J. W. Fenton II (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) or Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. All factor XIII A-chain mutants were constructed using oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (T7-Gen mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lai T.-S. Santiago M.A. Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The single point mutations E485A, E490A, D472A, D476A, and D479A were constructed using oligonucleotides 1 (GATA CTTACA AATTC CAAGC CGGTC AAGAA GAAGA GAG), 2 (GAAGG TCAAG AAGAA GCGAG ATTGG CCCTA GAAAC TG), 3 (AATTG GTGGT GCGGG CATGA TGG), 4 (GGCAT GATGG CGATT ACTGA TAC), and 5 (GGATA TTACT GCGAC TTACA AATT), respectively. In addition to the single point mutations, four double mutants (E485A,E490A, D472A,D476A, D472A,D479A, and D476A,D479A) and one triple mutant (D472A,D476A,D479A) were also constructed. The DNA sequences for each mutant were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Nco I-Pst I fragments of these constructs were then subcloned into the Nco I and Pst I sites of pKK233-2 as described previously (20Lai T.-S. Santiago M.A. Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The E485A, E490A, E485A,E490A, D476A,D479A, and D472A,D476A,D479A mutants were also constructed in the pGEX-MCS vector and purified as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described previously (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and preparation of Escherichia coli lysates were as described (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lai T.-S. Santiago M.A. Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, after resuspending E. coli pellets in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol/EDTA, and 15% glycerol, the cells were lysed by lysozyme and sonication as described. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Fresh aliquots were used for each experiment, and unused samples were discarded. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-factor XIII A-chain fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose affinity resins as described previously (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar) using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. The concentrations of affinity-purified GST-factor XIII A-chains, GST-E485A, GST-E490A, GST-E485A,E490A, GST-D476A,D479A, and GST-D472A,D476A,D479A were further normalized by scanning densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel of each protein band. The transglutaminase activities of E. coli lysates containing wild-type factor XIII A-chains or mutants were quantitated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]putrescine (NEN Life Science Products) or 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine into N, N′-dimethylcasein essentially as described (22Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.-S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations (2.5–150 μg/ml) of the thrombin-activated materials were used to estimate the specific activity, and all assays were performed in triplicate. Aliquots were taken to analyze FXIIIa formation by quantitative immunoblotting and were used to normalize the specific activity. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic constant for the glutamine substrate (N, N′-dimethylcasein) was measured by the [3H]putrescine incorporation assay, and the kinetic constant for the primary amine substrate (5-(biotinamido)pentylamine) was determined using an assay as described earlier (22Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.-S. Greenberg C.S. Anal.

The transglutaminase activity data were transformed by an Eadie-Hofstee plot to determine the Km. The enzyme concentration used in the assays expressed <5% of the total thrombin-independent FXIIIa activity. The measurement of the activation constant (Kact) for calcium ions was carried out by incubating FXIII with thrombin in the absence of calcium chloride at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by exposure to 0.04–5 mmcalcium chloride, and then measuring the calcium-dependent activity by the 3H incorporation assay. The Kact was determined by an Eadie-Hofstee plot of the calcium-dependent FXIIIa activity. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fickenscher K. Aab A. Stuber W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified GST-factor XIII A-chains, GST-E485A, GST-E490A, GST-E485A,E490A, GST-D476A,D479A, and GST-D472A,D476A,D479A (20–100 ng/ml) were thrombin-activated at 37 °C for 15 min. Aliquots were taken to measure the thrombin cleavage efficiency by quantitative immunoblotting and were used to normalize the FXIIIa concentration in the reaction (19Lai T.-S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin-activated mixtures were added to the reaction mixture containing glycine ethyl ester, synthetic peptide substrate, NADH, α-ketoglutarate, and bovine glutamate dehydrogenase provided by the manufacturer (Behring Diagnostics, Inc., Somerville, NJ) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The release of ammonia was measured by the decrease in NADH and was quantified by measuring the decrease in absorbance (λ340 nm, milli-absorbance units/min) using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The data were then averaged for two duplicate experiments and are expressed as milli-absorbance units/min/mg. The fibrin binding assay was performed as described previously (22Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli lysates of wild-type or mutant FXIII A-chains (0.75 μg/ml) were incubated with factor XIII-free fibrinogen (2.5 mg/ml; (American Diagnostica Inc.) in the presence of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.73 μmα-thrombin. Fibrin clots were squeezed to remove the liquor. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed on clot supernatants of wild-type and mutant factor XIII A-chains in parallel with control samples containing no fibrin. The binding of wild-type and mutant FXIIIa to fibrin was measured by quantitating the disappearance of FXIIIa antigen in the supernatants using scanning densitometry. The data are presented as percentage bound to fibrin relative to the wild-type FXIII A-chain. Fibrin cross-linking was performed at room temperature for 30 min in a reaction volume of 60 μl containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 μg of E. coli lysates containing wild-type FXIII A-chains or mutants, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 μm FXIII-free fibrinogen, and 0.73 μm human α-thrombin. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, separated by 6–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The proteolysis experiments were performed using the E. coli lysates (50 μg) containing either wild-type FXIII A-chains (or mutants) or 4 μg of affinity-purified GST-FXIII A-chains (or GST-E485A, GST-E490A, GST-E485A,E490A, GST-D476A,D479A, or GST-D472A,D476A,D479A) in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, increasing concentrations of α-thrombin (0–9.1 μm), and 5 mm CaCl2 or EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min. After adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer to stop the reaction, the reaction mixtures were separated by 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting. The factor XIII A-chain-related antigen was visualized using rabbit polyclonal antibody against factor XIII A-chains (Calbiochem). For experiments with affinity-purified GST fusion proteins, FXIIIa and the 51-kDa fragment were easily visualized after Coomassie Blue staining. The three-dimensional coordinates of the blood coagulation factor XIII A-chain were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University) with access code 1fie (4Yee V.C. Pederson L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The molecular modeling of the FXIII A-chain was performed using the Composer module of the Sybyl Version 6.4 molecular modeling program (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). The locations of the amino acid residues selected for mutagenesis are shown in relationship to the domain structure of the factor XIII A-chain (Fig. 1 A). In this model, the calcium-binding ligands Glu485 and Glu490 are located at the junction between the catalytic core domain and the first β-barrel domain (Fig. 1 A). These calcium-binding residues are also in close proximity (15 Å) to the secondary thrombin cleavage site (Lys513-Ser514) that is surface-exposed (Fig.1 A). Asp472 is located the farthest from the major calcium-binding coordinates (Fig. 1 B), although it is closer to the catalytic triad (Cys314, His373, and Asp396) than any of the other residues mutated in this study (Fig. 1 A). Asp476 is located in a β-sheet and Asp479 in a helical turn that are in close proximity to the reported calcium-binding site (Fig. 1 B). All three side chains of Asp472, Asp476, and Asp479 are solvent-accessible. The Asp479 side chains do not participate in any hydrogen bonding with other amino acid residues. The side chains of Asp472 participate in hydrogen bonding with Lys704. The side chains of Asp476also participate in hydrogen bonding with Thr478. Asp476 and Asp479 are <5 Å apart. The shortest distances between Asp472, Asp476, or Asp479 and Glu485 and Glu490 are 29.5, 16, and 10.6 Å, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The shortest distance between Asp472, Asp476, or Asp479 and the catalytic triad residues is ∼13 Å. All FXIII mutants were expressed in E. coli to the same level as wild-type FXIII A-chains (20 mg/liter). When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they migrated with the same mobility as the wild-type FXIII A-chains. The summary of the biochemical data derived from the study of each mutant is shown in Table I. The specific activity of the D472A mutant was unchanged, whereas the specific activities of the point mutations D476A and D479A were reduced by only ∼15%. An additional Ala substitution at Asp472 to the D476A and D479A mutants did not further modify the activity. In contrast, there was a significant inhibition of activity if both aspartic acids 476 and 479 were converted to alanine. The activity of the D476A,D479A double mutant was reduced by 69%, and an additional Ala substitution at Asp472 reduced activity by 86%. The specific activity of E485A was similar to that of E490A and was reduced by 47 and 49%. The activity of the E485A,E490A double mutant was reduced by 79%. The mutants that had reduced activity had the activation peptide cleaved by thrombin when analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Therefore, the loss of FXIIIa activity displayed by these mutants was not due to a defect in cleaving the activation peptide or in cleavage at another site within the catalytic core that would inactivate FXIIIa.Table ISummary of biochemical data for each mutantKm(BP)1-aBP, 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine; mAU, mill-absorbance units; ND, not determined.Km(casein)Kact(Ca2+)Specific activity1-bThe specific activity was determined in reactions containing 1 mm Ca2+.Fibrin bindingAmmonia releaseμmμmμm%% boundmAU/min/mgWild-type75 ± 133 ± 1337 ± 401008717.8 ± 1.6E485A99 ± 192.7 ± 1.5934 ± 8053 ± 69110.1 ± 1.1E490A90 ± 152.5 ± 22688 ± 38151 ± 8929.3 ± 0.8E485A,E490A77 ± 223.5 ± 1.67170 ± 56021 ± 10899.2 ± 1.5D472A89 ± 276.1 ± 1451 ± 64106 ± 1684NDD476A75 ± 14.1 ± 1.5307 ± 8684 ± 288NDD479A77 ± 25 ± 2.7268 ± 18284 ± 688NDD472A,D476A73 ± 25.5 ± 2579 ± 13677 ± 987NDD472A,D479A70 ± 74.8 ± 1.5424 ± 1882 ± 0.491NDD476A,D479A107 ± 14.3 ± 0.7159 ± 4031 ± 5904.0 ± 1.3D472A,D476A,D479A103 ± 89 ± 2213 ± 16514 ± 2881.1 ± 0.51-a BP, 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine; mAU, mill-absorbance units; ND, not determined.1-b The specific activity was determined in reactions containing 1 mm Ca2+. Open table in a new tab The apparent Km was unchanged when the glutamine substrate (N, N′-dimethylcasein) was studied for the single and double mutants E485A, E490A, E485A,E490A, D472A, D476A, D479A, D472A,D476A, D472A,D479A, and D476A,D479A. The Km for the triple mutant D472A,D476A,D479A was only ∼3-fold higher than that for wild-type FXIIIa (Table I). The apparent Km for the primary amine substrate (5-(biotinamido)pentylamine) was similar for all the thrombin-activated FXIII A-chain mutant molecules studied (75–107 μm). We examined whether the loss of activity was due to a defect in the formation of the thioester bond or in the catalysis of the amide transfer reaction for the E485A, E490A, E485A,E490A, D476A,D479A, and D472A,D476A,D479A mutants. The formation of the thioester bond was measured by quantitating ammonia release using a glutamine peptide substrate as described previously (16Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya Y. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 2898-2905Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity-purified E485A, E490A, E485A,E490A, D476A,D479A, and D472A,D476A,D479A mutants were thrombin-activated and found to have thioester bond formation reduced by 1.8-, 1.9-, 1.9-, 4.5-, and 16-fold, respectively, when compared with wild-type FXIIIa. The Kact values for calcium for the E485A, E490A, and E485A,E490A mutants increased by 2.8-, 8-, and 21-fold, respectively, whereas the D476A and D479A mutants had similar Kact values (∼337 μm) for calcium ions compared with wild-type FXIIIa. The Kact values for the D472A, D472,479A, and D472,479A mutants were only 1.3–1.7-fold higher than that for wild-type FXIIIa. The Kact values for the D476A,D479A and D472A,D476A,D479A mutants were slightly reduced by 2.1- and 1.6-fold, respectively (Table I). All mutants bound to a fibrin clot to the same extent as wild-type FXIIIa (84–92%) (Table I). The FXIIIa mutant molecules also displayed the same pattern of fibrin cross-linking as wild-type FXIIIa, with γ-chain dimer formation occurring prior to α-chain polymer formation.

https://openalex.org/W2167800710,"A novel monoclonal antibody (ASH1a/256C) that recognizes atherosclerotic lesions in human and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit aortae is described. When 123I-labeled ASH1a/256C antibody is injected intravenously into WHHL rabbits, it associates specifically with fatty streaks on the aorta. The antigen recognized by the antibody is lipid, based on extraction with chloroform and methanol from WHHL rabbit tissues. The antigen, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, was shown to be phosphatidylcholine (PC), which contains unsaturated fatty acyl groups based on analyses utilizing1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transfer-infrared spectrum, and mass spectrometry. The antibody did not react with other classes of phospholipids or neutral lipids when tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When PC was mixed with either cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, or triacylglycerol, however, the reactivity of the antibody to PC increased up to 8-fold. Homogenates of aorta tissue obtained from normal and WHHL rabbits were fractionated using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation in which neutral lipid droplets, cellular membranes, and proteins are separated. The phospholipid content in cellular membrane fractions from WHHL rabbits was twice as high as that of normal rabbits, and there was an enormous difference in the antigenic activity in these fractions. The content of cholesterol in the cellular membrane fraction of WHHL rabbits was approximately 50 times higher than that of normal rabbits. Addition of neutral lipids to the cellular membrane fraction of normal rabbit markedly increased the antigenic activity. Atheromatous lesions in thickened WHHL rabbit aortic intima that were rich in lipid droplets were stained positively with ASH1a/256C immunohistochemically. These results strongly suggest that PC-neutral lipid complex domains are formed in atherosclerotic lesions.

Homogenates of aorta tissue obtained from normal and WHHL rabbits were fractionated using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation in which neutral lipid droplets, cellular membranes, and proteins are separated. The phospholipid content in cellular membrane fractions from WHHL rabbits was twice as high as that of normal rabbits, and there was an enormous difference in the antigenic activity in these fractions. The content of cholesterol in the cellular membrane fraction of WHHL rabbits was approximately 50 times higher than that of normal rabbits. Addition of neutral lipids to the cellular membrane fraction of normal rabbit markedly increased the antigenic activity. Atheromatous lesions in thickened WHHL rabbit aortic intima that were rich in lipid droplets were stained positively with ASH1a/256C immunohistochemically. These results strongly suggest that PC-neutral lipid complex domains are formed in atherosclerotic lesions. cholesteryl ester phosphatidylcholine sn-1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxononanoyl) PC sn-1-stearoyl-2-(5-oxopentanoyl) PC enzyme-linked im- munosorbent assay high performance liquid chromatography low density lipoprotein polyunsaturated fatty acyl group Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Intracellular and extracellular accumulation of neutral lipids in the arterial intima is a typical feature of atherosclerotic lesions. In the early stages of atherosclerosis, foam cells that accumulate cholesteryl ester (CE)1droplets in their cytosol are formed from macrophages and smooth muscle cells (1Lupu F. Danaricu I.

Several types of scavenger receptors, which are capable of binding and taking up modified low density lipoproteins (LDL), have been shown to play crucial roles in foam cell formation (4Hajjar D.P.

In advanced lesions, neutral lipids are also accumulated in the extracellular space, and cholesterol crystals can form (1Lupu F. Danaricu I. Siminescu N. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 67: 127-142Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Bocan T.M.A. Schifani T.A. Guyton J.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lundberg B.

Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 705-717PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral lipids may be deposited in the extracellular spaces when foam cells eventually die either by necrosis or apoptosis (9Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R.B. Skepper J.N. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the mechanisms of extracellular deposition of neutral lipids or the fate of foam cells. Furthermore, it is not known whether lipid accumulation affects cellular responses in the lesions. Multiple factors are closely involved in the formation of these lesions, including lipoprotein metabolism, smooth muscle cell proliferation, endothelial cell malfunction, formation of modified LDLs, and accumulation of foam cells (4Hajjar D.P.

Thromb. 1994; 1 (suppl.): 1-5Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To establish useful tools for the investigation of the mechanisms of atherogenesis, a series of monoclonal antibodies using homogenates of human atheroma as immunogen has been raised. Through characterization of these anti-atheroma antibodies, the presence of vitronectin (13Sato R. Komine Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21232-21236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mori M. Iwasaki K. Komine Y. Sato R. Itabe H. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Atheroscl.

Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions have been demonstrated. In this study, a monoclonal antibody was selected that bound to fatty streaks using an in vitro artery wall binding assay. Strips of aorta from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits were incubated with hybridoma culture media followed by a125I-labeled second antibody. The antibodies that bound to the surface of fatty streak but not to the normal endothelium were selected. The monoclonal antibody ASH1a/256C (a murine monoclonal antibody against surface of human atheroma), which bound atherosclerotic lesions in vivo and immunohistochemically, recognized PC containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups (PUFA). The content of PC in atherosclerotic lesions was at most twice that of normals, although the antigenicity of the lesion homogenates was more than eight times higher than that of the normal aortae. The reactivity of this antibody to PC was greatly increased in the presence of neutral lipids, suggesting that certain complex structures of PC and neutral lipids are present in atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerotic areas of human abdominal aorta were cut into pieces and homogenized with a Polytron® homogenizer in SVE solution (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1% ethanol, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 220 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and used as immunogen. BALB/c mice (8 weeks old, female) were immunized three times with the homogenate of human atheroma over a period of 3 months (18Kimura J. Nakagami K. Amanuma K. Ohkuma S. Takano T. Virchows Arch. A. 1986; 410: 159-164Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Spleens were removed from the immunized mice 3 days after the final injection. The spleen cells were fused with the murine myeloma cell line P3/U1 using polyethylene glycol-4000 and cultured in HY medium (DMEM: NCTC109 medium = 8:1 containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.16 mg/ml oxaloacetate, 7% fetal calf serum) containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (19Oi V.T. Herzenberg L.A. Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. Freedman, San Francisco, CA1980: 351-372Google Scholar). Antibody titers in the culture medium of hybridomas were tested by enzyme-linked immnosorbent assay (ELISA) and an in vitro binding assay to WHHL aorta. Hybridomas showing anti-atheroma reactivity were cloned by limiting dilution procedure twice. To select anti-atheroma antibodies, homogenates of human atheroma, WHHL rabbit atheroma, and normal aorta obtained from control rabbits as well as human and rabbit sera were used as antigens for ELISA. For those clones that were positive to homogenates of human and rabbit atheroma and negative to the other antigens, immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections (4–6 μm) of WHHL rabbit aorta and human atheroma were performed. Then the in vitro binding assay to WHHL aorta was performed for the selected clones that stained atherosclerotic lesions immunohistochemically. Strips of WHHL rabbit aorta (4 × 15 mm) were incubated with the culture medium of the selected hybridoma clones followed by 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig(G+M) (New England Nuclear Co.). After rinsing the strips with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) five times, autoradiography was performed. The ascites obtained from mice bearing P3 U1 myeloma, which was not hybridized with any cells, was used as control. One of the clones that showed positive spots corresponding to areas of fatty streaks was isolated and was named ASH1a/256C. The antibody produced by this clone was partially purified from ascites of mice bearing the hybridoma using ammonium sulfate precipitation. Its immunoglobulin class was IgM. During investigating this antibody, the hybridoma clone has been recloned five times so far, and no change in the reactivity of the antibody has been observed. Aorta or kidney from WHHL rabbits were cut into pieces and homogenized using Polytron® homogenizer as described previously (14Mori M. Iwasaki K. Komine Y. Sato R. Itabe H. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Atheroscl. Thromb. 1996; 3: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After removed of cellular debris by centrifugation at 220 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected. Lipids were extracted from the homogenate using the method of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42744) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were dried under an argon gas stream and then applied onto a silica gel column to separate phospholipids from neutral lipids. After washing the column with chloroform followed by chloroform:methanol (9:1) to remove neutral lipids, polar lipids including those with antigenic activity were eluted with chloroform:methanol:water (6:4:1). The eluate was then fractionated using straight phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (column: LiChrosorb Si60, 4 × 250 mm, Merck, Germany) by gradient elution with hexane:2-propanol:water (44:55:1 to 33:55:12). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The antigenic activity, which was eluted at 45 min, was separated completely from neutral lipids and glycolipids by this purification step. The antigen recovered from the HPLC was rechromatographed on the same column with another solvent system chloroform:methanol:water (4:5:1) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The antigenic activity was eluted as a single peak at 23 min. Molecular species of PC were separated using a reverse phase HPLC (column: LiChrosorb RP-18, 4 × 250 mm, Merck) with isocratic elution of methanol:water:acetonitrile (60.7:2.7:36.6) with a final concentration of choline chloride of 20 mm. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Partially purified antigens eluted from the first HPLC separation were spotted onto a TLC plate (Polygram Sil-G, #805013, Macherey-Nagel Co.). The plate was developed with hexane:diethylether (1:1) followed by chloroform:methanol:water (6:4:1) in the same direction. TLC immunostaining was carried out using the method described by Karasawa et al. (22Karasawa K. Satoh N. Masuda M. Setaka M. Hashimoto K. Ishibashi K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the plate was soaked for few seconds in 0.4% polyisobutylmethacrylate (Aldrich), it was incubated with 1% ovalbumin in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature to avoid nonspecific binding. The plate was incubated with ASHla/256C antibody diluted 1:1,000 with PBS containing 1% ovalbumin and 1% polyvinylpirolidone (average molecular weight, 40,000; Sigma). The plates were then incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-murine lg(G+M) antibody (AMI3709; Bio Source International Inc., Camarillo, CA) followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako Japan). After extensive washing with PBS containing 1% polyvinylpirolidone, immunopositive bands were visualized by incubating the plate with diaminobendizine hydrochloride (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and H2O2. The purified antigen and PC standard (4 μg each) were spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate. The plates were developed with hexane:diethylether (1:1) followed by chloroform:methanol:water (6:4:1) in the same direction. The plate was then developed in the direction perpendicular to the first run with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:acetone:water (6:2:4:2:1). The samples were visualized by spraying molybdophospholic acid onto the plate (23Touchstone J.C. Dobbins M.F. Practice of Thin Layer Chromatography. Wiley-Interscience Publications, New York1978: 207-209Google Scholar). Proton NMR spectra of the purified antigen (2.7 mg) and sn-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC (2 mg) dissolved in (CD3)2SO were obtained using a GSX-400 spectrometer (Jeol) with 512-pulse scanning at 400 MHz (24Ellena J.F. Hutton W, C. Cafiso D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 1530-1537Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional cross-relaxation spectra (NMR-COSY) were obtained using 256-pulse scanning at 400 MHz. Proton chemical shifts were indicated in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane. 13C NMR spectrum was obtained using 61,440-pulse scanning at 100 MHz using the same spectrometer. Carbon chemical shifts were indicated in ppm with reference to the internal solvent (CD3)2SO. Fourier transfer infrared spectra of the antigen were obtained using a Fourier transfer infrared spectrum 8000 spectrometer (Jasco, Japan). Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the antigen were obtained using JMS-SX102 A (Jeol), triethanolamine as the matrix. Liquid chromatography-linked mass spectra of the antigen were examined using JMS-LX2000 spectrometer (Jeol) with a Hiber LiChroCART RP-18 column (4 × 250 mm; 7 μm; Merck) under the same conditions as described above. Reactivity of ASH1a/256C to various materials was determined by ELISA. Aquaous samples, such as homogenates of atheroma, were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon number 3912) that had been pretreated with 2% glutaraldehyde for 2 h. After incubating the plates at 37 °C for 1 h, the surfaces of the microtiter wells were blocked by incubating with Tris-buffered saline containing 2% skimmed milk. The plates were incubated with ASH1a/256C antibody diluted with Tris-buffered saline containing 2% skimmed milk followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-murine Ig(G+M) antibody (Tago Inc., AMI3705). After washing extensively with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with p-nitrophenylphosphate (1 mg/ml) dissolved in 1 m diethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 9.8 at 37 °C for the appropriate time periods. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured photometrically using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). When the antigenic activities of the lipids were tested, their methanol solutions were placed into microtiter wells without the pretreatment with glutaraldehyde. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5–10 min to remove the methanol, after which the surfaces of the microtiter wells were blocked with 0.3 m sucrose. Oxidized PC was prepared by incubating sn-1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl PC (400 nmol in 1 ml of PBS) with ferrous sulfate (40 μm) and ascorbic acid (0.4 mm) at 37 °C for various periods of time. Then total oxidized lipids were extracted by the method of Brigh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42744) Google Scholar). Two aldehyde-containing oxidized PC, sn-1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxononanoyl) PC (9-CHO PC) and sn-1-stearoyl-2-(5-oxopentanoyl) PC (5-CHO PC) were prepared by reductive osmium tetraoxide treatment of sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC and sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl PC, respectively. The oxidized lipids suspended in PBS were incubated with BSA (ratio, 1 nmol of PC/1 μg of BSA) at room temperature for 30 min, and then they were placed in microtiter wells (6.5 nmol of oxidized PC/well). Homogenates of atherosclerotic lesions from WHHL and normal rabbit aorta (6 mg of protein) were fractionated using a sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation according to the method described previously (20Takano T. Muto K. Imanaka T. Ohkuma S. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 485-492Google Scholar). Briefly, a linear gradient of SVE solutions containing 53 to 0% sucrose was layered on top of the homogenates containing 64% sucrose. After centrifugation at 89,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C using RPS-27 rotor (Hitachi), samples were collected from each ml from the bottom to the top of the gradient. Frozen sections (4–6 μm) of WHHL rabbit fatty streaks were obtained and fixed with 10% neutral formalin immediately after autopsy. The sections were incubated with ASH1a/256C (ascites) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig(G+M) (Organin Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). The adjacent WHHL section was stained with 0.1% oil-red O in 60% 2-propanol for 10 min, and the section was counter stained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 5 min after washing off any excess oil-red O with 2-propanol. The amounts of total cholesterol were measured by a cholesterol oxidase method using the Cholestase-V kit (Nissui, Co.) (25Richmond W. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 26Abele J. Clin Chem. 1979; 25: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Levels of phospholipids were determined by measuring phosphorus in organic extracts using malachite green according to the method of Zhou and Arther (27Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with BSA as the standard (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215842) Google Scholar). In an attempt to obtain monoclonal antibodies against atherosclerotic lesions, hybridoma clones from mice immunized with homogenates of fatty streak lesions of human atheroma were prepared. Anti-atheroma clones were selected by ELISA using homogenates of atheroma from humans and WHHL rabbits for initial screening, followed by immunohistochemical staining using frozen sections of WHHL rabbit aorta. Then candidate clones were further tested using a binding assay to WHHL rabbit aorta strips. Clones reactive to materials in human and rabbit sera proteins were omitted. A clone was finally established after these selections and was named ASH1a/256C (atheroma,surface, human). 123I-Labeled ASH1a/256C antibody was injected intravenously into normal and WHHL rabbits. These rabbits were sacrificed 48 h after injection, and the distribution of the labeled antibody in isolated aortas was visualized by autoradiography (Fig.1). Fatty streaks were observed in the WHHL rabbit aorta but not in the normal rabbit aorta. Lesion formation was prominent in the aortic arch and at the points of vessel branching. The radioactivity was co-localized with the atherosclerotic plaques in the WHHL rabbit aorta. In contrast, the area that was free of visible lesions in the WHHL aorta and the aorta from normal rabbit were negative. The antibody reacted strongly to atheromatous homogenates from human and WHHL rabbits but did not react to homogenates from normal rabbits (Fig. 2). Furthermore, this antibody also bound to atheromatous lesions in WHHL rabbit aortae as shown by an in vitro binding assay (see “Materials and Methods”). These results show that this monoclonal antibody recognizes atherosclerotic lesions both in vivo and in vitro.Figure 2The reaction of ASH1a/256C to homogenates and lipid extracts of rabbit aortae. Lipids were extracted from homogenates of rabbit aortas with chloroform and methanol. The homogenates (10 μg of protein each; hatched columns), corresponding amounts of the lipid extracts (open columns), and the residual fractions (closed columns) were coated onto microtiter plates. Then ASH1a/256C was added to the plates to carry out the ELISA assay as described under “Materials and Methods” to measure their antigenicity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The antigen of ASH1a/256C was effectively extracted with chloroform and methanol from homogenates of rabbit aorta with the residual fractions having no antigenicity, suggesting that the antigen is likely to be lipid (Fig. 2). The reactivity of the antibody to the lipid extracts from the WHHL rabbit aorta was 8-fold greater than that from the same amount (10 μg of protein) of normal rabbit aorta homogenate. When the same amount of phospholipid extracted from either the WHHL aorta or normal rabbit aorta was used as antigen, the antigenic activity in WHHL extract was 3.9-fold higher than the extract from normal rabbit by phospholipid basis (data not shown). When the antigenicity of homogenates of several tissues to ASH1a/256C was examined by ELISA, kidney and xanthoma as well as aorta from WHHL rabbits showed strong activities (data not shown). The lipid extracts obtained from atheroma and kidney of WHHL rabbits were fractionated by silica gel column chromatography followed by HPLC. The identity of the antigens obtained from atheroma and kidney was investigated by the following experiments. First, when the partially purified antigens were analyzed by TLC immunostaining using ASH1a/256C, both samples showed single bands with the same Rf values (Fig.3). Second, the antigens from these tissues were eluted from the HPLC column with the same retention times (data not shown). Finally, the same molecular mass numbers were obtained for these antigens by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). Therfore, the antigens in atheroma and kidney could be identical. The antigen was purified from both the aorta and kidney of WHHL rabbits. The antigen purified from the kidney was used to perform structural analyses (see below), because the quantity of the antigen purified from rabbit aorta was very limited. Fig.4 shows data from the antigen purification from kidney, and the profiles were almost the same as those of aorta. Initially, a step-wise elution from a silica gel column was performed to remove large amount of neutral lipids (Fig.4 A). The antigen was eluted in fraction III (chloroform:methanol:water, 6:4:1), whereas fractions I and II had no reactivity. Triacylglycerol and CE were mostly recovered in fraction I (data not shown). Fraction III was then applied to a straight phase HPLC with a gradient elution using hexane:2-propanol:water (44:55:1 to 33:55:12). The antigenic activity was eluted at 44 min as a single peak (Fig.4 B). This fraction was further purified on the same HPLC column using a different solvent system (Fig. 4 C). The purified antigen, which was eluted at 23 min as a single peak by the second HPLC, showed a single spot on two-dimensional TLC (data not shown). The antigen purified from WHHL rabbit kidney underwent a number of structural analyses. No signal corresponding to either ketone, aldehyde, acid anhydride, or free carboxylic acid was observed by Fourier transfer infrared spectrum of the antigen; however, the spectrum did suggest the presence of ester bonds (C=O; 1735 cm−1) (data not shown). The presence of two ester bonds (C=O; 172 ppm) was confirmed by a 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 5 A). Signals corresponding to two C=C double bonds (127 and 129 ppm) were also observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. Furthermore, one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR analysis (NMR-COSY) of the antigen was performed to identify its molecular structure. The signals marked in alphabets in the 1H NMR spectrum of the antigen were identified as described in the legend of Fig. 5. The spectrum of the antigen was found to be very similar to that of sn-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC (Fig. 5, C and D). One particular signal (d = 3.1 ppm; 9H, marked with asterisks in Fig. 5 (C and D), corresponds to signal e) did not interact with any other signal, suggesting that there is no proton in close proximity to the nine hydrogen atoms in the antigen, as is the case with the N-trimethylamino group of the authentic sn-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC. These results strongly suggest that the antigen is PC. Analyses of the antigen by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry showed several peaks ranging from m/z = 756–808. One of the peaks (m/z = 758) corresponds to palmitoyl-linoleoyl PC. The molecular species of the antigenic PC were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Fig.6). Several antigenic peaks appeared, and a major antigenic peak at 21 min and a large peak at 29 min were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as palmitoyl-linoleoyl PC and stearoyl-linoleoyl PC, respectively. It appears that the antigenic PC consists of several molecular species with different combinations of fatty acids. The possibility that certain compounds other than PC are present in the purified antigen is very unlikely for two reasons: first, the antigen was purified to homogeneity by two-dimensional TLC by which most of the phospholipid classes were separated, and, second, all of the signals (apart from one corresponding to the N-trimethylamino group in the NMR-COSY analysis) interacted with other signals. Therefore all of the signals were related to one structure. These results confirm that the monoclonal antibody ASH1a/256C recognizes PC molecules containing PUFA. To investigate specificity of ASH1a/256C to recognize PC, reactivity of the antibody to various phospholipids, neutral lipids, and PC-related compounds was examined by ELISA (Table I, experiment 1). The antibody did not react to phosphatidylethanolamine, monomethyl phosphatidylethanolamine, or dimethyl phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the binding was specific for the choline-containing head group. Because these three phospholipids were prepared from egg PC by a head exchange reaction, their fatty acid compositions are essentially the same (palmitic acid, 50%; oleic acid, 25%, palmitoleic acid; linoleic acid, 16%; stearic acid, 8%). Other phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol had no reactivity with the antibody. All the neutral lipids tested were also negative. Platelet-activating factor and sphingomyelin were not antigenic, although they share the choline head group. It seems that not only the choline head group but certain combinations of acyl groups are necessary for antigen recognition.Table IReactivity of various lipids against ASH1a/256CLipidsRelative activityExperiment 1 Egg PC1.00 Egg dimethyl PE0.00 Egg monomethyl PE0.00 Egg PE0.05 Egg PA0.00 Egg lysoPC0.00 Yeast phosphatidylserine0.00 Yeast phosp"
