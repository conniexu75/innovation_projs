https://openalex.org/W2917553271,"Wheat is one of the most important cereals, whose growth and development is strongly limited by drought. This study investigated the physiological and metabolic response of six winter wheat cultivars to drought with the emphasis on the induction of dominant metabolites affected by the treatment and genotypes or both. The plants were exposed to a moderate (non-lethal) drought stress, which was induced by withholding watering for six days under controlled greenhouse conditions. A decline in CO2 assimilation (Pn) and transpiration rate, stomata closure, a decrease in relative water content (RWC) and increase of malondialdehyde content were observed in drought-treated plants of all cultivars. These changes were most pronounced in Ellvis, while Soissons was able to retain the higher RWC and Pn. Among the studied metabolites, sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, several disaccharides), organic acids (malic acid, oxalic acids), amino acids (proline, threonine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine) and sugar alcohols such as myo-inositol accumulated to higher levels in the plants exposed to drought stress in comparison with the control. The accumulation of several metabolites in response to drought differed between the genotypes. Drought induced the production of sucrose, malic acid and oxalic acid, unknown organic acid 1, unknown disaccharide 1, 2 and 3, GABA, L-threonine, glutamic acid in four (Soissons, Žitarka, Antonija or Toborzó) out of six genotypes. In addition, Soissons, which was the most drought tolerant genotype, accumulated the highest amount of unknown disaccharide 5, galactonic and phosphoric acids. The two most drought sensitive cultivars, Srpanjka and Ellvis, demonstrated different metabolic adjustment in response to the stress treatment. Srpanjka responded to drought by increasing the amount of glucose and fructose originated from hydrolyses of sucrose and accumulating unidentified sugar alcohols 1 and 2. In Ellvis, drought caused inhibition of photosynthetic carbon metabolism, as evidence by the decreased Pn, gs, RWC and accumulation levels of sugar metabolites (sucrose, glucose and fructose). The results revealed the differences in metabolic response to drought among the genotypes, which drew attention on metabolites related with general response and on those metabolites which are part of specific response that may play an important role in drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2915873263,"The All Of Us Research Program (AOU) is building a nationwide cohort of one million patients' EHR and genomic data. Data interoperability is paramount to the program's success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model.Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research projects."
https://openalex.org/W2916778535,"Objective The rapid proliferation of machine learning research using electronic health records to classify healthcare outcomes offers an opportunity to address the pressing public health problem of adolescent suicidal behavior. We describe the development and evaluation of a machine learning algorithm using natural language processing of electronic health records to identify suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Methods Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit in a community health system in the northeastern United States were surveyed for history of suicide attempt in the past 12 months. A total of 73 respondents had electronic health records available prior to the index psychiatric admission. Unstructured clinical notes were downloaded from the year preceding the index inpatient admission. Natural language processing identified phrases from the notes associated with the suicide attempt outcome. We enriched this group of phrases with a clinically focused list of terms representing known risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in adolescents. We then applied the random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classification model. The model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Results The final model had a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.22, AUC of 0.68, a PPV of 0.42, NPV of 0.67, and an accuracy of 0.47. The terms mostly highly associated with suicide attempt clustered around terms related to suicide, family members, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications. Conclusion This analysis demonstrates modest success of a natural language processing and machine learning approach to identifying suicide attempt among a small sample of hospitalized adolescents in a psychiatric setting."
https://openalex.org/W2917247632,"The sterile insect technique (SIT) may offer a means to control the transmission of mosquito borne diseases. SIT involves the release of male insects that have been sterilized by exposure to ionizing radiation. We determined the effects of different doses of radiation on the survival and reproductive capacity of local strains of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus in southern Mexico. The survival of irradiated pupae was invariably greater than 90% and did not differ significantly in either sex for either species. Irradiation had no significant adverse effects on the flight ability (capacity to fly out of a test device) of male mosquitoes, which consistently exceeded 91% in Ae. aegypti and 96% in Ae. albopictus. The average number of eggs laid per female was significantly reduced in Ae. aegypti at doses of 15 and 30 Gy and no eggs were laid by females that had been exposed to 50 Gy. Similarly, in Ae. albopictus, egg production was reduced at doses of 15 and 25 Gy and was eliminated at 35 Gy. In Ae. aegypti, fertility in males was eliminated at 70 Gy and was eliminated at 30 Gy in females, whereas in Ae. albopictus, the fertility of males that mated with untreated females was almost zero (0.1%) in the 50 Gy treatment and female fertility was eliminated at 35 Gy. Irradiation treatments resulted in reduced ovary length and fewer follicles in both species. The adult median survival time of both species was reduced by irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. However, sterilizing doses of 35 Gy and 50 Gy resulted in little reduction in survival times of males of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, indicating that these doses should be suitable for future evaluations of SIT-based control of these species. The results of the present study will be applied to studies of male sexual competitiveness and to stepwise evaluations of the sterile insect technique for population suppression of these vectors in Mexico."

However, the reverse POP transport can occur if relative contaminant concentrations are higher in the organism than in the microplastic. We evaluated the effect of microplastic on the PCB removal in planktonic animals by exposing the cladoceran Daphnia magna with a high body burden of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 18, 40, 128 and 209) to a mixture of microplastic and algae; daphnids exposed to only algae served as the control. As the endpoints, we used PCB body burden, growth, fecundity and elemental composition (%C and %N) of the daphnids. In the daphnids fed with microplastic, PCB 209 was removed more efficiently, while there was no difference for any other congeners and ΣPCBs between the microplastic-exposed and control animals. Also, higher size-specific egg production in the animals carrying PCB and receiving food mixed with microplastics was observed. However, the effects of the microplastic exposure on fecundity were of low biological significance, because the PCB body burden and the microplastic exposure concentrations were greatly exceeding environmentally relevant concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2918091469,"TFCP2L1 (transcription factor CP2-like 1) is a transcriptional regulator critical for maintaining mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency. However, the direct TFCP2L1 target genes are uncharacterized. Here, using gene overexpression, immunoblotting, quantitative real-time PCR, ChIP, and reporter gene assays, we show that TFCP2L1 primarily induces estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb) expression that supports mouse ESC identity and also selectively enhances Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) expression and thereby promotes human ESC self-renewal. Specifically, we found that in mouse ESCs, TFCP2L1 binds directly to the Esrrb gene promoter and regulates its transcription. Esrrb knockdown impaired Tfcp2l1's ability to induce interleukin 6 family cytokine (leukemia inhibitory factor)–independent ESC self-renewal and to reprogram epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency. Conversely, Esrrb overexpression blocked differentiation induced by Tfcp2l1 down-regulation. Moreover, we identified Klf4 as a direct TFCP2L1 target in human ESCs, bypassing the requirement for activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor in short-term human ESC self-renewal. Enforced Klf4 expression recapitulated the self-renewal–promoting effect of Tfcp2l1, whereas Klf4 knockdown eliminated these effects and caused loss of colony-forming capability. These findings indicate that TFCP2L1 functions differently in naive and primed pluripotency, insights that may help elucidate the different states of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2917643380,"Background Effective interdisciplinary communication of imaging findings is vital for patient care, as referring physicians depend on the contained information for the decision-making and subsequent treatment. Traditional radiology reports contain non-structured free text and potentially tangled information in narrative language, which can hamper the information transfer and diminish the clarity of the report. Therefore, this study investigates whether newly developed structured reports (SRs) of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve interdisciplinary communication, as compared to non-structured reports (NSRs). Methods 50 NSRs and 50 SRs describing a single prostatic lesion were presented to four urologists with expert level experience in prostate cancer surgery or targeted MRI TRUS fusion biopsy. They were subsequently asked to plot the tumor location in a 2-dimensional prostate diagram and to answer a questionnaire focusing on information on clinically relevant key features as well as the perceived structure of the report. A validated scoring system that distinguishes between “major” and “minor” mistakes was used to evaluate the accuracy of the plotting of the tumor position in the prostate diagram. Results The mean total score for accuracy for SRs was significantly higher than for NSRs (28.46 [range 13.33–30.0] vs. 21.75 [range 0.0–30.0], p < 0.01). The overall rates of major mistakes (54% vs. 10%) and minor mistakes (74% vs. 22%) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) for NSRs than for SRs. The rate of radiologist re-consultations was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for SRs than for NSRs (19% vs. 85%). Furthermore, SRs were rated as significantly superior to NSRs in regard to determining the clinical tumor stage (p < 0.01), the quality of the summary (4.4 vs. 2.5; p < 0.01), and overall satisfaction with the report (4.5 vs. 2.3; p < 0.01), and as more valuable for further clinical decision-making and surgical planning (p < 0.01). Conclusions Structured reporting of prostate MRI has the potential to improve interdisciplinary communication. Through SRs, expert urologists were able to more accurately assess the exact location of single prostate cancer lesions, which can facilitate surgical planning. Furthermore, structured reporting of prostate MRI leads to a higher satisfaction level of the referring physician."
https://openalex.org/W2952765203,"Many plants have natural partnerships with microbes that can boost their nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) acquisition. To assess whether wheat may have undiscovered associations of these types, we tested if N/P-starved Triticum aestivum show microbiome profiles that are simultaneously different from those of N/P-amended plants and those of their own bulk soils. The bacterial and fungal communities of root, rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples from the Historical Dryland Plots (Lethbridge, Canada), which hold T. aestivum that is grown both under N/P fertilization and in conditions of extreme N/P-starvation, were taxonomically described and compared (bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacers—ITS). As the list may include novel N- and/or P-providing wheat partners, we then identified all the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were proportionally enriched in one or more of the nutrient starvation- and plant-specific communities. These analyses revealed: a) distinct N-starvation root and rhizosphere bacterial communities that were proportionally enriched, among others, in OTUs belonging to families Enterobacteriaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Cytophagaceae, Streptomycetaceae, b) distinct N-starvation root fungal communities that were proportionally enriched in OTUs belonging to taxa Lulworthia, Sordariomycetes, Apodus, Conocybe, Ascomycota, Crocicreas, c) a distinct P-starvation rhizosphere bacterial community that was proportionally enriched in an OTU belonging to genus Agrobacterium, and d) a distinct P-starvation root fungal community that was proportionally enriched in OTUs belonging to genera Parastagonospora and Phaeosphaeriopsis. Our study might have exposed wheat-microbe connections that can form the basis of novel complementary yield-boosting tools."

The mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in podocytes is not fully understood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is critical in maintaining NADPH, which is an important cofactor for the antioxidant system. Here, we hypothesized that high glucose induced ubiquitination and degradation of G6PD, which injured podocytes by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We found that G6PD protein expression was decreased in kidneys of both diabetic patients and diabetic rodents. G6PD activity was also reduced in diabetic mice. Overexpressing G6PD reversed redox imbalance and podocyte apoptosis induced by high glucose and palmitate. Inhibition of G6PD with small interfering RNA induced podocyte apoptosis. In kidneys of G6PD-deficient mice, podocyte apoptosis was significantly increased. Interestingly, high glucose had no effect on G6PD mRNA expression. Decreased G6PD protein expression was mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. We found that the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, directly bound to G6PD and degraded G6PD through ubiquitylating G6PD on K366 and K403. In summary, our data suggest that high glucose induces ubiquitination of G6PD by VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, which leads to ROS accumulation and podocyte injury.-Wang, M., Hu, J., Yan, L., Yang, Y., He, M., Wu, M., Li, Q., Gong, W., Yang, Y., Wang, Y., Handy, D.

Additionally, modifications located in the anticodon loop, but outside the anticodon itself, stabilize tRNA–codon interactions, increasing decoding fidelity. Anticodon loop nucleotide 37 is 3′ to the anticodon and, in tRNACGGPro, is methylated at the N1 position in its nucleobase (m1G37). The m1G37 modification in tRNACGGPro stabilizes its interaction with the codon and maintains the mRNA frame. However, it is unclear how m1G37 affects binding at the decoding center to both cognate and +1 slippery codons. Here, we show that the tRNACGGPro m1G37 modification is important for the association step during binding to a cognate CCG codon. In contrast, m1G37 prevented association with a slippery CCC-U or +1 codon. Similar analyses of frameshift suppressor tRNASufA6, a tRNACGGPro derivative containing an extra nucleotide in its anticodon loop that undergoes +1 frameshifting, reveal that m1G37 destabilizes interactions with both the cognate CCG and slippery codons. One reason for this destabilization is the disruption of a conserved U32·A38 nucleotide pairing in the anticodon stem through insertion of G37.5. Restoring the tRNASufA6 U32·A37.5 pairing results in a high-affinity association on the slippery CCC-U codon. Further, an X-ray crystal structure of the 70S ribosome bound to tRNASufA6 U32·A37.5 at 3.6 Å resolution shows a reordering of the anticodon loop consistent with the findings from the high-affinity measurements.

Protein synthesis is performed by the ribosome, a conserved protein–RNA macromolecular machine where mRNA, tRNAs, and translation factors read the genetic information as presented on mRNA into proteins. There are four defined stages of protein synthesis: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling (reviewed in Ref. 1Schmeing T.M. Ramakrishnan V.

Because tRNAs decode mRNAs, these RNA molecules probably play a role in mRNA frame maintenance. tRNAs are ∼76–90 nucleotides in length and adopt an L-shaped tertiary structure allowing them to fit into ribosome-binding sites that span both subunits (Fig. 1). tRNAs undergo extensive post-transcriptional modifications important for the correct tertiary fold of the tRNA, including the conformation of the anticodon stem-loop (ASL) (3Agris P.F.

The selection of the correct tRNA for each mRNA codon relies on the formation of Watson–Crick base pairs between the first two nucleotides of the codon and nucleotides 36 and 35 of the anticodon (Fig. 1A). The interaction between the third nucleotide of the codon and anticodon nucleotide 34 is not required to be Watson–Crick. Instead, a G·U wobble pair or a modified anticodon nucleotide 34–codon nucleotide pair can form. The modification of nucleotide 34 enables non-Watson–Crick interactions with the third nucleotide position of the mRNA that is accepted as cognate by the ribosome. The increased flexibility in codons that each tRNA can decode allows for the degeneracy of the genetic code where the 61 codons are decoded by fewer tRNAs (10Hou Y.M. Gamper H. Yang W. Post-transcriptional modifications to tRNA–a response to the genetic code degeneracy.RNA. 2015; 21 (25780173): 642-64410.1261/rna.049825.115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, tRNA modifications at nucleotide 34 have an important and essential role in the process of decoding. Nucleotide 34 contains many diverse modifications that are typically required for accurate translation (11Boccaletto P. Machnicka M.A. Purta E. Piatkowski P. Baginski B.

Although all of these codon–anticodon pairings should be recognized by the ribosome, the instability of the anticodon loop of tRNAUUULys and, thus, its interactions with the AAA codon require both modifications at nucleotides 34 and 37. Nucleotide 37 of the tRNA is located 3′ to the anticodon, adjacent to the first position of the Watson–Crick base pair between the codon and anticodon nucleotide 36 (Fig. 1A). The codon–anticodon pairing between tRNAUUULys and its codon is weak in the absence of the modifications because of the three A-U base pairs and poor stacking of the UUU anticodon (15Agris P.F.

In bacteria, the essential methyltransferase TrmD (Trm5 in eukaryotes and archaea) catalyzes the N1-methylation of G37 in tRNAs.

In this case, frameshift suppressor tRNASufA6, isolated from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, contains an eight-nucleotide anticodon loop by the addition of G37.5 that causes +1 frameshifting. The structure of 70S-tRNASufA6 bound to CCC-A/U/C codons at the decoding center that undergo +1 frameshifting revealed similarities to the structure of 70S–tRNACGGPro lacking the m1G37 bound to a near-cognate codon that also promotes +1 frameshifting (31Maehigashi T.

Both tRNAs decode the mRNA in the unshifted or zero frame, indicating that the shift into the new frame occurred post-decoding. Moreover, the inserted 37.5 nucleotide and the lack of m1G37 both cause destabilization of nucleotides on the opposite side of the anticodon loop that ablates a conserved, non-Watson–Crick U32·A38 pairing. The 32·38 pairing was restored in both the tRNAPro and tRNASufA6 in the context of recognizing a cognate, three-nucleotide codon. The disruption of the 32·38 pairing is particularly notable due to its universal significance in tuning the ribosomal binding across tRNAs (39Olejniczak M. Dale T. Fahlman R.P. Uhlenbeck O.C. Idiosyncratic tuning of tRNAs to achieve uniform ribosome binding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12 (16116437): 788-79310.1038/nsmb978Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results provide insight into how tRNA modifications and the 32·38 pairing in the anticodon loop together lead to mRNA frame maintenance. Here, we tested how the m1G37 modification in tRNACGGPro and tRNASufA6 impacts binding at the decoding center to cognate and slippery +1 codons. Further, we engineer tRNASufA6 to contain a conserved U32·A38 pairing to attempt to restore high-affinity binding to the decoding center. Last, a 3.6 Å X-ray crystal structure of tRNASufA6 containing this engineered 32·38 pairing bound to the 70S ribosomal A site reveals a reordering of the 32·38 pair required for decoding. To assess the importance of the m1G37 modification in tRNACGGPro in decoding, we used established filter binding assays to determine binding kinetics to the A site (39Olejniczak M. Dale T. Fahlman R.P. Uhlenbeck O.C. Idiosyncratic tuning of tRNAs to achieve uniform ribosome binding.Nat. Struct. Mol.

E. coli 70S ribosomes were programmed with mRNA containing a peptidyl-site (P-site) AUG start codon, an A-site proline CCG codon, and P-site E. coli tRNAfMet. We used a chemically synthesized ASL containing 18 nucleotides of tRNACGGPro and a m1G37 modification to ensure that the RNA was completely modified (Table S1). ASLCGGPro with the m1G37 modification binds to a cognate CCG codon in the A site with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 284 nm (Fig. 2A and Table S2). This affinity is within the range of reported values for ASLs binding to the A site (33–500 nm) (9Phelps S.S. Jerinic O. Joseph S.

Removal of the m1G37 modification (Δm1G37) significantly reduced binding, by ∼6.5-fold (1.8 μm; Fig. 2A and Table S2).

Furthermore, impractical 70S concentrations required to reach maximum binding for weaker interactions prevented us from attempting to continue with this approach. Therefore, we instead performed competition binding assays, which allow for the calculation of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) based on measured association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates (Fig. 2B) (42Fahlman R.P. Uhlenbeck O.C.

Unlike measuring the experimental Kd to observe equilibrium binding, the kon and koff measurements provide information regarding the influence of the m1G37 modification at each step of the binding event separately (i.e. the association with and dissociation from the ribosomal A site). Using this approach, we found a modest difference in koff between ASLCGGPro and ASLCGGPro Δm1G37, implying that the modification does not stabilize tRNA binding to ribosomes. Instead, the m1G37 modification is important for initial binding, as shown by the 2.6-fold slower association rate of ASLCGGPro Δm1G37 (kon = 0.012 μm−1 min−1) as compared with ASLCGGPro (kon = 0.031 μm−1 min−1) to the CCG A-site codon (Fig. 2 (C and D) and Table 1). These data are consistent with 70S structures demonstrating conformational distortion of the anticodon loop in the absence of the m1G37 modification (31Maehigashi T. Dunkle J.A. Miles S.J.

The present study aimed at investigating the temporal and spatial dynamics of deltamethrin resistance in An. gambiae s.l. populations from North Cameroon. Mosquito larvae were collected from 24 settings of the Garoua, Pitoa and Mayo Oulo Health Districts (HDs) from 2011 to 2015. Two to five days old female An. gambiae s.l. emerging from larval collections were tested for deltamethrin resistance using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) standard protocol. Sub samples of test mosquitoes were identified to species using PCR-RFLP and genotyped for knockdown resistance alleles (Kdr 1014F and 1014S) using Hot Ligation Oligonucleotide Assay (HOLA). All the tested mosquitoes were identified as belonging to the An. gambiae complex, including 3 sibling species mostly represented by Anopheles arabiensis (67.6%), followed by Anopheles coluzzii (25.4%) and Anopheles gambiae (7%). Deltamethrin resistance frequencies increased significantly between 2011 and 2015, with mosquito mortality rates declining from 70–85% to 49–73% in the three HDs (Jonckheere-Terstra test statistic (JT) = 5638, P< 0.001), although a temporary increase of mortality rates (91–97%) was seen in the Pitoa and Mayo Oulo HDs in 2012. Overall, confirmed resistance emerged in 10 An. gambiae s.l. populations over the 24 field populations monitored during the study period, from 2011 to 2015. Phenotypic resistance was mostly found in urban settings compared with semi-urban and rural settings (JT = 5282, P< 0.0001), with a spatial autocorrelation between neighboring localities. The Kdr 1014F allelic frequencies in study HDs increased from 0–30% in 2011 to 18–61% in 2014–2015 (JT = 620, P <0.001), especially in An. coluzzii samples. The overall frequency of the Kdr 1014S allele was 0.1%. This study revealed a rapid increase and widespread deltamethrin resistance frequency as well as Kdr 1014F allelic frequencies in An. gambiae s.l. populations over time, emphasizing the urgent need for vector surveillance and insecticide resistance management strategies in Cameroon."
https://openalex.org/W2917588801,"Lyme disease, the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in North America, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis in eastern Canada and Ixodes pacificus in western Canada. Recently, the northward range expansion of I. scapularis ticks, in south-eastern Canada, has resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of human Lyme disease. Detecting emerging areas of Lyme disease risk allows public health to target disease prevention efforts. We analysed passive tick surveillance data from Ontario and Manitoba to i) assess the relationship between the total numbers of I. scapularis submissions in passive surveillance from humans, and the number of human Lyme disease cases, and ii) develop province-specific acarological indicators of risk that can be used to generate surveillance-based risk maps. We also assessed associations between numbers of nymphal I. scapularis tick submissions only and Lyme disease case incidence. Using General Estimating Equation regression, the relationship between I. scapularis submissions (total numbers and numbers of nymphs only) in each census sub-division (CSD) and the number of reported Lyme disease cases was positively correlated and highly significant in the two provinces (P ≤ 0.001). The numbers of I. scapularis submissions over five years discriminated CSDs with ≥ 3 Lyme disease cases from those with < 3 cases with high accuracy when using total numbers of tick submission (Receiver Operating Characteristics area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89) and moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.78) when using nymphal tick submissions only. In Ontario the optimal cut-off point was a total 12 tick submissions from a CSD over five years (Sensitivity = 0.82, Specificity = 0.84), while in Manitoba the cut-off point was five ticks (Sensitivity = 0.71, Specificity = 0.79) suggesting regional variability of the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from an I. scapularis bite. The performances of the acarological indicators developed in this study for Ontario and Manitoba support the ability of passive tick surveillance to provide an early signal of the existence Lyme disease risk areas in regions where ticks and the pathogens they transmit are expanding their range."

In this study, we identified and characterized mosquito blood meals from both urban and forested areas in the city of Paranaguá, state of Paraná, Brazil, by analyzing the amplification of host DNA ingested by mosquitoes under different storage conditions and digestion levels. Host DNA preservation was evaluated in fresh blood meals according to storage duration (30 to 180 days) and temperature (-20°C / -80°C) and, in digested blood, according the degree of digestion classified on the Sella scale. Molecular analysis of blood meals was based on DNA extraction and amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene. We determined that, up to180 days of storage, the evaluated temperatures did not influence the preservation of fresh blood meals DNA, whereas the amplification success was increasingly reduced over the course of the digestion process. The species Anopheles cruzii, Aedes fluviatilis, Aedes scapularis, Psorophora ferox, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex mollis, and Culex intrincatus, together with specimens representing four subgenera and one genus of Culicidae [Ae. (Ochlerotatus), Cx. (Culex), Cx. (Melanoconion), Cx. (Microculex), and Limatus, respectively] had their blood meals identified. Their diverse host use was evidenced by the identification of 19 species of vertebrate host, namely two amphibians, three mammals and 14 birds. Birds were the most commonly identified host in blood meals. These results not only show the diversity of mosquito hosts, but also underscore the challenges involved in monitoring arboviruses of public health importance, given potential combinations of host use for each mosquito species."
https://openalex.org/W2972691774,"Lysophospholipids (LPLs) are important lipid-signaling molecules in plants, of which lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is one of the most well-characterized LPLs, having important roles in plant stress responses. It is broken down by lysophospholipases, but the molecular mechanism involved in lysoPC degradation is unclear. Recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana ACYL-CoA–BINDING PROTEIN2 (AtACBP2) has been reported to bind lysoPC via its acyl-CoA–binding domain and also LYSOPHOSPHOLIPASE 2 (AtLYSOPL2) via its ankyrin repeats in vitro. To investigate the interactions of AtACBP2 with AtLYSOPL2 and lysoPC in more detail, we conducted isothermal titration calorimetry with AtACBP270–354, an AtACBP2 derivative consisting of amino acids 70–354, containing both the acyl-CoA–binding domain and ankyrin repeats. We observed that the interactions of AtACBP270–354 with AtLYSOPL2 and lysoPC were both endothermic, favored by solvation entropy and opposed by enthalpy, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. Of note, three AtLYSOPL2 catalytic triad mutant proteins (S147A, D268A, and H298A) bound lysoPC only weakly, with an exothermic burst and dissociation constants in the millimolar range. Furthermore, the binding affinity of lysoPC-premixed AtACBP270–354 to AtLYSOPL2 was 10-fold higher than that of AtACBP270–354 alone to AtLYSOPL2. We conclude that AtACBP2 may play a role in facilitating a direct interaction between AtLYSOPL2 and lysoPC. Our results suggest that AtACBP270–354 probably binds to lysoPC through a hydrophobic interface that enhances a hydrotropic interaction of AtACBP270–354 with AtLYSOPL2 and thereby facilitates AtLYSOPL2′s lysophospholipase function.

AtLYSOPL2 can be grouped with monoacylglycerol lipases (MAGL), including 15 Arabidopsis homologues of the AtLYSOPL1 family, because they all showed high sequence homology in BLAST scores (≥75) to human monoglyceride lipase (MGL) (GB NP_009214), and all 16 Arabidopsis putative MAGLs (AtMAGLs) displayed 3D structures that are similar to a Homo sapiens MAGL (HsMAGL) (Protein Data Bank code 3HJU) (20Kim R.J.

In addition, AtLYSOPL2 (AT1G52760) was also identified as a caffeoyl shikimate esterase, an enzyme central to the lignin biosynthetic pathway (22Vanholme R. Cesarino I. Rataj K. Xiao Y. Sundin L.

It has been suggested that AtLYSOPL2 overexpressors were more tolerant to H2O2 and Cd than the wildtype (WT) because AtLYSOPL2 enhances phospholipid repair following lipid peroxidation (19Gao W.

Both AtLYSOPL2 and AtACBP2 mRNAs were elevated by Cd treatment; Zn and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but not lead (Pb), Cd, or copper (Cu), induced AtLYSOPL2 expression in shoots, whereas only H2O2 up-regulated AtLYSOPL2 expression in roots (19Gao W.

Microarray data from the Arabidopsis Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph Browser revealed that AtLYSOPL2 was inducible by biotic stresses caused by salicylic acid, bacterial-derived elicitor Flg22, and Pseudomonas syringae, besides various abiotic stresses, including cold, drought, genotoxicity (bleomycin plus mitomycin), oxidative treatment (methyl viologen), UV-B light, wounding, heat, and selenium (34Winter D.

To better understand the role of AtACBP2 and AtLYSOPL2 in stress tolerance, the in vitro energetics of their interactions were investigated. The thermodynamic analysis reported here provides new insights on AtACBP2, AtLYSOPL2, and lysoPC interactions. AtACBP2 (AT4G27780) consists of amino acids (aa) 1–354 comprising a signal peptide (aa 1–6), transmembrane domain (aa 7–69), the acyl-CoA–binding domain (aa 70–214) and the ankyrin repeats (aa 215–354) (Fig. 1A). The transmembrane domain (aa 7–69) was deleted in AtACBP270–354, because the truncated version (AtACBP270–354) enhanced AtACBP2 expression and solubility. The AtACBP270–354 interaction with lipid ligands and AtLYSOPL2 was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which quantifies the binding equilibrium directly by measuring the heat change resulting from the association of a ligand with its binding partner (35Pierce M.M. Raman C.S. Nall B.T. Isothermal titration calorimetry of protein–protein interactions.Methods. 1999; 19 (10527727): 213-22110.1006/meth.1999.0852Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). ITC thermograms showed that AtACBP270–354, an AtACBP2 derivative consisting of aa 70–354 inclusive of the acyl-CoA–binding domain and the ankyrin repeats, binds to both lysoPC (C16:0) and palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0–CoA) thioesters (Fig. 1, B and C). The primary heat change of AtACBP270–354–lysoPC (Fig. 1B) and AtACBP270–354–C16:0–CoA (Fig. 1C) interactions was fitted using a simple one-site binding model to yield the thermodynamic parameters (Table 1). AtACBP270–354 showed a higher binding affinity to C16:0–CoA than lysoPC, with KD values of 0.64 and 39.2 μm, respectively (Table 1).Table 1ITC binding constants and thermodynamic parameters for AtACBP270–354 interactions with palmitoyl-CoA and lysoPCCombinationsnKDΔH−TΔSΔGμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1AtACBP270–354/palmitoyl-CoA1.73 α 0.030.64 α 0.09−4.51 α 0.13−3.93−8.44 α 0.13AtACBP270–354/lysoPC1.22 α 0.4239.2 α 8.416.17 α 6.8−22.17−6.05 α 6.8The values are plotted in Fig. 1.

Interestingly, the thermodynamic characteristics of interactions between AtACBP270–354–lysoPC (Fig. 1B) and AtACBP270–354–C16:0–CoA (Fig. 1C) were fundamentally different. AtACBP270–354–lysoPC interaction represented an unusual endothermic association with favorable entropy (−TΔS −22.17 kcal mol−1) and opposed by enthalpy (ΔH 16.17 kcal mol−1) (Table 1), which suggests that the binding of AtACBP270–354 to lysoPC is supported by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1D). For lysoPC, the stoichiometric value (n) was 1.22, indicating that one molecule of AtACBP270–354 binds to only one lysoPC ligand (Table 1). The AtACBP270–354–C16:0–CoA interaction was exothermic, favored by both enthalpy (ΔH −4.51 kcal mol−1) and entropy (−TΔS −3.93 kcal mol−1), suggesting that the binding of AtACBP270–354 to C16:0–CoA is composed of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1D). In addition, the interaction between AtACBP270–354 and C16:0–CoA showed an n value of 1.73 (Table 1), indicating that one molecule of AtACBP270–354 likely binds to two C16:0–CoA ligands. The stoichiometry value observed here resembles that (n = 1.7) previously reported for the C2B and C2G domains of dysferlin, which was presumed to bind to two Ca2+ ions (36Abdullah N.

The effect of lysoPC on the AtLYSOPL2–AtACBP270–354 (Fig. 2A) interaction was determined by ITC. Theoretical fits to the experimental data were achieved using a single binding site model with the thermodynamic parameters listed in Table 2, including dissociation constant (KD), stoichiometry of the ligand-to-protein binding (n), enthalpy change (ΔH), the entropy change (ΔS), and free energy change (ΔG). ITC thermograms revealed that binding of AtLYSOPL2 (Fig. 2B) or the AtLYSOPL2–lysoPC complex (Fig. 2C) to AtACBP270–354 was highly endothermic. The interactions were driven by favorable entropy −TΔS of −15.38 and −15.29 kcal mol−1 and opposed by enthalpy changes ΔH of 9.55 and 9.65 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table 2). The binding mechanism of AtLYSOPL2–AtACBP270–354 is similar to AtACBP270–354–lysoPC and is assumed to be based on hydrophobic interactions following a conformational change (Fig. 2D).Table 2ITC binding constants and thermodynamic parameters for interactions of AtLYSOPL2 wildtype or mutant proteins with AtACBP270–354 with/without lysoPCCombinationsnKDΔH−TΔSΔGμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1AtACBP270–354/wildtype AtLYSOPL21.05 α 0.0128.98 α 3.369.55 α 0.26−15.38 α 0.13−5.93 α 0.12AtACBP270–354/wildtype AtLYSOPL2-lysoPC1.17 α 0.529.99 α 3.869.65 α 4−15.29 α 3.87−5.63 α 2.87AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 S147A0.56 α 0.220.7 α 1.0310.71 α 3.19−15.7 α 3.21−4.99 α 2.2AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 S147A-lysoPC0.36 α 0.0915.02 α 1.6318.1 α 2.17−24.47 α 1.77−6.37 α 1.9AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 D268A0.37 α 0.0812.39 α 0.249.27 α 1.16−15.94 α 1.18−6.67 α 1.4AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 D268A-lysoPC0.31 α 0.1210.17 α 4.329.63 α 2.46−16.42 α 1.79−6.79 α 1.88AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 H298A0.84 α 0.0325.64 α 2.496.42 α 1.2−12.67 α 1.45−5.27 α 1.84AtACBP270–354/AtLYSOPL2 H298A-lysoPC0.67 α 0.6623.04 α 2.147.63 α 0.7−14.23 α 1.12−6.62 α 1.11The values are plotted in Figure 2, Figure 5.

https://openalex.org/W2915679210,"Introduction Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease at present. Uncontrolled blood pressure leads to further complications including heart attack, stroke and chronic kidney disease. In Thailand, most of the information related to this issue is collected by hospitals or hospital-based organizations rather than at the community level. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension and to assess the relationship between patient characteristics (socio-behavioral and clinical) and uncontrolled blood pressure among hypertensive patients in the rural communities in the central areas in Thailand. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Na-Yao and Phra-Pleong rural communities of Thailand in 2018 using the total design method. In all, 406 individuals aged ≥18 years were interviewed using structured questionnaires related to demographic information, higher risk behavior, comorbidities and arthrometric measurement. Blood pressure was assessed for all participants. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg. Results The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was 54.4% (males: 59.8%; females: 52.4%). Uncontrolled blood pressure was associated with neck circumference more than 35.75 cm for males and 32.75 cm. for females (adjusted odds ratio; 1.66, 95% confidence interval; 1.03–2.68), sedentary behavior more than 5 hours a day (adjusted odds ratio; 2.03, 95% confidence interval; 1.28–3.23) and missed doctor appointments (adjusted odds ratio; 3.29, 95% confidence interval; 1.09–9.94). Conclusion Approximately one half of hypertensive patients in these rural communities had uncontrolled blood pressure. The Ministry of Public Health and health care providers should provide further strategies to prevent uncontrolled blood pressure’s complications."
https://openalex.org/W2917096404,"Growth hormone (GH) has an important function as an insulin antagonist with elevated insulin sensitivity evident in humans and mice lacking a functional GH receptor (GHR). We sought the molecular basis for this sensitivity by utilizing a panel of mice possessing specific deletions of GHR signaling pathways. Metabolic clamps and glucose homeostasis tests were undertaken in these obese adult C57BL/6 male mice, which indicated impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose disappearance rate were enhanced in muscle and adipose of mice lacking the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 via the GHR (Ghr-391-/-) as for GHR-null (GHR-/-) mice. These changes were associated with a striking inhibition of hepatic glucose output associated with altered glycogen metabolism and elevated hepatic glycogen content during unfed state. The enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with increased insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 activation along with activated downstream protein kinase B signaling cascades. Although phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck)-1 expression was unchanged, its inhibitory acetylation was elevated because of decreased sirtuin-2 expression, thereby promoting loss of PCK1. Loss of STAT5 signaling to defined chromatin immunoprecipitation targets would further increase lipogenesis, supporting hepatosteatosis while lowering glucose output. Finally, up-regulation of IL-15 expression in muscle, with increased secretion of adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 1 from adipose tissue, is expected to promote insulin sensitivity.-Chhabra, Y., Nelson, C. N., Plescher, M., Barclay, J. L., Smith, A. G., Andrikopoulos, S., Mangiafico, S., Waxman, D. J., Brooks, A. J., Waters, M. J.

We also examine the interaction between institutional delivery and demographic factors on the birth doses of the BCG and polio vaccines to better understand factors influencing vaccination. Methods Using the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, we calculated the distribution of the study population across different demographic and vaccination characteristics. We computed acceleration factors using a multivariable accelerated failure time model with a Weibull distribution to account for left and right censoring. For the birth doses, we further specified an interaction term between institutional delivery and every other a priori specified independent variable to test whether institutional delivery modifies sociodemographic disparities in vaccination timeliness. Results Low wealth status, home delivery, and ethnicity are risk factors for delayed vaccination of polio 1, DPT 1, pentavalent 1, and measles 1. Religion is a risk factor for measles 1 vaccination delay and rural residence are risk factors for delayed DPT1 and polio 1 doses. For birth doses of polio and BCG, institutional delivery attenuated many sociodemographic disparities in vaccination delay, except for urbanicity, which showed rural dwellers with more delay than urban dwellers with an institutional vs home birth. Conclusions Less delayed vaccination among children with institutional deliveries highlights the importance of perinatal care and the potential for promoting healthy behaviors to parents. Persistent disparities between urban and rural residents, even among those with institutional births, can be targeted for future interventions. Timely vaccination is key to prevention of unnecessary childhood mortality."

This disease is presented with high phase I antibody development in chronic and high phase II antibody in the acute form of illness. This study was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence of Q fever among high-risk occupations in the Ilam province in Western Iran.In this cross-sectional study, 367 sera samples were collected from five groups comprised of animal husbandry workers, farmers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and park rangers. The collected sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Coxiella burnetii using ELISA. The seroprevalence of antibodies against C. burnetii in phase I and II was 24.38% and 26.37%, respectively (i.e., 32.42% overall). Low educational level, living in rural areas, keeping sheep/goats, ages older than 50 years, and a history of arthropod bites positively correlated with increased risk of Q fever infection. Animal husbandry workers (45.13%) were at higher risk of contracting Q fever compared with other occupations in the study (17.11%).High seroprevalence of C. burnetii among high-risk occupations is a serious challenge in the Ilam province. In addition, the high seroprevalence of endemic Q fever in rural and nomadic areas and a higher concentration of occupations who are directly engaged with livestock demonstrate the critical need for preventive medicine education and training in regards to mitigating risk for disease contraction in susceptible groups."

GADD34 has opposing effects on different stimuli-induced cell apoptosis events, but the reason for this is unclear. Here, using immunoblotting analyses and various molecular genetic approaches in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, we demonstrate that GADD34 protects hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells from tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis by stabilizing a BCL-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1). We found that GADD34 knockdown decreased MCL-1 levels and that GADD34 overexpression up-regulated MCL-1 expression in HCC cells. GADD34 did not affect MCL-1 transcription but enhanced MCL-1 protein stability. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 abrogated GADD34 depletion–induced MCL-1 down-regulation, suggesting that GADD34 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of MCL-1. Furthermore, GADD34 overexpression promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation through a signaling axis that consists of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7)–binding protein 1 (TAB1), which mediated the up-regulation of MCL-1 by GADD34. Of note, TRAIL up-regulated both GADD34 and MCL-1 levels, and knockdown of GADD34 and TRAF6 suppressed the induction of MCL-1 by TRAIL. Correspondingly, GADD34 knockdown potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and MCL-1 overexpression rescued TRAIL-treated and GADD34-depleted HCC cells from cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2917727340,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common β-herpesvirus causing life-long latent infections. HCMV replication interferes with cell cycle regulation in host cells because the HCMV-encoded cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) ortholog pUL97 extensively phosphorylates the checkpoint regulator retinoblastoma protein. pUL97 also interacts with cyclins B1, T1, and H, and recent findings have strongly suggested that these interactions influence pUL97 substrate recognition. Interestingly, here we detected profound mechanistic differences among these pUL97-cyclin interactions. Our study revealed the following. (i) pUL97 interacts with cyclins B1 and H in a manner dependent on pUL97 activity and HCMV-specific cyclin modulation, respectively. (ii) The phosphorylated state of both proteins is an important determinant of the pUL97-cyclin B1 interaction. (iii) Activated phospho-Thr-315 cyclin H is up-regulated during HCMV replication. (iv) Thr-315 phosphorylation is independent of intracellular pUL97 or CDK7 activity. (v) pUL97-mediated in vitro phosphorylation is detectable for cyclin B1 but not H. (vi) Mutual transphosphorylation between pUL97 and CDK7 is not detectable, and an MS-based phosphosite analysis indicated that pUL97 might unexpectedly not be phosphorylated in its T-loop. (vii) The binary complexes pUL97-cyclin H and CDK7-cyclin H as well as the ternary complex pUL97-cyclin-H-CDK7 are detectable in an assembly-based CoIP approach. (viii) pUL97 self-interaction can be bridged by the transcriptional cyclins T1 or H but not by the classical cell cycle-regulating B1 cyclin. Combined, our findings unravel a number of cyclin type-specific differences in pUL97 interactions and suggest a multifaceted regulatory impact of cyclins on HCMV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2915920111,"Background Biochemical adrenal insufficiency induced by glucocorticoid treatment is prevalent, but data on the clinical implications are sparse. We investigated clinical consequences of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency after oral glucocorticoid cessation. Methods We conducted a Danish population-based self-controlled case series utilizing medical registries. In this design each individual serves as their own control allowing event rates to be compared as a function of time and treatment. Clinical indicators of adrenal insufficiency were defined as diagnoses of gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, syncope, hyponatremia, and hypoglycaemia. We included 286,680 persons who discontinued long-term (≥ 3 months) oral glucocorticoid treatment. We defined five risk periods and a reference period (before treatment): period 0 (on treatment), withdrawal period (1 month before and after cessation), followed by three consecutive 2 month-risk periods after withdrawal (periods 2–4). Results Median age at cessation was 69 years and 57% were female. Median treatment duration was 297 days and median cumulative dose was 3000 mg prednisolone equivalents. The incidence rates of hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia were increased in the withdrawal period compared to before treatment started (reference period). Incidence rate ratios comparing the withdrawal period with the reference period were 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4–4.3] for hypotension, 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6–1.9) for gastrointestinal symptoms, 2.2 (95% CI: 0.7–7.3) for hypoglycemia, and 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1–2.0) for hyponatremia. During 7 months of follow up, the rates of hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms remained elevated compared to the reference period. Risk factors included use of antibiotics, increasing average daily dose of glucocorticoids, cumulative dose, and age. Conclusion Oral glucocorticoid withdrawal was associated with adverse outcomes attributable to adrenal insufficiency. Our study underscores the need for future research to establish evidence-based clinical guidance on management of patients who discontinue oral glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2916930659,"The aesthetic appreciation of natural places is one of the most fundamental ways in which people relate to their environment. It provides wellbeing, an opportunity for recreation and reflection, a sense of place, and cultural enrichment. It also motivates people to take care of natural places and to conserve them for current and future appreciation. Aesthetically valuable places also support significant economic activity. However, there is little guidance available to assist environmental managers and policy-makers to consider and integrate aesthetic values into decision-making processes. In this study, we present an approach for developing robust and practical indicators of aesthetic value to enable environmental managers to consider, assess and report on aesthetic condition and trend. We demonstrate its utility using the case of the Great Barrier Reef, a region currently undergoing significant social, economic and environmental change and an area formally protected, in part, for its aesthetic values. A qualitative scoping study with 30 key informants identified over 180 potential qualities contributing to reef aesthetics. We tested five for their utility in capturing key aspects of the coral reef aesthetic: (i) coral cover, (ii) coral pattern, (iii) coral topography, (iv) fish abundance, and (v) visibility. We asked 1,417 online Australians to aesthetically rate 50 out of 181 underwater coral reef images that varied in relation to these five attributes. Coral topography, fish abundance, and visibility were significantly correlated with aesthetic ratings, whilst coral cover and coral pattern were not. We also tested for demographic patterns in aesthetic ratings. Our pilot study has demonstrated that readily measurable characteristics of coral reefs can provide useful indicators of aesthetic quality, opening up opportunities for coral reef managers and policymakers to assess and track changes in aesthetics in ways that are relevant to the public. There is considerable scope to further advance capacity for monitoring and managing aesthetic values of coral reefs through additional research that resolves nuances in the meanings associated with aesthetics in coral reef settings."
https://openalex.org/W2917444075,"Emerging studies have shed light on the association between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and cardiometabolic risk. However, there is no evidence to support a causal link for the relationship in the general population. Our aim was to determine whether HP infection is associated with the risks of incident type II diabetes mellitus (DM) in a population-based cohort consisting of adults from the general population. A total of 69235 adults enrolled in the study obtained health examinations at the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan from 2010 to 2016. HP infection detection was performed by rapid urease tests (RUTs), and endoscopic examinations were used to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric ulcers (GUs) and duodenal ulcers (DUs). Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed to examine the association between HP infection and cardiometabolic diseases using logistic regression and Cox regression in a large population-based study. HP infection was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (OR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.00-1.57) and DM (OR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.17-2.17) only in male subjects, and abnormal endoscopic findings were also correlated with cardiometabolic diseases. Our findings demonstrated that participants with HP infection had an elevated risk of developing incident DM (HR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.11-2.13). In addition, endoscopic findings of a DU (HR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.02-2.63), rather than GERD or a GU, were also predictive of incident DM. In this cohort, HP infection was a statistically significant predictor of incident DM among male population."
https://openalex.org/W2917856486,"While host plant drought is generally viewed as a negative phenomenon, its impact on insect herbivores can vary largely depending on the species involved and on the intensity of the drought. Extreme drought killing host plants can clearly reduce herbivore fitness, but the impact of moderate host plant water stress on insect herbivores can vary, and may even be beneficial. The populations of the Finnish Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) have faced reduced precipitation in recent years, with impacts even on population dynamics. Whether the negative effects of low precipitation are solely due to extreme desiccation killing the host plant or whether moderate drought reduces plant quality for the larvae remains unknown. We assessed the performance of larvae fed on moderately water-stressed Plantago lanceolata in terms of growth, survival, and immune response, and additionally were interested to assess whether the gut microbial composition of the larvae changed due to modification of the host plant. We found that larvae fed on water-stressed plants had increased growth, with no impact on survival, up-regulated the expression of one candidate immune gene (pelle), and had a more heterogeneous bacterial community and a shifted fungal community in the gut. Most of the measured traits showed considerable variation due to family structure. Our data suggest that in temperate regions moderate host plant water stress can positively shape resource acquisition of this specialized insect herbivore, potentially by increasing nutrient accessibility or concentration. Potentially, the better larval performance may be mediated by a shift of the microbiota on water-stressed plants, calling for further research especially on the understudied gut fungal community."

Therefore, establishing a therapeutic modality to maintain or improve renal function in AMI patients is necessary.

Methods We enrolled 41 patients (35 men; average age, 67.5 ± 12.6 years) after AMI onset. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and physical function tests were conducted at discharge and 3 months after discharge. Renal function was evaluated based on cystatin C based-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcys). The number of steps was recorded for 3 months post-discharge. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to test the association between physical activity level and within-patient changes in eGFRcys. Results Patients were stratified into low (n = 21; number of steps, 2335 ± 1219 steps/day) and high groups (n = 20; number of steps, 7102 ± 2365 steps/day). eGFRcys significantly increased from baseline to after 3 months in the high group (76.5 ± 13.8 to 83.2 ± 16.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, q = 0.004), whereas no significant change was observed in the low group (65.1 ± 15.9 to 62.2 ± 20.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, q = 0.125). Result of GEE adjusted for potential confounding variables showed a significant positive association between physical activity level and within-patient changes in eGFRcys (p = 0.003). Changes in eGFRcys was -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 among low group versus +6.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 among high group. Conclusions Physical activity level was positively associated with changes in renal function, demonstrating that high physical activity may suppress renal function decline in patients after AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2915458702,"Several antibody-targeting cancer immunotherapies have been developed based on T cell activation at the target cells. One of the most potent activators of T cells are bacterial superantigens, which bind to major histocompatibility complex class II on antigen-presenting cells and activate T cells through T cell receptor. Strong T cell activation is also one of the main weaknesses of this strategy as it may lead to systemic T cell activation. To overcome the limitation of conventional antibody–superantigen fusion proteins, we have split a superantigen into two fragments, individually inactive, until both fragments came into close proximity and reassembled into a biologically active form capable of activating T cell response. A screening method based on fusion between SEA and coiled-coil heterodimers was developed that enabled detection of functional split SEA designs. The split SEA design that demonstrated efficacy in fusion with coiled-coil dimer forming polypeptides was fused to a single chain antibody specific for tumor antigen CD20.

Cancer therapy is experiencing great progress, especially based on application of biological drugs and cell immunotherapy. Nevertheless, cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. In the last decade, immunotherapy became an important approach for fighting cancer, where the main goal is to activate the patient's own immune system to specifically recognize and kill tumor cells. Antibody-based therapeutics that target surface antigens expressed on tumor cells are successfully used for treatment of different types of cancer. Although unconjugated monoclonal antibodies are efficient, clinical studies showed that conjugating cytotoxic agents to monoclonal antibodies enhances their clinical utility (1Kang J.S. Lee M.H. Overview of therapeutic drug monitoring.Korean J. Intern. Med. 2009; 24 (19270474): 1-1010.3904/kjim.2009.24.1.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Antibody–drug conjugates are a class of highly potent biological drugs, composed of an antibody and an effector molecule. One of the immunotherapy approaches to potentiate the effects of monoclonal antibodies includes superantigens as effector molecules. Superantigens (SAg) 2The abbreviations used are: SAgsuperantigensMHCmajor histocompatibility complexTCRT cell receptorSEAstaphylococcal enterotoxin APBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellsGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidscFvsingle chain variable fragmentIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideRTroom temperatureRLUrelative light units. are potent activators of T lymphocytes and can activate up to 20% of T cells compared with conventional peptide antigens that activate only a small fraction of T cells (0.001% or less) (2Proft T.

Superantigens do not need to be processed through antigen-presenting cells but can directly bind to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC class II) expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Once bound to MHC class II, superantigen binds the T cell receptor (TCR) via the variable region of the TCR β chain (4Baker M.D. Acharya K.R. Superantigens: Structure-function relationships.Int. J.

This results in activation of both cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) and helper T cells (CD4+), including massive release of cytokines, such as interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and perforins, which generate strong T cell cytotoxic capacity. The precondition for activating T cells is binding of superantigen to the MHC class II expressed on B cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes (5Hedlund G. Dohlsten M. Lando P.A. Kalland T. Staphylococcal enterotoxins direct and trigger CTL killing of autologous HLA-DR+ mononuclear leukocytes and freshly prepared leukemia cells.Cell.

Because all tumor cells do not express MHC class II, to make superantigens selective for tumor antigens, Dohlsten et al. (6Dohlsten M. Hedlund G. Akerblom E. Lando P.A. Kalland T.

Because of the high affinity of SEA for MHC class II, a limitation of this approach was a retention of Ab-SEA fusion proteins in normal tissues expressing MHC class II, which caused systemic immune activation and dose-limiting toxicity (9Brodin T.N. Persson R. Soegaard M. Ohlsson L. d'Argy R. Olsson J. Molander A. Antonsson P. Gunnarsson P.O. Kalland T. Dohlsten M. Man-made superantigens: tumor-selective agents for T-cell-based therapy.Adv.

Therefore to lower the systemic effect of Ab-SAg fusion proteins, the Asp-227 to Ala (D227A) substitution was introduced into the SEA, reducing binding activity to MHC class II without affecting the TCR binding (10Gidlöf C. Dohlsten M. Lando P. Kalland T. Sundström C. Tötterman T.H.

This point mutation lies in the SEA high-affinity MHC class II–binding site, which interacts with β chain of MHC class II complex in zinc-dependent manner. However SEA also contains a low-affinity MHC class II–binding site that interacts with α chain of MHC class II complex (12Abrahmsén L. Dohlsten M. Segrén S. Björk P. Jonsson E. Kalland T. Characterization of two distinct MHC class II binding sites in the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7542584): 2978-298610.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb07300.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although D227A substitution in SEA reduced the binding affinity to MHC class II, the systemic cytotoxic effect on MHC class II expressing cells was only decreased, but not eliminated (13Forsberg G.

It has been shown that Ab-SEA fusion proteins are cytotoxic for target tumor cells irrespective of their MHC class II expression, in contrast to the induction of cytokine release from T cells which requires the presence of MHC class II–positive cells, such as monocytes. This might be explained by the low-affinity interaction of Ab-SEA fusion proteins and TCR β chain in the absence of MHC class II being sufficient to induce cytotoxic T cells to release granules, whereas induction of cytokine release requires a stronger TCR signal, as seen with the high-affinity interaction of the TCR with the SEA–MHC class II (14Dohlsten M. Sundstedt A. Björklund M. Hedlund G. Kalland T. Superantigen-induced cytokines suppress growth of human colon-carcinoma cells.Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54 (8509223): 482-48810.1002/ijc.2910540321Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we present a novel approach to overcome the limitation of previous antibody–superantigen fusion proteins. A new generation of superantigens was designed with intact binding site for MHC class II that is able to activate T cell response only upon dimerization triggered by binding to cells expressing target antigen and does not affect MHC class II–positive healthy cells. To achieve this, SEA was split into two fragments, each individually inactive, until the fragments come into close proximity upon binding to target cells, where they reconstitute a biologically active form capable of activating T cell response. To detect functional split superantigen designs, a screening method was developed, where split SEA fragments were fused with interacting protein domains. The functional SEA regained its biologic activity only when split SEA fragments were fused with coiled-coil dimer forming polypeptides; meanwhile, split SEA fragments fused with noninteracting polypeptides did not regain their activity. The effective split SEA design was implemented for targeting B cells by fusion with single chain variable fragment against B cell antigen CD20 (scFv–CD20) for use in cancer immunotherapy. Design of split proteins is a challenging task, because it is difficult to predict which sites would ensure that the reassembled protein has the activity of a parent protein, while each split fragment individually remains inactive, and that the split fragments do not reassemble spontaneously. Split proteins often completely lose their biological activity (15Shekhawat S.S. Ghosh I. Split-protein systems: Beyond binary protein-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15 (22070901): 789-79710.1016/j.cbpa.2011.10.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As superantigen we decided to use SEA, which is highly potent and among the most extensively characterized superantigens. The split sites within the SEA have been selected based on the following requirements: a) at least one domain should comprise a sufficiently large independent folding domain containing several secondary structure elements, to form the nucleus of folding; b) split sites should preferentially be located in the loop regions, exposed to the solvent, which are less sensitive for the reconstitution of split proteins; and c) split site should inactivate the TCR-binding epitope, which prevents the constitutive T cell activation in the absence of complementation by the second split segment. Overlap of split segment amino acids has been on several occasions demonstrated as an effective strategy enabling the optimal positioning of the split segments (15Shekhawat S.S. Ghosh I. Split-protein systems: Beyond binary protein-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15 (22070901): 789-79710.1016/j.cbpa.2011.10.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Li S. Chen T. Hua H. Lin Z.

Therefore, to design an efficient split SEA we selected three different split sites based on the above-stated requirements, where each of the split constructs overlapped in nine amino acid residues (Fig. 1). A 3D crystal structure of SEA (17Schad E.M. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V.N. Dohlsten M. Kalland T. Schlievert P.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Svensson L.A. Crystal structure of the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin type A.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7628431): 3292-330110.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb07336.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was used as a guide for the design. For the detection of functional split protein designs it is desirable to have an easily measurable readout, similar to the split GFP (18Kent K.P. Childs W. Boxer S.G. Deconstructing green fluorescent protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130 (18597452): 9664-966510.1021/ja803782xCrossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where the readout is reconstituted fluorescence. Depending on the fluorescence intensity it can be determined which split protein construct exhibits the highest biological activity, whereas in the case of split superantigens, the readout is more complex. To solve this issue we developed a method for screening candidate superantigen split sites, based on split SEA fusion with heterodimerizing polypeptides (Fig. 2B) to select split SEA design which meets three criteria important for further application as cancer therapeutics. First, each split fragment individually should not trigger activation of T cells; second, the reassembled split SEA should be biologically active; and third, split fragments should not spontaneously reassemble into a biologically active form. To monitor the biological activity of split SEA, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with fusion proteins and the release of human cytokine IL-2, as the readout of T cell activation, was detected with an ELISA assay. Split SEA fragments were fused with coiled-coil dimer-forming P3 and P4 polypeptides (Fig. 2A) designed and tested previously in our lab (19Gradišar H. Božič S. Doles T. Vengust D. Hafner-Bratkovič I. Mertelj A. Webb B. Šali A. Klavžar S. Jerala R. Design of a single-chain polypeptide tetrahedron assembled from coiled-coil segments.Nat. Chem.

Both polypeptide domains were genetically fused with SEA fragments by a 10 amino acid glycine-serine peptide linker. Coiled-coil dimers were selected because interactions that govern their dimerization specificity are well-understood and orthogonality of used coiled-coil forming polypeptides in mammalian cells ensures that each polypeptide binds preferably to its designated partner polypeptide and does not interfere with other cellular processes. Our goal was not only to determine the effective split SEA design but also to establish a fast and simple screening method for the detection. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for fusion proteins that were cloned into a pFLAG–CMV3 vector containing signal sequence for secretion. To confirm that transiently transfected HEK293T cells secrete biologically active recombinant SEA into the media in the amount sufficient to activate T cell response, we first generated a construct with a WT SEA (Fig. S1A) and compared the biological activity of mammalian cell–produced protein with pure SEA (Fig. S1, B and C). To select functional split SEA designs where each split fragment individually does not activate the T lymphocytes, following the example of recombinant WT SEA, PBMCs were stimulated with a HEK293T supernatant containing secreted split SEA fragments fused with P3 or P4 polypeptide. The presence of fusion proteins in the supernatant was confirmed by the Western blot analysis (Fig. S1D). None of the split SEA fragment fused to the P3 or P4 polypeptide from all three split variant designs caused T cell activation (Fig. 2C). PBMCs were therefore further stimulated with a combination of split SEA fragments fused to P3 or P4 polypeptide to determine whether any of the selected split variant pairs could reassemble into the biologically active form after coiled-coil dimer formation. Only split variant 2 efficiently reassembled, whereas split SEA variants 1 and 3 did not reassemble into a biologically active form (Fig. 2D). To rule out that activation of T cells is a result of the spontaneously reassembled split SEA, PBMCs were stimulated with HEK293T supernatant containing both split SEA fragments fused with a P3 polypeptide, so that the coiled-coil dimer should not form (Fig. 2E). We confirmed that in case of split SEA variant 2 (SEA2), the split fragments indeed have to be in the close proximity to reassemble into a biologically active form that activates T cell response. This is important for further application, because the spontaneously reassembled split SEA could cause T cell activation against nontarget cells expressing MHC class II. To investigate the cytotoxic activity induced by the split SEA2 reassembly, its ability to mediate killing of MHCII+ cells by human reactive T cells was measured. Efficient cell killing of target BCWM cells expressing MHC class II (21Ditzel Santos D. Ho A.W. Tournilhac O. Hatjiharissi E. Leleu X. Xu L. Tassone P. Neri P. Hunter Z.R. Chemaly M.A.Z.

The expression of MHC class II on BCWM cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. S2). As seen from the immunoblot analysis (Fig. S1D) fusion proteins P4_cSEA and P3_cSEA of the split SEA variant 3 were not observed in the HEK293T supernatant. To increase the yield of those variants both fusion proteins were fused with the maltose binding protein, which resulted in an improved production (Fig. S3A). Again, the stimulation assay revealed that split SEA variant 3 fragments fused with polypeptides P3 or P4 alone are not able to activate T cells. Activation of T cells did not occur even in case of stimulation with a combination of split SEA3 fragments fused to P3 and P4 polypeptide that form a heterodimer (Fig. S3B). Because of the favorable results obtained with split SEA2, for which a 3D model of fusion proteins was prepared (Fig. S4), further work was focused on split SEA2. We first decided to investigate the influence of a linker length on the functionality of reconstituted split SEA. It is known that linker length may strongly affect split protein reassembly (22Kondo N. Miyauchi K. Meng F. Iwamoto A. Matsuda Z. Conformational changes of the HIV-1 envelope protein during membrane fusion are inhibited by the replacement of its membrane-spanning domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20197275): 14681-1468810.1074/jbc.M109.067090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DNA constructs were prepared coding for split SEA2 linked to P3 and P4 polypeptides through glycine–serine containing linker of different lengths (Fig. S5). Fusion proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells and secreted into the media. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of fusion proteins of the expected size in cell suspension (Fig. S5). Few additional bands most likely occur because of the proteolysis or glycosylation. Glycosylation is a frequent posttranslation modification of proteins, and the vast majority of secreted eukaryotic proteins are glycosylated. Because of the glycosylation, proteins migrate differently on SDS-PAGE (23Croset A. Delafosse L. Gaudry J.-P. Arod C. Glez L. Losberger C. Begue D. Krstanovic A. Robert F. Vilbois F. Chevalet L. Antonsson B. Differences in the glycosylation of recombinant proteins expressed in HEK and CHO cells.J. Biotechnol. 2012; 161 (22814405): 336-34810.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.06.038Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore for the bands on Western blots with slower mobility than the expected size, we proposed that this is because of the glycosylation. Analysis of the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites revealed positive scores for the potential N-glycosylation sites within split SEA2–coiled-coil fusion proteins. All three potential N-glycosylation sites are present in split SEA fragments and are surface exposed according to the 3D molecular model (Fig. S6). Stimulation assay revealed that PBMCs stimulated with HEK293T cell suspension containing both split fragments of SEA2 fused with P3 and P4 coiled-coil dimer forming polypeptides, activated T cells to the similar extent regardless of the peptide linker length (Fig. 3A), and were also cytotoxic for target cells expressing MHC class II (Fig. 3B). Cell stimulation and cytotoxicity assays with different amounts of HEK293T supernatant containing split SEA2 linked to P3 and P4 polypeptides alongside integral SEA, revealed a dose-dependent response (Fig. S7). The importance of interacting domain orientation has also been reported (24Bracha-Drori K. Shichrur K. Katz A. Oliva M. Angelovici R. Yalovsky S. Ohad N. Detection of protein-protein interactions in plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation.Plant J. 2004; 40 (15469499): 419-42710.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02206.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 25Paulmurugan R. Gambhir S.S. Combinatorial library screening for developing an improved split-firefly luciferase fragment-assisted complementation system for studying protein-protein interactions.Anal. Chem. 2007; 79 (17295448): 2346-235310.1021/ac062053qCrossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated how the orientation of split SEA2 fragments and polypeptides (P3 or P4) might influence the split SEA2 reassembly. DNA constructs were prepared (Fig. 3C) where the interacting domains were at the N terminus of the fusion proteins. Again stimulation assay showed that split SEA2 reassembled when the orientation was reversed, which is likely because of the sufficient length of the linker to enable reconstitution in case of pairing in both orientations (Fig. 3D). Targeting of split SEA can be provided by fusion with antibodies or specificity determining single chain variable fragment (scFv) against target cell surface markers such as CD20, specific for B lymphocytes. To prepare split SEA2/scFv–CD20 fusion proteins that came into close proximity only upon binding of scFv–CD20 to target cells expressing CD20 at their surface and trigger T cell response, we generated humanized scFv–CD20, comprising humanized variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) chain (26Hansen, H., Qu, Z., and Goldenberg, M. D., (December 19, 2006) Anti-CD20 antibodies and fusion proteins thereof and methods of use. U.S. Patent No. 7,151,164.Google Scholar), connected by a Whitlow peptide linker (27Whitlow M. Bell B.

An improved linker for single-chain Fv with reduced aggregation and enhanced proteolytic stability.Protein Eng. 1993; 6 (8309948): 989-99510.1093/protein/6.8.989Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a fluorescent protein Venus was fused to scFv–CD20 through a glycine–serine linker (Fig. S8A) to track the binding of scFv–CD20 to target cells. We selected the scFv–CD20 that targets a well-known B cell lymphoma CD20 tumor antigen as a targeting moiety, because it is expressed at high surface density on B cells from the pro-B phase through memory cells, is not rapidly internalized upon binding of antibody, and is not shed from cells (28Smith M.R. Rituximab (monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody): Mechanisms of action and resistance.Oncogene. 2003; 22 (14576843): 7359-736810.1038/sj.onc.1206939Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For fast characterization, fusion protein was expressed in HEK293T cells and secreted into the media (Fig. S8B), and cell supernatant was incubated with B cell lymphoma line Raji expressing target CD20 antigen. The efficient binding of scFv–CD20 to target CD20 antigen expressed on Raji cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal imaging (Fig. S8C). The same design of scFv–CD20 was further used for fusion with split SEA2. Proof-of-concept fusion proteins were designed where split SEA2 fragments were genetically fused to a scFv–CD20. Binding of two antibodies specific for the tumor antigens at the target cell membrane, fused with split superantigen fragments, were expected to bring the inactive split SEA fragments into close proximity so they could reassemble into the biologically active form that triggers the T cell response (Fig. 4). The main advantage of this approach is the specificity for tumor cells without affecting other cells expressing MHC class II, which should, unlike the standard approach with WT superantigen fused with antibody, decrease the toxic systemic effect of superantigen. A pair of fusion proteins for targeting CD20+ lymphomas was designed.

https://openalex.org/W2917535117,"Worldwide, crop production is intrinsically intertwined with biological, environmental and economic systems, all of which involve complex, inter-related and spatially-sensitive phenomena. Thus knowing the location of agriculture matters much for a host of reasons. There are several widely cited attempts to model the spatial pattern of crop production worldwide, not least by pixilating crop production statistics originally reported on an areal (administrative boundary) basis. However, these modeled measures have had little scrutiny regarding the robustness of their results to alternative data and modeling choices. Our research casts a critical eye over the nature and empirical plausibility of these types of datasets. To do so, we determine the sensitivity of the 2005 variant of the spatial production allocation model data series (SPAM2005) to eight methodological-cum-data choices in nine agriculturally-large and developmentally-variable countries: Brazil, China, Ethiopia, France, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey and the United States. We compare the original published estimates with those obtained from a series of robustness tests using various aggregations of the pixelized spatial production indicators (specifically, commodity-specific harvested area, production quantity and yield). Spatial similarity is empirically assessed using a pixel-level spatial similarity index (SSI). We find that the SPAM2005 estimates are most dependent on the degree of disaggregation of the underlying national and subnational production statistics. The results are also somewhat sensitive to the use of a simple spatial allocation method based solely on cropland proportions versus a cross-entropy allocation method, as well as the set of crops or crop aggregates being modeled, and are least sensitive to the inclusion of crude economic elements. Finally, we assess the spatial concordance between the SPAM2005 estimates of the area harvested of major crops in the United States and pixelated measures derived from remote-sensed data."

Specifically, to investigate (1) the perceived challenges involved in the further implementation of the e-Catalogue and the NF, (2) reasons of prescribing medicines not listed in the NF, and (3) possible improvements in the acceptance and use of the e-Catalogue and the NF.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders (policymakers, healthcare providers, a pharmaceutical industry representative, and experienced patients) to collect the qualitative data. The data was analysed using directed content analysis, following the guidelines of the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative studies (COREQ) in reporting the findings.Interestingly, 20 of 45 participants decided to withdraw from the interview due to their lack of knowledge of the e-Catalogue and the NF. All 25 stakeholders who fully participated in this research were in favor of the e-Catalogue and the NF. However, interviewees identified a range of challenges. A major challenge was the lack of harmonization between the lists of medicines in the e-Catalogue and the NF. Several system and personal reasons for prescribing medicines not listed in the NF were identified. Important reasons were a lack of incentives for physicians as well as a lack of transparent and evidence-based methods of selection for the medicines to be listed in the NF.The e-Catalogue and the NF have not been fully utilized for achieving UHC in Indonesia. Some possible improvements suggested were harmonization of medicines listed in the e-Catalogue and the NF, restructuring incentive programs for prescribing NF medicines, and increasing the transparency and evidence-based approach for selection of medicines listed in the e-Catalogue and the NF."
https://openalex.org/W2917808626,"Background Although child physical abuse (CPA) is considered as a major global public health problem, it has not yet been recognized as such in Bangladesh. Very few studies have assessed the prevalence and victims’ characteristics of multiple forms of CPA. Objective This population-based study assessed the prevalence of CPA committed by adults in a rural area of Bangladesh and examined its association with demographic and socio-contextual factors. Methods Data were obtained using ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) in a random sample of 1416 children (49% girls, 51% boys) aged 11 to 17 years by face-to-face interviews during March-April 2017. The response rate was 91.5%. To estimate predictors of CPA, physical abuse was categorized into frequent and less frequent groups. Results The prevalence of at least one form (≥ 1), two forms (≥2) and three or more forms (≥ 3) of CPA were estimated approximately to 99%, 95% and 83% in their lifetime and 93%, 79%, and 57% in the past year respectively. Hitting (except on buttocks), standing/kneeling and slapping were the most common physical abuse whereas given drugs or alcohol, pinched, burned or scalded, beaten-up and locked up were less reported. Female children were faced severe forms of CPA more than that of males. Male children, younger age groups, witnessing adults using weapons at home, bullied by siblings and low level of maternal education were found to be significant risk factors for both ≥ 1 form and ≥ 2 forms of frequent CPA whereas adding also adult shouting in a frightening way was found as a significant risk factor for ≥ 2 forms of frequent CPA. Conclusion Self-reported prevalence of CPA is extremely common in the Bangladeshi rural society. The prevalence was associated with demographic and socio-contextual characteristics of the children such as being younger, witnessing domestic violence and maternal low education. The findings provide evidence to support parents and policy-makers to take effective measures to implement policy and programme on alternative up-bringing methods and creating awareness of negative effects of CM which in turn help Bangladesh to line up with UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the country signed in 1990."
https://openalex.org/W2917101129,"Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is a conserved protein of the Golgi apparatus that in humans has been implicated in tumorigenesis. However, the precise function of GOLPH3 in malignant transformation is still unknown. Nevertheless, clinicopathological data shows that in more than a dozen kinds of cancer, including gliomas, GOLPH3 could be found overexpressed, which correlates with poor prognosis. Experimental data shows that overexpression of GOLPH3 leads to transformation of primary cells and to tumor growth enhancement. Conversely, the knocking down of GOLPH3 in GOLPH3-overexpressing tumor cells reduces tumorigenic features, such as cell proliferation and cell migration and invasion. The cumulative evidence indicate that GOLPH3 is an oncoprotein that promotes tumorigenicity by a mechanism that impact at different levels in different types of cells, including the sorting of Golgi glycosyltransferases, signaling pathways, and the actin cytoskeleton. How GOLPH3 connects mechanistically these processes has not been determined yet. Further studies are important to have a more complete understanding of the role of GOLPH3 as oncoprotein. Given the genetic diversity in cancer, a still outstanding aspect is how in this inherent heterogeneity GOLPH3 could possibly exert its oncogenic function. We have aimed to evaluate the contribution of GOLPH3 overexpression in the malignant phenotype of different types of tumor cells. Here, we analyzed the effect on cell migration that resulted from stable, RNAi-mediated knocking down of GOLPH3 in T98G cells of glioblastoma multiforme, a human glioma cell line with unique features. We found that the reduction of GOLPH3 levels produced dramatic changes in cell morphology, involving rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and reduction in the number and dynamics of focal adhesions. These effects correlated with decreased cell migration and invasion due to affected persistence and directionality of cell motility. Moreover, the knocking down of GOLPH3 also caused a reduction in autoactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that regulates focal adhesions. Our data support a model in which GOLPH3 in T98G cells promotes cell migration by stimulating the activity of FAK."

Increasing evidence indicates that apoptosis is one of the main mechanisms of β-cell death in both types. Ethanolic extracts of Pluchea indica leaf (PILE) have been reported to possess blood glucose lowering actions in vivo. Nevertheless, further study is required to determine the underlying mechanisms. In this report, we have investigated the preventive effects of PILE on multiple low doses of streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced β-cell apoptosis. Mice were pre-treated with PILE at 50 mg/kg (PILE 50) or 100 mg/kg (PILE 100) for 2 weeks before streptozotocin (STZ) stimulation, and the treatment continued for 4 or 8 weeks. Results revealed that PILE 100 mice exhibited improved blood biochemistry, maintained a higher body weight, had decreased hyperglycemia, and restored islet architectures compared to non-treated STZ mice. Significantly, PILE 100 decreased levels of inflammatory response markers interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interlukin1-β (IL-1β), concomitant with the inhibition of caspase-3, caspase-8, capsepase-9, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1), nuclear factor-κBp65 (NF-κBp65), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, survival and proliferative ability of β-cells was mediated by up-regulated Bcl-2 and Ki67, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that pretreatment with PILE 100 effectively attenuated STZ-induced diabetes-related symptoms and these effects could be associated with the inhibition of cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis."

Further, they digitally connected those individuals with hypertension and diabetes to a study physician via Skype, and handed over a printed e-prescription. Medication adherence checks, BP and fasting blood sugar measurements were done once a month and doctor consultations once in three months during follow-up.Among 2456 eligible individuals, 1751 and 1686 individuals were screened for hypertension and diabetes, respectively. Prevalence of hypertension was 23·6% (95% CI 21·6%-25·6%) and among them 38.9% were newly detected. Prevalence of diabetes was 11·2% (9·7%-12·7%) and 28.6% of them were newly detected. After 24 months of intervention, control of BP and blood sugar was achieved in 54.0% and 34·1% of individuals with hypertension and diabetes, respectively. Blood pressure control rate improved by 12% (7.9%-16.0%) in known hypertensive individuals over the intervention period.This research demonstrates the feasibility and local acceptability of a mHealth intervention strategy anchored on NPHWs guided by physicians for detection, treatment and regular follow-up of individuals with hypertension and diabetes in a community setting in India."
https://openalex.org/W2915463733,"A study on six 50 ha agricultural fields was conducted to investigate the effect of conservation tillage practices on the long-term (1990-2016) changes in the soil organic carbon (SOC) content of the topsoil layers (0-10 cm) of agricultural fields. The experimental fields were selected from the 49 fields of the Tawdeehiya Arable Farm (TAF), located 200 kilometers southeast of Riyadh, the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data sets from laboratory determined SOC and the corresponding Landsat images generated vegetation indices, namely, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI), were utilized for the prediction of SOC using multivariate regression techniques. Long-term changes in the SOC content of the experimental fields, as a result of different tillage practices, were also studied. The developed SOC prediction models exhibited high accuracy indicated by R2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.85, RMSE values of 0.34 to 0.85 g kg-1 and P-values of less than 0.0001. The cross-validation results (R2 of 0.61-0.70, RMSE value of 0.34-0.85 g kg-1 and P-values of less than 0.0001) confirmed the high accuracy of the developed SOC prediction models. Results also revealed that the change in the SOC content was clearly associated with soil tillage practices. On the average, 76% of the all agricultural fields in the experimental farm showed a decrease of up to 24 g kg-1 in their SOC content after 10 years (1990-2000) of continuous conventional tillage practices. On the other hand, an average increase of up to 37 g kg-1 in the SOC content was observed in 88% of the studied fields at the end of the study period (2016), where conservation tillage was a continous and consistent practice in the experimental farm."
https://openalex.org/W2917283285,"In Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, GLI family zinc finger (GLI)-mediated diverse gene transcription outcomes are strictly regulated and are important for SHH function in both development and disease. However, how the GLI factors differentially regulate transcription in response to variable SHH activities is incompletely understood. Here, using a newly generated, tagged Gli3 knock-in mouse (Gli3TAP), we performed proteomic analyses and identified the chromatin-associated SAFB-like transcription modulator (SLTM) as a GLI-interacting protein that context-dependently regulates GLI activities. Using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, RT-quantitative PCR, and ChIP assays, we show that SLTM interacts with all three GLI proteins and that its cellular levels are regulated by SHH. We also found that SLTM enhances GLI3 binding to chromatin and increases GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) form protein levels. In a GLI3-dependent manner, SLTM promoted the formation of a repressive chromatin environment and functioned as a GLI3 co-repressor. In the absence of GLI3 or in the presence of low GLI3 levels, SLTM co-activated GLI activator (GLIA)-mediated target gene activation and cell differentiation. Moreover, in vivo Sltm deletion generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing caused perinatal lethality and SHH-related abnormal ventral neural tube phenotypes. We conclude that SLTM regulates GLI factor binding to chromatin and contributes to the transcriptional outcomes of SHH signaling via a novel molecular mechanism."

Yet, finding statistical evidence of this fact has been challenging. Here we combine a common causal inference technique (instrumental variable estimation) with a dataset on nearly forty thousand biographies from Wikipedia (Pantheon 2.0), to study the effect of the introduction of printing in European cities on Wikipedia’s digital biographical records. By using a city’s distance to Mainz as an instrument for the adoption of the movable type press, we show that European cities that adopted printing earlier were more likely to become the birthplace of a famous scientist or artist during the years following the invention of printing. We bring these findings to recent communication technologies by showing that the number of radios and televisions in a country correlates with the number of globally famous performing artists and sports players born in that country, even after controlling for GDP, population, and including country and year fixed effects. These findings support the hypothesis that the introduction of communication technologies can bias historical records in the direction of the content that is best suited for each technology."

Before PCI, fibrous (FI), fibrofatty (FF), necrotic core (NC), and dense calcium (DC) regions were evaluated using VH-IVUS, and the contributions of each to the culprit lesion volume were recorded. Plasma LDL-C, HDL-C, Apo-B, and Apo-A1 levels were assessed before PCI. The relationship between the regions on VH-IVUS and plasma lipid levels was assessed. Patients were categorized into low Apo-B (LAB) and high Apo-B (HAB) groups, based on the overall cohort median Apo-B level.We enrolled 115 patients (median Apo-B, 91 mg/dL, male n = 88) with 57 and 58 patients in the LAB (Apo-B ≤ 90 mg/dL) and HAB (Apo-B ≥ 91 mg/dL) groups, respectively. Vessel, plaque, and %NC volumes were significantly greater in the HAB group than in the LAB group. The %FI, %FF, and %DC volumes were similar in both groups. In all 115 patients, the %NC volume correlated with LDL-C (r = 0.2353, P = 0.0114) and Apo-B (r = 0.2487, P = 0.0074) but not with HDL-C and Apo A-1. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level tended to be higher in the HAB group than in the LAB group. Multiple regression analysis showed that being male, Apo-A1, and Apo-B were significant predictors of %NC volume extent.Elevated Apo-B level was related to the %NC in target coronary artery lesions in SCD patients, suggesting a role of Apo-B as a biomarker of unstable plaque in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2916070700,"Pesticides aerial application may results in the drift to neighboring areas if some application technology is not well executed. This phenomenon should be minimized to reduce environmental risks and agricultural production costs. This work aimed to investigate the interaction of environmental conditions, surrounding distance, and application conditions influencing spray drift in aerial applications. Sampling data from aerial sprays were collected during three agricultural years (from 2012 to 2014) in fields cultivated with sorghum, millet, soybean, corn, and cotton. The following variables were evaluated: application swath width, application rate, distance from the applied field, wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature. The estimated Pearson’s correlations and path analysis identified that application rate and distance from the applied field and application were the variables that most influenced drift. Equations relating spray drift in function of distance from the applied field and application rate were adjusted in function of the variable, and a response surface model was constructed to estimate drift. The major pesticide class sprayed with aircraft in the Brazilian Cerrado was insecticide, followed by fungicide. This scenario shows the potential hazard risk of spray drift over the environment. The concentration of the drift deposits decreased as surrounding distance and application rate were increased. A mathematical equation of drift prediction was established, where the variables that contributed most to drift deposits were surrounding distance and wind speed. Thus, it is very important to monitor and respect the wind speed limits during the aerial spraying, mainly when there is any risk potential associated with pesticide exposure over the downwind direction."
https://openalex.org/W2916666759,"Tortoise Picornavirus (ToPV) commonly known as Virus ""X"" was recently discovered in juvenile European tortoises suffering from soft carapace and plastron as well as kidney disease. Therefore, this virus was a potential candidate to be a causative agent for these disease patterns. Spur thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seemed to be more susceptible to establish clinical symptoms than other European species like T. hermanni. Thus this trial investigated the role of ToPV in the described syndrome. Two groups of juvenile European tortoises (T. graeca and T.hermanni) each of 10 animals, were cloacally, oronasally and intracoelomically inoculated with an infectious dose (~ 2000 TICD) of a ToPV strain isolated from a diseased T. graeca. A control group of two animals of each species received non-infected cell culture supernatant. The tortoises were examined daily and pharyngeal and cloacal swabs for detection of ToPV-RNA by RT-PCR were taken from each animal every six days for a period of 6 months. At the end of the study the remaining animals were euthanised and dissected. Bacteriological and parasitological tests were performed and organ samples of all tortoises were investigated by RT-PCR for the presence of ToPV and histopathology. Animals that were euthanised at the end of the experiment, were examined for presence of specific anti-ToPV antibodies. Several animals in both inoculated groups showed retarded growth and a light shell weakness, in comparison to the control animals. Three animals were euthanised during the trial, showing reduced weight gain, retarded growth, severe shell weakness and apathy, in parallel to clinical observations in naturally infected animals. In all inoculated animals of both species an intermittent virus shedding, starting from 18 days post inoculation (d.p.i.), till 164 d.p.i. was detected, while the control animals remained negative. The virus was successfully reisolated in terrapene heart cell culture in 16 of 20 inoculated animals of both species. Histopathology of most inoculated animals revealed a lack of bone remodeling and vacuolisation in kidney tubuli which supports the described pathogenesis of nephropathy and osteodystrophy. Anti- ToPV antibody titres ranged from 1:2 to >1:256 in 13 of 20 animals, whereas all control animals were seronegative. The study proofed the Henle Koch`s postulates of ToPV as causative agent for shell dystrophy and kidney disease in both testudo species. The proposed species specific sensitivity towards clinical disease was not observed."

In the current study, the C isoforms were screened for blocking adipogenesis. The hypothesis that the TRP classic or canonical (TRPC) deters adipocyte differentiation was investigated in 3T3-L1 cells employing the channel-specific activator and antagonist, silencing, and overexpression techniques. Fat accumulation in cells was visualized by Oil Red O staining. Intracellular calcium inflow was estimated by confocal microscopy. A high-fat (HF) feeding study was also performed on C57BL/6J mice to verify the findings in the cell model. Among the 6 C isoforms tested, only TRPC-6 inhibited the differentiation of fat cells. The phytochemical quercetin induced the channel protein expression. Calcium-imaging results also revealed that the flavonoid could trigger calcium inflow. Coadministration of quercetin (1 or 20 mg/kg body weight) in an HF diet prevented TRPC-6 from declining and attenuated phosphorylated (p)-PKB and PI3k, as well as the proliferation of visceral fat cells. The present study illustrated that TRPC-6 activation could perturb adipocyte differentiation. The food flavonoid quercetin was a TRPC-6 inducer and activator and it could prevent adipogenesis in mice.-Tan, Y. Q., Kwan, H. Y., Yao, X., Leung, L. K.

https://openalex.org/W2953341165,"Molecular mimicry is the formation of specific molecules by microbial pathogens to avoid recognition and attack by the immune system of the host. Several pathogenic Ascomycota and Zygomycota show such a behaviour by utilizing human complement factor H to hide in the blood stream. We call this type of mimicry molecular crypsis. Such a crypsis can reach a point where the immune system can no longer clearly distinguish between self and non-self cells. Thus, a trade-off between attacking disguised pathogens and erroneously attacking host cells has to be made. Based on signalling theory and protein-interaction modelling, we here present a mathematical model of molecular crypsis of pathogenic fungi using the example of Candida albicans. We tackle the question whether perfect crypsis is feasible, which would imply that protection of human cells by complement factors would be useless. The model identifies pathogen abundance relative to host cell abundance as the predominant factor influencing successful or unsuccessful molecular crypsis. If pathogen cells gain a (locally) quantitative advantage over host cells, even autoreactivity may occur. Our new model enables insights into the mechanisms of candidiasis-induced sepsis and complement-associated autoimmune diseases."

We sought to overcome this limitation by exploring the development of a new classification analogy concept for transcribing the largely qualitative criteria in the pedomorphologically based, soil taxonomic classification systems to quantitative physicochemical descriptions. We collected soil horizons classified under the Alfisols taxonomic Order in the U.S. National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) soil classification system and quantified their properties via physical and chemical characterizations. Using multivariate statistical modeling modified for compositional data analysis (CoDA), we developed quantitative analogies by partitioning the characterization data up into three different compositions: Water-extracted (WE), Mehlich-III extracted (ME), and particle-size distribution (PSD) compositions. Afterwards, statistical tests were performed to determine the level of discrimination at different taxonomic and location-specific designations. The analogies showed different abilities to discriminate among the samples. Overall, analogies made up from the WE composition more accurately classified the samples than the other compositions, particularly at the Great Group and thermal regime designations. This work points to the potential to quantitatively discriminate taxonomically different soil types characterized by varying compositional datasets."

https://openalex.org/W2917455829,"Cell therapy for diabetes could benefit from the identification of small-molecule compounds that increase the number of functional pancreatic beta cells. Using a newly developed screening assay, we previously identified glucocorticoids as potent stimulators of human and rat beta cell proliferation. We now compare the stimulatory action of these steroid hormones to a selection of checkpoint tyrosine kinase inhibitors that were also found to activate the cell cycle-in beta cells and analyzed their respective effects on DNA-synthesis, beta cell numbers and expression of cell cycle regulators. Our data using glucocorticoids in combination with a receptor antagonist, mifepristone, show that 48h exposure is sufficient to allow beta cells to pass the cell cycle restriction point and to become committed to cell division regardless of sustained glucocorticoid-signaling. To reach the end-point of mitosis another 40h is required. Within 14 days glucocorticoids stimulate up to 75% of the cells to undergo mitosis, which indicates that these steroid hormones act as proliferation competence-inducing factors. In contrast, by correlating thymidine-analogue incorporation to changes in absolute cell numbers, we show that the checkpoint kinase inhibitors, as compared to glucocorticoids, stimulate DNA-synthesis only during a short time-window in a minority of cells, insufficient to give a measurable increase of beta cell numbers. Glucocorticoids, but not the kinase inhibitors, were also found to induce changes in the expression of checkpoint regulators. Our data, using checkpoint kinase-specific inhibitors further point to a role for Chk1 and Cdk1 in G1/S transition and progression of beta cells through the cell cycle upon stimulation with glucocorticoids."
