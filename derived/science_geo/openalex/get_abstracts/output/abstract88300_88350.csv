https://openalex.org/W2019675508,The discoveries are reviewed that elucidate how the cytoskeleton of the human erythrocyte membrane is linked to the membrane and make it possible to visualize the molecular interactions among the cytoskeletal components. These discoveries are the result of a coordinated structural and biochemical approach that has revealed a surprisingly complex set of specific interactions whose existence emphasizes the fundamental continuity between the erythrocyte membrane and the erythrocyte cytoskeleton.

The enzyme possesses an apparent Km (Ca2+) of 0.3 +/- 02 microM, a Vmax of Ca2+ transport of 31 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min, and an apparent Km (ATP) of 30 microM. It is only slightly influenced by monovalent cations and is highly sensitive to orthovanadate (Ki = 0.5 +/- 0.1 microM). The high vanadate sensitivity has been used to distinguish the sarcolemmal and the contaminating sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-dependent ATPase in heart microsomal fractions. Calmodulin has been shown to be present in heart sarcolemma. Its depletion results in the transition of the Ca2+-pumping ATPase to a low Ca2+ affinity; readdition of calmodulin reverses this effect. The Na+/Ca2+ exchange system was not affected by calmodulin. The results of calmodulin extraction can be duplicated by using the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine. The calmodulin-depleted Ca2+-ATPase has been solubilized from the sarcolemmal membrane and purified on a calmodulin affinity chromatography column. One major (Mr = 150,000) and 3 minor protein bands could be eluted from the column with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The major protein band (72%) has Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and can be phosphorylated by [gamma]32P]ATP in a Ca2+-dependent reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2020490067,"Chi recombinational hotspots are sites around which the rate of Rec-promoted recombination in bacteriophage lambda is elevated. Examination of a derivative of lambda into which the plasmid pBR322 was inserted reveals that pBR322 lacks Chi sites. Using this lambda-pBR322 hybrid, we obtained mutations creating Chi sites at three widely separated loci within pBR322. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the mutations are single base-pair changes creating the octamer 5' GCTGGTGG 3'. This sequence is present at three previously analyzed Chi sites in lambda, and all analyzed mutations creating or inactivating these Chi sites occur within this octamer. We conclude that Chi is 5' GCTGGTGG 3', or its complement, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1557975966,"The ribose-modified nucleotides 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) and TNP-ADP were used to probe the catalytic sites on soluble beef heart mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase (F1). Both compounds were potent competitive inhibitors of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by F1, Ki = 5.5 and 10 nM, respectively, and by submitochondrial particles, Ki (TNP-ATP) = 21 nM. Both compounds also were potent competitive inhibitors of ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation (Ki = 1300 nM). Both analogs inhibited the 32Pi-ATP exchange reaction and the ATP-dependent reduction of NAD+ by succinate, catalyzed by submitochondrial particles. TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP were bound by F1. The presence of two binding sites on the enzyme for TNP-adenine nucleotides was determined by titrations of difference absorbance spectra, of the increase in fluorescence of the analog which occurred upon interaction with protein, and by titrations with the centrifuge column method using 32P-labeled TNP-adenine nucleotides. The first binding site bound the analogs with an affinity too high to be measured. The Kd for analog binding by the second site was 20 to 80 nM. In the presence of Mg2+, the 2 sites were filled with the TNP-ATP at a rate too rapid to be resolved by the procedure used. TNP-[gamma-32P]ATP was hydrolyzed by F1, Km = 0.2 microM, Vmax = 1.1 mol of 32Pi formed/mol of F1/s. It was shown, using the isotope trap technique as well as the inhibitor efrapeptin, that the 2 binding sites for TNP-ATP on F1 are hydrolytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1493386189,"Escherichia coli recA protein catalyzes a specific proteolytic cleavage of repressors in vitro when it is activated by interaction with a single-stranded polynucleotide and nucleoside triphosphate. The ATP analogue adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) satisfies the NTP requirement. We show here that despite its activity in repressor cleavage, ATP gamma S is hydrolyzed at a negligible rate by the recA protein DNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase activity. In the presence of DNA, ATP gamma S binds tightly to recA protein in a complex that can be detected because it is trapped by a nitrocellulose filter. One ATP gamma S molecule is bound per recA monomer. These results suggest that a ternary complex of recA protein, DNA, and nucleoside triphosphate is the species active in repressor cleavage. The activation of recA protein by small, defined oligonucleotides in place of DNA is described and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1552593866,"The recognition marker for the targeting of lysosomal enzymes contains mannose 6-phosphate. The recent discovery of phosphate in diester linkage between N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase led to the proposal that the phosphate might be acquired via N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate transfer from UDP-GlcNAc (Tabas, I., and Kornfeld, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6633-6639). We describe the synthesis of [beta-32P]UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and the use of this compound to demonstrate a UDP-GlcNAc:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. The basis of the enzyme assay is the incorporation of 32P and 3H into glycopeptides with a high affinity for Concanavalin A-Sepharose. This membrane-associated transferase is neither inhibited by tunicamycin nor stimulated by dolichol-phosphate, indicating that the reaction does not proceed via a dolichylpyrophosphoryl-N-acetylglucosamine intermediate. Characterization of the enzyme reaction products (derived from either endogenous or exogenous acceptors) demonstrated that alpha-linked N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate is transferred en bloc to the 6-hydroxyl of mannose in high mannose oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. We propose that the function of this enzyme is to donate N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate to mannose residues of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1975487363,"The Ion gene of E. coli controls the stability of two bacteriophage lambda proteins. The functional half-life of the phage N gene product, measured by complementation, is increased about 5-fold in Ion mutant strains, from 2 min to 10 min. The chemical half-life of N protein, determined by its disappearance on polyacrylamide gels following pulse-chase labeling, increases about three-fold in Ion cells. In contrast to its effect on the N protein, the Ion mutation produces a 50% decrease in the chemical half-life of cll protein. The decay rate of many other phage proteins, including the unstable gene O product, remains unaffected by a host Ion defect. A Ion mutation alters lambda physiology in two ways. First, upon infection, the phage enters the lytic pathway predominantly. This may result from the deficiency of cll protein caused by its decreased stability, since cll product is required for establishment of lysogeny. Second, brief thermal induction of a Ion (Î»c1857) lysogen leads irreversibly to lysis; repression cannot be restablished and the treated cells are committed to forming infective centers. Although N product is normally required for rapid commitment, Ion lysogens become committed more rapidly than Ion+ lysogens, even in the absence of N function. These results identify for the first time native proteins whose stability is affected by the Lon proteolytic pathway. They also indicate that the Lon system may be important in regulating gene expression in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1533742139,"A new activator of rat liver phosphofructokinase was partially purified from rat hepatocyte extracts by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The activator, which eluted in the sugar diphosphate region, was sensitive to acid treatment but resistant to heating in alkali. Mild acid hydrolysis resulted in the appearance of a sugar monophosphate which was identified as fructose 6-phosphate by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. These observations suggest that the activator is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. This compound was synthesized by first reacting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and then treating the cyclic intermediate with alkali. The structure of the synthetic compound was definitively identified as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate had properties identical with those of the activator purified from hepatocyte extracts. It activated both the rat liver and rabbit skeletal muscle enzyme in the 0.1 microM range and was several orders of magnitude more effective than fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was not a substrate for aldolase or fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. It is likely that this new activator is an important physiologic factor of phosphofructokinase in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2050455558,"The fidelity of copying natural DNA in vitro with each of the three classes of eukaryotic DNA polymerases has been determined. DNA polymerases-beta and -gamma are highly inaccurate, catalyzing noncomplementary single-base substitution at a frequency between 1/3000 and 1/8000. DNA polymerase-alpha is substantially more accurate, with an error rate of 1/30,000. When the error rates of these DNA polymerases are considered in the context of the accuracy of DNA replicative processes in vivo, it seems likely that other factors must exist in mammalian cells which are involved in the accurate replication and maintenance of the genetic information."
https://openalex.org/W1486944673,"Occupancy of only one of two hydrolytic sites on beef heart mitochondrial ATPase (F1) by the radioactive ATP analog, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-[gamma-32P]-triphosphate (TNP-[gamma-32P]ATP) is associated with a low rate of hydrolysis of the substrate even under conditions otherwise favoring catalysis. Addition of excess nonradioactive TNP-ATP, in concentrations sufficient to fill catalytic Site 2 on the enzyme (Grubmeyer, C., and Penefsky, H. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3718-3727), accelerates the rate of hydrolysis of the radioactive substrate 15- to 20-fold. Since the excess nonradioactive substrate serves as an effective isotope trap, the involvement of medium TNP-[gamma-32P]-ATP as an intermediate is ruled out. These observations constitute direct evidence for catalytic cooperativity between active sites on F1. It is proposed that the use of high binding affinity substrates or substrate analogs, combined with the isotope trap technique, offers a new approach to the detection and study of catalytic site cooperativity in enzymes. The hydrolyzable nucleotides GTP, ITP, and ATP are excellent promoters of the hydrolysis of previously bound TNP-[gamma-32P]ATP whereas addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotides such as TNP-ADP, ADP, and adenylyl imidodiphosphate result in a lower rate and extent of hydrolysis. AMP is without effect. Studies of the hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP and TNP-[gamma-32P]ITP, under appropriate conditions, also provide evidence consistent with promoted catalysis. Based upon these findings, a model is presented for the mechanism of action of F1 in which site-site cooperativity reflects promoter-dependent hydrolysis of bound substrate."

D. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 3144-3148). Using the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of recA protein as an assay, we obtained about 60 mg of purified recA protein from 100 g of cells. Ten micrograms or 1 microgram of the purified protein exhibited only one detectable band with Mr approximately = 40,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. More than 99% of the ATPase activity of purified recA protein was dependent on single-stranded DNA. Purified recA protein had no detectable DNase, topoisomerase, or ligase activities. The enzyme was stable for a least a year when stored at 0-4 degrees C. The half-life of the ATPase activity of 25 microM recA protein was 37 min at 51 degrees C. Purified recA protein binds to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, unwinds duplex DNA by a mechanism that is stimulated by single-stranded DNA or oligonucleotides, and pairs homologous single strands with duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2080305198,"The 5S RNA genes (5S genes) in N. crassa are not tandemly arranged or tightly clustered as in other eucaryotes that have been examined. 5S RNA or cloned 5S DNA hybridizes to at least 30 different restriction fragments of Neurospora DNA. Of 34 5S DNA clones examined, each contains a single 5S gene. Saturation hybridization analyses indicate that there are about 100 copies of 5S genes in the genome of this organism. We have partially or completely sequenced the 5S region of 15 clones. Both identical and highly divergent 5S coding regions were found. Nine are of one type (a). The other six include four different types (Î², Î², Î³ and Î´) which differ from each other and from the a genes to various degrees. Eleven of 15 genes have distinct flanking regions. Analysis of Neurospora 5S RNA showed that it consists of one principal species which matches the a-type gene sequence. Additional 5S species corresponding to the less abundant 5S gene types were also detected. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions between the predicted Neurospora 5S RNAs and between these and S. cerevisiae 5S RNA suggests that a particular 5S RNA secondary structure occurs in vivo and is conserved."

https://openalex.org/W1625674217,"Of the fully competitive inhibitors of small intestinal sucrase investigated in this or in other papers, acarbose, nojirimycin, and deoxynojirimycin (Fig. 2) have the highest affinity for the enzyme, their Ki values being in the 10(-7)-10(-8) M range. Furthermore, thier interaction with the enzyme is slow, the steady state being reached in their presence in a matter of minutes. Their overall and off constants are small, which indicates that a conformational change accompanies the interaction of these substances with the active site of intestinal sucrase. The structure of these inhibitors, as well as the pH dependence of their Ki values, agrees with and allows additions to be made to the catalytic mechanism earlier suggested for this enzyme (Cogoli, A., and Semenza, G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7802-7809). None of these inhibitors of sucrase has any sizeable effect on the small intestinal Na+-dependent D-glucose transport system."

The effects of synexin on the kinetics of membrane fusion were examined. Membrane fusion was assayed by following the mixing of aqueous contents of phospholipid vesicles. Synexin lowers the threshold of CA2+ concentration required for fusion of large unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylserine and a mixture of phosphatidylserine with phosphatidylethanolamine. synexin also increases drastically the initial rate of fusion. the initial rate of fusion increases with the quantity of synexin present in the reaction mixture. In the presence of 1-2 mM Ca2+ and 50 microM phospholipid, synexin at 20 to 40 micrograms/ml increases the rate of fusion by two orders of magnitude. Mg2+ does not support synexin-induced fusion. With vesicles containing a mixture of phosphatidylserine with phosphatidylcholine, synexin enhances aggregation in the presence of CA2+, without promoting fusion. Synexin may play a role in exocytosis by promoting fusion of membranes containing specific phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1486131364,"The formation of a fibrin clot is initiated after the proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin. The enzyme removes fibrinopeptides A and B and generates fibrin monomer which spontaneously polymerizes. Polymerization appears to occur though the interaction of complementary binding sites on the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal (Fragment D) regions of the molecule. A peptide has been isolated from the gamma chain remnant of fibrinogen Fragment D1 which has the ability to bind to the NH2-terminal region of fibrinogen as well as to inhibit fibrin monomer polymerization. The peptide reduces the maximum rate and extent of the polymerization of thrombin or batroxobin fibrin monomer and increases the lag time. The D1 peptide does not interact with disulfide knot, fibrinogen, or Fragment D1, but it binds to thrombin-treated disulfide knot with a Kd of 1.45 X 10(-6) M at approximately two binding sites per molecule of disulfide knot. Fibrin monomer formed either by thrombin or batroxobin binds approximately two molecules of D1 peptide per molecule of fibrin monomer, indicating that the complementary site is revealed by the loss of fibrinopeptide A. The NH2-terminal sequence (Thr-Arg-Trp) and COOH-terminal sequence (Ala-Gly-Asp-Val) of the D1 peptide were determined. Therefore the gamma 373-410 region of fibrinogen contains a polymerization site which is complementary to the thrombin-activated site on the NH2-terminal region of fibrinogen."

https://openalex.org/W1570437501,"We have studied Ca transport and the Ca-activated Mg-ATPase in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from normal human lymphocytes. Membrane vesicles that were exposed to oxalate as a Ca-trapping agent accumulated Ca in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. ADP, AMP, GTP, UTP, ITP, TTP, or CTP did not substitute for ATP in energizing uptake. The Vmax for Ca uptake was 2.4 pmol of Ca/micrograms of protein/min, and the Km values for Ca and ATP were 1.0 and 80 microM, respectively. One microM A23187, added initially, completely inhibited net Ca uptake and, if added later, caused the release of Ca accumulated previously. Cyanide, oligomycin, ouabain, or varying Na+ or K+ concentrations had no effect on Ca uptake. A Ca-activated ATPase was present in the same membrane vesicles, which had a Vmax of 25 pmol of Pi/micrograms of protein/min at a free Ca concentration of 4-5 microM. This Ca-ATPase had Km values for Ca and ATP of 0.6 and 90 microM, respectively. These kinetic parameters were similar to those observed for uptake of Ca by the vesicles. The Ca-ATPase activity was insensitive to azide, oligomycin, ouabain, or varying Na+ or K+ concentrations. No Ca-activated hydrolysis of GTP or UTP was observed. Both Ca transport and the Ca-ATPase activity of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-treated lymphocyte plasma membranes were stimulated 2-fold by a cytoplasmic component (calmodulin) that was purified 500-fold from lymphocyte cytoplasm. Thus, human lymphocyte plasma membranes have both a Ca transport activity and a Ca-stimulated ATPase activity with similar substrate affinities and specificities and similar sensitivities to calmodulin."

In this paper, we investigated the enzyme responsible for its synthesis. We have found an enzyme from rat liver which catalyzes the formation of activation factor from fructose-6-P and ATP-Mg and it has been identified as fructose-2,6-P2. Fructose-1,6-P2, fructose-1-P, or fructose does not serve as a substrate. This enzyme has been partially purified and shown to be different from phosphofructokinase. Several lines of evidence indicate that the in vitro synthetic product is identical with chemically synthesized fructose-2,6-P2: (a) it is active in our assay for activation factor which is based on counteraction of ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase; (b) it is acid labile as is fructose-2,6-P2; and (c) it shows the same mobility as synthetic fructose-2,6-P2 upon paper chromatography and the acid hydrolysis product has been identified as fructose-6-P. Thus, this new enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of the activation factor from fructose-6-P and ATP-Mg."

The protein is an oligomer of 22,000-dalton subunits migrating as a single electrophoretic band on native, as well as on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Estimates of a Stokes radius of 41 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S, a Mr = 61,000, and a frictional coefficient of 1.57 suggest that native protein i is a highly asymmetric oligomer composed of three identical subunits. About 50 such molecules are present/cell. Cross-linking the protein with dimethylsuberimidate or dimethyladipimidate produced three major bands corresponding to the monomer, dimer, and trimer, as well as two minor bands corresponding to the tetramer and pentamer. Incorporation of 3H-labeled trimeric protein i into the prepriming replication intermediate (primosome) occurs at a stage requiring participation of dnaB and dnaC proteins, and follows the actions of proteins n, n', and n. After extension of primers by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, protein i is not retained in the isolated primosome complex. Thus, protein i is essential in the assembly of a functional primosome, but its precise physiologic role and genetic locus are still unknown."

The results of these studies indicate that in skeletal muscle and heart the levels of the major liver phosphofructokinase isozyme (PFK-L2) and the muscle phosphofructokinase isozyme (PFK-M) are dependent on the developmental status of the rat. For example, PFK-L2 and PFK-M are present in fetal and early neonatal skeletal muscle; whereas in adult skeletal muscle, only PFK-M is detectable. By DEAE- cellulose chromatography, PFK-L2 activity was estimated to be 2.4 units/g (41% of total phosphofructokinase activity) in fetal muscle, very low and not resolved from PFK-M in 7-day neonatal muscle, and not detectable in adult muscle. Further, PFK-M activity was found to be 3.4 units/g (59% of total phosphofructokinase activity), 10 units/g, and 31.6 units/g in fetal, 7-day neonatal, and adult skeletal muscle, respectively. The developmental changes of heart phosphofructokinase isozymes differ considerably from that of the skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase isozymes. In fetal heart, PFK-L2 is the major phosphofructokinase isozyme (5.6 units/g), constituting 67% of total phosphofructokinase activity. Further, in fetal heart another phosphofructokinase isozyme (33% of total phosphofructokinase activity) was found by DEAE-cellulose chromatography which is different from PFK-M and PFK-L2. In 7-day neonatal and adult heart, PFK-M and PFK-L2 are the only detectable phosphofructokinase isozymes. Varying from 5.6 units/g (44% of total) in 7-day neonatal to 5.9 units/g (40% of total) in adult heart, PFK-L2 activity remains fairly constant. Also, PFK-M is very low in fetal heart but increases within 1 week postpartum to 5.5 units/g (50% of total activity) and to 8.9 units/g (60% of total activity) in adult heart."

Soluble F1 has been shown previously to contain two tight-binding site for Mg. Both of these sites were present on membrane-bound enzyme. Co and Mn, substituted at the second of the two Mg-binding sites on soluble F1, became incorporated with F1 into membrane-bound enzyme. Use of radioactive Co and Mn showed that they behaved differently during short bursts of succinate oxidation or ATP hydrolysis. Co remained stably bound, whereas Mn was released to the extent of 55-80%. The results extend previous work to show that the membrane proton-ATPase is an Mg-metalloenzyme containing a structural Mg site and a second Mg site possibly involved in catalysis. The conversion of 2-Mg F1 to 1-Mg F1 during purification and storage is shown to be due to use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the dependence of reuptake of Mg (1-Mg F1 leads to 2-Mg F1) on nucleotides is described."

Several anion transport inhibitors, when utilized in the presence of FCCP, also eliminated the proton gradient. These experiments demonstrate that a modified Donan-type equilibrium dependent upon selective permeability of membranes to protons has no role in maintenance of the acidic pH of the acrosome. N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofuran, inhibitors of the mitochondrial proton-translocating ATPase, dissipated the proton concentration gradient when FCCP was present. Oligomycin and ouabain had no effect, either in the presence or absence of FCCP.

Although the uracil-dependent decarboxylation was much slower than the coupled reaction, both reactions were similar with respect to the requirement for molecular oxygen, the stoichiometric formation of succinate, and the stimulations effected by Fe2+, ascorbate, and catalase. That the same enzyme catalyzed both reactions was indicated by the parallel loss of the uracil- and thymine-dependent activities upon heat denaturation, their copurification, and the lower level of both activities in a mutant strain deficient in the 7-hydroxylase. These data are consonant with molecular oxygen initially attacking alpha-ketoglutarate in the thymine 7-hydroxylase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1784310188,"The rate of renaturation of denatured, covalently closed, circular DNA (form Id DNA) of the phi X174 replicative form has been investigated as a function of pH, temperature, and ionic strength. The rate at a constant temperature is a sharply peaked function of pH in the range of pH 9 to 12. The position on the pH scale of the maximum rate decreases as the temperature is increased and as the ionic strength is increased. The kinetic course of renaturation is pseudo-first order: it is independent of DNA concentration, but falls off in rate from a first order relationship as the reaction proceeds. The rate of renaturation depends critically on the temperature at which the denaturation is carried out. Form Id, prepared at an alkaline pH at 0 degrees C, renatures from 5 to more than 100 times more rapidly than that similarly prepared at 50 degrees C. Both the heterogeneity in rate and the effect of the temperature of denaturation depend, in part, on the degree of supercoiling of the form I DNA from which the form Id is prepared. However, it is concluded that a much larger contribution to both arises from a configurational heterogeneity introduced in the denaturation reaction. The renaturation rate was determined by neutralization of the alkaline reaction and analytical ultracentrifugal analysis of the amounts of forms I and Id. The nature of the proximate renatured species at the temperature and alkaline pH of renaturation was investigated by spectrophotometric titration and analytical ultracentrifugation. It is concluded that the proximate species are the same as the intermediate species defined by an alkaline sedimentation titration of the kind first done by Vinograd et al. ((1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 53, 1104-1111). Observations are included on the buoyant density of form Id and on depurination of DNA at alkaline pH values and high temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W1487766000,A comparison was made of the subunit sensitivities of the F1-ATPase and the Triton-solubilized ATPase complex to trypsin degradation. The dissociation of the F1-ATPase from ATPase complex increased the trypsin sensitivity of subunit 3 by a factor of 2 and increased the sensitivity of a particular trypsin site (or group of sites) on subunit 1 by 7-fold. The overall degradation of subunits 1 and 2 appears to be the same in solubilized ATPase complex and the F1-ATPase. Implications of these findings for structural models of the ATPase complex are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2109230499,The role of tyrosine in the catalytic mechanism of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by beef heart mitochondrial ATPase is explored. We compare the rates of the ATPase reaction by both nitrated and native F1 at both pH 8 and pH 6. The pH-activity profile of nitrated F1 is compared to the pH-activity profile of the unmodified enzyme. These data indicate that the phenolic group of an active-site tyrosine must be protonated during the hydrolysis reaction. Deuterium oxide is used in the reaction buffer to explore the role of protons in the ATPase reaction. Kinetic constants of the nucleoside triphosphates are obtained at various levels of D2O using both the nitrated and native forms of F1. Several nucleoside diphosphates are used as inhibitors of F1-catalyzed ITP hydrolysis. Dissociation constants of these inhibitors are obtained at both low and high concentrations of D2O for both the nitrated and native F1. We explore the possibility that a tyrosine and an arginine lie in close proximity in the F1 active site by studying the effects of sequential modification of arginine and tyrosine. These results are interpreted in terms of possible ATP hydrolysis mechanisms. Two possible roles for tyrosine in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates by F1 are suggested.
https://openalex.org/W1547849812,"A histone-binding polypeptide of 25,000 Mr (J2) in the saline-EDTA wash of mouse liver nuclei was purified to homogeneity in three steps: 1) ammonium sulfate fractionation, 2) hydrophobic chromatography using omega-amino butyl agarose, and 3) DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The isolation conditions were mild, and avoided extremes of pH and use of chaotropic reagents. The purified polypeptide was similar, although not identical, to calf thymus HMG-1 (high mobility group protein). The molecular weight, migration in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, and the amino acid sequence of the first 9 residues of the NH2-terminal region were identical for the two proteins. The amino acid analysis, however, indicated the mouse liver polypeptide was more acidic, with a lower content of lysine and higher contents of serine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid. The mouse liver and calf thymus proteins differ in extraction from nuclei and solubility at neutral pH. The J2 polypeptide reacted with affinity-purified HMG-1 antibody by complement fixation, but always at a lower level than the homologous antigen purified with chaotropic reagents. We conclude the J2 polypeptide is an HMG-1-like protein. The intrinsic hydrophobicity of HMG-1 may be important in its functional interaction with DNA and histones."

https://openalex.org/W1484190033,"F1I, the specific ATPase inhibitor protein, and the chromium(III) analogs of ATP and ADP, CrATP and CrADP, were used to study the inhibition of Pi goes to and comes from ATP exchange reaction catalyzed by beef heart submitochondrial particles. F1I was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of the exchange reaction. CrATP and CrADP, both competitive inhibitors of ATP hydrolysis in isolated F1 (Schuster, S. M., Ebel, R. E., and Lardy, H. A. (1975) ARch. Biochem. Biophys. 171, 656-661) were shown to be competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors of Pi goes to and comes from ATP exchange, respectively. Dual inhibitor studies were done using combinations of F1I and the chromium nucleotides, or the nucleotide analogs in combination. All cases show sets of intersecting Dixon plots indicative of interacting inhibitors. Upward curvature is also evident on some of the plots. This phenomenon was explained using the concept of multiple synergistic binding of the inhibitors. Binding mechanisms and their relevant kinetic equations were postulated to explain the results of the dual inhibitor studies. They support the notion that in addition to the catalytic site, there are two types of regulatory binding sites on F1, one specific for nucleotides and one specific for F1I. When one of these sites is occupied, other sites are either opened or other inhibitors become more potent."
