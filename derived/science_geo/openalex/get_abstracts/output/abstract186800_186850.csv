https://openalex.org/W2150163104,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells undergo extended proliferation while remaining poised for multilineage differentiation. A unique network of transcription factors may characterize self-renewal and simultaneously suppress differentiation. We applied expression cloning in mouse ES cells to isolate a self-renewal determinant. Nanog is a divergent homeodomain protein that directs propagation of undifferentiated ES cells. Nanog mRNA is present in pluripotent mouse and human cell lines, and absent from differentiated cells. In preimplantation embryos, Nanog is restricted to founder cells from which ES cells can be derived. Endogenous Nanog acts in parallel with cytokine stimulation of Stat3 to drive ES cell self-renewal. Elevated Nanog expression from transgene constructs is sufficient for clonal expansion of ES cells, bypassing Stat3 and maintaining Oct4 levels. Cytokine dependence, multilineage differentiation, and embryo colonization capacity are fully restored upon transgene excision. These findings establish a central role for Nanog in the transcription factor hierarchy that defines ES cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W2126851387,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts grow infinitely while maintaining pluripotency. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells through activation of Stat3. However, LIF/Stat3 is dispensable for maintenance of ICM and human ES cells, suggesting that the pathway is not fundamental for pluripotency. In search of a critical factor(s) that underlies pluripotency in both ICM and ES cells, we performed in silico differential display and identified several genes specifically expressed in mouse ES cells and preimplantation embryos. We found that one of them, encoding the homeoprotein Nanog, was capable of maintaining ES cell self-renewal independently of LIF/Stat3. nanog-deficient ICM failed to generate epiblast and only produced parietal endoderm-like cells. nanog-deficient ES cells lost pluripotency and differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm lineage. These data demonstrate that Nanog is a critical factor underlying pluripotency in both ICM and ES cells."

Hydroxylation of one or two critical prolines by specific hydroxylases (P4Hs) targets their HIF-α subunits for proteasomal degradation. By studying the three human HIF-P4Hs, we found that the longest and shortest isoenzymes have major transcripts encoding inactive polypeptides, which suggest novel regulation by alternative splicing. Recombinant HIF-P4Hs expressed in insect cells required peptides of more than 8 residues, distinct differences being found between isoenzymes. All the HIF-P4Hs hydroxylated peptides corresponding to Pro564 in HIF-1α, whereas a Pro402 peptide had 20–50-fold K m values for two isoenzymes but was not hydroxylated by the shortest isoenzyme at all; this difference was not explained by the two prolines being in a -Pro402-Ala- and -Pro564-Tyr-sequence. All the HIF-P4Hs-hydroxylated peptides corresponding to two of three potential sites in HIF-2α and one in HIF-3α. The K m values for O2 were slightly above its atmospheric concentration, indicating that the HIF-P4Hs are effective oxygen sensors. Small molecule inhibitors of collagen P4Hs also inhibited the HIF-P4Hs, but with distinctly different K i values, indicating that it should be possible to develop specific inhibitors for each class of P4Hs and possibly even for the individual HIF-P4Hs.

HIFs are αβ heterodimers in which both the α and β subunits are basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim proteins, and the human α subunits have three isoforms, HIF-1α to HIF-3α (for reviews see Refs. 1Semenza G.L.

HIF-1α and HIF-2α are synthesized continuously, and at least one of two critical proline residues, Pro402 and Pro564 in HIF-1α, becomes hydroxylated under normoxic conditions (3Ivan M. Kondo K.

This hydroxylation, which requires oxygen, ceases under hypoxic conditions so that HIF-α escapes degradation and forms the αβ dimer with HIF-β. This dimer then becomes bound to the HIF-responsive elements in a number of hypoxia-inducible genes, such as those for erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Semenza G.L.

A family of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs), enzymes residing within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, has been extensively characterized and shown to act on -X-Pro-Glysequences (7Kivirikko K.I.

These novel enzymes resemble the C-P4Hs in that they require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate. The three HIF-P4Hs show a 42–59% sequence identity to each other but no distinct sequence similarity to the C-P4Hs. The three critical Fe2+-binding residues identified in the C-P4Hs (13Lamberg A.

Most experiments reported so far on the HIF-P4Hs have used enzymes prepared in reticulocyte lysates and assays based on capture of the hydroxylated substrate by the VHL protein (10Bruick R.K.

These assays do not always allow one to distinguish between the critical requirements for hydroxylation and binding of the hydroxylated product, and they are not suitable for any detailed studies of the catalytic properties of the enzymes. Preliminary data suggest that hydroxylation of Pro402 may be less efficient than that of Pro564 and may not be performed by HIF-P4H-3 at all (11Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.-M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar), but no kinetic data are available on possible differences in the hydroxylation of the two sites by the three isoenzymes, nor are any data available on possible hydroxylation of similar sequences in HIF-2α or HIF-3α. It is also unknown whether the three isoenzymes show differences in their kinetic constants for O2 and other co-substrates or for small molecule inhibitors. In the present work we expressed all three human HIF-P4H isoenzymes as recombinant proteins in insect cells and adopted an assay based on the measurement of the amount of 14CO2 released during the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate. This is similar to the assay used for the C-P4Hs (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and made it possible to study differences between the isoenzymes in their hydroxylation of various peptide substrates and their kinetic constants for the co-substrates. We also studied inhibition of the enzymes by several compounds known to inhibit C-P4Hs. It became evident during the early stages of this work that transcripts of two of the three isoenzymes are alternatively spliced, with major variants encoding inactive polypeptides. Cloning of the HIF-P4H Isoenzymes and Generation of Expression Vectors—The cDNAs encoding the human HIF-P4Hs 1–3 were obtained by PCR amplification from colon, aorta, and lung Marathon-Ready cDNAs (Clontech). The PCR products were cloned into pUC18 using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences) and sequenced on an automated DNA sequencer (Abi Prism 377, Applied Biosystems). Full-length HIF-P4H-1 and -3 cDNAs were obtained, but the HIF-P4H-2 PCR product had a 51-nucleotide insertion instead of the codons for Cys58–Pro175 (named HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant). The correct HIF-P4H-2 exon 1 sequence spanning this region was amplified from genomic DNA using Advantage-GC2 polymerase (BD Biosciences) and cloned as a blunt-XhoI fragment into the HIF-P4H-2 PRC variant to generate the full-length HIF-P4H-2 cDNA. The full-length HIF-P4H-1–3 cDNAs and the HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant were cloned into the pVL and pAcG3X baculovirus expression vectors (Pharmingen), and the HIF-P4H-3 cDNA was also cloned into a pBlueBacHis baculovirus expression vector (Pharmingen), and the HIF-P4H-1 and -3 cDNAs into a pMALc Escherichia coli expression vector (New England Biolabs). Site-directed mutagenesis of HIF-P4H-1 cDNA was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). PCR Analysis of HIF-P4H mRNA Expression in Various Tissues— Expression of HIF-P4H-1–3 cDNAs in various tissues was studied by PCR analysis of human multiple tissue cDNA (MTC™) panel I and human fetal MTC panel (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primer pairs 5′-TGCCCGGGGGATGAAGACACTGCTGCCA-3′ and 5′-TCTGCCATGCGGCTCTGGGACTGGCCAG-3′, and 5′-ATTCTGCGGGCGAGATGCCCCTGGGACA-3′ and 5′-ATGAACAAGGCCAGCAGATTTCAGAGCT-3′, amplifying full-length HIF-P4H-1 and HIF-P4H-3, respectively, were used in the analyses. Expression of HIF-P4H-2 mRNA was studied using the primers 5′-GGCCTGCGGCCCAACGGGCAGACGAAG-3′ (starting from nucleotide 532 of HIF-P4H-2 cDNA) and 5′-GGGTATTGCTGGATCAAAGGCTCTAGAAG-3′. The identities of the PCR products were verified by sequencing. Expression of Recombinant HIF-P4H Isoenzymes in Insect Cells and E. coli—The recombinant baculovirus expression vectors were co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were amplified (16Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System; Instruction Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Sf9 or High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106/100-mm plate or 1 × 106/ml and infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of 5. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, and homogenized in a 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8. The pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS, and aliquots of all the soluble fractions were analyzed by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with antibodies against the histidine (Amersham Biosciences) or GST (Pharmingen) tags. The recombinant polypeptides containing histidine or GST tags were purified according to the HiTrap Chelating HP and GSTrap FF manuals (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant E. coli expression plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). The maltose-binding protein fusion polypeptides were expressed and purified according to the pMAL protein fusion and purification system manual (New England Biolabs). P4H Activity Assays—HIF-P4H activity was assayed by a modified method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 1.0 ml, which contained 10–100 μl of the Triton X-100 extracts of the insect cells expressing recombinant HIF-P4H isoenzymes as sources of the enzyme, 0.025 or 0.05 μmol of the peptide DLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQL (Innovagen) as a substrate, 0.005 μmol of FeSO4, 0.16 μmol of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (160 000 dpm), 2 μmol of ascorbate, 60 μg of catalase (Sigma), 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, 2 mg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 50 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7.8 at 25 °C. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min. K m values for various HIF peptide substrates (Innovagen), 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, and O2 were determined at saturating concentrations of the other components, except that the O2 concentration was that of air and thus non-saturating. In the experiments in which the O2 concentration was varied, the reaction mixtures were equilibrated by bubbling with gas mixtures of 1–45% O2 (AGA) for 10 min at room temperature. The tubes were closed and equilibrated by shaking at room temperature for 30 min, after which the enzyme and 2-oxoglutarate were added by injection, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C. The amount of dissolved oxygen was measured with a model 781 oxygen meter equipped with a microcathode oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin Instruments). K i values were determined by adding the inhibitors at four to five constant concentrations, whereas the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate was varied. The K m value for O2 of purified recombinant human type I C-P4H (17Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was determined using the standard P4H activity assay with (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (Peptide Institute) as a substrate (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Cloning of the HIF-P4H-1–3 cDNAs—In order to express the three human HIF-P4H isoenzymes as recombinant proteins, the cDNAs encoding human HIF-P4Hs 1–3 were amplified by PCR from human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA pools using specific primers, and the PCR products were cloned into pUC18 and sequenced (the numbers used here correspond to PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 in Ref. 11Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.-M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession numbers XP_040482, AAG33965, and NP_071356, respectively). The encoded amino acid sequences of the full-length HIF-P4H-1 and HIF-P4H-3 cDNAs obtained were identical to the above GenBank™ sequences, whereas the PCR product of HIF-P4H-2 corresponded to a variant (Fig. 1) in which the nucleotides encoding residues Cys58–Pro175 were missing and were replaced by a 51-nucleotide stretch encoding -Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Phe-Ser-Trp-Asn-Ser-Asp-Glu-Arg-Ala-. Surprisingly, this 51-nucleotide stretch was found to represent the non-coding strand of the HIF-P4H-2 cDNA between bp 450–500 in a 3′ to 5′ direction. A slightly different HIF-P4H-2 variant lacking amino acids Gly76–Gly177 has been stated previously (10Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar) to represent a splicing variant and shown to hydroxylate Pro564 in a HIF-1α peptide in vitro. Neither of these two HIF-P4H-2 PCR variants was found to follow the GT/AG consensus rule of intron splicing, however. We also attempted to amplify the HIF-P4H-2 sequence encoding amino acids Cys58–Pro175 with the Advantage2 polymerase from genomic DNA but only obtained the same PCR variant as from the cDNA pools. A correct full-length PCR product could be obtained with the Advantage-GC2 polymerase, however. It is very likely that this DNA region, which has a high GC content, shows a strong tendency to form secondary structures, which makes it difficult to amplify correct products and increases the likelihood of aberrant variants. Analysis of the Expression of mRNAs for the Three Human HIF-P4H Isoenzymes Indicates Alternative Splicing in Various Tissues—In addition to the HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant and the full-length HIF-P4H-1 and -3 cDNAs obtained by PCR amplification of colon, aorta, and lung cDNA pools, smaller fragments originating from HIF-P4H-2 and -3 were also obtained in the same reactions. In order to analyze whether they represented alternatively spliced forms, the expression of the HIF-P4H mRNAs in various tissues was studied further by PCR amplification of adult and fetal human multiple tissue cDNA panels. For HIF-P4Hs 1 and 3 specific primers were used to amplify the full-length cDNAs, whereas in the case of HIF-P4H-2 the forward primer was from the 3′ end of exon 1, as this exon contains a GC-rich region that easily generates PCR errors. Full-length HIF-P4H-1 cDNA was amplified in all the tissues studied (Fig. 2A); no smaller PCR products were detected. The level of HIF-P4H-1 mRNA expression was highest in the adult brain, placenta, lung, and kidney (Fig. 2A). A full-length HIF-P4H-2 PCR product starting from the 3′ end of exon 1, with a size of 476 bp, was likewise amplified in all the tissues (Fig. 2B); the levels of HIF-P4H-2 mRNA expression were the highest in the adult heart, brain, lung, and liver and in the fetal brain, heart, spleen, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2B). Two additional HIF-P4H-2 PCR products with smaller sizes of ∼350 and 400 bp were obtained in amplifications from several tissues, however (Fig. 2B), and sequencing showed that they represented splicing variants lacking the exon 3 or 4 sequences, respectively (Fig. 1). The levels of expression of these splicing variants were considerably lower in all the tissues than that of the HIF-P4H-2 mRNA containing all the exons from 1 to 4 (Fig. 2B). Full-length HIF-P4H-3 cDNA was amplified from all the tissues; its expression level was the highest in the adult heart, brain, placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle and in the fetal heart, spleen, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2C). In addition to the band representing the full-length HIF-P4H-3 cDNA, one representing a smaller product of ∼500 bp was found in about a 1:1 ratio in all the tissues studied (Fig. 2C). Sequencing of this band showed that it represented a splicing variant lacking the HIF-P4H-3 nucleotides 76–357, and thus encoded a shortened polypeptide lacking amino acids 26–119 (Fig. 1). All the alternatively spliced HIF-P4H-2 and -3 mRNAs followed the GT/AG rule. Recombinant Expression of the HIF-P4H Isoenzymes—The full-length HIF-P4H isoenzymes and the HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant with a -Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Phe-Ser-Trp-Asn-Ser-Asp-Glu-Arg-Ala-sequence replacing Cys58–Pro175 were expressed as recombinant polypeptides in insect cells. All three isoenzymes were also expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and HIF-P4H-3 was further expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection and solubilized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the HIF-P4H-2 polypeptide was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 3), whereas the vast majority of the other polypeptides was found in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3, A–C, even-numbered lanes). Nevertheless, distinct bands corresponding to isoenzyme 1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3) and the GST-fused forms of isoenzymes 1 and 3 (Fig. 3, A and C, lanes 5) could be seen in the soluble fraction. The HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant, GST-HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant, HIF-P4H-3 and His-HIF-P4H-3 polypeptides were not detectable in the soluble fraction in the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 7, and C, lanes 3 and 7), but a definitive level of HIF-P4H activity was found in the soluble fraction of the cells expressing these polypeptides (see below), and the presence of the histidine-tagged and GST-fused HIF-P4H-3 polypeptides in the soluble fraction could further be verified by Western blotting (Fig. 3D). Development of a Simple Activity Assay and Measurement of the Activities of the HIF-P4Hs in Cell Extracts—The most commonly used assay for the C-P4Hs is based on the hydroxylation of a synthetic peptide substrate such as (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and measurement of the radioactivity of the 14CO2 formed during the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We adopted this assay for measurement of the activities of the HIF-P4Hs using as a standard substrate a synthetic 19-residue peptide with a sequence identical to that around the C-terminal hydroxylation site of HIF-1α. Extensive optimization experiments resulted in the reactant concentrations and assay conditions given under “Materials and Methods.” The assay was found to be linear with increasing concentrations of cell extracts expressing the recombinant enzymes for up to about 6000–9000 dpm of 14CO2 generated (as shown for isoenzyme 1 in Fig. 4A), and with time for at least 25 min provided that the amount of recombinant enzyme used produced less than about 6000–9000 dpm in this time (as shown for isoenzyme 3 in Fig. 4B). Variation of the concentration of the peptide substrate (as shown for isoenzyme 2 in Fig. 4C) or any of the co-substrates gave typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (as shown for 2-oxoglutarate with respect to isoenzyme 3 in Fig. 4D). The assay is simple and rapid and was found to be suitable for all the experiments reported below. Significant levels of HIF-P4H activity were found in the soluble fractions of insect cells expressing any of the three recombinant isoenzymes (Table I). The differences in the activity values shown do not represent differences in the specific activities of the three isoenzymes, as their expression levels and solubilities in the extraction buffer were not equal (see Fig. 3). The presence of a GST fusion partner slightly increased the activity levels obtained with HIF-P4H-1 and HIF-P4H-2 PCR variant, whereas a marked increase was obtained with HIF-P4H-3 (Table I). These increases were most probably because of improved solubility of the GST fusion proteins in the extraction buffer (see Fig. 3).Table IHIF-P4H activity levels in Triton X-100 extracts of H5 insect cells expressing various forms of HIF-P4H isoenzymesEnzymeHIF-P4H activitydpm/100 μl aValues are given in dpm/100 μl of extractable cell protein.

Open table in a new tab The highest observed activity values for the three isoenzymes ranged to about 0.16–0.22 nmol of 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylated per μg of protein/20 min. If the purities of the isoenzymes in the cell extracts were 100%, these values would correspond to about 0.4–0.55 mol of 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylated per mol of enzyme/min, depending on the isoenzyme. The purities of the enzymes in the soluble fractions are likely to be far less than 1%, however, and thus the true specific activities are likely to be much more than 100-fold, i.e. much more than 40–55 mol/mol/min. Although these estimates are highly inaccurate, it should be noted that a highly purified HIF-P4H-1 produced in E. coli had a specific activity of only 12 × 10–6 mol/mol/min (18McNeill L.A.

Components of the Lac and Ntr systems were used to construct genetic circuits that display toggle switch or oscillatory behavior. Both devices contain an “activator module” consisting of a modified glnA promoter with lac operators, driving the expression of the activator, NRI. Since NRI activates the glnA promoter, this creates an autoactivated circuit repressible by LacI. The oscillator contains a “repressor module” consisting of the NRI-activated glnK promoter driving LacI expression. This circuitry produced synchronous damped oscillations in turbidostat cultures, with periods much longer than the cell cycle. For the toggle switch, LacI was provided constitutively; the level of active repressor was controlled by using a lacY mutant and varying the concentration of IPTG. This circuitry provided nearly discontinuous expression of activator."

Allosteric rearrangement of mRNA structure is mediated by ligand binding, and this results in modulation of gene expression. We have identified a class of riboswitches that selectively recognizes guanine and becomes saturated at concentrations as low as 5 nM. In Bacillus subtilis, this mRNA motif is located on at least five separate transcriptional units that together encode 17 genes that are mostly involved in purine transport and purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Our findings provide further examples of mRNAs that sense metabolites and that control gene expression without the need for protein factors. Furthermore, it is now apparent that riboswitches contribute to the regulation of numerous fundamental metabolic pathways in certain bacteria."

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The morphology of mitochondria is regulated by the controlled action of fusion and fission mechanisms, which give rise to, in many cases, a branched tubular network extending throughout the cell (5Westermann B.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F1-F4Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,7Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), whereas Mdm33 is involved in the fission of the inner mitochondrial membrane (8Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Deletion of any of these genes abrogates the fission mechanism, and fusion continues unabated leading to a fused mitochondrial network. Dnm1p is a dynamin-related GTPase that assembles on the fission points and is thought to form a circular structure that “pinches” or constricts the outer membrane. The constriction and complete fission of the OMM requires Mdv1p, which is thought to act as an adaptor molecule between Dnm1p and Fis1p, the latter being an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein. In the absence of Fis1p, Dnm1p can no longer associate with the OMM and is distributed in a diminished number of punctate spots in the cytosol. Further delineation of this pathway has shown that Fis1p not only allows initial assembly of Dnm1p but also the final scission process, which is dependent on the presence of Mdv1p. The mechanisms of mitochondrial fission in other eukaryotic species are less clearly understood. Orthologues of Dnm1p have been characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans (DRP1 (9Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M.C Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar)) and mammals (Drp1 (10Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar)), but they are different in their functionality. Expression of DRP1 in C. elegans promotes mitochondrial fission, but expression of mammalian Drp1 has no effect on the morphology of mitochondria. In addition Drp1 has recently been implicated in the division of peroxisomes (11Koch A. Thiemann M. Grabenbauer M. Yoon Y. McNiven M.A. Schrader M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8597-8605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the regulation of mitochondrial morphology is a key factor in the process of apoptosis. Exposure of cells to apoptotic inducers leads to fragmentation of their mitochondria and the release of apoptogenic proteins from the intermembrane space (3Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that expression of a mutant Drp1 (Drp1(K38A)) blocked the fragmentation of mitochondria induced by either treatment with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or expression of Bax, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Importantly, expression of Drp1(K38A) reduced the staurosporine-induced release of cytochrome c and inhibited apoptosis (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). As yeast Dnm1p requires Fis1p for complete fission of the mitochondria, we identified and cloned the human orthologue of Fis1p (hFis1) and studied its function in mammalian mitochondrial morphology. Isolation and Expression of hFis1—The human homologue of Fis1 (NP057152) was shown to be CGI-135-like (BC009428) after performing a Fasta 3.3 homology search (EBI, Hinxton, UK (13Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar)). Oligonucleotides derived from the 5′ and 3′ untranslated region of CGI-135-like were used to amplify, by PCR (Pwo or Tgo polymerase, Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), CGI-135-like from a human liver library (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland). This template was used in a further PCR step to add His (MAHHHHHH) or HA (MQDLPGNDNSTAGL) tags 5 prime to the ORF of hFis1 lacking the initial methionine or a deletion mutant that lacked the last 28 amino acids (ΔTM). The PCR products were ligated into pCI (Promega, Madison, WI), and all positive clones were sequenced. YFP/CFP/GFP-hFis1 was generated by PCR with the appropriate oligonucleotides to add restriction enzyme sites to the ORF or ORF-ΔTM of hFis1, which was then subcloned into pECFP-CI, pEGFP-CI, pEYFP-CI, or pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Expression plasmids for HA-Drp1 and HA-Drp1 K38A were obtained from A van der Bliek and subcloned using PCR into pCI with an alternative HA tag (as above) or as YFP/CFP fusions. Recombinant hFis1 protein was generated by subcloning His-hFis1ΔTM into pTYB1 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The resultant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for production of the recombinant protein. The intein-His-hFis1 fusion protein was purified over a chitin column, cleaved by dithiothreitol, further purified by affinity to Nickel resin (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) and subsequently dialyzed against 30% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Immunizations and antisera collection were performed by Sigma-Genosys (Pampisford, UK). Cell Culture and Reagents—HEK 293, COS-7, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Tissue culture plates were obtained from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark), and all other cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland). The mitochondrial specific dye MitoTracker™ Red CMXRos, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Fluorescent images were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV with a 100× objective, and images were captured using a charge-couple device camera (photometric CE200A) with IP Lab software. Alternatively, for confocal microscopy, images were visualized using a Zeiss inverted 200M microscope with a scanhead QLC100 Nipkow disk (Yokogawa) equipped with a 3-line argon laser 457/488/514 (Laser Physics) with AOTF control of laser lines (Visitech). Pictures were acquired with a Coolsnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific). Image acquisition and analysis was performed with Metamorph/Metafluor 4.1.2 software (Universal Imaging). The resultant images were processed using Adobe Photoshop version 6. Subcellular Fractionation—HeLa cells transfected with His-hFis1 for 24 h (or untransfected for endogenous hFis1) were fractionated as described previously (14Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). 100 μg of the mitochondrial fraction was incubated in 200 μl of MB buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) with 20 μg of proteinase K at room temp for the indicated times, subsequently pelleted at 10,000 g and lysed in 50 μlof1× SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE for analysis by Western blotting. The anti-prohibitin antibody was from Neo Markers (Fremont, CA), anti-human Bcl-xL from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti-His (H15) from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Live Cell Fluorescence—COS-7 or HeLa cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/3-cm glass bottomed dish (Mattek) 6 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with a 1:1 ratio of target DNA to YFP-mito (Clontech) and a total of 1 μg DNA/dish and observed after a minimum of 10 h post-transfection. Luciferase Assay—COS-7 cells in 3-cm dishes were transfected using Calcium phosphate with up to 2.0 μg of target DNA (pCI-GFP was used to make up any difference) together with 2.0 μg of pCI-Luc. All transfections were performed in triplicate. 16 h after transfection cells were washed once in TBS and cultured for a further 20 h. Cells were then washed once in PBS and lysed in 500 μl of luciferase assay buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temp. 10 μl of the extract was mixed with 50 μl of LDBII and immediately measured using a Turner TD-20e luminometer. All transfections were performed in triplicate. Immunocytochemistry—HeLa or COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips at a confluency of 50–80% in 6-well plates and maintained in culture medium for 2–3 h before transfection with 5 μg of DNA using a standard calcium Phosphate transfection procedure. 16 h after transfection the cells were washed in TBS for 10 min, followed by up to 20-h incubation in culture medium supplemented with 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature followed by PBS washes. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and, after PBS washes were blocked for 1 h at 4 °C, with PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/0.1% saponin/5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature followed by washes in PBS/0.1% saponin. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by incubating the cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled mouse secondary and Texas Red-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin for 1 h at room temperature, followed by PBS washes. During the last PBS wash, the cells were co-stained with Hoechst 33258 (25 μg/ml) to visualize the nucleus. The coverslips were then mounted using Vectashield H-100 fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). To visualize endogenous hFis1, untransfected cells, which had been plated on glass coverslips, were fixed for 5 min in 100% methanol and processed as above. For UV-induced apoptosis, cells were plated on glass coverslips as described above and transfected, using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with 0.2 μg YFP-mito together with 1.0 μg of Bcl-xL or HA-Drp1(K38A) or pCI-Luciferase. 48 h after transfection 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk was added to the media, and the cells were irradiated at 90 mJ/cm2 using a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene), cultured for a further 16 h, and processed for immunofluorescence as above. To assay cell death, prior to UV irradiation Z-VAD-fmk was omitted from the culture medium. 16 h following UV irradiation, cells were incubated for 30 min with Hoechst 33258, as described above, and transfected cells were scored for apoptotic nuclei. Cells that had a diffuse, non-mitochondrial immunofluorescence using the cytochrome c antibody were scored as having released cytochrome c. Cells were scored as having a fragmented mitochondrial network when >50% of the mitochondria appeared punctate. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen, Germany), anti-His polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-mHsp70 (ABR, Golden, CO). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were seeded in 14-cm dishes 2 h prior to transfection and transfected with a total of 20 μg of DNA using standard calcium phosphate techniques. 16 h after transfection, cells were washed once with 1× TBS, cultured for a further 8–20 h, washed once with 1× PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Hepes, 143 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) IGEPAL CA 630 supplemented with 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 20 min on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and incubated with anti-HA antibody (D. Picard, University of Geneva) for 16 h at 4 °C, and the immunocomplexes were captured on 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed four or five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and finally resuspended in 40 μl of 1× loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal anti-Bcl-xL (BD Pharmingen) or anti-HA antibody. The Human Homologue of Yeast Fis1p—Recent advances made in yeast have shed more light on the mechanisms that serve to divide or fuse mitochondria (6van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F1-F4Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the possibility that these may play a part in the apoptotic demise of a cell (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Although yeast Fis1p has been shown to be localized in the outer membrane of yeast mitochondria and to be necessary for yeast mitochondrial fission (15Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), the function of this protein in higher order eukaryotes is unknown. A search of the EMBL data base confirmed the human homologue of yeast Fis1p as CGI-135-like (accession number Q9BTB3), which was similar to a transcript identified using comparative gene identification (CGI) of the human and C. elegans databases (16Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CGI-135-like, which we call hFis1, is 30% homologous to Fis1p at the protein level and 23% at the nucleotide level. Further analysis revealed an orthologue in the mouse (accession number Q9CQ92), which was 96% homologous to hFis1 and orthologues in C. elegans (Q19383) and Drosophila melanogaster (AAL48886), which show 41 and 42% similarity to hFis1, respectively (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, there are two proteins in C. elegans (Q19383 and Q20291) and two in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Q94CK3 and Q9M1J1), which are homologous to hFis1 but as yet, only one Fis1p homologue has been found in humans. Two regions of high similarity are apparent from the alignment: the region spanning amino acids (aa) 71–87 from hFis1, which contains no known motif, and the region spanning aa 127–144, which Prosite (EBI, Hinxton, UK) identifies as a putative transmembrane domain. Prosite additionally identified a possible leucine zipper (aa 77–98), a coiled-coil (aa 108–120), and a TPR repeat, which suggest that hFis1 preferentially interacts with proteins containing WD40 repeats and could aggregate in multiprotein complexes. hFis1 Localizes to the Mitochondria—A polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant hFis1ΔTM and used to assess the subcellular localization of hFis1 in HeLa cells. The cells were found to display a typical mitochondrial staining that was confirmed by co-staining with the mitochondrial marker mHsp70 (Fig. 1C). We also generated expression constructs (Fig. 1B) to confirm the localization of hFis1, and tested the expression in other cell types, including COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (data not shown). Immunofluorescence performed on these cells expressing His-hFis1 confirmed a mitochondrial staining pattern (Fig. 1D). In contrast, a mutant of hFis1 lacking the C terminus (His-hFis1ΔTM) was found to be cytosolic, indicating that the C terminus is required for the mitochondrial localization. To define the submitochondrial localization of endogenous hFis1, mitochondria from HeLa cells were isolated and treated with proteinase K, which digested the parts of the outer membrane proteins exposed to the cytosol. Incubation with proteinase K reduced endogenous hFis1, whereas it did not reduce the levels of prohibitin, which is localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane, indicating that the outer mitochondrial membrane remained intact during the treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 1E). We furthermore showed that the overexpressed His-tagged hFis1 was also sensitive to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 1F). The proteolytic treatment significantly reduced the levels of another mitochondrial membrane protein: Bcl-xL. We therefore concluded that both endogenous and overexpressed hFis1 were localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and that the presence of the N-terminal tag did not affect the localization of hFis1. hFis1 Promotes Fragmentation of the Mitochondrial Network—During these studies we noticed that the morphology of mitochondria in cells overexpressing hFis1 was abnormal (Fig. 1D) and, therefore, decided to assess the role of hFis1 in mitochondrial morphology. To clearly visualize the changes induced by hFis1 on mitochondrial morphology we fused hFis1 to the C terminus of YFP. Fig. 2 shows representative fluorescent images of YFP-hFis1-expressing cells. At early time points (approximately 10 h, top panel) the mitochondrial network started to bud or fragment, and some mitochondrial swelling was apparent. Later time points (middle panel) were typified by mitochondria, which appear banded or striped and later still (approximately 16 h, bottom panel) the network had degenerated into the punctiform phenotype, which appeared to be identical to the His-tagged hFis1 (Fig. 1D and data not shown). We furthermore confirmed that the structures were part of a mitochondrial network by loading the cells with MitoTracker™ Red CMX Ros (data not shown). The deletion mutant of hFis1 (hFis1ΔTM) was fused to the N terminus of GFP, and its expression pattern showed that this mutant remained localized to the cytosol and did not affect mitochondrial morphology (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that insertion of a protein with a transmembrane domain into the outer membrane of mitochondria was sufficient to trigger fragmentation, we expressed a GFP protein fused to the transmembrane domain of Bax. This construct localized to mitochondria but did not induce fragmentation (data not shown). Therefore the effects seen with hFis1 appear to be specific. hFis1-induced Fragmentation Is Inhibited by Mutant Drp1— Changes in mitochondrial morphology in mammals is known to involve Drp1, which can relocalize from the cytosol to the points of mitochondrial division (17Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative mutant of Drp1 (Drp1(K38A)) has also been shown to hinder the changes in mitochondrial morphology induced by apoptotic inducers such as staurosporine (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that Drp1(K38A) might prevent the fragmentation induced by hFis1. Drp1 and Drp1(K38A) were subcloned and expressed as HA or CFP fusions and subsequently co-transfected with YFP-hFis1 to assess their effect on hFis1 induced changes in mitochondrial morphology. Expression of CFP-Drp1 had no discernable effect on hFis1-induced fragmentation (Fig. 3A). However, co-expression of CFP-Drp1(K38A) altered the morphology induced by hFis1 (Fig. 3B), and the mitochondrial network appeared as a number of long filaments as well as cisternae-like structures. A quantitative analysis revealed that expression of Drp1(K38A) was able to reduce the number of hFis1-expressing cells with fragmented mitochondria by 31 and 24% at 24 and 36 h, respectively, as compared with cells transfected with hFis1 alone. These results prompted us to investigate how the dominant negative of Drp1 inhibited hFis1 induced fragmentation. In yeast, it has been shown that, in the absence of Fis1p, Dnm1p (the yeast orthologue of Drp1) is not recruited to mitochondria (15Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested if Drp1(K38A) blocked the recruitment of Drp1 to the mitochondria. HeLa cells were co-transfected with hFis1, CFP-mito, and YFP-Drp1 in the presence or absence of HA-Drp1(K38A). Thirty-six hours after transfection the cells were fixed and examined using confocal microscopy. Fig. 3C shows that Drp1 (shown in red) localized principally to the ends of the mitochondria (shown in green). Expression of Drp1(K38A) dramatically altered the localization of Drp1, sequestering it into a number of (usually 3–5) discrete spots (Fig. 3D). We also verified that expression of the dominant negative Drp1 was able to alter localization of Drp1 in the absence of transfected hFis1 using YFP-Drp1 and CFP-Drp1(K38A) (see Supplemental Data). In addition, Western blot analysis of sodium carbonate-treated mitochondria showed that Drp1(K38A) diminished the amount of Drp1 found strongly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data indicate that Drp1(K38A) prevented hFis1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by sequestering Drp1, thereby preventing its localization to the mitochondria. Expression of hFis1 Induced a Caspase-dependent Reduction in Cell Viability—Our data so far showed that tagged hFis1 was effective in promoting the fragmentation of mitochondria and that its localization to the mitochondrial membrane was necessary for its function. However, we had noted that expression of hFis1 for more than 24 h correlated with an increased number of detached cells. We therefore investigated if fragmentation of mitochondria by hFis1 could affect cell viability. We utilized a luciferase assay where a reduction in the translation of a transfected luciferase construct correlates with a decrease in cellular viability after co-transfection with a target gene. Co-transfection with increasing amounts of HA-hFis1 reduced the amount of luciferase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). As a positive control we used a plasmid encoding His-tagged Bax, which has previously been shown to induce cell death and observed a pronounced decrease in luciferase activity (data not shown). The addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) effectively blocked the reduction in the luciferase activity at all concentrations of HA-hFis1 transfected (Fig. 4A and data not shown) indicating that a caspase-dependent process was leading to the changes in viability as assayed by luciferase activity. hFis1 Induces Cytochrome c release—Mitochondria are considered as pivotal organelles in many apoptotic responses. Perturbation of the outer membrane often leads to the release of apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome c. We therefore investigated if the expression of hFis1 led to cytochrome c release (Fig. 4B). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with His-tagged hFis1 and were fixed and stained for His expression and cytochrome c. Expression of hFis1 promoted the release of cytochrome c as shown by the diffuse staining of the cells. Identical results were also obtained using YFP-hFis1. Expression of the ΔTM mutant (His-hFis1ΔTM), which does not localize to mitochondria, did not alter the distribution of cytochrome c (Fig. 4C). These results therefore suggested that misregulated expression of hFis1 was sufficient to promote the redistribution of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Bcl-xL and Drp1(K38A) Inhibit the Cytochrome c Release Induced by hFis1—Anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, as well as Drp1(K38A) (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), are known to inhibit the apoptotic process at the mitochondrial membrane. We therefore tested if the co-expression of Bcl-xL and Drp1(K38A) could block the hFis1-induced cytochrome c release. Cells were transiently transfected with His-hFis1 and Bcl-xL or Drp1(K38A) and stained for cytochrome c 36 h later (Fig. 5A). Although 50% of cells expressing hFis1 had released cytochrome c, only 10% of cells co-expressing Bcl-xL and hFis1 and 15% of cells expressing Drp1(K38A) displayed a diffuse cytosolic cytochrome c staining (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the mitochondria in all cells co-expressing Bcl-xL and hFis1 were punctiform (Fig. 5A), whereas cells co-expressing Drp1(K38A) and hFis1 principally displayed elongated mitochondria. Bcl-xL but Not Drp1(K38A) Prevents hFis1-induced Apoptosis—We also investigated if Bcl-xL and Drp1(K38A) could also prevent apoptosis-induced by hFis1. We therefore co-transfected His-tagged hFis1 with Bcl-xL or Drp1(K38A) and luciferase (Fig. 5C). Bcl-xL but not Drp1(K38A) was able to inhibit the reduction in luciferase activity induced by hFis1. To ensure that the changes in luciferase activity were mirrored by changes in cell viability, cells were incubated with Hoechst and apoptotic nuclei were counted. As shown in Fig. 5C Bcl-xL significantly reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei induced by hFis1 expression, whereas Drp1(K38A) had no effect. hFis1 Triggers the Fragmentation of Mitochondria—In this study we have identified the human orthologue of Fis1p (hFis1) and show that its expression in cultured cells induces fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. The morphology of mitochondria resulting from the overexpression of hFis1 in mammalian cells is indicative of a role in mitochondrial fission and is consistent with previous data obtained in yeast (15Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 18Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although this finding would argue that the mitochondrial division machinery is conserved during evolution, nevertheless some differences are notable between species. Overexpression of YFP-hFis1 in various mammalian cells (HEK, COS-7, and HeLa) clearly resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 2A), whereas yeast cells that expressed GFP-Fis1p displayed no apparent fragmentation effect yet there was clear mitochondrial localization (15Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpressed Drp1 did not lead to fragmentation of mammalian mitochondria (data not shown and Ref. 10Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), as also shown in S. cerevisiae (Dnm1p (15Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)), whereas the orthologue in C. elegans (DRP (9Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M.C Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar)) localized to sites of mitochondrial division and promoted fission. Our data also showed that overexpressed Drp1 was insensitive to sodium carbonate treatment, which suggested that Drp1 was strongly attached to the mitochondrial membrane. In our experiments, overexpressed hFis1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane was sufficient to trigger a complete mitochondrial fission. Although no increase in the amount of overexpressed Drp1 was observed, it is possible that the conformation of Drp1 is altered upon hFis1 expression. One hypothesis is that high hFis1 levels overcome an endogenous inhibitor that would normally maintain the endogenous hFis1 in an inactive state and would impede the recruitment of the division apparatus. It is possible that in mammalian cells the signal that triggers fission of the OMM, as in yeast (8Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), initiates from the inner membrane fission apparatus. The inhibition of hFis1-induced fragmentation by Drp1(K38A) also places hFis1 within the mitochondrial fission apparatus, upstream of Drp1. However, we have been unable to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Drp1 and hFis1, and therefore the mechanism by which hFis1 recruits Drp1 is still unclear. The fact that this inhibition was only partial (on average 30%) suggests that Drp1(K38A) is unable to sequester all of the endogenous Drp1 from points of mitochondrial fission or that Drp1-independent fragmentation also occurred. Mitochondrial Fragmentation and Apoptosis—A link between mitochondrial fission and apoptosis has been recently made by Frank et al. (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 19Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) who reported that a mutant of Drp1, DrpK38A, was able to prevent apoptosis triggered by many stimuli. In addition, it was found that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax colocalized with members of both the fusion (Mfn2) and fission (Drp1) apparatus (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 19Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Here we show that prolonged misregulation of the mitochondrial fission apparatus was lethal for mammalian cells. Overexpression of hFis1 rapidly fragmented the mitochondrial network (Figs. 1D and 2) into clusters of punctate mitochondria that surrounded the nucleus. This striking change in morphology was accompanied 16 h later by a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and subsequent cell death. Overexpression of Bcl-xL was able to inhibit cytochrome c release and cell death, although this failed to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation. This suggests that Bcl-xL does not interfere with the fission machinery per se. However, overexpressed Bcl-xL was found to co-immunoprecipitate with overexpressed hFis1 (see Supplemental Data), but this interaction was not detected between the endogenous proteins. In contrast to Bcl-xL, Drp1(K38A) was able to prevent mitochondrial fission but not cell death. This suggested that the mechanism by which hFis1 triggered apoptosis did not involve proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, because Drp1(K38A) is known to inhibit many death stimuli involving these proteins (12Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that neither Bax nor Bak were activated in this process, because no conformational change in the N terminus of these proteins was detected using specific antibodies (data not shown). In addition, the cell death process appeared to be independent of the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), which Bcl-xL is known to prevent (20Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of hFis1-expressing cells with inhibitors of the PTP, namely bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A, did not reduce the amount of cell death (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that Bcl-xL inhibit hFis1-induced apoptosis by a mechanism that is Bax-, Bak-, and PTP-independent (21Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). How prolonged expression of hFis1 triggers apoptosis requires further investigation. These data are important in light of findings that have shown that a disease linked to mutations in the OPA1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in the fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane (22Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P.

Monocytes from patients with OPA1 mutations displayed an abnormal mitochondrial network, with clumps of punctate mitochondria (23Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie-Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), therefore suggesting that mutations in OPA1 lead to a more fragmented mitochondrial network. Our results suggest that the deregulated fission of mitochondria in the ganglion cells of the retina could be responsible for their degeneration through apoptosis. The characterization of a second component of the mammalian mitochondrial fission machinery provides another piece of the jigsaw of this complex process. It will be interesting to see, if like OPA1, defects in the regulation hFis1 are involved in human pathologies.

Saprophytic microorganisms produce and secrete a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, amylases, cellulases, and hemicellulases. These enzymes degrade organic biological substrates, providing nutrients for growth and contributing to carbon recycling in nature. Recently, a great deal of attention has focused on cellulases and hemicellulases produced by these organisms because of their potential to be produced industrially and used in degradation of biomass for a number applications, most notably biofuel production (1Biely P.

The principal component of biomass is cellulose. It consists of polymers of β-1,4-linked glucose residues that are organized into higher order fibrillar structures (8Bayer E.A. Chanzy H. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In addition to cellulose, biomass contains large quantities of hemicelluloses, heteropolysaccharides composed of two or more monosaccharides such as d-xylose, l-arabinose, d-mannose, d-glucose, d-galactose, and 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (1Biely P. Tenkanen M. Harman G.E. Kubicek C.P. Trichoderma and Gliocladium: Enzymes, Biological Control and Commercial Applications. Vol. 2. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1998: 25-47Google Scholar). Among the most prolific producers of biomass-degrading enzymes is the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The cellulase activity produced by T. reesei is composed of a complement of endoglucanases (EGI/Cel7B, EGII/Cel5A, EGIII/Cel12A, EGIV/Cel61A, and EGV/Cel45A) and exoglucanases (the cellobiohydrolases, CBHI/Cel7A, and CBHII/Cel6A) that act synergistically to break down cellulose to cellobiose (glycosyl β-1,4-glucose) (9Okada H.

Microbiol. 1994; 13: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Two β-glucosidases (BGLI/Cel3A and BGLII/Cel1A) have been identified that are implicated in hydrolyzing cellobiose to glucose (15Barnett C.C. Berka R.M. Fowler T. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Takashima S. Nakamura A. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uozumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 728-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An additional protein, swollenin (encoded by the gene swo1), has been described that disrupts crystalline cellulose structures, presumably making polysaccharides more accessible to hydrolysis (17Saloheimo M. Paloheimo M. Hakola S. Pere J. Swanson B. Nyyssonen E. Bhatia A. Ward M. Penttila M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4202-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The four most abundant components of T. reesei cellulase CBHI/Cel7A, CBHII/Cel6A, EGI/Cel7B, and EGII/Cel5A together constitute greater than 50% of the protein produced by the cell under inducing conditions and can be secreted in excess of 40 g/liter (18Durand H. Baron M. Calmels T. Tiraby G. FEMS Symp. 1998; 43: 135-152Google Scholar). The regulation of cellulolytic enzyme expression in T. reesei is complex and only partially understood. Transcription of the major components of cellulase (CBHI/Cel7A, CBHII/Cel6A, EGI/Cel7B, EGII/Cel5A, EGIII/Cel12A, EGIV/Cel61A, and EGV/Cel45A) is induced not only by cellulose but also by a variety of disaccharides including lactose, cellobiose, and sophorose (glycosyl β-1,2-glucose) (13Saloheimo M. Nakari-Setala T. Tenkanen M. Penttila M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Nogawa M. Goto M. Okada H. Morikawa Y. Curr.

Induction by these molecules is antagonized by the presence of the preferred carbon sources, glucose and fructose. Sophorose is by far the most potent inducer of cellulase expression (21Mandels M. Parrish F.W. Reese E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1962; 83: 400-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this high potency is an innate characteristic of the molecule or whether other disaccharides are less effective because they are more readily cleaved by cellular glucosidases. The balance between intact disaccharides and inhibitory monosaccharide cleavage products might then influence the transcriptional state of these genes. In accordance with this notion both lactose and cellobiose fail to fully induce cellulase gene expression when present at high concentrations. In addition to enzymes with cellulolytic activity, a number of enzymes have been identified in T. reesei that degrade hemicellulose (17Saloheimo M. Paloheimo M. Hakola S. Pere J. Swanson B.

These enzymes include four xylanases (Xyn1, Xyn2, Xyn3, and Xyn4) and mannanase (Man1), which cleave the xylan and mannan main chains of hemicellulose. Acetyl xylan esterase (Axe1), α-glucuronidase (Glr1), and arabinofuranosidase (Abf1) digest side chains containing acetyl, methylglucuronic acid, and arabinose moieties, respectively. Additionally, enzymes that digest oligosaccharides derived from hemicellulose have been identified. These are β-xylosidase (Bxl1) and three α-galactosidases (Agl1, Agl2, and Agl3). Among the hemicellulases that have been studied, all except arabinofuranosidase are expressed at a substantially higher level when T. reesei is grown in medium containing cellulose than when it is grown in medium containing non-inducing carbon sources such as sorbitol (28Xu J. Takakuwa N. Nogawa M. Okada H. Morikawa Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 718-724Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Margolles-Clark E. Ilmen M. Penttila M. J. Biotechnol. 1977; 57: 167-179Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of many of the genes encoding these enzymes, with the notable exception of man1, is induced by xylans. Sugars such as sophorose, arabitol, xylobiose, cellobiose, and galactose also induce expression to varying extents, particularly of enzymes that degrade substrates related to these sugars (32Margolles-Clark E. Ilmen M. Penttila M. J. Biotechnol. 1977; 57: 167-179Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which T. reesei senses the composition of the extracellular milieu and modulates the expression of these enzymes are unknown. Moreover, although expression of some of these genes is modified by certain substrates, it is unclear to what extent each gene has a unique regulatory apparatus and to what extent expression of these genes are coupled among themselves and with the cellulases via sharing of regulatory pathways. The mechanisms by which the cellulase and hemicellulase genes are regulated are likely to influence the ecological niches that T. reesei occupies and are of interest in the commercial production of these enzymes. The very large quantity of biomass-degrading enzymes synthesized by T. reesei requires a significant investment of cellular resources. Evidence suggests that a primary means by which the cell manages these demands is to regulate transcription of the genes encoding these enzymes according to the availability of different carbon sources. However, the degree to which gene products involved in other cellular processes, such as secretion, must be regulated to accommodate the substantial burden of cellulase biosynthesis has not been systematically investigated. In this study, aspects of these questions are addressed by determining the transcriptional effects of cellulase inducers on a genomic scale. Over 5100 cDNAs from T. reesei were partially or fully sequenced. Twelve cDNAs encoding new enzymes with putative roles in biomass degradation were discovered. Microarrays were used to examine the regulation of these and previously identified genes encoding biomass-degrading enzymes in the context of the extensive repertoire of newly identified genes. The results presented shed light on the coregulation of cellulases and hemicellulases and the mechanisms by which the cell copes with synthesizing very large quantities of these secreted enzymes. Media, Strains, and Culture Growth Conditions—T. reesei strains used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Liquid minimal medium was as described previously (20Ilmen M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.L. Penttila M.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 100 mm piperazine-N, N-bis(3-propanesulfonic acid) (Calbiochem) was included to maintain the pH at 5.5. Vogel's medium was described by Davis and DeSerres (33Davis R.H. DeSerres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). YEG medium contains 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 2% glucose. For Northern blot analysis, ∼1 × 108 spores were inoculated into 50 ml of minimal medium supplemented with 5% glucose and grown at 30 °C for 24 h. Mycelia were collected by centrifugation, washed in carbon-free medium, and resuspended to an optical density of ∼0.3 in 50 ml of minimal medium supplemented with 5% glucose, 2% avicel (FMC), 2% glycerol, or 2% glycerol containing 1 mm sophorose (Sigma). Cultures were grown in flasks with vigorous agitation for 20 h. For microarray analysis, inoculation was performed as above. Cultures were grown in triplicate overnight. Mycelia were collected by centrifugation and washed with minimal medium containing 2% glycerol. They were then resuspended to an OD of 0.15–0.2 and grown for 9 h (OD 0.5). The cultures were then divided in half, and 0.01 volume of 100 mm sophorose was added to 1 flask of each pair immediately and 10 h later. The cultures were grown an additional 2 h to an OD ∼2–4. cDNA Library and Sequencing—T. reesei strain QM6a mycelia were grown in baffled flasks at 30 °C for 24 h in YEG medium with vigorous aeration. 5 ml of this culture was added to 50 ml of the following media and grown under the following conditions: Vogel's liquid medium, 2% avicel, 3 and 6 days; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% Solka floc (International Fiber Corp., North Tonawanda, NY), 3 and 6 days; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% wheat bran (Skidmore Sales and Distributing Co., Inc., West Chester, OH), 3 and 6 days; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% beet pulp (D&D Ingredients Distributors, Inc., Delphos, OH), 6 days; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% glucose, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% lactose, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% xylose, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% fructose, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% maltose, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, no carbon source added, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, no nitrogen source added, 24 h; Vogel's liquid medium, 2% phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, 3 days; YEG medium, 42 °C, 1.5 h; YEG medium, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 h; YEG, room temperature, closed container with no agitation (anoxia), 1.5 h; solid state, 15 g of wheat bran, 1 g of proflo, 1 g of solkafloc, 30 ml of water, 6 and 7 days; solid state, 15 g of beet pulp, 1 g of proflo, 1 g of solkafloc, 30 ml of water, 9 days. RNA was prepared from the mycelia by grinding under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and extracting using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA libraries were constructed by Invitrogen in the vector pREP3Y, which is a derivative of pREP3X (33Davis R.H. DeSerres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar) containing additional restriction sites at the multiple cloning site. ESTs 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; GH, glycoside hydrolase; ORF, open reading frame. were generated by sequencing cDNA clones from the 5′ end. Template DNA was extracted in a 96-well format using a modified alkaline lysis protocol. Sequencing reactions were performed following standard Big Dye (Applied Biosystems) protocols for a 0.25× reaction. Cycle sequencing was performed over 35 cycles (96 °C for 10 s; 50 °C for 5 s; and 60 °C for 4 min) in an Applied Biosystems GenAmp 9700 thermocycler. DyeEx 96-well plates (Qiagen) were used for dyeterminator removal. Samples were sequenced using an ABI 3700 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Fermentation—Duplicate fermentations were run for each of the strains displayed in Fig. 3. 0.8 liters of minimal media containing 5% glucose was inoculated with 1.5 ml of frozen spore suspension. After 48 h, each culture was transferred to 6.2 liters of the same media in a 14-liter Biolafitte fermenter. The fermenter was run at 25 °C, 750 rpm, and 8 standard liters per min of air flow. One hour after the initial glucose was exhausted, a 25% (w/w) lactose feed was started and was fed in a carbon-limiting fashion to prevent lactose accumulation. The concentrations of glucose and of lactose were monitored using a glucose oxidase assay kit or a glucose hexokinase assay kit with β-galactosidase added to cleave lactose, respectively (Instrumentation Laboratory Co., Lexington, MA). Samples were obtained at regular intervals to monitor the progress of the fermentation. Samples obtained before (20–35 g/liter glucose) and just after glucose exhaustion, and 24 and 48 h after the lactose feeding commenced were used for microarray analysis. Isolation of RNAs, Labeling, and Hybridization—Mycelia were harvested by filtration through miracloth (Northern blots and fermentation samples) or by vacuum filtration through Whatman No. 1 paper and were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. For Northern blotting, RNA was prepared as described above for construction of cDNA libraries. Polyadenylated RNA was selected 2 times using Oligotex (Qiagen). Blotting was performed using a NorthernMax-Gly Kit (Ambion). 32P-Labeled probes were generated using a DECAprime Kit (Ambion). Hybridization was performed using ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion). In all of the microarray experiments performed, the relative expression levels were determined between two RNA samples derived from growth under two different conditions. RNA was prepared using a FastRNA (Red) Kit (Qbiogene). Two aliquots of total RNA were taken from each sample. One aliquot was labeled with cyanine 3-CTP, and the other aliquot was labeled with cyanine 5-CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a fluorescent linear amplification kit (Agilent Technologies). 250 ng of cyanine 5-labeled RNA derived from mycelia grown under one condition of interest were combined with 250 ng of cyanine 3-labeled RNA derived from mycelia grown under a second condition of interest, and the pooled RNAs were hybridized to the microarrays using an in situ hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies). The relative fluorescent intensities of cyanine 5- and cyanine 3-labeled species bound to each probe of the microarray were determined using an Agilent Technologies microarray scanner and software. The log of the ratio (log ratio) of the two fluorescent species bound to each of the probes reflects the relative expression levels of the cognate genes in the two samples (34Hughes T.R. Mao M.

To avoid possible bias resulting from differences in incorporation of the dyes, duplicate microarrays were hybridized in which reciprocal dye combinations were used. Thus, for example, in sophorose induction experiments, cyanine 5-labeled RNA derived from sophorose-induced cultures was combined with cyanine 3-labeled RNA from uninduced cultures; and in replicate microarrays, cyanine 3-labeled RNA derived from sophorose-induced cultures was combined with cyanine 5-labeled RNA from uninduced cultures. A total of 6 microarrays was performed for each condition in the sophorose induction experiments (duplicate reciprocally labeled arrays for triplicate cultures). In the lactose induction experiments 4 microarrays were performed for each time point (duplicate reciprocally labeled arrays for duplicate fermenters). For all figures the mean values across replicates are presented. Microarray Design—60-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the assembled ESTs were designed and synthesized in situ by Agilent Technologies. Bioinformatics and Data Analysis—Sequence chromatograms were assigned base quality values by Phred (version 0.990722, www.phrap.org). Sequences containing >100 bases with Phred quality values ≥20 or an average base quality ≥12 were retained. High quality sequences were assembled using the PhredPhrap (version 0.990329) script provided by Consed (version 11.0) (36Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P.

Selected sequences were further analyzed by aligning them with similar genes using ClustalW (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/). All tools were used with default parameters. Secretion signal sequence prediction was performed according to Ref. 41Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar.

To identify genes involved in protein processing and secretion, the sequences of gene products of interest from other organisms were compared by BLAST to the translated ESTs. Microarray data were quantified using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies). The data were visualized and analyzed using Genespring version 4.2 (Silicon Genetics). Clustering was performed using a standard correlation and Genespring default settings. Identification of New Genes Encoding Hydrolytic Enzymes— The inducible expression of the very abundant cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes requires the coordination of a variety of cellular processes. To identify T. reesei genes that participate in these processes and to identify new enzymes that might play a role in biomass utilization, we sequenced the 5′ ends of 18,000 random cDNAs from mycelia grown on a wide variety of carbon sources and conditions. The sequences of individual sequence reads were compared, and overlapping segments were assembled to form 2101 contigs consisting of two or more 5′ reads. 3030 individual reads did not have significant sequence overlap with any other reads in the data set. The predicted coding regions of the EST set were compared with all publicly available sequence data bases. Twelve new sequences were identified encoding proteins with significant similarity to known enzymes whose substrates are commonly found in biomass. Full-length sequences corresponding to these gene products were determined.

https://openalex.org/W2140884549,"Axon outgrowth is the first step in the formation of neuronal connections, but the pathways that regulate axon extension are still poorly understood. We find that mice deficient in calcineurin-NFAT signaling have dramatic defects in axonal outgrowth, yet have little or no defect in neuronal differentiation or survival. In vitro, sensory and commissural neurons lacking calcineurin function or NFATc2, c3, and c4 are unable to respond to neurotrophins or netrin-1 with efficient axonal outgrowth. Neurotrophins and netrins stimulate calcineurin-dependent nuclear localization of NFATc4 and activation of NFAT-mediated gene transcription in cultured primary neurons. These data indicate that the ability of these embryonic axons to respond to growth factors with rapid outgrowth requires activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling by these factors. The precise parsing of signals for elongation turning and survival could allow independent control of these processes during development."
https://openalex.org/W2038350989,"Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) catalyzes the synthesis of catechin, an initiating monomer of condensed tannin or proanthocyanidin (PA) synthesis, from 3,4-cis-leucocyanidin and thus is the first committed step in PA biosynthesis. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity from PA-rich leaves of the legume Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC, partially sequenced and the corresponding cDNA cloned. The identity of the enzyme was confirmed by expressing active recombinant LAR in Escherichia coli and in tobacco and white clover. The enzyme is a monomer of 43 kDa (382 amino acids) and is most active synthesizing catechin (specific activity of ∼10 μmol min+1 mg of protein+1) but also synthesizes afzelechin and gallocatechin. LAR is most closely related to the isoflavone reductase group of plant enzymes that are part of the Reductase-Epimerase-Dehydrogenase (RED) family of proteins. Unlike all other plant isoflavone reductase homologues that are about 320 amino acids long, LAR has an additional 65-amino acid C-terminal extension whose function is not known. Curiously, although Arabidopsis makes PA, there is no obvious LAR orthologue in the Arabidopsis genome. This may be because Arabidopsis seems to produce only an epicatechin, rather than a dual catechin/epicatechin-based PA similar to many other plants."

Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) residue 1177 (in human) is a substrate for both Akt (27Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A.

Phosphorylation of eNOS at this residue leads to enzyme activation and nitric oxide (NO) production. AMPK is reported to phosphorylate eNOS in cardiac myocytes under hypoxic conditions (29Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether NO production by endothelial cells is regulated by this reaction. Recently, AMPK was detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (30Dagher Z. Ruderman N. Tornheim K. Ido Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pharmacological stimulator of AMPK, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), protects HUVECs from apoptosis under hyperglycemic conditions (31Ido Y. Carling D. Ruderman N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AICAR was found to reverse the inhibitory effect of hyperglycemia on mitogen-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In this study we analyzed whether AMPK signaling plays a role in angiogenesis. Specifically, we tested whether AMPK is essential for endothelial cell migration, differentiation into capillary-like structures, and NO production under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We also tested whether AMPK signaling is required for angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs that were subcutaneously implanted in mice. The results of this study suggest that cross-talk between AMPK and Akt is essential for angiogenesis under conditions of hypoxic stress, but dispensable for angiogenic cellular responses in normoxic endothelial cells. Materials—Phospho-AMPK (Thr-172), pan-α-AMPK, and phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177), and phospho-eNOS (Thr-495) antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phospho-Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) (Ser-79) and c-Myc tag antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). ACC protein antibody was from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Akt and eNOS antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were purchased from Sigma. Adenovirus—A replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing dominant-negative AMPK was a gift from Dr. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania). This vector expresses the rat AMPK α2-subunit cDNA, whose lysine 45 residue was changed to arginine (14Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), fused in-frame with the c-Myc epitope tag. Details of Ad-caAkt and Ad-dnAkt construction were previously described (32Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol.

Adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) was obtained from Qbiogene (Illkirch, France). Cell Culture and Adenoviral Vectors Transduction—Human umbilical vein endothelium cells (HUVECs), endothelial cell basal medium (EBM), and endothelial cell growth medium (EGM) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). HUVECs were cultured in EGM with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All experiments utilized HUVECs at passage 6 or less. HUVECs were transduced with the indicated replication-defective adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 plaque-forming units for 1 day. The media was then changed to EBM containing 1% fetal bovine serum to reduce the effects of stimulation by serum mitogens. After a 1-day incubation in low mitogen media, transduced cells were placed in a hypoxia chamber (GasPak anaerobic system; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the indicated period of time. This system induces anaerobic conditions of less than 2% of oxygen and more than 4% of carbon dioxide by using carbon dioxidegenerating reagents (34Nagata D. Hirata Y. Suzuki E. Kakoki M. Hayakawa H.

All experiments utilized HUVECs at passage 6 or less. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out as previously described (35Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Yoshizumi M. Mano T. Walsh K. Sata M. Kakoki M. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were extracted with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) followed by SDS-PAGE. The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution. ECL-PLUS Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed as described previously using a modified Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) (36Witzenbichler B. Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Le Roux A. Branellec D. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HUVECs infected with the indicated adenoviral vectors were serum-starved overnight in serum-free media (EBM). Transduced cells were suspended with 0.05% trypsin-0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in EBM. EBM containing VEGF 150 ng/ml was put into the wells of the lower chamber. Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (PVPF; OSMONICS, Kent, WA) coated with 0.5% gelatin were used to separate the lower chamber and 1 × 105 suspended cells in the upper chamber. For some experiments, the indicated concentrations of SNP were added to both chambers. The chambers were then incubated for 8 h at 37 °C under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Filters were carefully removed and the cells attached to the upper side were removed by wiping. Cells migrating through the filter (cells on the lower side of filter) were fixed with methanol for 15 min, stained with Giemsa stain solution (Sigma) and five random microscopic fields per well were quantified. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and three separate experiments were performed. Tube Formation Assay—The formation of vascular-like structures by HUVECs on growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was performed as previously described (37Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). 24-well culture plates were coated with Matrigel according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated adenovirus-transduced HUVECs were seeded on coated plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in EBM containing VEGF 50 ng/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. In some wells, SNP (1 μm-1 mm) was also added. Tube formation was observed using an inverted phase contrast microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured with a video graphic system (DEI-750 CE Digital Output Camera, Optronics, Goleta, CA). The degree of tube formation was quantified by measuring the length of tubes in 3 randomly chosen low power fields (×100) from each well using the NIH Image Program. Each experiment was repeated for 4 times. cGMP Assay—Intracellular cGMP concentration was measured using cGMP enzyme immunoassay system purchased from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instruction. After adenovirus infection, cells were incubated overnight in low serum medium to reduce the effect of mitogens. Then VEGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the cultures in the absence or presence of NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (1 mg/ml). Cells were then incubated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 6 h prior to the cGMP measurement. Each experiment was performed in four independent samples, and two sets of separate experiments were performed. Mouse Angiogenesis Assay—The formation of new vessels in vivo was evaluated by Matrigel plug assay as described previously (38Muhlhauser J. Merrill M.J. Pili R. Maeda H. Bacic M. Bewig B.

For these experiments, 400 μl of Matrigel containing bFGF (250 ng/ml) and replication-defective adenoviral vectors encoding GFP, dominant-negative AMPK, or dominant-negative Akt (1 × 108 plaque forming units) was cooled on ice and then injected subcutaneously into the abdomen of C57BL mice. Mice were sacrificed 14 days after the injection. The Matrigel plugs with adjacent subcutaneous tissues were carefully recovered by en bloc resection, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with 30% sucrose, and embedded in OCT compound (GTI Microsystems, Tempe, AZ) in liquid nitrogen. Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistostaining for CD31 (PECAM-1: BD Biosciences) were performed on adjacent frozen sections. Primary antibody was used at a 1:50 dilution followed by incubation of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG at a 1:100 dilution). The AEC Substrate Pack (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) was used for detection. CD31-positive capillaries were counted in 4 randomly chosen low-power (×100) microscopic fields. Each experiment was repeated four times. Statistical Analyses—Values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe's F procedure for post-hoc analysis. AMPK Activation by Hypoxia in Endothelial Cells—To test whether AMPK is activated in endothelial cells under conditions of hypoxia, HUVEC cultures were incubated in a hypoxia chamber for different lengths of time and Western immunoblot analyses were performed on lysates using an antibody that is specific for AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 of the α-subunit. A basal level of AMPK phosphorylation was detected in cell cultured under normoxic conditions, and hypoxia produced a time-dependent increase in AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). A representative Western blot of this time course is shown (Fig. 1A). Thr-172 phosphorylation leads to AMPK activation, and the induction of AMPK signaling by hypoxia was indicated by the time-dependent phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79 (Fig. 1B), which is a substrate for AMPK. Hypoxia also led to a time-dependent increase in AMPK activity as assessed by SAMS peptide phosphorylation with immunoprecipitated AMPK (data not shown). Basal and hypoxia-inducible phosphorylation of ACC was blocked when cells were transduced at 50 m.o.i. with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK (dominant-negative AMPK) that contains a c-Myc epitope tag (Fig. 1, A and B). Parallel cultures incubated with an adenoviral vector expressing the GFP marker protein at 50 m.o.i. revealed greater than a 95% transduction efficiency. Transduction with dominant-negative AMPK also inhibited the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of endogenous AMPK (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia did not affect the total level of α-subunit expression in immunoblot analyses using a pan-α-AMPK antibody (Fig. 1A), nor did it affect the level of ACC protein expression (data not shown). Hypoxia led to a modest reduction in basal Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, which is required for kinase activity (40Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 41Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Transduction with dominant-negative AMPK further suppressed Akt phosphorylation, inhibiting Akt phosphorylation at every time point examined (Fig. 1C). The relative magnitude of the inhibition by dominant-negative AMPK increased as the length of exposure to hypoxia increased. Regulation of eNOS Ser-1177 Phosphorylation and NO Production by AMPK—The production of endothelial NO is important for vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis (42Noiri E. Lee E. Testa J. Quigley J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation promotes Akt signaling which, in turn, produces NO through the activating phosphorylation of eNOS at residue 1177 (27Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Because AMPK is also reported to phosphorylate eNOS at residue 1177 in cardiac myocytes (29Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), the contribution of AMPK to VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation was analyzed in HUVEC under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2A). In our assays, VEGF did not affect the level of AMPK expression or phosphorylation (data not shown). However, transduction with dominant-negative AMPK effectively blocked eNOS phosphorylation under conditions of hypoxia, whereas it had little effect in normoxic HUVEC cultures (Fig. 2B). While basal levels of AMPK in normoxic endothelial cells has little effect on the status of eNOS 1177 phosphorylation, AMPK signaling was essential for ACC phosphorylation under these conditions (Fig. 2A). A vector expressing dominant-negative Akt was used as a positive control in these experiments because it is known to inhibit VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation in normoxic endothelial cell cultures (27Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). In contrast to dominant-negative AMPK, transduction with dominant-negative Akt significantly inhibited eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 in normoxic cultures. Transduction with dominant-negative Akt also inhibited eNOS phosphorylation in hypoxic cultures. However, it had no effect on ACC phosphorylation under any condition. Recently, it has been shown that eNOS activity is negatively regulated through phosphorylation of Thr-495 (29Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 47Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T.

Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In normoxic cultures, VEGF stimulation led to a decrease in Thr-495 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and C), consistent with a previous report (47Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The reduction in Thr-495 phosphorylation by VEGF was reversed by transduction with dominant-negative Akt, while dominant-negative AMPK had no effect. Similar trends in Thr-495 phosphorylation were also seen in hypoxic cultures, but the overall magnitude of the VEGF effect was less than that seen in normoxic cultures. Furthermore, dominant-negative AMPK had no detectable effect on decline in Thr-495 under conditions of hypoxia. The production of NO by eNOS was measured in intact HUVEC cultures by monitoring the accumulation of cGMP (39Kim H.-S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41888-41896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of these assays, VEGF-induced cGMP accumulation was similar between HUVEC cultures incubated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3). Under both conditions, cGMP accumulation was largely inhibited by the eNOS inhibitor l-NAME. Transduction with dominant-negative AMPK significantly inhibited NO output in hypoxic cultures. There was a trend toward lower NO output in normoxic cultures transduced with dominant-negative AMPK, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). In contrast, transduction with dominant-negative Akt significantly inhibited NO output in both hypoxic and normoxic HUVEC cultures. Transduction with dominant-negative Akt or dominant-negative AMPK did not affect basal NO production in the absence of VEGF in either hypoxic or normoxic cultures.2 AMPK Signaling Is Essential for Endothelial Cell Migration under Hypoxic Conditions—To evaluate the role of AMPK signaling on endothelial cell migration, HUVEC were transduced with Ad-dnAMPK and tested for their ability to migrate toward VEGF (150 ng/ml) in a Boyden chamber apparatus. Under hypoxic conditions, transduction with dominant-negative AMPK significantly suppressed cell migration relative to cells transduced with GFP control (Fig. 4). No differences in cell migration were detected between Ad-GFP-treated and nontransduced cells2. Furthermore, the reduction in cell migration did not appear to be due to decreased cell viability. Under these cell culture conditions dominant-negative AMPK-transduced cells did not display detectable increases in the frequencies of TUNEL- or pyknotic nuclei-positive cells, nor was there a detectable decrease in mitochondrial function (data not shown). Addition of 10 μm sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, partially reversed the inhibitory action of dominant-negative AMPK on HUVEC migration to VEGF in the hypoxic cultures (Fig. 4). Similar effects were also observed at 1 and 100 μm SNP (data not shown). However, co-transfection with an adenoviral vector expressing a constitutively-active form of Akt was more effective than the NO donor at reversing the inhibition by dominant-negative AMPK in hypoxic cultures (p < 0.05 relative to dominant-negative AMPK plus SNP, and not significant relative to control). Transduction with dominant-negative AMPK had no effect on HUVEC migration to VEGF under normoxic conditions. In contrast, transduction with dominant-negative Akt suppressed migration under normoxic conditions, consistent with previous findings (49Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton G. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and also exhibited this activity in hypoxic cultures. AMPK Regulates Endothelial Cell Tube Formation under Hypoxic Conditions—To examine the role of AMPK signaling on endothelial cell differentiation into vascular structures in vitro, HUVECs were plated on matrigel in the presence of VEGF after transduction with GFP, dominant-negative AMPK or dominant-negative Akt, and tube formation was assessed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5A). Tube structure length was quantified after 18 h using NIH imaging software (Fig. 5B). Transduction with dominant-negative AMPK suppressed tube formation to a similar extent as dominant-negative Akt under hypoxic conditions. The inhibition of tube formation by dominant-negative AMPK was partially reversed by the inclusion of 10 μm SNP in the culture media. Similar effects were observed at 1 and 100 μm SNP (data not shown). Co-transfection with an adenoviral vector expressing constitutively-active Akt was more effective than the NO donor in reversing the inhibition of tube formation by dominant-negative AMPK (p < 0.05 relative to dominant-negative AMPK plus SNP, and not significant relative to control). In contrast, transduction with dominant-negative Akt, but not dominant-negative AMPK, suppressed on t"
https://openalex.org/W2042269850,"MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that contains an N-terminal methylated DNA-binding domain, a central transcription regulation domain, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. Whereas current models of MeCP2 function evoke localized recruitment of histone deacetylases to specific methylated regions of the genome, it is unclear whether MeCP2 requires DNA methylation to bind to chromatin or whether MeCP2 binding influences chromatin structure in the absence of other proteins. To address these issues, we have characterized the complexes formed between MeCP2 and biochemically defined nucleosomal arrays. At molar ratios near 1 MeCP2/nucleosome, unmethylated nucleosomal arrays formed both extensively condensed ellipsoidal particles and oligomeric suprastructures. Furthermore, MeCP2-mediated chromatin compaction occurred in the absence of monovalent or divalent cations, in distinct contrast to all other known chromatin-condensing proteins. Analysis of specific missense and nonsense MeCP2 mutants indicated that the ability to condense chromatin resides in region(s) of the protein other than the methylated DNA-binding domain. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 assembles novel secondary chromatin structures independent of DNA modification and suggest that the ability of MeCP2 to silence chromatin may be related in part to its effects on large-scale chromatin organization.

The overall domain structure of MeCP2 is considerably different from that of other MBD family members (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). In particular, most of the middle portion of MeCP2 consists of a transcriptional repression domain, while at the extreme C terminus are repetitive sequences similar to those found in forkhead proteins (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Vacca M. Filippini F. Budillon A. Rossi V. Mercadante G. Manzati E. Gualandi F. Bigoni S. Trabanelli C. Pini G. Calzolari E.

MeCP2 is also fundamentally different from other MBD family members in that numerous specific mutations scattered throughout the entire polypeptide chain are closely associated with the molecular pathogenesis of the neurological disorder Rett syndrome (4Lee S.S. Wan M. Francke U. Brain Dev. 2001; 23: S138-S143PubMed Google Scholar, 5Van den Veyver I.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Brain Dev. 2001; 23: S147-S151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA methylation is classically associated with imprinted genes, transposable elements and their relics, and the inactive X chromosome in female mammals (6Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Because regions of dense cytosine methylation are so strongly correlated with transcriptional repression in vivo (2Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 6Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), virtually all molecular investigations to date have focused on the possible role of MeCP2 as a specific DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional repressor (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 7Wade P.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The current paradigm for MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression involves specific, targeted deacetylation of promoter chromatin mediated by the MeCP2-Sin3-HDAC1 corepressor complex (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). However, it is well documented that MeCP2 can repress transcription independently of histone acetylation (7Wade P.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), implying that MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression does not exclusively involve local recruitment of histone deacetylases. Furthermore, to date, there have been no examinations of whether MeCP2 directly affects either local or global chromatin structure. It has previously been shown that a glutathione S-transferase-MeCP2 hybrid protein can bind to methylated DNA wrapped within a reconstituted mononucleosome (10Chandler S.P. Guschin D. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These studies with Xenopus laevis MeCP2 showed that both the MBD and C terminus are involved in MeCP2-nucleosome interactions, suggesting that MeCP2 binding to chromatin substrates may be more complex than to naked DNA. Here, we have determined the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic properties of the nucleoprotein complexes formed in solution between human recombinant MeCP2 and defined 12-mer nucleosomal arrays and visualized their structures by electron cryomicroscopy and electron microscope tomography. We found that at molar ratios near 1 protein/nucleosome, binding of MeCP2 led to salt-independent conversion of extended nucleosomal arrays into extensively compacted 60 S ellipsoidal structures. Furthermore, at MeCP2/nucleosome molar ratios of ≥1.0, the 60 S particles assembled into morphologically defined oligomeric suprastructures. Studies of specific Rett syndrome mutants indicated that the ability to mediate chromatin compaction lies in a region of the protein other than the MBD. Thus, in addition to functions related to binding methylated DNA, human MeCP2 is a potent chromatin-condensing protein that mediates assembly of novel secondary chromatin structures. The relevance of these results to current models of MeCP2 function is discussed. Protein Purification—Histone octamers were isolated from chicken erythrocytes as described by Hansen et al. (11Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Purified histone octamer fractions were stored at 4 °C in the presence of 20 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Human recombinant full-length MeCP2 (486 amino acids, 52,408 Da), MeCP2(R133C), and MeCP2(R168X) were prepared from clones provided by T. Yusufzai (12Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4172-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Following induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, bacteria were collected, washed (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl), resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 20 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone), and sonicated. Following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, the cleared lysate was applied to chitin-agarose (New England Biolabs Inc.) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A, followed by 2 column volumes of Buffer A containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. The column was then sealed and incubated at 4 °C for 48 h. Following incubation, the column was washed with Buffer A, and fractions containing the bulk of the eluted MeCP2 were pooled. The chitin-agarose-purified protein was diluted with water to a conductance equivalent to 250 mm NaCl and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 20 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone). MeCP2 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25–1.0 m NaCl. Nucleosomal Array Reconstitution and Formation of MeCP2-Nucleosomal Array Complexes—208-12 DNA templates were purified from the pPol-I-208-12 plasmid (13Georgel P. Demeler B. Terpening C. Paule M.R. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described (11Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Preparations of 208-12 nucleosomal arrays containing 10–12 nucleosomes were reconstituted from purified core histone octamers and 208-12 DNA using salt dialysis as described (14Hansen J.C. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1.1 mol of histone octamer/mol of 208-bp DNA was used for the reconstitutions. The final dialysis step for electrophoretic mobility shift assay and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments was performed against TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm NaCl (pH 7.8)). The nucleosomal arrays used for electron microscopy (EM) imaging were dialyzed against HEGN buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2.5 mm NaCl). Nucleoprotein complexes were formed by incubating 208-12 nucleosomal arrays or 208-12 DNA (200 ng in 20 μl) with increasing molar ratios of MeCP2 to 208-bp repeat (r MeCP2 = 0.1–2.0) at room temperature for 30 min. The incubation buffer was either TEN or HEGN buffer. Prior to loading of the samples, glycerol was added to a final percentage of 10%. EcoRI Digestion—Nucleoprotein complexes formed in the presence or absence of various molar ratios of MeCP2 were digested with 10 units of EcoRI/μg of DNA at 37 °C for 90 min. The reaction buffer contained 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm NaCl, and 1.75 mm MgCl2. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. Half of the sample was deproteinized by treatment with 10 μg of proteinase K at 50 °C for 60 min, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The native chromatin and deproteinized DNA samples were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel buffered with 1× Tris borate/EDTA at 8 V/cm for 2 h. Sedimentation Velocity—All sedimentation velocity studies were performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples were sedimented at 18,000 rpm. The A 260 was ∼0.6, and the temperature was 20 ± 0.1 °C. Data were acquired with the absorbance optics. The boundaries were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (15van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1405Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using the Ultrascan data analysis program to yield the integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients, plotted as the boundary fraction versus s 20,w. Electron Microscopy—Samples for negative staining or shadowing were first cross-linked as follows. 208-12 DNA or nucleosomal arrays at a DNA concentration of 50 μg/ml were incubated with MeCP2 at a the desired molar ratio for 1 h at room temperature in HEGN buffer and then fixed by dialysis against HEGN buffer containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by two changes of HEGN buffer for a total of 16 h. For negative staining, fixed samples were diluted 8-fold with 50 mm NaCl, adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon film, washed with double-distilled water, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and air-dried. Some MeCP2/DNA samples were rinsed briefly with water after uranyl acetate treatment to provide positive staining. For shadowing, samples were brought to 75% glycerol and then sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica as described (16Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The mica was dried under high vacuum in a turbo-pumped evaporator (BA080, Baltec Products Inc., Hudson, NH) and, while under vacuum, shadowed with platinum at an angle of 6° and then coated with a thin layer of carbon. To provide both an accurate value for the size of the particles and a view of the complete shape, the sample was kept stationary for the first one-fourth of the platinum evaporation procedure and then rotated for the remaining three-fourths. After removal from the vacuum, the carbon films were floated off the mica on distilled water and mounted on 400-mesh grids. Samples were examined in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) operating at 100 kV, and images were recorded on a TVIPS slow-scan CCD (TVIPS GmbH, Gauting, Germany). Most shadowed preparations and all positively stained grids were examined using tilted beam dark-field optics. For tomographic reconstruction of negatively stained samples, tilt series were recorded with a pixel size at the image of 0.45 nm. The tilt data consisted of images at 2.5° intervals between –70° and +65° with an average dose of 0.5 electrons/A2. Alignment of the tilt series by cross-correlation and reconstruction by sinc-weighted back-projection was performed using SUPRIM software (17Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) on an SGI Octane workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). The computed three-dimensional reconstructions were analyzed using Amira software (TGS Inc., San Diego, CA). Electron cryomicroscopy (ECM) was carried out by applying 3-μl drops of an unfixed sample of r MeCP2 = 1.0 nucleosomal arrays to glow-discharged Quantifoil grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany) in a humidity-controlled chamber maintained at 85% relative humidity at room temperature. The sample droplet was blotted with Whatman No. 4 filter paper before plunging the grid into liquefied ethane. The frozen grids were transferred under liquid nitrogen to a Gatan 626 crytotransfer system (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA) and observed at –180 °C in the Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV. Stereo pair images with a 15° separation were digitally recorded as described above. Three-dimensional measurements from stereo pairs were calculated as previously described (18Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Dubochet J. Woodcock C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and model reconstructions were created using Vertigo software (Vertigo, Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Human Recombinant MeCP2 Binds to Long Linear DNA and Forms Cross-linked Aggregates—As a control, we initially examined whether human recombinant MeCP2 binds to linear 208-12 DNA. This DNA template consists of 12 tandem 208-bp repeats of Lytechinus 5 S rDNA (19Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and is extensively used for studies of chromatin structure/function relationships (20Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Human MeCP2 was purified from recombinant bacteria using chitin and heparin affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) and judged to be ≥95% pure by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1A). Recombinant protein was added to the DNA at molar ratios of 0.25–2.0 MeCP2 monomers/208-bp DNA. After incubation in low ionic strength TEN buffer for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed on native 1.0% agarose gels. This same large particle gel shift assay has been used previously to study binding of linker histones (21Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and yeast Sir3p (22Georgel P.T. Palacios DeBeer M.A. Pietz G. Fox C.A. Hansen J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8584-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to 208-12 DNA and nucleosomal arrays. We found that there was a large progressive reduction in DNA mobility upon addition of increasing MeCP2 molar ratios (Fig. 1B). The smearing seen at the lower r MeCP2 values is indicative of the presence of multiple nucleoprotein species. A relatively discrete, more slowly migrating band was observed at r MeCP2 = 1.0, whereas at r MeCP2 = 2.0, none of the DNA was able to migrate through the gel. The greatly reduced band mobilities seen at r MeCP2 ≥ 0.5 indicate that MeCP2 binds to long unmethylated DNA under low ionic strength conditions and assembles large nucleoprotein complexes. The structural features of the MeCP2-DNA complexes formed at r MeCP2 = 1.0 were visualized by EM (Fig. 1C). As expected, 208-12 DNA appeared as an individual, randomly curved, linear molecule (Fig. 1C, panel i). In contrast, DNA samples bound to MeCP2 contained structures with thickened regions formed by the close apposition of two DNA strands (Fig. 1C, panels ii–v). On either side of the apposed regions, the two DNA molecules diverged (Fig. 1C, arrows), presumably because of their mutual electrostatic repulsion under these low salt conditions. In some cases, several 208-12 DNA molecules existed together in intricate structures (Fig. 1C, panel v). We interpret the thickened regions as places in which two DNA strands are bridged by MeCP2 molecules. Similar complexes have been observed upon incubation of naked DNA with MENT (23Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the globular domain of linker histones (24Thomas J.O. Rees C. Finch J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), both of which are proteins involved in local and global chromatin condensation. Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 1 (B and C) demonstrate that MeCP2 is able to “cross-link” long DNA fragments into large complex structures and that MeCP2-mediated assembly of such structures occurs in the absence of DNA methylation. These results also suggest a potential “nucleation” mechanism whereby MeCP2 binding to methylated genomic sites may lead to spreading of MeCP2 into unmethylated adjoining regions. MeCP2 Mediates Compaction of Nucleosomal Arrays into Novel Secondary Chromatin Structures in the Absence of Salts—MeCP2 functions in a chromatin environment in vivo (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) and is not likely to encounter long stretches of naked DNA. Hence, we next examined the interactions of MeCP2 with nucleosomal arrays assembled from 208-12 DNA and chicken erythrocyte histone octamers. The intrinsic solution behavior of these biochemically defined 12-mer nucleosomal arrays is very well understood (20Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), making them ideal templates for investigating MeCP2 interactions with nucleosomes and chromatin in vitro. Human recombinant MeCP2 was mixed with the nucleosomal arrays at molar ratios of 0.25–2.0 MeCP2/nucleosome and incubated in low ionic strength TEN or HEGN buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then electrophoresed on native 1.0% agarose gels and also characterized by EM (Fig. 2). Large electrophoretic mobility shifts were observed with increasing protein molar ratios, indicative of formation of MeCP2-nucleosomal array complexes in TEN buffer (Fig. 2A). The same results were obtained after incubation in HEGN buffer (data not shown). The unique structural features of these nucleoprotein complexes were revealed using a variety of EM techniques. Under subsaturating conditions (r MeCP2 = 0.5), shadowed EM images obtained in HEGN buffer showed areas of local compaction within individual nucleosomal arrays (Fig. 2B, panels b–f), presumably reflecting regions where MeCP2 was bound to nucleosomes. A relatively broad range of compacted array morphologies were observed, consistent with smearing of the r MeCP2 = 0.5 samples during electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). More striking are the images obtained at r MeCP2 = 1.0 (Fig. 2B, panels g–i). Under these conditions, the dominant structures were highly condensed, ellipsoidal particles. In some cases, we also observed what appeared to be oligomers of the ellipsoidal particles (Fig. 2C, panel i, arrows), which we interpret as corresponding to the smear of material seen directly above the predominant band on agarose gels (Fig. 2A, fifth lane). Importantly, there was no intrinsic folding of the nucleosomal arrays under the low ionic strength conditions of the binding reaction (Fig. 2B, panel a) (20Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Hence, the intra-array compaction observed in low salt can be attributed entirely to MeCP2. To determine whether MeCP2-mediated compaction also occurs under more physiological ionic conditions, the experiment in Fig. 2A was repeated in the presence of either 2 mm MgCl2 or 150 mm NaCl. The resulting gel patterns were essentially identical to those shown in Fig. 2A (data not shown), indicating that MeCP2-mediated chromatin fiber compaction is independent of ionic strength and is not an artifact of low salt conditions. The structures of the compacted nucleoprotein particles formed at r MeCP2 = 1.0 were further characterized by sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge, restriction enzyme probing of linker DNA accessibility, and three-dimensional image reconstructions of complexes in negative stain and in the frozen hydrated state. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed to obtain the sedimentation coefficients of the MeCP2-compacted arrays and to determine the distribution of nucleoprotein species present in solution. Data were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (15van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1405Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) to yield the integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients, plotted as boundary fraction against s 20,w (Fig. 3). Such a plot will be vertical if the sample is homogeneous (15van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1405Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The sedimentation experiments were performed in low salt buffer to prevent intrinsic salt-dependent array compaction (20Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the parent nucleosomal arrays sedimented as a nearly homogeneous 27–29 S population (data not shown), corresponding to the extended “beads-on-a-string” conformation (Fig. 2B, panel a). However, at r MeCP2 = 1.0, ∼60% of the sample sedimented as a 60 S species, whereas the remainder was spread between 60 and 110 S (Fig. 3). Extensively condensed 12-mer nucleosomal arrays sediment near 55 S (11Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Hence, we conclude that the 60 S species present in the r MeCP2 = 1.0 sample corresponds to the highly compacted ellipsoidal structures observed in the electron microscope (Fig. 2B, panels g–i). As discussed below, the heterogeneous population of rapidly sedimenting species seen in Fig. 3 are oligomers of the 60 S particles (e.g. Fig. 2B, panel i). Further insight into the structure of the 60 S complexes was obtained from EM image reconstruction. All three imaging methods (shadowing, negative staining, and ECM) revealed roughly ellipsoidal particles, although the detailed shape of each individual particle was slightly different (Figs. 2B and 4). To better understand their internal structure, tomographic three-dimensional reconstructions were carried out on 60 S particles embedded in negative stain (Fig. 4, panels a–g). From the reconstructed volumes, it was possible to recognize the location of each nucleosome as well as the orientation of the nucleosomal disks. The three-dimensional reconstructions also allowed estimation of the mean volume of the 60 S particles as 15 × 103 nm3 (S.E. = 0.6 ± 103 nm3), which is ∼2.2 times the volume of 12 nucleosomes. In comparison, a solenoidal arrangement with six nucleosomes/turn occupies ∼6 times the volume of 12 nucleosomes. Whereas negative staining provides a relatively stable specimen and high contrast imaging, the processes of chemical fixation and grid adhesion may potentially alter the hydrated three-dimensional solution structure. These problems are obviated in frozen hydrated specimens obtained by ECM (25Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 167-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An overview of a field of unfixed, unstained complexes imaged by ECM is shown in Fig. 4 (panels h–l). Stereo pair ECM images of monomeric particles allowed the three-dimensional location (but not the orientation) of nucleosomes to be identified. Fig. 4 (panels i–l) shows the result of placing 10-nm diameter spheres at nucleosome positions derived from the specific particles denoted by the arrows in panel h. In the absence of substrate adhesion, the 60 S complexes were not compressed in one plane, and the probable linear path of the 12 connected nucleosomes was often evident. The “envelopes” of the three-dimensional structures occupied approximately the same volume in the ECM and negatively stained reconstructions, indicating that conformational distortions due to substrate adhesion in the latter are minimal. Nuclease digestion was used to probe both the linker DNA accessibility and the nature of the macromolecular interactions that stabilize the 60 S complexes. Each tandem repeat in the 5 S rDNA template is linked by EcoRI restriction sites (19Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and most of these sites are located in the linker DNA of the parent 208-12 nucleosomal arrays (Fig. 5A, lane 7) (11Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We digested samples assembled at r MeCP2 = 0–2.0 with EcoRI and examined the electrophoretic band pattern before and after deproteinization of the digests. The deproteinized digests reveal information about linker DNA accessibility (22Georgel P.T. Palacios DeBeer M.A. Pietz G. Fox C.A. Hansen J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8584-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Digestion of the parent nucleosomal arrays produced a ladder of DNA bands on 1.0% agarose gels as expected (Fig. 5A, lane 7), indicative of protection of a fraction of the EcoRI sites by nucleosomes (11Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Somewhat to our surprise, digestion of the MeCP2-compacted 60 S complexes yielded a pattern of bands essentially identical to that of the nucleosomal array control (Fig. 5A, lanes 8–10). Thus, the linker DNA segments in condensed 60 S structures are as equally accessible as those in the parental nucleosomal arrays. Electrophoresis of the non-deproteinized samples indicated whether cleavage of the linker DNA caused the 60 S complexes to dissociate into mononucleosomes. The results from electrophoresis of the native digests are shown in Fig. 5B. There was little change in the electrophoretic mobility of the samples; and in particular, the r MeCP2 = 1.0 sample remained almost entirely intact (compa"
https://openalex.org/W2040233624,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that bind denatured proteins in vitro, thereby facilitating their subsequent refolding by ATP-dependent chaperones. The mechanistic basis of this refolding process is poorly defined. We demonstrate that substrates complexed to sHsps from various sources are not released spontaneously. Dissociation and refolding of sHsp bound substrates relies on a disaggregation reaction mediated by the DnaK system, or, more efficiently, by ClpB/DnaK. While the DnaK system alone works for small, soluble sHsp/substrate complexes, ClpB/DnaK-mediated protein refolding is fastest for large, insoluble protein aggregates with incorporated sHsps. Such conditions reflect the situation in vivo, where sHsps are usually associated with insoluble proteins during heat stress. We therefore propose that sHsp function in cellular protein quality control is to promote rapid resolubilization of aggregated proteins, formed upon severe heat stress, by DnaK or ClpB/DnaK."

The F1 capsular antigen from the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis consists of linear fibers of a single subunit (Caf1) and serves as a prototype for nonpilus organelles assembled via the chaperone/usher pathway. Genetic data together with high-resolution X-ray structures corresponding to snapshots of the assembly process reveal the structural basis of fiber formation. Comparison of chaperone bound Caf1 subunit with the subunit in the fiber reveals a novel type of conformational change involving the entire hydrophobic core of the protein. The observed conformational change suggests that the chaperone traps a high-energy folding intermediate of Caf1. A model is proposed in which release of the subunit allows folding to be completed, driving fiber formation."
https://openalex.org/W1969958451,"Monoubiquitination serves as a regulatory signal in a variety of cellular processes. Monoubiquitin signals are transmitted by binding to a small but rapidly expanding class of ubiquitin binding motifs. Several of these motifs, including the CUE domain, also promote intramolecular monoubiquitination. The solution structure of a CUE domain of the yeast Cue2 protein in complex with ubiquitin reveals intermolecular interactions involving conserved hydrophobic surfaces, including the Leu8-Ile44-Val70 patch on ubiquitin. The contact surface extends beyond this patch and encompasses Lys48, a site of polyubiquitin chain formation. This suggests an occlusion mechanism for inhibiting polyubiquitin chain formation during monoubiquitin signaling. The CUE domain shares a similar overall architecture with the UBA domain, which also contains a conserved hydrophobic patch. Comparative modeling suggests that the UBA domain interacts analogously with ubiquitin. The structure of the CUE-ubiquitin complex may thus serve as a paradigm for ubiquitin recognition and signaling by ubiquitin binding proteins."

The biosynthesis of HS is initiated by polymerization of d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in alternating sequence and is pursued through a series of modification reactions that include N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc, C5-epimerization of GlcA to the C5-epimer, IdoA, and, finally O-sulfation at various positions (4Esko J.D.

Mutational studies in Drosophila and targeted disruption of murine genes involved in HS biosynthesis, or encoding HS proteoglycan core proteins, have demonstrated a critical role for HS proteoglycans in developmental processes (5Grobe K.

IdoA occurs in all protein-binding HS domains so far identified. Here we show that mouse embryos lacking GlcA C5-epimerase synthesize an abnormal HS, with GlcA but no IdoA residues and a highly distorted sulfation pattern. The resulting phenotype is lethal, with defects that can be differentially ascribed to HS structural alterations. However, it also shows apparently normal organ development, believed to depend on selective HS-protein interactions. These findings raise intriguing questions as to the need for regulation in HS biosynthesis. Gene Targeting Construct—A 19-kb genomic clone containing 3′-untranslated region and 3 exons of the GlcA C5-epimerase gene (Hsepi) was isolated from a bacteriophage mouse (strain 129/Sv) genomic library (Stratagene). Three SacI fragments of this genomic clone were separately cloned into Bluescript plasmid (12Li J.P. Gong F. El Darwish K. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20069-20077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A 2-kb fragment immediately upstream of exon 3 was inserted downstream of a PGK-neo cassette as a short arm homologous sequence to the endogenous gene, and a 4-kb fragment downstream of exon 3 was inserted upstream of the PGK-neo cassette as a long arm of homology to the endogenous gene. The targeting vector construct had a total size of 11 kb. Homologous Recombination in ES Cells and Generation of Hsepi-deficient Mice—The targeting vector was linearized by restriction enzyme NotI and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Clones expressing the neo-resistant gene were selected by including G418 (350 μg/ml; Invitrogen) in the cell cultures and analyzed for target gene homologous recombination. The clone showing homologous recombination was detected by Southern blot analysis using an external 700-bp fragment as probe (Fig. 1A). The positive clone was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeric male founder mice were crossed with C57BL/6 females. The offspring was genotyped for the mutation by tail biopsies using a PCR method described below. The heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce Hsepi mutant mice. Phenotype studies were performed on mice with mixed genetic background (129/SvJ/Sv and C57BL/6). Genotype Analysis—Genotypes were determined by genomic Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1A) or by PCR. Genomic DNA from ES cells and tail biopsies were isolated as described previously (14Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and digested with BglII and SalI. The resulting fragments were separated in agarose gel and subsequently blotted onto a nylon membrane, followed by hybridization with a 700-bp external probe as shown in Fig. 1A. The PCR amplification was performed using the following primers: 5′-AGTGTTCAAAGGATAAACTACAA-3′ (upstream) for both wild type and mutant, 5′-ACTCCATGCTGCTCTGAC-3′ (downstream) for wild type (729bp), and 5-GGAAGGATTGGAGCTACGGGGGT-3′ (downstream) for mutant (521 bp). HS Structure Analysis—Pregnant mice (17.5–18.5 d.p.c., intercross of heterozygous mice) were injected with 0.5 mCi of [6-3H]GlcN and were sacrificed after 6 h. Whole embryos were homogenized in 4 m urea, 1% (v/w) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Proteoglycans in the extracts were purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, digested with chondroitinase ABC, and subjected to alkaline β-elimination. Released HS chains were recovered by anion-exchange chromatography. The purified HS samples were N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis and treated with HNO2 at pH 1.5 and 3.9 to convert the chains to disaccharides, which were subsequently reduced with NaB3H4 (15Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The metabolically and chemically 3H-labeled disaccharides were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column. Products obtained on deamination of HS at pH 1.5 only (cleavage of chains at N-sulfated GlcN units (15Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

The column was eluted with 0.5 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 2 ml/h. Morphological Analysis—Embryos from heterozygote matings were dissected under microscopy. Skeletal preparations of newborn mice were generated using an alcian blue-alizarin red staining method as described previously (16Kessel M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 67: 89-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). For histological analysis, newborn mice were immediately fixed in 10% formalin. The fixed animals were sectioned transversally at seven levels, each level yielding nine consecutive 4-μm sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and esoin. Targeted Disruption of Hsepi Results in Neonatal Lethality with Respiratory Failure—The GlcA C5-epimerase is encoded by a single Hsepi gene with three exons and accounts for the formation of IdoA units in HS biosynthesis (12Li J.P.

Pinhal M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21538-21543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To assess the functional significance of IdoA residues in HS, we have generated Hsepi-deficient mice by gene targeting in ES cells. A targeting vector was constructed to create a functional mutation by deletion of exon 3 (Fig. 1A) corresponding to the 341 C-terminal amino acid residues of the 618-residue protein. Following electroporation, homologous recombination in the Hsepi gene was found in one ES cell clone, identified by Southern blot analysis, with no additional sites of integration (not shown). Microinjection of this clone into C57BL/6 blastocysts yielded chimeric animals and germ line transmission. No overt defects were seen in heterozygous animals. Genotype analysis of offspring from intercrosses between heterozygous mice (Fig. 1B) showed essentially Mendelian heritance (22% wild type, 57% heterozygous, 21% homozygous; n = 168), indicating no early embryonic death. The offspring of heterozygous intercrosses was born on d.p.c. 18.5. Wild type (Hsepi +/+) and heterozygous (Hsepi +/–) littermates showed no aberrant phenotype and were fertile, with a lifespan of more than one year. By contrast, Hsepi –/– pups died immediately after birth, apparently from respiratory failure. Analysis of embryo (d.p.c. 18.5) extracts demonstrated that Hsepi –/– pups lacked detectable GlcA C5-epimerase activity, whereas heterozygotes showed decreased activity compared with wild type animals (Fig. 1C). HS from Hsepi –/– Mice Lacks IdoA—HS from Hsepi +/+, Hsepi +/–, and Hsepi –/– embryos (d.p.c. 17.5–18.5) was analyzed for composition, with particular regard to the occurrence of IdoA. Samples were cleaved to disaccharides by exhaustive deamination with nitrous acid, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4 and analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC (Fig. 2A). Notably, all three samples showed the same overall proportions of non-O-sulfated versus O-sulfated 3H-labeled disaccharide units (Table I). The Hsepi +/+ and Hsepi +/– patterns of O-sulfated disaccharides were indistinguishable and typical of normal HS, with a predominance of mono-O- and di-O-sulfated, IdoA-containing species. By contrast, these disaccharides were completely absent from the Hsepi –/– samples, which instead showed increased proportions of GlcA-containing species, including a disaccharide with 2-O-sulfated GlcA (Fig. 2A; Table I). Gel chromatography of metabolically [3H]GlcN-labeled HS indicated similar chain length for the various samples (not shown), whereas the Hsepi –/– polysaccharide emerged more retarded than the corresponding Hsepi +/+ and Hsepi +/– products on anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B). This difference in charge density was reflected by changes in N-substitution pattern, as demonstrated by size analysis of fragments obtained by selective deaminative cleavage of the HS chains at N-sulfated glucosamine residues (Fig. 2C). The proportion of disaccharides, derived from contiguous N-sulfated domains in mutant HS, was increased relative to wild type HS, whereas that of intermediate sized (4- to 14-mer) fragments was decreased. Total N-sulfation was calculated to 51 and 43% of disaccharide units in Hsepi –/– and Hsepi +/+ HS, respectively. These findings indicate a change in HS structure, from a largely intermixed distribution of N-substituents to a pattern of extended N-sulfated domains, along with a switch from -IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3-(upper structure in Fig. 2D) to -GlcA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-(lower structure in Fig. 2D) as the predominant sulfated disaccharide unit.Table IComposition of disaccharides obtained upon deaminative cleavage of HS isolated from embryonic (d.p.c 18.5) animalsDisaccharide unitsHsepi genotypeNon-O-sulfated2-O-Sulfated6-O-Sulfated2,6-O-SulfatedGlcAIdoAGlcAIdoAGlcAIdoAGlcAIdoA%+/+619.91.0115.84.5NDaNot determined.6.5+/-609.60.4135.74.7ND6.6-/-69ND3.3ND28NDNDNDa Not determined. Open table in a new tab Phenotype of Hsepi –/– Mice—All Hsepi –/– mice lacked kidneys (Fig. 3A), but showed no overt abnormalities in any other abdominal organs. The lungs of mutant animals were poorly inflated and immature with thickened, cell-rich alveolar walls (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, all Hsepi –/– animals showed bilateral iris coloboma (Fig. 3C). Abundant skeletal abnormalities included shorter body length (average 19 mm for Hsepi –/– animals, 26 mm for wild type littermates) with generally excessive mineralization (Fig. 3D), lack of proximal phalanges and tarsal bones (Fig. 3, E and F), “twisted” tail (Fig. 3G), post-axial polydactyly in one or both forelimbs (Fig. 3H), malformed ribcage and sternum and often cleft palate (not shown). However, the brain, heart, liver, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and skin all appeared normal. Given the recognized importance of HS in early embryonic patterning and morphogenesis (5Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Nybakken K. Perrimon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the selective nature of the IdoA-deficient phenotype, albeit severe, was unexpected. The requirements for defined HS structure in several functionally important interactions thus would not seem to include the presence of IdoA units. Comparison of the numerous defects in the Hsepi –/– mice with phenotypes due to elimination of other enzymes involved in HS biosynthesis shows similarities as well as differences. HS synthesized by mice deficient in N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase isoform 1 (NDST-1) is low in N-sulfate, hence in IdoA (sulfated and non-sulfated) and total O-sulfate compared with wild type HS (10Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). NDST-1 –/– pups show an immature lung phenotype similar to that of Hsepi –/– mice and die mostly immediately after birth (although ∼30% die E14.5–E18.5). Skeletal defects of NDST-1 –/– animals are generally less pronounced than in Hsepi –/– mice, whereas severe skull deformities and eye defects are more common (5Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M.

The Hs2st –/– mice further show several skeletal abnormalities indistinguishable from those seen in Hsepi –/– animals (17Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A.

On the other hand, contrary to the NDST-1 –/– and Hsepi –/– mice, the Hs2st –/– mutants had apparently normal lungs and remained alive for some hours (17Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S.

Differential Dependence of Development on HS Fine Structure—The accumulated information provides some clues to structure/function relations in HS biology. The multiple functions ascribed to HS proteoglycans throughout embryonic development involve several signaling networks, including FGF, Wnt, TGF-β, and Hedgehog pathways (6Nybakken K. Perrimon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Baeg G.H. Lin X. Khare N. Baumgartner S. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding signaling mechanisms appear either unaffected or perturbed by the lack of IdoA in HS. Indian Hedgehog is expressed during gastrulation in mammals and is an important regulator of developmental processes. Elimination in mice of the EXT1 protein, which is essential for HS biosynthesis, resulted in loss of HS, disruption of gastrulation, and embryonic lethality before E8.5 (23Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In EXT1 –/– embryos Indian Hedgehog failed to bind to the appropriate target cells, whereas wild type embryos showed strong binding. This critical interaction can apparently be mediated also by grossly perturbed HS lacking either IdoA or 2-O-sulfate residues. The up-regulation in N-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation observed in both Hsepi –/– (Table I) and Hs2st –/– HS (20Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) could conceivably “compensate” for the loss of IdoA and 2-O-sulfate residues, respectively, in some interactions crucial to development. On the other hand, we have now identified certain phenotype traits that critically depend on the presence of IdoA. Some of these features can be differentially related to the sulfation state of this monosaccharide component, as revealed by the Hsepi –/– and Hs2st –/– phenotypes. Lung maturation thus requires a minimal proportion of IdoA units (or a structure associated with such units) that do not need to be sulfated. Other events, including kidney, iris, and skeletal development, depend on HS with 2-O-sulfated IdoA residues. The distinctive NDST-1 –/– phenotype points to signaling mechanisms with yet other requirements for HS structure (5Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The regulation and temporal aspects of the expression and functional recruitment of HS epitopes continue to provide challenges for future work.

On the other hand, PTEN possesses lipid phosphatase activity toward 3-phosphoinositides, counteracting the action of the oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and blocking the activation of the proto-oncogene protein kinase B/Akt (8Maehama T.

Structurally, PTEN is composed of two domains, an N-terminal phosphatase catalytic domain and the C-terminal C2 domain, which binds phospholipids in vitro and is thought to mediate the binding of the molecule to membranes (10Lee J.-O.

In addition, PTEN contains three unstructured regions: first, the first seven residues form part of a phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-diphosphate binding motif; second, an internal loop within the C2 domain (residues 286–310) of unknown function; third, a C-terminal tail (residues 354–403) that contains a region phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2, as well as a PDZ binding motif located at the far C terminus (1Maehama T.

We and others have reported that the phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 regulates its function and protein stability to proteasome-mediated degradation (11Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R.

The C-terminal PDZ binding motif of PTEN has been shown to interact with the second PDZ domain of the scaffolding proteins S-SCAM/MAGI-2 and MAGI-3. This interaction has been shown to enhance the inhibitory effect of PTEN on protein kinase B activation (14Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.-J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L.

Caspases (cysteinyl-directed aspartate-specific proteases) are a family of highly specific proteases that play a key role during the apoptotic cell death. Caspases, constitutively expressed as inactive zymogens, are activated in a proteolytic cascade, in which initiator caspases, such as caspase-8, are activated by autoproteolysis in response to apoptotic cell stimulation. Initiator caspases then proteolytically activate downstream executioner caspases, such as caspase-3, which target a restricted set of structural and signaling proteins. Cleavage of these substrates accounts for cell death, as well as the phenotypic alterations characteristic of apoptosis (16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of caspase targets is crucial to understand how these caspases control the programmed cell death. In this regard, caspase-3 is the major apoptotic executioner protease and directly cleaves most of the proteins that are proteolyzed during apoptosis (17Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 18Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). PTEN plays a critical role in regulating cell survival; however, the regulation of its biological activity remains poorly understood. In this report, we describe that both the tumor suppressor PTEN and the scaffolding protein S-SCAM/MAGI-2 are targets of caspase-3. Interestingly, our results indicate that the proteolysis of PTEN by caspase-3 is negatively regulated by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase. The implications of the caspase-3-mediated proteolysis of PTEN, as a potential regulatory mechanism of protein stability and PTEN-protein interactions, are discussed.

PTEN catalytically inactive and caspase cleavage-site mutations were obtained by polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To obtain the construct pGEX-4T (S-SCAM)-PDZ 2, the second PDZ domain of rat S-SCAM (residues 591–732) was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pCMV Myc-S-SCAM (19Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M.

The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(Ome)-fmk (Alexis Biochemicals) and the caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem) were used at 50 and 4 μm, respectively. The caspase-3 colorimetric substrate, DEVD-pNA, was from MBL. Recombinant mouse TNFα (Sigma) was used at 100 ng/ml (for U87MG cells) or 20 ng/ml (for HeLa S3 cells). In some experiments, TNFα was used in combination with cycloheximide (10 ng/ml). Recombinant active His-tagged caspase-3 was purified from bacteria with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads by standard procedures and used at 100 ng/μl for in vitro proteolysis assays. Recombinant active human caspase-9 was from MBL and was used at 20 milliunits/μl. Human recombinant CK2 holoenzyme was from Roche Applied Science and was used at 6 microunits/μl. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of PTEN was raised against residues 1–16 of human PTEN. The monoclonal antibodies against caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 have been described previously (20Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.-E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl.

The rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-PARP and anti-ERK1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-HA and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies were 12CA5 and 9E10, respectively. Cell Lysis, Immunoblot, and Cell Fractionation in Triton X-100 — Transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed in ice-chilled PBS and lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20mm Na4P2O7) and then the cell lysates were centrifuged (14000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or pull-down experiments, as indicated. For cell lysis of transfected U87MG cells (see Fig. 5B and Fig. 6A) and HeLa S3 cells (see Fig. 5C), all cells, attached and floating, were collected by centrifugation and washed once with ice-chilled PBS. Then, cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For the fractionation of the cells in Triton X-100 (see Fig. 5A), transfected U87MG cells were rinsed in ice-chilled PBS and lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA), followed by centrifugation (14000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was considered as the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The pellet was further extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer during 5 min at 95 °C, followed by centrifugation (14000 rpm, 5 min at room temperature), and the supernatant was considered as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. For the measurement of caspase-3 activity in cell extracts, transfected U87MG cells were lysed in NPM buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.1% Triton X-100.Fig. 6Caspase-3 activity is induced by ectopic expression of PTEN. A, U87MG cells transfected with pRK5 PTEN w.t. or G129E mutation were harvested 24 h after transfection, lysed as in Fig. 5B and analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-N-terminal PTEN antibody (upper panel) or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (as a control of protein-loading; lower panel). B, cell extracts from U87MG cells, transfected as in A, were processed for measurement of caspase-3 activity in the presence of the caspase-3-specific substrate DEVD-pNA. Mock-transfected cells, non-treated or treated with TNFα plus cycloheximide (CHX) for 12 h, were processed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell Culture, Transfections, and [35S]Methionine Labeling of Proteins—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. HEK293, HeLa S3, and U87MG cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. U87MG cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. [35S]Methionine labeling and purification of HA-tagged PTEN or Myc-tagged S-SCAM was carried out in transfected COS-7 cells as described (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and then cells were labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/μl), rinsed in PBS, and lysed in lysis Buffer B, as indicated above. The HA-tagged or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates with the anti-HA 12CA5 or the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, respectively, plus protein A-Sepharose beads, washed four times with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol), and used for the in vitro proteolysis experiments. Pulse-chase experiments of 35S-labeled PTEN were performed as described (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In Vitro Proteolysis Experiments and Caspase-3 Activity Assays— Preparation of the HEK293 cellular extracts and activation of the caspase cascade with dATP were performed as described (21Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). For the in vitro proteolysis of PTEN by the HEK293 cellular extracts, purified 35S-labeled HA-PTEN wild type or the indicated mutations, from COS-7 transfected cells, were incubated with 35 μl of the non-activated or the dATP-activated HEK293 cellular extracts at 30 °C. Immunodepletions were performed by sequential incubations of cellular extracts with caspase-specific antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. For the in vitro proteolysis by caspase-3 or caspase-9, Myc-S-SCAM, HA-PTEN, or GST-PTEN, wild type, or the indicated mutations were incubated with recombinant active caspase-3 (100 ng/μl) or caspase-9 (20 milliunits/μl) in 35 μl of NPM buffer at 30 °C. At the indicated times, equal aliquots of each sample were placed on 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, and analyzed by autoradiography or by immunoblot. Caspase-3 activity assays from U87MG cell extracts were performed using the caspase-3 colorimetric substrate DEVD-pNA. Briefly, U87MG cells were lysed as indicated above, and 0.2 mg of protein extract was diluted 1:1 in NPM buffer containing 20 μm DEVD-pNA. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and DEVD-pNA hydrolysis was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. GST Fusion Proteins, in Vitro Kinase Assays, and GST Pull-down Experiments—The GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose using standard procedures. In vitro CK2 kinase assays of the GST fusion proteins were done as described (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). For GST pull-down experiments, COS-7 cells transfected with HA-PTEN wild type or mutations were lysed in lysis Buffer B as indicated above, and 0.5 mg of the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h on ice with 2 μg of the GST-(S-SCAM)-PDZ 2 fusion protein, followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads and further incubation for 2 h under constant shaking. Then, samples were washed four times with HNTG buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. PTEN Is Cleaved by Activated HEK293 Cell Extracts in a Phosphorylation-regulated Manner—We have described previously that PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated by the Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2 at a cluster of residues located at its C terminus. Analysis of the CK2 phosphorylated region of PTEN showed the existence of several putative caspase cleavage sites (DXXD and DXXD-like sequences) (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTEN could be cleaved by caspases within this region. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro proteolysis assays using 35S-labeled HA-PTEN, immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells, as the substrate. As the source of inactive or active caspases, non-activated or dATP-activated HEK293 cellular extracts were used. No changes in HA-PTEN (58-kDa apparent molecular mass) were observed upon incubation with non-activated HEK293 cellular extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4), indicating that PTEN is not a target for proteases present in the non-activated extracts. However, upon incubation with dATP-activated cellular extracts, the intensity of the band corresponding to HA-PTEN diminished in a time-dependent manner, concomitant with the appearance of two new bands of lower apparent molecular mass (50 and 37 kDa) (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8). Thus, activation of caspases in cell extracts triggers the cleavage of PTEN at several sites. Next, the involvement of phosphorylation in PTEN cleavage was investigated. In vitro proteolysis assays were performed using the phosphorylation-defective HA-PTEN S370A/S385A mutation (DMA), which targets the two major residues of PTEN phosphorylated by CK2 (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 13Miller S. Lou D. Seldin D. Lane W. Neel B.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 4B). Incubation of HA-PTEN DMA with activated extracts led to a prominent proteolysis of the PTEN molecule (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8), generating three bands of lower molecular mass: two faster migrating bands (50 and 37 kDa) that comigrated with the two cleavage products from HA-PTEN wild type (double-head arrows) and an additional band of 53 kDa. The intensity of the 50-kDa band, but not the 37-kDa band, was increased in the HA-PTEN DMA mutant, compared with HA-PTEN wild type (see below). Moreover, the time course of the proteolysis showed that the HA-PTEN DMA mutant was cleaved faster than the HA-PTEN wild type. PTEN residues Ser380, Thr382, and Thr383 are also involved, to a minor extent, in the phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a HA-PTEN S380A/T382A/T383A mutation (TMA) was also tested for proteolytic cleavage, as above. As shown, the proteolysis pattern of HA-PTEN TMA was indistinguishable with that of HA-PTEN wild type (Fig. 1C). The proteolysis of the HA-PTEN S370E/S385E mutation (DME), which mimics the phosphorylation of the residues Ser370 and Ser385 observed in PTEN wild type, was also analyzed. Upon incubation with activated extracts, HA-PTEN DME showed a proteolysis pattern analogous to that observed for HA-PTEN wild type (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HA-PTEN DMA mutation is cleaved more efficiently and contains more target sequences for proteolysis by activated cellular extracts than HA-PTEN wild type. This suggests that the phosphorylation of residues Ser370 and/or Ser385 negatively regulates the cleavage of PTEN by caspases. PTEN Is Cleaved by the Caspase-3 at Several Target Sites—To identify the caspase(s) involved in the cleavage of PTEN, 35S-labeled HA-PTEN DMA was incubated with HEK293 cellular extracts that were immunodepleted of caspase-9, caspase-3, or caspase-7 by specific antibodies, prior to their activation with dATP. As shown, depletion of caspase-7 from the extracts had no effect in the cleavage of HA-PTEN DMA (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–16), when compared with the control set points (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). However, immunodepletion of caspase-9 or caspase-3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8 and 6-12, respectively) abrogated the cleavage of HA-PTEN DMA by the activated extracts. As a control, the extent of depletion of the different caspases from the extracts is shown (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that HA-PTEN DMA is cleaved by the activated HEK293 cellular extracts in a caspase-9/caspase-3-dependent manner. The activation of caspase-9 in the dATP-activated extracts triggers the activation of caspase-3 (21Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTEN could be directly proteolyzed by caspase-3. To test this possibility, a GST-PTEN fusion protein was incubated in the presence of recombinant active caspase-3 or caspase-9, followed by immunoblot with an anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, caspase-3, but not caspase-9, cleaved GST-PTEN, rendering products equivalent to that observed in the dATP-activated extracts. Furthermore, both 35S-labeled HA-PTEN wild type and DMA mutation were also proteolyzed upon incubation with active caspase-3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3 and 4-6, respectively). Under these conditions, caspase-9 proteolyzed its specific synthetic substrate, LEHD-pNA (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PTEN is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro and support the notion that, in the experiments using activated HEK293 cellular extracts, PTEN is directly proteolyzed by caspase-3.Fig. 3PTEN is cleaved by caspase-3 at four target sites. A, 35S-labeled HA-PTEN, w.t., or the indicated mutations, were incubated with recombinant-active caspase-3 (100 ng/μl). At the indicated times, aliquots were processed and analyzed as in Fig. 1. Arrows indicate the cleavage products of HA-PTEN. DMA, S370A/S385A; CM2, D371N/D375N; CM3, D371N/D375N/D384N; CM4, D301N/D371N/D375N/D384N. B, schematics of the C-terminal portion of PTEN (residues 186–403, corresponding to the C2 domain and the tail of the molecule) and the caspase-cleavage mutations used in our study. The structural features of the C-terminal portion of PTEN and the cleavage target sites for the caspase-3 (arrowheads) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the caspase-3 cleavage sites on PTEN, experiments were performed using mutations that affect putative caspase-3-like sites at the C-terminal portion of PTEN (Asp301, Asp371, Asp375, and Asp384; see Fig. 3B). Mutation of Asp301 and Asp384 to Asn (D301N and D384N) abrogated the appearance of the 37- and 54-kDa bands, respectively, upon incubation with recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9 and 10–12). This implicates these residues are sites for cleavage by caspase-3. Analogous mutation of the residues Asp371 or Asp375 alone had no effect in the proteolysis of PTEN by the caspase-3 (data not shown); however, the combined mutation of these two residues (D371N/D375N; CM2) abrogated the appearance of the 50-kDa band (Fig. 3A, lanes 13–15), indicating that the mutation of the two caspase putative target sequences at Asp371 and Asp375 is necessary to abolish the cleavage of PTEN in this region. The combined mutation of the critical Asp in the three target sequences found within the CK2 phosphorylated region (D371N/D375N/D384N; CM3) eliminated the appearance of the 50- and 54-kDa bands upon incubation with caspase-3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 16–18). Finally, the combined mutation of all the caspase target sequences found in PTEN (D301N/D371N/D375N/D384N; CM4) completely blocked the cleavage of PTEN by the caspase-3 in vitro (Fig. 3A, lanes 19–21). Altogether, these results demonstrate that caspase-3 cleaves the tumor suppressor PTEN at several target sites within the C-terminal domain. CK2 Phosphorylation Blocks PTEN Cleavage by Caspase-3—To test the direct role of CK2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of PTEN on its cleavage by caspase-3, experiments were performed using recombinant active caspase-3 and non-phosphorylated and CK2-phosphorylated GST-PTEN fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A (see also Fig. 2C), GST-PTEN was cleaved by caspase-3 in an identical manner as HA-PTEN. Also, GST-PTEN wild type was efficiently phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, whereas phosphorylation of the GST-PTEN DMA mutation was severely impaired (Fig. 4B; see also Ref. 12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Remarkably, after phosphorylation of GST-PTEN wild type by CK2, caspase-3 cleavage at the PTEN C-terminal tail was abolished, whereas no effect of CK2 was observed on the cleavage of GST-PTEN DMA (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 blocks PTEN cleavage at its C terminus. Caspase-3-mediated Cleavage of PTEN in Vivo—To ascertain whether PTEN is cleaved by caspases in vivo, we examined by immunoblot the status of PTEN protein ectopically expressed in the PTEN-null cell line U87MG, using an antibody raised against the N terminus of PTEN. When expressed in U87MG cells, PTEN was detected in both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, a distinctive pattern of PTEN bands was observed in the insoluble fraction that included the PTEN full-length band (upper band) and three faster migrating bands, which were similar to that observed for the proteolysis of the PTEN DMA mutation by the caspase-3 in vitro. The appearance of these three faster migrating bands increased upon cell stimulation with the pro-apoptotic cytokine TNFα (Fig. 5A, lane 4). This cleavage was partially prevented by cell treatment with a specific caspase-3-selective inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) or with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (Boc-Asp(Ome)-fmk (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Finally, only the PTEN full-length band was observed in the caspase-insensitive PTEN CM4 mutation (Fig. 5B, lane 4). We next tested whether endogenous PTEN is cleaved by caspases during TNFα-induced apoptosis, using HeLa S3 cells that harbor wild type alleles of PTEN (22Yaginuma Y. Yamashita T. Ishiya T. Morizaki A. Katoh Y. Takahashi T. Hayashi H. Ishikawa M. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As observed, cleavage of endogenous PTEN was observed during TNFα-induced apoptosis in a time course-dependent manner and was partially inhibited by preincubation of the cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig. 5C, upper panel). The extent of caspase-3 activation upon the distinct conditions, as monitored by the cleavage of the caspase-3-specific protein substrate, PARP, is shown (Fig. 5C, middle panel). Note that only partial inhibition of PARP cleavage by z-DEVD-fmk was achieved under our experimental conditions. The expression of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 is also shown as a control of protein loading (Fig. 5C, lower panel). These results indicate that endogenous PTEN is cleaved in HeLa S3 cells during TNFα-induced apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner and corroborate the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo with recombinant PTEN. The cleavage pattern of the lipid-phosphatase inactive PTEN G129E mutation was also investigated in U87MG cells. Interestingly, the G129E PTEN mutation was less susceptible to cleavage than PTEN wild type (Fig. 6A, upper panel), suggesting that PTEN catalytic activity could affect caspase-3 activity in U87MG-transfected cells. To test this possibility, caspase-3 activity was measured in cell extracts from U87MG cells transfected with PTEN (Fig. 6B). As shown, caspase-3 activity was increased in extracts from wild type PTEN-transfected cells but not on those from cells transfected with G129E PTEN. Altogether, these results indicate that PTEN is cleaved by caspase-3 in vivo at the target sites identified in our in vitro studies and suggest a role for PTEN in the regulation of caspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 Proteolysis May Affect PTEN Protein Stability and PTEN/S-SCAM Interactions—The cleavage of PTEN by caspase-3 removes the C-terminal portion of PTEN, which has been involved in the regulation of PTEN stability and half-life, as well as in the binding of PTEN to PDZ domain-containing proteins (1Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 2Simpson L. Parsons R. Exp.

To test the consequences of caspase-3 cleavage on PTEN stability, the degradation of PTEN deletion mutants mimicking the cleavage of the protein by caspase-3 (residues 1–384, 1–375, 1–371, and 1–301) was measured by pulse-chase experiments. COS-7 cells expressing HA-PTEN wild type or C-terminal deletions were 35S-labeled, and degradation plots were obtained (Fig. 7A). As shown, PTEN C-terminal deletions were degraded faster than PTEN wild type. Next, the association of HA-PTEN C-terminal deletion mutants with the second PDZ domain of the multi PDZ domain-containing protein S-SCAM/MAGI-2 (S-SCAM-PDZ 2) (14Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.-J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N.

PTEN wild type was efficiently precipitated with GST-(S-SCAM)-PDZ 2 (Fig. 7B, lane 8); however, the PTEN C-terminal deletion mutants lacked the capability to interact with this PDZ domain (Fig. 7B, lanes 9–12). The same results were obtained with S-SCAM/MAGI-2 full-length in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Remarkably, S-SCAM/MAGI-2 was also found to be partially proteolyzed by caspase-3 in vitro (Fig. 7C, lanes 2 and 3). Together, these results suggest a role for caspase-3 in the regulation of PTEN protein stability and in the disassembling of multimolecular complexes containing PTEN and S-SCAM/MAGI-2. The role of the tumor suppressor PTEN in the control of cell survival and apoptosis is well documented (1Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 2Simpson L. Parsons R. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Waite A.W. Eng C. Am. J.

However, the regulatory mechanisms of PTEN biological activity remain poorly understood. In the present study, we have investigated the involvement of caspases in the partial proteolysis of PTEN during apoptosis and its potential role as a regulatory mechanism of PTEN protein stability and PTEN interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins. We have found that PTEN is cleaved upon incubation with HEK293 cellular extracts in the presence of dATP, which activates the caspase cascade in these extracts (21Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis of PTEN was also observed in intact cells stimulated with the cytokine TNFα, a well known activator of the caspase cascade. Our results provide evidence that this proteolysis is because of the activity of the caspase-3 apoptotic protease. First, depletion of caspase-3, or its upstream activator caspase-9, from the dATP-activated HEK293 cellular extracts, impaired the cleavage of PTEN. Second, recombinant caspase-3 cleaved PTEN in vitro to generate proteolysis products identical to those observed upon incubation of PTEN with the dATP-activated 293 cellular extracts or upon cell stimulation with TNFα. Third, cleavage of PTEN during TNFα stimulation was diminished by preincubation of the cells with both the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(OMe)-fmk or the caspase-3-selective inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk. Fourth, caspase-3 target sites were identified in PTEN amino acid sequence (see below). Mutation of these sites prevented PTEN cleavage in intact cells. Together, these results support the hypothesis that caspase-3, the major executioner caspase during apoptosis, directly cleaves the tumor suppressor PTEN in intact cells. Our mutational analysis demonstrates that caspase-3 cleaves PTEN at several target sites, which are located at unstructured regions of the protein (see Fig. 3B). One of these sites, Asp301, is located at an internal loop within the C2 domain of PTEN. This domain has been shown to facilitate the binding of PTEN to membranes; however, the precise function of its internal loop remains unknown. On the other hand, the residues Asp371, Asp375, and Asp384 are located at the C-terminal tail of PTEN, which regulates the stability and the function of PTEN (11Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, these three sites overlap with the CK2 phosphorylation sites found at the C terminus of PTEN (12Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3B), suggesting that the cleavage of the phosphatase in cells could be regulated by CK2-mediated phosphorylation. Indeed, our results using PTEN phosphorylation-defective mutations indicate that phosphorylation of the residues Ser370 and/or Ser385 inhibits the cleavage of PTEN by caspase-3. Furthermore, phosphorylation by CK2 abrogated caspase-3 cleavage of PTEN in vitro, reinforcing the hypothesis that CK2 could negatively regulate PTEN cleavage by caspase-3 during apoptosis. It is possible that the phosphorylation of Ser370 and Ser385 PTEN residues could mask the neighboring caspase-3 cleavage sites and/or decrease the accessibility of the protease to its recognition sites. In this regard, it has been shown that the phosphorylation by CK2 of several cell survival-regulatory proteins inhibits their cleavage by caspases (25Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that defective phosphorylation of PTEN at other C-terminal residues (Ser380, Thr382, and Thr383) enhances its function and its binding to the PDZ domain-containing protein S-SCAM/MAGI-2 (11Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 26Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4985-4989PubMed Google Scholar; see also below), suggesting that specific phosphorylation of distinct residues at the C terminus of PTEN could differentially affect PTEN regulation. In general, CK2 is a constitutively active kinase, making possible that most of the CK2 sites within PTEN would always be phosphorylated. However, our findings also suggest that the phosphorylation of PTEN could be modulated in cells, because both recombinant and endogenous wild type PTEN show a proteolysis pattern similar to that observed for the PTEN DMA mutation. Furthermore, the fact that the cleavage of PTEN in cells was only detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction suggests that pools of PTEN with distinct levels of phosphorylation may exist at different subcellular locations. Thus, it is possible that a pool of non-phosphorylated PTEN is localized at Triton X-100 insoluble fractions, such as components of nucleus, lipid rafts, and/or cytoskeleton, where it could be proteolyzed by caspase-3 in response to apoptotic stimuli. Indeed, PTEN localization at some of these subcellular compartments has been reported (28Lachyankar M.B. Sultana N. Schonhoff C.M. Mitra P. Poluha W. Lambert S. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.C. Recht L.D. et al.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Caselli A. Mazzinghi B. Caici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 29: 692-697Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The possibility cannot be excluded that a protein phosphatase, located at Triton X-100-insoluble fractions, could target PTEN in response to caspase activation. During apoptosis, caspases cleave a restricted set of signaling proteins involved in cell growth and survival, thereby turning off survival signals in addition to activating death signals (30Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have not observed significant differences in the inhibition of protein kinase B activity by transient overexpression of the C-terminal tail PTEN deletion mutations mimicking PTEN cleavage by caspase-3, when compared with PTEN wild type (data not shown), suggesting that PTEN catalytic activity is not directly affected by the caspase-3-mediated cleavage. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that cleavage of PTEN modulates its phosphatase activity. On the other hand, the observation that the cleavage of the catalytically inactive PTEN G129E mutation is diminished in intact cells suggests that PTEN activity could favor its cleavage by caspases. In this regard, caspase-3 activity was increased in extracts from cells transfected with PTEN wild type but not on those transfected with PTEN G129E. These findings, and the observations on the reduced stability of C-terminal PTEN deletions (see Refs. 23Georgescu M.-M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and 24Tolkacheva T. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and this study), suggest that caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PTEN could be part of a physiological feedback mechanism whereby PTEN protein levels could be down-regulated during the commitment of cells to undergo apoptosis. We have found that PTEN deletion mutations mimicking caspase-3 cleavage fail to bind to the second PDZ domain of the scaffolding protein S-SCAM/MAGI-2. Furthermore, S-SCAM/MAGI-2 was also proteolyzed by caspase-3 in vitro, suggesting that the interaction of the C-terminal tail of PTEN with PDZ domain-containing proteins could be controlled by caspase cleavage. The C2 domain of PTEN is also targeted by caspase-3 (see above), and it has been reported that this domain mediates the interaction of PTEN with the major vault protein (31Yu Z. Fotouhi-Aroakani N. Wu L. Maoui M. Wang S. Banville D. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40247-40252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that, during apoptotic cell death, cleavage of PTEN by caspase-3 would result in changes in the interaction of PTEN with structural, scaffolding, and/or regulatory molecules at particular subcellular locations (see above). Altogether, the results presented here describe a potential regulatory mechanism of PTEN protein stability and PTEN-protein interactions, controlled by CK2 and mediated by caspase-3, that could take place under physiological conditions.

We examined angiogenesis using an assay wherein confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were overlain with collagen in a serum-free defined medium. Small spaces formed in the cell layer by 2 h, and cells formed net-like arrays by 6–8 h and capillary-like lumens by 24 h. Blocking of α2β1, but not α1 or αvβ3 integrin function halted morphogenesis. We found that a triple-helical, homotrimeric peptide mimetic of a putative α2β1 binding site: α1(I)496–507 GARGERGFP*GER (where single-letter amino acid nomenclature is used, P* = hydroxyproline) inhibited tube formation, whereas a peptide carrying another putative site: α1(I)127–138 GLP*GERGRP*GAP* or control peptides did not.

In adult mammals, angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from the existing vasculature, is the exclusive mechanism by which new vessels are formed, and is involved in normal homeostasis as well as in various diseases, including growth and metastasis of solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7189) Google Scholar). It is a complex process by which endothelial cells degrade their matrix, migrate, proliferate, and differentiate into new vessels (2Strömblad S. Cheresh D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis depends upon the interaction of endothelial cells with extracellular matrix proteins via cell adhesion molecules, and the activities of growth factors and cytokines (3Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Because type I collagen is a ubiquitous component of many tissues that undergo angiogenesis during embryonic development, it may play a role in promoting blood vessel development and contribute to pathological angiogenesis. In fact, type I collagen is among the most ideal scaffolds for the induction of angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, bovine aortic endothelial cells synthesize type I collagen (4Cotta-Pereira G. Sage H.

In vivo, angiogenesis is disrupted in the chick embryo by inhibiting collagen triple helix formation or fibrillogenesis using α,α-dipyridyl or β-aminopropionitrile, respectively (14Ingber D.E. Folkman J. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 44-51PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a definitive role for collagen exists, but the mechanisms by which it exerts its pro-angiogenic effect remain elusive. Roles for several intracellular signaling pathways are proposed for collagen-induced angiogenesis. Thus, in long term collagen gel cultures, the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways are implicated in mediating angiogenesis of the endothelial cell line MSS31, although their relative contributions to specific phases of angiogenesis are unknown (15Tanaka K. Abe M. Sato Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is of interest that in mice null for p38α MAPK, primary angiogenesis proceeds normally, but remodeling of the capillary plexus and placental angiogenesis are defective (16Mudgett J.S. Ding J. Guh-Siesel L. Chartrain N.A. Yang L. Gopal S. Shen M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas lack of Mekk3, the p38 MAPK upstream activator, causes deficiency in both primary as well as placental angiogenesis (17Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Additionally, links between the collagen-associated integrins and p38 MAPK have been established, albeit in a non-angiogenic context (18Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.M.

In three-dimensional collagen gels, PMA treatment induces HUVEC survival and tube formation by activating MAPK, PI3K, and Akt/protein kinase B pathways, which are postulated to act by up-regulating VEGF receptor expression and cell-cell adhesion molecules such as vascular endothelial cadherin (10Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within other matrix scaffolds, FGF-2-dependent angiogenesis correlates with a sustained, αVβ3 integrin-dependent wave of ERK activity, necessary for endothelial cell migration (20Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), whereas VEGF promotes angiogenesis, but requires src kinase and ERK activities (21Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L. Hood J.D. Leng J. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In vivo, type I collagen implants induce angiogenesis and require matrix metalloproteinase activity (22Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); in the case of αVβ3 integrin-mediated angiogenesis, matrix metalloproteinase 2 association is also necessary and proposed to facilitate cell migration (23Silletti S. Kessler T. Goldberg J. Boger D.L. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we seek to identify the endothelial integrin receptors used, the determinants in the type I collagen fibril to which they bind, and the intracellular signaling pathways employed during tube formation in type I collagen. Here we developed an in vitro model representing the capillary tube formation phase of angiogenesis, using a novel SFDM containing only BSA, FGF-2, and VEGF. We found that α2β1 integrins and a single integrin binding site on type I collagen are essential for tube formation and identified potential roles for p38 MAPK and FAK.

Endothelial cell growth supplement was isolated from bovine hypothalami as described previously (24Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant α2 I domain was a generous gift from Dr. Santoro (University of Washington, St. Louis, MO). Type I Collagen Isolation—Collagen was isolated from rat tail tendons as previously described and solubilized in 10 mm acetic acid overnight with agitation at 4 °C prior to use (25San Antonio J.D. Lander A.D. Wright T.C. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HUVEC Isolation—Umbilical cords were from the Obstetrics Department, Thomas Jefferson University. Cells were isolated as described and used through passage six (26Gimbrone M.A. Collen B.S. Progress in Hematology and Thrombosis. Vol. III. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1976: 1-28Google Scholar). In Vitro Angiogenesis Assays—Our assay was adapted from that of Montesano et al. (9Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). 6- and 12-well cell culture dishes (Falcon) were coated with 100 μg/ml rat-tail type I collagen in sterile 10 mm acetic acid (10.5 μg/cm2) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were rinsed twice in warm, sterile PBS+, and cells were plated at 105 cells/cm2 in complete media. Alternatively, suspended cells were rinsed twice with SFDM lacking growth factors and plated at 105 cells/cm2 in SFDM, incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The next day wells were rinsed with PBS+ and given 80–100 μl/cm2 of a collagen gel. Gels were prepared by mixing seven parts of a 1.4 mg/ml type I collagen stock in sterile 10 mm acetic acid with one part of 10× BME or Medium 199 and two parts of an 11.8 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate stock on ice. Cultures were incubated as above until gels had solidified for ∼15 min then given 0.6 ml of media with test agents to yield a final volume of 1.0 ml. In gel removal experiments, we used a sterile scalpel to cut along the circumference of the gel then pipetted the medium under the gel to dislodge it. Finally, gels and media were aspirated, and media were replaced. Geldanamycin was dissolved in Medium 199, and all other inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO. Inhibitors were diluted in SFDM and added after gel formation. Transmission Electron Microscopy of Cultures—Methods were as detailed previously (27Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At 24 h, embedded control monolayers and collagen-treated cultures were cut on an Ultracut S ultramicrotome, with the plane of sectioning perpendicular to the monolayer. Analysis was performed on a JEM-100CX II, and images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Quantitation of Angiogenesis—Endothelial tube morphogenesis was examined by phase contrast microscopy and assessed quantitatively. Photographs taken using a FUJI X HC-300Z digital camera were adjusted to the same numerical values using the levels function of Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Typical quantitation methods count the area occupied by or numbers of tube-like structures, making the uncertain assumption that all structures counted are bona fide tubes. We used a more objective measurement of HUVEC network formation, i.e. the formation of tube-like structures and their intervening spaces, as the total empty area in a given culture. Area measurements were performed using Image 1.62 (National Institutes of Health). All assays were repeated at least three times with at least two wells per treatment group. In some experiments the progression of morphogenesis was also quantitated by measuring the width of cellular processes at the midpoint, as a measure of the stage of tube formation, i.e. well-formed tubes have narrow diameters, whereas poorly or partially formed tubes do not. p values were generated using the Student's t test. Fluorescent Staining of Angiogenic Cultures—100 μg of collagen I was dried onto permanox 2-well chamber slides overnight and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Slides were rehydrated with warm PBS for 5 min, before plating 105 HUVEC/cm2 in SFDM; gels were prepared as outlined above. After 30 min or 1 h of collagen gel exposure, both the monolayer cultures, and the treated cultures (following gel removal) were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed in TBS, permeabilized for 5 min with TBS/0.1% triton X 100, and blocked with TBS/1% BSA for 30 min. Cells were incubated with 1:100 anti-phospho-FAK in TBS for 1 h. In some cases, cells were dual-stained with 1:200 anti-human vinculin (hVIN1, Sigma) or 1:50 anti-talin (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Following incubation with primary antibodies, cells were rinsed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies, and rinsed again; coverslips were glycerol-mounted. Photographs were taken using Kodak 1600 color slide film and an Olympus BX50 upright microscope. Analysis of the Phosphorylation State of Focal Adhesion Kinase—Two 12-well plates were set up for angiogenesis assays per time point; collagen gels were prepared as outlined above. One plate received collagen while the other SFDM; following polymerization, plates were extracted using 40 μl (10 μl/cm2) of 1× SDS loading buffer at various times after collagen addition. Gels were removed as outlined above, and cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS prior to extraction. Equivalent microgram quantities of total lysate were loaded and run on 12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (ICN Biomedicals). Proteins were then transferred onto activated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with primary antibody, 1:500 phospho-FAK, 4 h at room temperature, and 1:250 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, 1 h at 25 °C. Blots were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager. Relative levels of phosphorylation were determined using the integrate volume and local average background subtraction functions of ImageQuant software. Analysis of p38 MAPK Activity—We determined relative p38 MAPK activity in cultures using a non-radioactive assay (Cell Signaling). Two 12-well plates were set up for angiogenesis assays as outlined above; one plate received collagen while the other SFDM. At various times following the addition of the collagen, gels and media were removed, cells rinsed twice with PBS, and extracted with 40 μl of lysis buffer containing 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per well. Extracts were clarified at 14,000 × g/10 min/4 °C. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using an immobilized anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (T180/Y182). On the following day, pellets were rinsed in lysis and kinase buffers then given 2 μg of recombinant ATF-2 and 10 μm ATP at 30 °C/30 min. Reactions were quenched using SDS loading buffer, run on 10% PAGE gels (ICN), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS, then incubated with 1:1000 phospho-ATF-2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Bands were visualized using an horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and ECL. Films were scanned into a computer, and band intensities were analyzed using the gel analysis macros of NIH Image 1.62. Toxicity of Chemical Inhibitors—HUVECs were plated at 105 cells/cm2 on collagen-coated 96-well plates overnight in SFDM. The next day, cultures were given SFDM containing various chemical inhibitors. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, media were withdrawn, and PBS containing 1 mm calcein and 2 μm ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes) was added; plates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. Following labeling, plates were read using the Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager, and fluorescent signals were analyzed using Fluorsep and ImageQuant. Flow Cytometry Analysis of Integrin Expression—HUVEC passages 0–7 were trypsinized, allowed to recover in suspension for 2 h, rinsed twice in PBS/1% BSA, and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml. 5 × 105 cells were placed in a non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plate with 5–40 μg/ml anti-α2β1, α1, or αVβ3 antibodies at 24 °C for 1 h. Plates were rinsed twice in PBS and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min at 24 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and mixed 1:1 with 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were read on a Beckman Coulter XL/MCL analyzer using a 488-nm argon ion laser and system II software. Triple Helical Peptide Synthesis—Chemicals, including 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-amino acid derivatives, of analytical reagent grade or better were from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA) or Fisher. Amino acids, except for Gly, were l-isomers. The monoalkyl chains decanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)8-CO2H, designated C10) and palmitic acid (CH3-(CH2)14-CO2H, designated C16) were purchased from Aldrich. THPs and single-stranded peptides (SSP) were synthesized and purified as described (28Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Chung L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 50: 5795-5803Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Yu Y.-C. Berndt P. Tirrell M. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem.

Three THPs and one SSP were constructed: α1(I)256–270 (C10-(GPP*)4GEP*GAP*GNKGDTGEP*(GPP*)4-NH2) 2Where single-letter amino acid nomenclature is used, P* = hydroxyproline. THP (α1(I)256 –270 THP); α1(I)127–138 (C10-(GPP*)4GLP*GERGRP*GAP*(GPP*)4-NH2) THP (α1(I)127–138 THP); α1(I)496 –507 (C10-(GPP*)4GARGERGFP*GER(GPP*)4-NH2) THP (α1(I)496 –507 THP); and α1(I)499 –510 (C16GAP*GFP*GERGEK-NH2) SSP (α1(I)499 –510 SSP). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A LD-TOF mass spectrometer using either a sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (9:1, v/v) matrix. Single chain mass values were as follows: α1(I)256 –270 THP, [M+H]+ 3721.8 Da (theoretical, 3722.0 Da); α1(I)127–138 THP, [M+H]+ 3498.8 Da (theoretical, 3502.9 Da); α1(I)496 –507 THP, [M+H]+ 3595.5 Da (theoretical, 3595.5 Da); and α1(I)499 –510 SSP, [M+H]+ 1469.9 Da (theoretical, 1470.7 Da). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190 –250 nm on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter using a 10-mm path-length quartz cell. We obtained thermal transition curves by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm while continuously increasing the temperature from 5 to 80 °C at 0.2 °C/min, using a JASCO PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the reflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (T m). T m values were 44.5, 56.0, and 52.5 °C for α1(I)256 –270 THP, α1(I)127–138 THP, and α1(I)496 –507 THP, respectively. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements of Integrin-THP Interactions—Binding of THP and SSP peptides to α1β1, αVβ3, and α2 integrins was determined at 25 °C using SPR from measurements of the accompanying increase in refractive index through time using a Biacore™ 2000 Biosensor (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Initially, the α1β1, αVβ3, and α2 integrins were captured on individual channels of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling. Solutions containing THPs and SSPs in elution buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) at the required concentrations were injected over each surface, and the response was measured as a function of time. The surface was regenerated after each injection by a single 10-s injection of 1 m NaCl. After subtraction of the contribution of bulk refractive index changes and nonspecific interactions with the CM5 chip surface, typically less than 5%, the individual association (k a) and dissociation (k d) rate constants were obtained by global fitting of data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation™ (Biacore, Inc.). These values were then used to calculate the dissociation constant (K D). The values of average squared residual (c 2) obtained were not significantly improved by fitting data to models that assumed bivalent or heterogeneous interactions. Conditions were chosen so that the contribution of mass transport to the observed values of K D was negligible. To examine mechanisms of type I collagen-induced angiogenesis, we first modified the classic method for the induction of angiogenesis by a type I collagen gel deposited apically on a confluent HUVEC monolayer plated on a collagen gel (9Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, we simplified the system by replacing the basal collagen gel with a collagen film to prevent cellular invasion and developed a serum-free medium (SFDM) that optimally supported angiogenesis. Development of a Novel Serum-free Defined Medium—Typically, endothelial cells are grown and used in angiogenesis assays in 10% serum with either endothelial cell growth factor or endothelial cell growth supplement, a heterogeneous mixture derived from bovine hypothalamic extracts (24Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar); in such media angiogenesis occurs over 24–72 h. To develop a SFDM substitute, we tested the effectiveness of three base media: EBM, Medium 199, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F-12 (1:1) in supporting tube formation. We found that EBM, a commercially available serum-free media for endothelial cells, although more complex and more expensive, was no more effective than Medium 199. The Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 mixture, often used because it is a richer nutrient medium, was also no better than Medium 199. Next, we found that insulin, transferrin, and selenium, often included in serum-free formulations to enhance cell survival and growth, had no benefit. Finally, we evaluated the effect of FGF-2 and VEGF and found that VEGF alone at either 5 or 10 ng/ml was less effective than 5 ng/ml FGF-2 alone in supporting tube formation (10Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, a combination of 5 ng/ml of both growth factors was optimal in agreement with previous studies (31Pepper M.S. Ferrara N. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Thus, our final SFDM was composed of Medium 199, 1% BSA (w/v), and 5 ng/ml FGF-2 and VEGF. Notably, use of this formulation resulted in the formation of widespread tube-like structures typically within 8–12 h. Time Course of Angiogenesis in SFDM—Observation of live cultures revealed immediate changes within the cell layer following polymerization of the collagen gel, when cells appear flattened as compared with non-collagen-treated cells. Within 2 h small spaces appeared in the cell layer, enlarging to form a net-like structure by 6–8 h as cells condensed and elongated forming capillary-like tubes that persisted to 24 h (Fig. 1). At this time, intracellular vacuoles were apparent by phase contrast microscopy, and it is proposed that such structures are precursors to lumen formation (32Folkman J. Haudenschild C. Nature. 1980; 288: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 33Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis of cell layers at 24 h revealed structures reminiscent of capillaries enclosing lumen-like cavities formed by several HUVEC (Fig. 2). The lumen-like cavities occasionally contained filopodia, debris, and cellular protrusions yet always excluded the fibrillar collagen gel (Fig. 2, B–D). Thus our system resulted in the rapid formation of capillary-like tubes and therefore replicated the end point or capillary morphogenesis phase of angiogenesis.Fig. 2Capillary tube-like structures form in endothelial cell layers in response to an apical collagen gel. Control (A) and collagen-treated (B–D) cultures were fixed at 24 h and processed for transmission electron microscopy; sections were perpendicular to the plane of the cultures. Cultures stimulated with an apical collagen gel showed lumen-like structures (Lu) (B–D), and lumen-like structures with filopodia (arrow). Arrow-heads indicate electron dense intercellular junctions in closely apposed cells. Some lumen-like structures contained cellular protrusions (cp) and debris (d) (D). In some micrographs the fibrillar collagen gel (cg) can be seen (C and D).

We found that, when apical gels were removed at times less than 8 h after their addition, cellular reorganization was arrested and cells returned to a near-confluent monolayer as previously reported (34Deroanne C.F. Colige A.C. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in cultures where collagen gels were present for at least 8 h and capillary like networks had formed, some remnants of the net-like structure remained following gel removal and persisted even at 24 h. Thus collagen must be constantly present during HUVEC tube formation. However, once morphogenesis is complete, parts of the capillary-like network remain quite stable morphologically, even in the absence of collagen.

https://openalex.org/W2105538566,"Collagens are extended trimeric proteins composed of the repetitive sequence glycine-X-Y. A collagen-related structural motif (CSM) containing glycine-X-Y repeats is also found in numerous proteins often referred to as collagen-like proteins. Little is known about CSMs in bacteria and viruses, but the occurrence of such motifs has recently been demonstrated. Moreover, bacterial CSMs form collagen-like trimers, even though these organisms cannot synthesize hydroxyproline, a critical residue for the stability of the collagen triple helix. Here we present 100 novel proteins of bacteria and viruses (including bacteriophages) containing CSMs identified by in silico analyses of genomic sequences. These CSMs differ significantly from human collagens in amino acid content and distribution; bacterial and viral CSMs have a lower proline content and a preference for proline in the X position of GXY triplets. Moreover, the CSMs identified contained more threonine than collagens, and in 17 of 53 bacterial CSMs threonine was the dominating amino acid in the Y position. Molecular modeling suggests that threonines in the Y position make direct hydrogen bonds to neighboring backbone carbonyls and thus substitute for hydroxyproline in the stabilization of the collagen-like triple-helix of bacterial CSMs. The majority of the remaining CSMs were either rich in proline or rich in charged residues. The bacterial proteins containing a CSM that could be functionally annotated were either surface structures or spore components, whereas the viral proteins generally could be annotated as structural components of the viral particle. The limited occurrence of CSMs in eubacteria and lower eukaryotes and the absence of CSMs in archaebacteria suggests that DNA encoding CSMs has been transferred horizontally, possibly from multicellular organisms to bacteria.

Collagens, present in most multicellular organisms, are helical proteins composed of three extended polyproline type II-like chains (1Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Best studied are the fibrillar collagens, constituting important components of the extracellular matrix. However, non-fibrillar collagens as well as proteins with shorter collagen-like regions also exist, and a collagen-related structural motif (CSM) 1The abbreviation used is: CSM, collagen-related structural motif. has been identified in proteins of bacteria, bacteriophages, and viruses (2Charalambous B.M.

Science. 1998; 279: 1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria and viruses are generally believed to be unable to synthesize hydroxyproline, a residue regarded as essential for the stabilization of a triple-helical structure. However, the absolute requirement of hydroxyproline for triple-helix formation has lately been challenged (6Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been shown that three different bacterial CSMs trimerize, despite the lack of hydroxyprolines (2Charalambous B.M. Keen J.N. McPherson M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2903-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Höök M. Lukomski S. J. Biol.

This study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of proteins containing CSMs in bacteria and viruses through an in silico approach. We found that CSMs are encoded by a minority of bacteria and bacteriophages and that these CSMs differ from human collagens in several important aspects. A novel mechanism for the stabilization of bacterial CSMs is presented. We also propose that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution of CSMs. The CSMs were identified by downloading 56 bacterial proteomes from The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR.org) homepage using the batch download function and pattern searches in-house, using MacVector (version 6.5.3; Oxford Molecular Ltd.). The pattern used was (GPP)7 with 12 allowed mismatches. Matches containing Gly in the Pro positions were excluded. The CSMs were then used in unfiltered tBLASTn searches from the NCBI microbial genome homepage against 136 eubacterial genomes, 15 archeabacterial genomes, 30 genomes of lower eukaryotes, and against available viral genomes. Obtained hits were analyzed with the pattern in-house. Open reading frames flanking the bacterial CSM-encoding genes were analyzed by BLASTp to determine whether the gene was phage-encoded. Homology models of proline-rich CSMs were constructed on a trimeric ((GPP)10)3 template from a 1.3-Å x-ray structure (11Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The models were built by global energy minimization using the template as constraint. After the model structures had been minimized, conformations of all threonine side chains were sampled through an exhaustive systematic search of the χ-angles of the side chains. All molecular mechanics calculations were carried out using the ICM software (12Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). All statistical analyses for differences were performed using Fisher's exact test. Proteins with Collagen-related Structural Motifs in Bacteria and Viruses—The characteristic primary structure of collagen (glycine-X-Y repeats) and the high content of proline allowed us to construct a simple pattern (GPP)7 for in silico detection of CSMs. The pattern was applied to 58 bacterial proteomes to detect such sequences. In addition, BLAST searches against 137 eubacterial genomes, 15 archaebacterial genomes, 30 genomes of lower eukarya, and against viral genomes with the CSMs obtained in the proteome screen, identified additional proteins containing CSMs. In total, 103 CSMs were identified. The results, which are summarized in Fig. 1A, show that proteins with a CSM are present in a minority of genomes analyzed. No CSMs were detected in the 15 archaebacterial genomes, whereas 53 CSMs were detected in the 137 eubacterial genomes analyzed. In eubacteria, CSMs are mostly found in the firmicute group (including mycobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria), and on several occasions a single genome encodes more than one such protein. The viral CSMs detected were mostly from bacteriophages (37/43), and some of them represent allelic variants. A given viral or bacteriophage genome only encodes one CSM. In the lower eukarya group, CSMs were only detected in proteins from three different strains of Plasmodium falciparum. These CSMs were omitted from further analysis because they were too few to allow any statistical analysis. Characteristics of Bacterial and Viral CSMs—The CSMs were generally dissimilar in primary structure, except for the periodicity of the glycines and a relatively high proline content. The length of the CSM varied from 7 (the detection limit of the pattern) to 745 continuous GXY repeats, with a mean number of 76 GXY repeats. In 18 of the 103 CSM-containing proteins identified, more than one CSM was identified. Both COOH- and NH2-terminal to the CSM, other regions of varying length and sequence were found in all proteins. A position-specific analysis of the amino acid content of the identified CSMs revealed several differences compared with human collagens (Fig. 1B). Because no statistically significant differences were noted between bacteriophage CSMs and CSMs from other viruses, these were pooled for the purpose of subsequent analyses. Perhaps most striking is the difference in proline content and the preference for proline in position X in the CSMs from bacteria and viruses. The proline content is significantly lower in these CSMs as compared with human collagens (p = 3.7 × 10–147 for the bacterial CSMs and p = 2.8 × 10–16 for the viral CSMs). In bacterial and viral CSMs the fraction of prolines found in the Y position was significantly lower as compared with this fraction in human collagens (p = 3.2 × 10–77 for bacterial and p = 1.2 × 10–59 for the viral CSMs). Prolines in position Y are generally hydroxylated in human collagen; thus, the relative absence of prolines in this position among CSMs from bacteria and viruses probably reflects their inability to synthesize hydroxyproline. In this context it should be mentioned that bacterial homologues of eukaryotic prolyl hydroxylases could not be identified despite extensive similarity searches. The CSMs identified contained a significantly higher proportion of threonine (p = 7.6 × 10–206 for bacterial CSMs and p = 1.9 × 10–36 for viral CSMs) and glutamine (p = 2.1 × 10–12 for bacteria and p = 4.1 × 10–14 for viruses) in the Y position as compared with human collagen. A minority of the bacterial CSMs (17 of 53) had more than 50% of Y positions occupied by threonine (mean 94%). In these threonine-rich CSMs, the X position is typically occupied by prolines, alanines, or serines, whereas charged residues are less common than in the other bacterial CSMs and in human collagen. The proteins containing threonine-rich CSMs are clustered in five bacterial species: the spore-forming human pathogens Clostridium difficile, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus cereus, the nitrogen-fixating Metorhizobium loti, and the sulfur-metabolizing Desulfitobacter hafniense. To determine whether threonine can influence stability of a collagen-like triple-helix, we built homology models of six representative proline-rich CSMs on a trimeric ((GPP)10)3 template constructed from a 1.3-Å x-ray structure (11Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The resulting models show that threonine in the Y position is able to form direct interchain hydrogen bonds to backbone carbonyls in its energetically most favored conformation (Fig. 2). When the amino acids in the X and Y positions of one threonine-rich CSM were switched, the threonines were not able to form interchain hydrogen bonds (data not shown). Interestingly, there are indications that threonine in the Y position can also stabilize a triple-helical structure through indirect hydrogen bonding or through glycosylations (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bachinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most of the remaining 83 CSMs could instead be classified as rich in prolines (>30% in X and Y position) or charged (>45% charged residues in X and Y). Eight of the identified CSMs did not meet any of the criteria, whereas five CSMs fell into more than one class (Fig. 3A). Not only the prolines, but also the charged residues, were found to be unevenly distributed between the X and Y positions (Fig. 3B). Most often, negatively charged residues are found in position X, whereas positively charged residues (arginine and lysine) are found in the Y position. This may be related to triple-helix stability, because especially arginine in the Y position stabilizes trimers (9Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol.

Negative charges in the Y position are generally destabilizing, with the exception of GR/KD triplets (15Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Among the charged CSMs with a net negative charge in the Y position, aspartate is more common than glutamate and the aspartate is in 50% of the cases preceded by a positively charged residue. In addition to stabilization, charges in collagen are important for the interactions between collagen and other macromolecules (16Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H.

Function of the CSM—The function of CSMs in bacteria and viruses is not well understood. The few CSMs studied have been shown to mediate trimerization or elongation (2Charalambous B.M. Keen J.N.

Furthermore, the CSM of one protein from Streptococcus sanguis has been shown to mediate aggregation of platelets (26Erickson P.R. Herzberg M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1646-1649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is less clear whether the CSMs from two Streptococcus pyogenes proteins contribute to the adhesive properties of these proteins (21Lukomski S.

The viral proteins containing CSMs identified in this study were mainly encoded by bacteriophages and had to a large extent been annotated or could easily be annotated by similarity searches. The majority of these proteins were tail-fiber or host-specificity proteins, involved in the interactions between bacteriophages and bacteria (see e.g. Ref. 27Duplessis M. Moineau S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Only a minority of the bacterial proteins containing a CSM could be annotated. Three proteins had previously been described as surface or spore-associated (20Rasmussen M. Edén A. Björck L. Infect.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); from pattern and similarity searches, an additional 13 proteins could be classified as cell wall-attached (28Janulczyk R. Rasmussen M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or transmembrane proteins. The non-collagen-related parts of the proteins showed surprisingly little sequence similarity to other proteins, making a functional classification of the bacterial proteins difficult. The presence of CSMs in proteins with so little sequence similarity indicates that the CSM is, indeed, a structural motif that elongates or trimerizes a variety of different, mainly extracellular, proteins. The possibility remains, however, that some CSMs may mediate binding of bacterial or bacteriophage proteins to other macromolecules. Evolutionary Aspects—Because so few bacterial and unicellular eucaryotic genomes encode CSMs and because archaebacteria completely lack such sequences, it seems unlikely that CSMs have evolved before the diversification of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It appears more plausible that genes encoding CSMs have moved horizontally or arisen on several occasions during evolution rather than selective gene loss among archaea, bacteria, and lower eukaryotes. Horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and vertebrae has been proposed to be relatively common (29Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K. Heaford A. Howland J. Kann L. Lehoczky J. LeVine R. McEwan P. McKernan K. Meldrim J. Mesirov J.P. Miranda C. Morris W. Naylor J. Raymond C. Rosetti M. Santos R.

Ainscough R. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17824) Google Scholar, 30Syvanen M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 245-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although this view has also been questioned (31Stanhope M.J. Lupas A. Italia M.J. Koretke K.K. Volker C. Brown J.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). If horizontal gene transfers of CSMs have occurred, we believe that the direction of transfer has been from eukaryotes to bacteria. After horizontal transfer of sequences encoding a CSM, bacteriophages may have promoted further horizontal transfer within the bacterial kingdom leading to the “patchy” distribution seen for CSMs among bacteria. We have no evidence for a role of viruses or bacteriophages in the putative horizontal transfer between eukaryotes and bacteria, but this cannot be excluded. After the putative horizontal transfer, extensive rearrangements seem to have occurred in the bacterial CSMs, because there are limited sequence similarities except for the spacing of glycines in the bacterial CSMs. The limited sequence similarities also made phylogenetic analyses meaningless. Interestingly, the threonine-rich CSMs are very dissimilar in amino acid composition from human collagens and from the other bacterial CSMs. Instead, the threoninerich CSMs have their closest homologues in hypothermal vent worm cuticle collagens (14Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that several events of horizontal gene transfer of the genetic material encoding CSMs could have occurred during evolution. An alternative evolutionary explanation to the threonine-rich CSMs is that these have arisen de novo in bacteria, followed by horizontal spread to a few other bacterial species. The threonine-rich CSMs are highly repetitive and could have evolved from duplications of a short DNA segment. The presence of CSMs in bacteria and viruses underlines the importance of collagen as a structural motif in nature. This work also suggests that alternative means for triple-helix stabilization probably operate in bacteria and viruses, and future elucidation of the structure and function of bacterial and viral CSMs represents an interesting scientific task.

Under these conditions NO. inhibited mitochondrial respiration with an IC50 of 0.14 ± 0.01 μm in state 3 versus 0.31 ± 0.04 μm in state 4. Spectral data indicate that the higher sensitivity of state 3 respiration to NO. is due to greater control over respiration by an NO.-dependent spectral species in the respiratory chain in this state.

These results are discussed in the context of regulation of respiration by NO. in vivo and its implications for the control of vessel-parenchymal O2 gradients. The interaction of nitric oxide (NO.) with mitochondria is now emerging as one of the major pathways through which NO. can exert both physiological and pathological responses in a variety of cell types (1Brookes P. Levonen A. Shiva S. Sarti P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Brookes P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The most sensitive and widely studied target for NO. in mitochondria is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, cytochrome c oxidase (3Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M.

The binuclear O2 binding site of this enzyme (heme a 3/CuB) is reversibly inhibited by NO. (3Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.

This is controlled by O2 at two levels: by a competition between NO. and O2 at the enzyme's active site (9Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and by the partition of both NO. and O2 into mitochondrial membranes, which accelerates the direct reaction between these molecules (10Shiva S.

Three of the likely physiological roles for this interaction are: (a) regulation of mitochondrial H2O2 generation (2Brookes P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobo N. Schopfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem.

Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In pathological situations, perturbation of the NO.-cytochrome c oxidase pathway can occur, resulting in enhanced apoptosis or loss of control over respiration, as has been demonstrated in several tissues (15Loke K.E. Laycock S.K. Mital S. Wolin M.S. Bernstein R. Oz M. Addonizio L. Kaley G. Hintze T.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Beltran B. Mathur A. Duchen M.R.

A. 2001; 98: 11575-11580Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Critical to understanding the mechanisms regulating the NO.-cytochrome c oxidase pathway are fundamental biochemical questions that have not been addressed in detail. For example, different NO.-derived species bound to purified cytochrome c oxidase have been identified, including a putative heme a 3-nitrite complex (7Sarti P. Giuffre A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but it is unknown which of these complexes is formed in respiring mitochondria. In addition, the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO. appears greater while actively respiring (state 3 in the isolated preparation of the organelle) than while quiescent (state 4) (18Borutaite V. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This phenomenon represents an additional level of control over respiration. However, it is inherently linked to the regulation of tissue O2 levels, because mitochondrial O2 consumption is different in each respiratory state. Therefore it is essential to determine the control of state 3 and 4 respiration by NO. under conditions of O2 delivery similar to those in vivo.Mechanisms that could explain the greater sensitivity of state 3 respiration to NO. include: (a) the formation of different NO.-derived complexes in cytochrome c oxidase depending on electron flux (7Sarti P. Giuffre A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), (b) different amounts of such complexes formed in each state, or (c) different levels of control over respiration exhibited by cytochrome c oxidase in each state (18Borutaite V. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Groen A.K. Wanders R.J. Westerhoff H.V. Van der M.R. Tager J.M. J. Biol.

Cardiol. 2001; 33: 69-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) has received little attention in the context of NO. regulation of respiration. This is important to study because control is a changing parameter, with cytochrome c oxidase exhibiting more control over respiration in state 3 than in state 4 (19Groen A.K. Wanders R.J. Westerhoff H.V. Van der M.R. Tager J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2754-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells, it is likely that mitochondria can exist in a mixture of both respiratory states.In this investigation, several of the above issues were addressed by measuring the effects of NO. on mitochondrial respiration under conditions of controlled O2 delivery (23Cole R.P. Sukanek P.C. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition mitochondrial absorption spectra were acquired to provide information on the redox status of cytochromes and their NO.-derived complexes. The results indicate that mitochondrial state 3 respiration is indeed more sensitive to NO.-dependent inhibition than state 4 under controlled O2-delivery conditions. Analysis of the absorption spectra suggested a common NO.-dependent spectral intermediate is formed to a similar extent in both respiratory states. Interestingly, the data suggest that the inhibition of respiration due to population of this species is greater in state 3. In addition, NO.-dependent inhibition of respiration elevated the local [O2], as has been proposed to occur in vivo (14Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of a role for NO. as a physiological regulator of both mitochondrial respiration and local O2 gradients.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Animals—Sucrose for mitochondrial preparations was ultra-pure grade from USB (Cleveland, OH). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 250 g in weight, were purchased from Harlan and housed according to standard humane procedures on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Pure solutions of NO. gas were prepared by bubbling NaOH-scrubbed commercial NO. gas through deoxygenated (argon-purged) water in a gas-tight bulb (24Brookes P.S. Shiva S. Patel R.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Solutions were sealed under NO. atmosphere, stored in the dark, and aliquots withdrawn through a gas-tight septum into a gas-tight syringe. The concentration of NO. in these stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin conversion and was typically ∼1.5 mm. The NO. probe and NO. solutions were also calibrated using an acidified nitrite/potassium iodide method as per the manufacturer's instructions (WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL).Isolation of Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated by standard differential centrifugation techniques in buffer comprising sucrose (250 mm), Tris (10 mm), and EGTA (1 mm), pH 7 (24Brookes P.S. Shiva S. Patel R.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C, and mitochondria were stored on ice and used within 4 h of isolation. Mitochondria in this study had respiratory control ratio values of 4.7 ± 0.1 with glutamate + malate as substrates. Protein was determined using the Folin-phenol reagent against a standard curve constructed using bovine serum albumin (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Apparatus—Instrumentation was modified from Cole et al. (23Cole R.P. Sukanek P.C. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Optical spectra of mitochondrial suspensions were acquired with a Cary model 14 recording spectrophotometer equipped with a scattered transmission accessory (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). A dilute suspension of whole milk in the reference cuvette was used to attenuate the reference light beam and partially balance light scattering. The thermostatted cuvette, serving as the respirometry chamber, was a cylindrical quartz tube with a 16-mm light path, containing 5 ml stirred (460 rpm) sample with a 5-ml gas headspace. The floor of the chamber was a polarographic O2 sensor (Orbisphere 2110, Geneva, Switzerland) and a NO. sensor (WPI ISO-NO, Sarasota, FL) was positioned through the cuvette wall into the liquid phase. Composition of the gas phase was set by mixing dry air and O2-free N2 using a digital mass flow controller (Tylan, Carson, CA), humidifying the gas, and passing it through the cuvette headspace at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. All experiments were performed at 37 °C.Experimental Procedures—Five ml of respiration buffer comprising KCl (120 mm), sucrose (25 mm), HEPES (10 mm), EGTA (1 mm), KH2PO4 (1 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), glutamate (15 mm), and malate (7.5 mm) pH 7.3, was added to the sample cuvette. The apparatus was assembled and purged with 100% N2 to lower the liquid phase [O2] prior to mitochondrial addition. After addition of mitochondria (1 mg protein/ml), the gas flow mixture was re-adjusted to give a steady-state [O2] of ∼5 μm. For state 4 respiration (with glutamate plus malate alone, formally state 2), the mixture required 8% air, whereas state 3 respiration (with the additional presence of 2 mm ADP) required 39% air. In all cases, substrate and/or ADP concentrations were sufficient to maintain steady-state respiration for >25 min.The range of cellular O2 concentrations that are present in vivo have been investigated extensively, with precise values dependent upon the specific tissue, metabolic activity, and subcellular location. In this investigation, an initial value of ∼5 μm was chosen, being at the low range of values experienced by mitochondria (26Gnaiger E. Steinlechner-Maran R. Mendez G. Eberl T. Margreiter R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Gayeski T.E. Honig C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H522-H531PubMed Google Scholar).After a steady-state O2 concentration had been maintained for at least 3 min (indicating O2 consumption = O2 delivery), NO. was added in the form of a bolus injection (1 μm final), and the kinetics of solution [O2] and [NO.] were continuously monitored. Absorption spectra (500–400 nm, 1 nm resolution) were acquired at ∼75 s intervals during the NO. decay until [O2] returned to the same steady-state level as before NO. addition, indicating recovery of mitochondrial respiration. In the case of NO. it is technically difficult to establish a steady-state concentration of this inhibitor within the time-frame of this experiment, and thus it is necessary to capture data in the non-steady-state.Mass transfer coefficients (see Equation 1) were also determined for each experiment. In a separate series of experiments, absorption spectra were acquired in the range 380–640 nm, under half-saturating O2 (∼95 μm), for mitochondria respiring in state 3, in the presence of either antimycin A, cyanide, or NO..Calculation of Mitochondrial O 2 Consumption Rates—The underlying principle used to calculate steady-state O2 consumption rates in open flow respirometry is that the O2 consumed is proportional to the predicted liquid phase [O2] minus the measured liquid phase [O2]. Cole et al. (23Cole R.P. Sukanek P.C. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) expressed this algebraically as in Equation 1, Q=m(C*-C1)(Eq. 1) where Q is mitochondrial respiration rate, C* is the predicted liquid phase [O2], based on gas phase pO2 multiplied by the O2 solubility in the liquid phase (see next paragraph), C1 is the liquid phase [O2] determined from the O2 sensor, and m is the mass transfer coefficient (23Cole R.P. Sukanek P.C. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The term m is a kinetic constant defining the first order response of the liquid phase [O2] to a step change in gas phase [O2]. Experimentally, m is determined by recording the decay of liquid phase [O2] in response to switching the gas phase from 100 ml/min of air to 100 ml/min of pure N2. Typical values of m in this system were 0.0035 ± 0.0002 s–1.Average atmospheric pressure during the course of these experiments was 98.5 kPa. The concentration of O2 in air-saturated mitochondrial respiration buffer at 37 °C (C*) was thus calculated as 196.8 μm (28Forstner H. Gnaiger E. Gnaiger E. Forstner H. Polarographic Oxygen Sensors. Springer-Verlag, New York1983: 321-333Crossref Google Scholar). Throughout this paper [O2] is referred to in μm, calculated from the mV output of the polarographic O2 sensor, because this is the term most commonly used in mitochondrial physiology. Fig. 1 shows a typical set of traces for a mitochondrial respiration experiment. Following addition of mitochondria and respiratory substrates, a new steady-state value of C1 is established. Under these conditions, the rate of O2 consumption (Q) is m(C* – C1) from Equation 1.Following addition of NO., transient inhibition of respiration causes a rise in C1, and because the system is now no longer at steady-state Equation 1 does not apply. Thus, a new equation for the calculation of rate (Q) is required. From general engineering principles, the equation for the rate of change of an intermediate X (i.e. dX/dt) under all conditions (both steady- and non-steady-state) is as follows, dX/dt=A-B(Eq. 2) where A is the rate of delivery of X, and B is the rate of consumption of X. In the current experimental system, A equates to O2 delivery, i.e. m(C* – C1), and B equates to mitochondrial O2 consumption rate (Q). The intermediate X is the liquid phase O2 concentration (C1). Thus, substituting these terms into Equation 2 yields the following, dC1/dt=m(C*-C1)-Q(Eq. 3) and subsequent rearrangement of this equation yields a universal equation for the calculation of Q under all conditions (both steady- and non-steady-state). Q=m(C*-C1)-dC1/dt(Eq. 4) Experimentally, dC1/dt is the slope of the measured liquid phase [O2] trace (C1). Examining Equation 4, it becomes clear that in the steady-state (dC1/dt = 0), it simplifies to Equation 1. In fact, rather than considering Equation 4 as a derivative of Equation 1, it is somewhat beneficial to consider Equation 1 and the steady-state, as a subset of the conditions governed by the universal Equation 4.In adapting these terms for application to the non-steady-state, the rate-limiting step in obtaining a value for C1 is the response time of the liquid phase [O2] to changes in Q, and this is governed by m. Neither the time constant of the O2 sensor (6.5 ± 0.1 s, n = 6), nor the adjustment of mitochondria to a new respiration rate (∼100 ms (29Territo P.R. French S.A. Dunleavy M.C. Evans F.J. Balaban R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2586-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)) are limiting factors. Supporting this, it was observed that C1 changed almost instantaneously upon addition of NO. to respiring mitochondria (Fig. 1). Thus, the term dC1/dt accurately describes the rate of change of liquid phase [O2] in response to changes in mitochondrial respiration rate in the non-steady-state condition. Herein, rates are primarily expressed as a percentage of the rate prior to NO. addition.Correction of Rates for Limitation at Low [O 2 ]—During initial experiments, it was observed that mitochondrial respiration was O2-limited at the values of baseline [O2] chosen (∼5 μm). Addition of NO. and subsequent inhibition of respiration then caused a transient increase in C1, which could possibly give rise to variable O2 limitation throughout the course of the experiment. It was therefore decided to account for this phenomenon by determining the steady-state O2 consumption rate (Q) as a function of [O2] for this experimental system. A series of incubations were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” without NO., at different values of C*, allowing the system to reach steady-state. The rate Q was calculated using Equation 1. This data set was then used to correct the experimental data by multiplying each point on the absolute rate plots by a correction factor specific to the [O2] at that point. In practice, this was achieved by determining the [O2] for each point on Fig. 3A (by reference to the original data, Fig. 2B). Then, from Fig. 4A, the percentage rate was read from the y-axis at that particular value of [O2] and converted to a fractional value (50% = 0.5, 60% = 0.6 e.t.c.). The rate in Fig. 3 was then divided by this fractional value to yield a corrected rate. Thus, instantaneous rates at higher [O2] (less limiting) are subject to less correction (divided by a number closer to 1) than those at lower [O2], which are corrected by a greater amount (divided by a smaller number).Fig. 3Effects of NO . on respiration in state 3 versus state 4.

Also at each steady-state, absorption spectra were acquired to determine cytochrome redox state as a function of [O2] and in a separate experiment in the presence of sodium dithionite.Statistics—Unless otherwise indicated, all data are means of 4 determinations ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, with significance set at p < 0.05.RESULTSThis study represents the first use of an open-flow respirometry system to determine mitochondrial respiration rates under non-steady-state conditions. In the first series of experiments (Fig. 2) both O2 and NO. were monitored simultaneously in respiring mitochondria in states 3 and 4 (thick line and thin lines, respectively). Liquid phase oxygen (C1) was maintained at ∼5 μm prior to addition of a 1 μm bolus of NO. (shown by the arrow), which then caused an increase in C1 in both states. Following the decay of NO., C1 returned to a similar level as that seen before NO. addition, consistent with the reversal of respiratory inhibition. The increase in [O2] upon addition of NO. was more rapid and reached a higher level in state 3 than in state 4, primarily because the proportion of air in the gas mixture used to support state 3 (39%) is greater than for state 4 (8%). This means that, for example, even if Q were identical for both states after NO. addition, the dissolved O2 concentration will rise more rapidly for state 3 because the gas phase pO2 is nearly 5-fold higher. The kinetics of NO. decay (Fig. 2, C and D) were not significantly different between respiratory states.From a series of identical experiments, mitochondrial respiration rates (Q) were calculated and are shown in Fig. 3, both as a function of the time from NO. addition (panels A and B) and the corresponding NO. concentrations (panel C). The IC50 for NO. inhibition occurs at 0.24 ± 0.03 in state 3 and 0.39 ± 0.04 μm in state 4. In addition to the absolute values of Q (nmols O2/min/mg protein, panel A), rates are also expressed as a percentage of the initial (pre-NO.) rate (panel B).Interestingly, respiration rates increased to a value greater than the initial rate prior to addition of NO. at the later time points. We attribute this response to O2-limitation of mitochondrial respiration at low [O2]. Upon addition of NO., the inhibition of respiration results in an increase in [O2] (see Fig. 2, A and B). At later time points when most of the NO. has decayed, [O2] is still higher than the initial level of 5 μm. Thus the observed rate of respiration is greater than the value seen prior to NO. addition. Eventually, as [O2] returns to baseline levels, the rate recovers to the initial value, because O2 is once again limiting. The increase in Q above 100% is greater in state 3, because the increase in [O2] is greater here than in state 4 (see Fig. 2).As described under “Materials and Methods,” to correct for this phenomenon, mitochondria respiring in state 3 were incubated in the absence of NO. at different values of C*, allowing the system to reach steady-state. The value of C1 was then recorded, and the rate Q was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the maximal rate at non-limiting [O2] (120 μm). These data are shown in Fig. 4A and demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration is O2 limited in this experimental system at <20 μm O2 (p50 ∼2.5 μm).Absorption spectra were also acquired in this experiment, and difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum at 120 μm O2 from those obtained at lower values of [O2]. The delta absorbance for the peak at 445 nm was then expressed as a percentage of the fully reduced spectrum obtained in the presence of sodium dithionite (Fig. 4B). This represents the fractional reduction of cytochromes aa 3 in cytochrome c oxidase. Consistent with inhibition of mitochondrial respiration at low [O2], these data indicate that the respiratory chain is more reduced as [O2] falls. This is in contrast to a previous criticism of open-flow respirometry, in which a mis-match between respiration rates and cytochrome redox status was reported (26Gnaiger E. Steinlechner-Maran R. Mendez G. Eberl T. Margreiter R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Having quantified the O2 saturation kinetics in this system (Fig. 4), it is thus possible to correct the respiration rates determined in Fig. 3, taking into account the variable [O2] that occurs during transient NO. inhibition. This analysis is shown in Fig. 5, and results in elimination of the increase in respiration rate above initial values, during recovery from NO. inhibition. Also NO. dose-response curve (Fig. 5C) becomes left-shifted, with the IC50 for inhibition of respiration being 0.14 ± 0.01 and 0.31 ± 0.04 μm NO. in states 3 and 4, respectively. Fig. 5A shows absolute values of Q, demonstrating the magnitude to which this data manipulation has modified these rates (cf. Fig. 3A).Fig. 5NO . inhibition of state 3 and state 4 respiration, correcting for O 2 limitation. Data from Fig. 3 were re-scaled according to the O2·¯ limitation data shown in Fig. 4A (see “Materials and Methods”). Briefly, for each data point the value of [O2] (C1) was measured, and the corresponding degree of O2-limitation was extrapolated from Fig. 4A and as a correction factor to calculate a new value for Q.

https://openalex.org/W2136446592,"We report a new member of the Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) superfamily of receptors, SAMP14, which is retained on the inner acrosomal membrane of the human spermatozoan following the acrosome reaction and may play a role in fertilization. The SAMP14 sequence predicted a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein with a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus, and a putative transamidase cleavage site in the proprotein. Attachment of SAMP14 to the membrane by a lipid anchor was confirmed by its sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. SAMP14 has a single functional domain similar to the Ly-6 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor superfamily of proteins, and the gene mapped to 19q13.33, near the PLAUR locus for uPAR at 19q13.2. Northern and dot blotting showed that SAMP14 expression was testis-specific. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy with antisera to purified recombinant SAMP14 localized the protein to outer and inner acrosomal membranes as well as the acrosomal matrix of ejaculated human sperm. Acrosome-reacted sperm demonstrated SAMP14 immunofluorescence, indicating its retention on the inner acrosomal membrane following the acrosome reaction. However, SAMP14 localized to the entire sperm when unwashed swim-up sperm from the ejaculate were stained, indicating that some SAMP14 is loosely associated with the plasma membrane. Antibodies against recombinant SAMP14 inhibited both the binding and the fusion of human sperm to zona free hamster eggs, suggesting that SAMP14 may have a role in sperm-egg interaction.

SAMP14 represents a GPI-anchored putative receptor in the Ly-6/uPAR family that is exposed on the inner acrosomal membrane after the acrosome reaction. Members of the Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; EST, expressed sequence tag; PIPLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; aa, amino acid(s); recSAMP14, recombinant SAMP14; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide. family possess one or several repeats of a 100-amino acid Ly-6/uPAR domain that is defined by conservation of distinct disulfide bonds between 8 or 10 cysteine residues (1Williams A.F. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The family can be divided into two subfamilies. One comprises GPI-anchored glycoprotein receptors with 10 cysteine residues. Members of this subfamily include uPAR, CD59, the Ly-6 family, thymocyte B cell antigen, and prostate stem cell antigen. Among these proteins, uPAR contains three tandem copies of the Ly-6/uPAR domain, whereas the others contain a single domain (2Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second subfamily contains snake and frog cytotoxins, principally three-finger neurotoxins. Its members lack the GPI-anchoring signal sequence and possess only eight cysteines. The Ly-6/uPAR receptors mediate several physiological functions including cellular activation, macrophage migration, trophoblast implantation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion (3Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Gumley T.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Sandrin M.S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 277-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During mammalian fertilization, the acrosomal and plasma membranes of the sperm interact with the egg vestments. Sperm surface molecules on the plasma membrane are involved in the recognition of the zona pellucida protein (ZP3) during the early process of sperm egg interaction (primary binding) (5Wassarman P.M. Litscher E.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1995; 30: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following sperm binding to the egg the acrosomal membranes are involved in a critical cascade of events that includes the following: 1) the acrosome reaction, in which the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the plasma membrane; 2) secondary binding of the inner acrosomal membrane to the zona pellucida; and 3) tertiary binding of the equatorial segment and subsequent fusion to the vitelline membrane. After the acrosome reaction, the inner acrosomal membrane becomes the limiting membrane on the external surface of the anterior principal acrosomal segment, whereas the plasma membrane remains continuous with the outer acrosomal membrane at the anterior tip of the equatorial segment (6Toshimori K. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 293: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The acrosome contains many enzymes including proteases, such as acrosin (7Klemm U. Muller-Esteri W. Engel W. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), esterases, acid phosphatases, glycohydrolases, and aryl sulfatases. Enzymes released from the acrosome are believed to play an important role in digesting the zona and paving the way for penetration of the egg vestments by the sperm (8De Duve. C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the components of the acrosomal membranes and matrix is essential to understanding the biology of acrosomal functions including the fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane with the plasma membrane during the acrosome reaction, the interaction of the inner acrosomal membrane with zona pellucida during penetration of the zona (secondary binding) and tertiary egg binding and fusion. Many details of sperm capacitation, sperm-egg interaction, and the roles of constituent proteins of the acrosome in these events are still unknown. Definition of the molecular constituents of the acrosomal matrix and acrosomal membranes is clearly of importance to understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate induction of the acrosome reaction and sperm-egg interactions. Molecules identified as key players in these events are candidates for targeting by rational drug design or for inclusion in a sperm-based contraceptive vaccine. A major step toward identification of novel sperm molecules that may be crucial players in the molecular events leading to fertilization was initiated by Naaby-Hansen et al. (9Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) during a comprehensive analysis of human sperm proteins utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to create a computerized data base (sperm protein encyclopedia). However, membrane molecules represent only a small subset of proteins in total cellular extracts, and specialized methods are required for their enrichment, isolation, and characterization. To increase the likelihood of identifying sperm membrane molecules that may be involved in the acrosome reaction and/or sperm-egg interaction, we adopted the strategy of Triton X-114 phase partitioning prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and microsequencing by mass spectrometry (10Shetty J. Diekman A.B. Jayes F.C. Sherman N.E. Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 3053-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several spots in this previous study yielded novel peptide sequences. From a protein spot of pI 4.8 and molecular mass of 14 kDa that yielded novel peptide sequences by mass spectrometry, we have cloned and characterized a membrane-associated protein localized to the acrosome and, transiently, to the plasmalemma of human spermatozoa. This protein, named SAMP14 (sperm acrosomal membrane-associated protein 14) on the basis of its localization, appears to be a member of the Ly-6 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor family and play a role in sperm-egg binding and fusion. Semen Samples—All semen samples for this study were obtained under informed consent using forms approved by the University of Virginia Human Investigation committee. Animals—We used adult female Sprague-Dawley virgin rats of 6–9 weeks for immunization. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication 85-23). Surface Labeling, Phase Partitioning, and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Human semen samples were obtained from healthy donors as described earlier (11Shetty J. Naaby-Hansen S. Shibahara H. Bronson R. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Triton X-114 phase partitioning was employed to enrich potential membrane proteins from human spermatozoa before or after surface labeling of sperm with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Biotinylation of sperm was performed by vectorial labeling conditions described previously (10Shetty J. Diekman A.B. Jayes F.C. Sherman N.E. Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 3053-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To enrich for hydrophobic membrane proteins, Triton X-114 phase separation was performed as described by Bordier (12Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Shetty et al. (10Shetty J. Diekman A.B. Jayes F.C. Sherman N.E. Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C.

The second dimension SDS-PAGE was carried out in 0.15-cm-thick 16 × 16-cm slab gels using linear gradients (9–16% of acrylamide). Electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes was performed as described previously (11Shetty J. Naaby-Hansen S. Shibahara H. Bronson R. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Protein electrophoresis was performed on discontinuous polyacrylamide gels (4% stacking and 15% separating gel) on a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus or in 0.15-cm-thick 16 × 16-cm slab gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and processed as described previously (10Shetty J. Diekman A.B. Jayes F.C. Sherman N.E. Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 3053-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Oligonucleotides designed from an expressed sequence tag (EST) (AA778671) were manufactured by Invitrogen. The forward primer (5′-TACCATATTTCATGGACTCTAAAGTGCTAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTCCGGTCATCAACAAAGGCTGCCTG-3′) were utilized to generate a 475-bp probe. For subsequent PCRs, human testicular RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was reverse transcribed as described by Wolkowicz et al. (14Wolkowicz M.J. Naaby-Hansen S. Gamble A.R. Reddi P.P. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1-μl aliquots of the cDNA solution were amplified for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min, as specified by the manufacturer of the recombinant Thermophilus thermophilus polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequencing was performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Northern and Dot Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue northern membranes containing eight tissues and multitissue array RNA dot blots containing 76 tissues were purchased from Clontech. The PCR-amplified 372-bp cDNA corresponding to the entire open reading frame of SAMP14 was used as a probe for both analyses. Both multiple tissue Northern and multitissue array RNA dot blot analysis were done as described previously (15Hao Z. Wolkowicz M.J. Shetty J. Klotz K. Bolling L. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Coonrod S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Screening of λ cDNA Library—A λ DR2 cDNA library from human testis was purchased from Clontech and screened according to the user manual and as described earlier (15Hao Z. Wolkowicz M.J. Shetty J. Klotz K. Bolling L. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Coonrod S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A 475-bp cDNA fragment was PCR-amplified from the human testicular cDNA using two primers based on GenBank™ sequence AA778671 and used to probe filters. Probes were labeled with [32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate by the random primer method using an oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were washed once in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 22 °C; once in 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 42 °C; and once in 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50 °C, each for 20 min. After washing, filters were exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C for 24–48 h. Secondary screening was repeated as above to isolate single, pure phage plaques. Finally, the cDNA inserts were recovered from the phage particles as plasmids in the pDR2 vector by transforming the Escherichia coli, AM1 strain. Sequencing was performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility in both directions, and the nucleotide and amino acid data were analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group and SEQWeb (Madison, WI) program. Expression of Recombinant Protein and Production of Antiserum—To express SAMP14 in E. coli, a DNA fragment encoding amino acids (aa) 20–100 (lacking both the putative signal peptide and COOH-terminal transmembrane domain) of the open reading frame was amplified by PCR. The amplified fragment was fused in frame with His tag at the COOH terminus of pET 28b using the NcoI and XhoI sites. The plasmid was then transformed into the host strain E. coli BL21 DE3. The recombinant protein was affinity-purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column under denaturing conditions (16Mandal A. Naaby-Hansen S. Wolkowicz M.J. Klotz K. Shetty J. Retief J.D. Coonrod S.A. Kinter M. Sherman N. Cesar F. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was further purified on a model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad) to a single band, which was verified by SDS-PAGE and used for immunizations. Female virgin Lewis rats (three rats per each group), weighing 160–200 g, were injected with purified recombinant SAMP14 (recSAMP14) in PBS emulsified with equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant. Each rat received subcutaneously 100 μg of protein in 0.3 ml of PBS for the primary injection and each subsequent injection 3 and 6 weeks later. Antibody titers were checked by Western blot analysis 10 days after each injection, and the animals were sacrificed 10 days after the last boost. Specificity of the rat antisera for SAMP14 was tested by Western blotting against recSAMP14 as well as human sperm protein extracts. Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopic Analysis—Spermatozoa were purified by the swim-up method as described by Mandal et al. (16Mandal A. Naaby-Hansen S. Wolkowicz M.J. Klotz K. Shetty J.

Reprod. 1999; 61: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and were air-dried onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Following three washes with PBS for 10 min each, slides were blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 1 h with or without 0.1% saponin for permeabilization. The sperm were then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-SAMP14 primary antiserum or preimmune serum for 1 h at 22 °C, followed by washing in PBS three times for 10 min each at 22 °C. Following incubation with the secondary goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with TRITC at 1:100 dilution for 1 h, the slides were washed in PBS, incubated for 5 min with equilibration buffer followed by Slow Fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and mounted with coverslips. Images were captured with an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Processing of pooled sperm for electron microscopy was done as described earlier (15Hao Z. Wolkowicz M.J. Shetty J. Klotz K. Bolling L. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Coonrod S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To stain the sections, they were first blocked in undiluted normal goat serum for 15 min at 22 °C. They were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with either preimmune or rat anti-SAMP14 serum at a dilution of 1:50 containing 1% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, the sections were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of 5-nm gold-conjugated goat-anti-IgG (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ) for 1.5 h at 22 °C. The sections were washed in distilled water, stained with uranyl acetate, and observed with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. Acrosome Reaction and Double Staining with Concanavalin A—Human semen samples were obtained from healthy donors as described earlier (11Shetty J. Naaby-Hansen S. Shibahara H. Bronson R. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Live “swim-up” sperm were prepared as described by Mandal et al. (16Mandal A. Naaby-Hansen S. Wolkowicz M.J. Klotz K. Shetty J. Retief J.D. Coonrod S.A. Kinter M. Sherman N. Cesar F. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Capacitation was conducted in BWW medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing sodium bicarbonate and bovine serum albumin at 37 °C overnight (17Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation in capacitating medium, 0.25 m progesterone in absolute ethanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce the acrosome reaction. Aliquots were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The cells were washed three times with PBS and air-dried onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Slides were washed three times in PBS, overlaid with 2.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A (ConA; Sigma) in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in a humid chamber at room temperature. In cases where double staining was done, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ConA was mixed with the secondary goat-anti-rat IgG conjugated to TRITC and overlaid after the slide was incubated with anti-SAMP14 primary antibody and washed with PBS. The slides were washed with PBS, overlaid with equilibration buffer, and mounted with Slow-Fade reagent as described earlier. Hamster Egg Penetration Assay—Gamete incubations were carried out in microdrops under paraffin oil at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The swim-up sperm prepared as described above were washed twice by centrifugation (8 min at 600 × g) in 8-ml volumes of BWW medium containing 5 mg/ml human serum albumin (Sigma) in 15-ml centrifuge tubes. Sperm were capacitated at a concentration of 20 × 10 6 sperm/ml overnight in 250-μl drops of BWW containing 30 mg/ml human serum albumin. Hamster ova were obtained from Golden Syrian hamsters by supraovulation (18Johnson A. Bassham B. Lipshultz L.I. Lamb D.J. Keel B.A. Webster B.W. Handbook of the Laboratory Diagnosis and Treatment of Infertility. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 135-147Google Scholar). Cumulus cells were removed by treating eggs with 0.05% hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 3 min. The oocytes were then pooled and washed through 20-μl drops of medium using a pulled, heat-polished Pasteur pipette. Zona pellucidae were removed by treating eggs with 1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 s followed by five washes. The eggs were then randomly allotted into treatment groups. Rat serum IgG was isolated using Nab™ protein G spin chromatography kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was measured by reading the OD at 280 nm. Following overnight capacitation, 2 × 106 sperm/ml were treated for1hina20-μl drop containing 100, 50, 20, 10, or 5 μg/ml of IgG from rat anti-SAMP14 serum in BWW containing 30 mg/ml human serum albumin. One hundred micrograms/ml of preimmune IgG was used as a negative control and 100 μg/ml of SAMP32 (15Hao Z. Wolkowicz M.J. Shetty J. Klotz K. Bolling L. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Coonrod S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) IgG was used as a positive control. Following sperm/antibody incubation, zona free hamster oocytes were added directly to the sperm suspension, and the gametes were co-incubated for 3 h. Following gamete co-incubation, loosely bound sperm were removed from the oocytes by gentle pipetting. The eggs were then treated with 1 mm acridine orange in 3% Me2SO (Sigma) for 15 s to stain the chromatin and washed through three 20-μl microdrops. To quantitate binding, oocytes were placed between a microscope slide and an elevated coverslip, and the number of sperm bound per oocyte was recorded. The number of sperm fused per egg was scored by counting the number of acridine orange-stained decondensed sperm heads within each oocyte using fluorescent microscopy. The assay was repeated at least three times for each concentration of IgG used. Specific effect of the antibody was verified by preabsorbing the antibody with an excess amount of recombinant SAMP14. Experimental and control group averages were reported as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to identify differences in the mean numbers of bound or fused spermatozoa. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Treatment of Spermatozoa with PIPLC—Percoll-harvested sperm (200 × 106) were incubated with 1.0 unit/108 sperm/ml of PIPLC from Bacillus cereus (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or without enzyme for 20 min at 22 °C. At the end of the incubation time, sperm were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 min. To prevent proteolysis, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm EDTA were added to the supernatants, which were collected and dialyzed against distilled water at 4 °C overnight. The dialyzed solution was concentrated by lyophilization, and the proteins were reconstituted in Celis lysis reagent (19Celis J.E. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Leffers H. Honore B. Dejgaard K. Gesser B. Olsen E. Gromov P. Hoffmann H.J. Nielsen M. Celis A. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Ratz G.P. Nielsen H. Andersen A.H. Walbum E. Kjargaard I. Puype M. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J.

Phase Partitioning and Surface Labeling—Among several proteins that were selectively partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, a major protein spot of 14 kDa and pI 4.8 was identified on a silver-stained two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1A) and was determined to be reactive with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase following sperm surface labeling with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the spot was a hydrophobic protein and was accessible to cell surface biotinylation, characteristic features of a membrane protein. Microsequencing of the protein spot using mass spectrometry yielded two peptides, ATSCGLEEPVSYR and —XSDSMEC— (Fig. 1A). SAMP14 Encodes a Novel Protein Showing Similarity to Ly-6/uPAR Family of Proteins—Use of the peptide sequences described above to search the nonredundant protein data bases revealed no known gene, suggesting that this protein was novel. However, an exact match was found in the EST data base (entry AA778671). PCR was performed to amplify a hybridization probe from a testicular cDNA library using primers based on the EST sequences. After screening the λ DR2 human testis cDNA library, six clones were identified at the secondary screening stage. DNA sequencing of the largest clone (1-2) yielded a 475-bp cDNA, which contained the EST AA778671 sequence embedded within and a contiguous open reading frame encoding 124 amino acids (Fig. 2). The predicted molecular mass and pI of 13 kDa and 5.4, respectively, closely matched the molecular weight and pI of the excised spot. The peptide microsequence ATSCGLEEPVSYR obtained by mass spectrometry was present in the cloned protein. A comparison of the deduced sequence with the GenBank™ data base using BLAST and FASTA as well as Prosite and Prodom revealed that the predicted protein had the closest amino acid similarity to proteins from the Ly-6 and uPAR superfamily. Fig. 3 shows a multiple sequence alignment of SAMP14 and other Ly-6/uPAR superfamily members with highest homology to SAMP14. One of the unique features of these molecules is the presence of a cysteine-rich domain that is conserved among all of the members (see asterisks). The highly conserved motif Cys-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Asp-Leu-Cys-Asn, which is a signature of proteins belonging to this family, was located at the COOH terminus of many of these sequences, including SAMP14. Alignment of SAMP14 with three tandem Ly-6 domains of uPAR (uPAR-1, uPAR-2, and uPAR-3) showed that two residues (tyrosine and leucine) located in the uPAR-1 functional epitope involved in ligand binding (20Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 274: 37995-38003Google Scholar) are conserved in SAMP14, suggesting that SAMP14 may be closely related to uPAR.Fig. 3Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of SAMP14 and other members of the Ly-6/uPAR superfamily. Residues shaded with a gray background are identical in all sequences. The conserved cysteine residues are marked by asterisks. Numbers on the side refer to amino acid positions relative to the first residue. In the case of the urokinase receptor, uPAR, the three sequential Ly-6 domains have been placed in alignment and labeled UPAR1, -2, and -3. For SP10, the COOH-terminal region of the protein having a Ly-6 domain (30Palfree R.G.E. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is aligned. The residues in black form a part of the functional epitope involved in ligand binding in uPAR1 (20Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 274: 37995-38003Google Scholar). Note that these residues in addition to the adjoining amino acids are conserved in human SAMP14 (boxed). Accession numbers are gi5701858 (G6E_hum), gi21312278 (SAMP14_mouse), gi70151 (CD59_hum), gi 65003 (uPAR_hum), gi10720240 (prostate stem cell antigen; PSCA_human), and gi1042049 (SP-10_hum).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SAMP14 Is a Predicted Membrane Protein Putatively Anchored through a GPI Moiety—Running the algorithms provided in the Simple Modular Architecture Tool on the ExPASy server revealed several features: 1) a signal peptide cleavage site between aa 19 and 20; 2) a Ly-6/uPAR-like domain from aa 20 to 112; and 3) a transmembrane domain from aa 101 to 124 (Fig. 2). Based on the presence of a putative transamidase cleavage site following aa 97 in the COOH terminus of the protein, SAMP14 was predicted to be a GPI-anchored protein. In addition, putative threonine (aa 69, 83, and 88) and serine (aa 78) phosphorylation sites were identified. A scan against the protein profile data base including Prosite predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at aa 78–80 and 92–94. Expression of SAMP14 Is Testis-abundant if Not Testis-specific—Northern blot (Fig. 4A) and dot blot (Fig. 4B) hybridization were used to analyze the expression of SAMP14 mRNA in different human tissues.

We now report that ablation of PITPα function leads to aponecrotic spinocerebellar disease, hypoglycemia, and intestinal and hepatic steatosis in mice. The data indicate that hypoglycemia is in part associated with reduced proglucagon gene expression and glycogenolysis that result from pancreatic islet cell defects. The intestinal and hepatic steatosis results from the intracellular accumulation of neutral lipid and free fatty acid mass in these organs and suggests defective trafficking of triglycerides and diacylglycerols from the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that deranged intestinal and hepatic lipid metabolism and defective proglucagon gene expression contribute to hypoglycemia in PITPα– / – mice, and that hypoglycemia is a significant contributing factor in the onset of spinocerebellar disease. Taken together, the data suggest an unanticipated role for PITPα in with glucose homeostasis and in mammalian endoplasmic reticulum functions that interface with transport of specific luminal lipid cargoes.

By contrast, the physiological functions for mammalian PITPs, which are structurally unrelated to yeast PITPs (7Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M.

Mammals express at least three soluble PITPs: PITPα, PITPβ, and rdgBβ (9Dickeson S.K. Lim C.N. Schuyler G.T. Dalton T.P. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol.

PITPα and PITPβ share 77% primary sequence identity, are encoded by distinct genes, and exhibit biochemical differences. Yet both PITPα and PITPβ (and even yeast PITPs) function as soluble factors that stimulate various reconstitutions of PIP-dependent functions in permeabilized mammalian cells. These functions include regulated and constitutive membrane trafficking and phospholipase C-dependent signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors (12Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 13Ohashi M. de Vries K.J. Frank R. Snoek G. Bankaitis V. Wirtz K. Huttner W.B.

Given the lack of PITP specificity in these assays, it remains unclear how faithful such reconstitutions are in reporting physiological functions for mammalian PITPs. Genetic studies are providing initial clues regarding PITP function in metazoans. An inherited form of light-enhanced retinal degeneration in Drosophila results from inactivation of a membrane-bound PITP (15Milligan S.C. Alb Jr., J.G. Elagina R.B. Bankaitis V.A. Hyde D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In mice, reduction of PITPα to 18% of wild-type levels is the basis for the vibrator neurodegenerative disorder (16Hamilton B.A. Smith D.J. Mueller K.L. Kerrebrock A.W. Bronson R.T. van Berkel V.

Lauderdale V. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Gene ablation approaches suggest PITPβ plays an essential housekeeping function, whereas PITPα is nonessential for ES cell viability and is not a quantitatively significant factor in membrane trafficking, PIP metabolism, or growth factor signaling in ES cells (17Alb Jr., J.G. Phillips S.E. Rostand K. Cotlin L. Pinxteren J. Manning T. Guo S. York J.D. Sontheimer H. Collawn J.F. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 739-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the consequences associated with ablation of PITPα function in the mouse. We find that PITPα, although dispensable for prenatal development, is required for neonatal survival. PITPα– / – neonates suffer from a severe spinocerebellar neurodegenerative disease and exhibit defects in dietary fat and α-tocopherol transport across the small intestine. This intestinal steatosis in some respects resembles CRD, a human disorder of unknown molecular etiology (18Levy E. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar, 19Aguglia U. Annesi G. Pasquinelli G. Spadafora P. Gambarella A. Annesi F. Pasqua A.A. Cavalcanti F. Crescibene L. Bagala A. Bono F. Oliveri R.L. Valentino P. Zappia M. Quattrone A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Liver steatosis is also prominent in the mutant mice, suggesting the possibility that PITPα nullizygosity also compromises lipoprotein assembly and/or neutral lipid secretion in hepatocytes. Finally, PITPα– / – mice are severely hypoglycemic. Our results suggest a novel and unanticipated role for PITPα in regulating cargo-specific lipid transport from the enterocyte and hepatocyte ER, endocrine pancreas function, and glycogen metabolism. Generation and Genotyping of PITPα– / – Mice—AB1-derived +/PITPαΔ1::neo* ES cells have been described previously (17Alb Jr., J.G. Phillips S.E. Rostand K. Cotlin L. Pinxteren J. Manning T. Guo S. York J.D. Sontheimer H. Collawn J.F. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 739-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The +/PITPα::neo/puro ES cells corresponded to the OST 1152 line (Lexicon Genetics OmniBank™ library (20Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar)). Mice were generated by injection of ES cells into C57BL/6 blastocysts, implantation of blastocysts into pseudopregnant foster mothers, and identification of male chimeric mice competent for germ line transmission of each allele. Genotypes for PITPαΔ1::neo* mice (JG line) were determined by using a three-primer PCR assay. We employed a primer specific for the homozygous PITPα+ / + genotype (AB-2; 5′-GCGAGGCATCACTCTTCCCCTC-3′), the heterozygous PITPα– / + genotype (AB-1B; 5′-CACCATCCCCCACGGTGACTG-3′), and the PITPα– / – genotype (PG-1; 5′-GAATGTGTGCGAGGCCAGAGG-3′) in a 33-cycle reaction (53 °C annealing temperature). Genotypes for PITPα::neo/puro mice (L1 line) were determined in two steps. First, a two primer assay that monitored Neo distinguishes PITPα+ / + from PITPα– / + and PITPα– / – mice. Primers GE-UP (5′-GGGCGCCCGGTTCTTT TTGTGA-3′) and GE-DO (5′-TTGGTGGTCGAATGGGCAGGTAGC-3′) were used in a 28-cycle reaction (60 °C annealing temperature). To distinguish PITPα– / + from PITPα– / – L1 mice, we resorted to immunoblot analyses of mouse brain using PITPα-specific serum (17Alb Jr., J.G. Phillips S.E. Rostand K. Cotlin L. Pinxteren J. Manning T. Guo S. York J.D. Sontheimer H. Collawn J.F. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 739-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Serum Analyses—Blood was collected from mice immediately after heart puncture and clotted, and serum was clarified by centrifugation. Serum glucose was determined by using either the Trinder assay (Sigma) or was measured by Antech Diagnostics (Farmingdale, NY). Insulin and β-hydroxybutyrate were determined using the Immunoassay System (Crystal Chem Inc.) and the β-hydroxybutyrate assay kit (Sigma), respectively. All other serum analyses were performed by Antech Diagnostics (Farmingdale, NY). Carcass Analyses—Carcass analyses were as described previously (21Nagy T.R. Gower B.A. Stetson M.H. Can. J. Zool. 1994; 72: 1726-1734Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gastrointestinal tracts were removed (stomach, small and large intestine, and cecum) and carcasses weighed. Body water content of eviscerated carcasses was determined by drying to constant weight in a 60 °C oven and measuring differences between the pre- and post-drying carcass mass. Dried carcasses were minced, ground to a homogeneous mixture, and extracted with petroleum ether in a Soxhlet apparatus to determine fat mass and fat-free dry mass. Fat-free dry mass was burned overnight at 600 °C(>8 h) to determine eviscerated carcass ash. Histological Analysis—Mice were anesthetized with 1.25% Avertin and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, 4% paraformaldehyde. Duodenum, ileum, cerebellum, pancreas, and spinal cord were harvested, flushed with fixative (duodenum and ileum only), dissected, and infused with fixative for 24 h. Samples were mounted in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick sections were stained and mounted. These sections were rehydrated by serial transfer from xylene to 50% EtOH, stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and mounted in Permount (Fisher). Where osmium staining was employed, duodenal and liver sections were stained in 5% potassium dichromate, 2% osmium tetroxide for 8 h prior to paraffin embedding (22Luna L. Manual of Histological Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Armed Forces Institute of Pathlogy, Washington, DC1968: 143-145Google Scholar) and counterstained with toluidine blue O. Whole brains were extracted from mice perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed for several days in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in paraffin. Brains were sliced in half along the sagittal plane; each half was embedded in paraffin; and 5- or 8-μm-thick slices were mounted onto treated slides. Sections were rehydrated to 50% EtOH. For visualization of Purkinje cells, slices were incubated with goat anti-calbindin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After incubation in 2% osmium fumes for 10 min, slices were counterstained with toluidine blue O. For Oil Red O staining, livers were extracted from mice perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at –20 °C. Frozen livers were mounted, sectioned (8 μm), fixed to a histological slide, and placed in absolute propylene glycol (2 min). Slides were moved into Oil Red O solution (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, WI, catalog number 12722) for 1 h, differentiated in 85% propylene glycol (1 min), rinsed 2× in distilled water, counterstained with hematoxylin (10 s), and mounted in glycerin. Electron Microscopy—Mice were perfused with 4% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Biopsies from intestine, liver, and spinal cord were post-fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated with acetone, embedded in epoxy (23Mascorro J.A. Kirby G.S. Proceedings of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Electron Microscopy Society of America. 1986; : 222-223Crossref Google Scholar), sectioned (65 nm-thick), and stained with 4% uranyl acetate and Sato's lead mixture (24Sato T. J. Electron Microsc. 1968; 17: 158-159PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were viewed at 80 kV in a Phillips Tecnai 12 microscope (FEI Co., Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and imaged with a Gatan MultiScan model 794 digital camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Epoxy-embedded samples were sectioned for histological analysis (2-μm thickness) and stained with 1% toluidine blue O in 1% sodium borate. Digital images were collected with a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI), using Plan Fluor Nikon objectives mounted in a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). Morphometric analysis of spinal cord sections was carried out with Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). α-Tocopherol Analyses—Brain α-tocopherol was extracted as described (25Jishage K. Arita M. Igarashi K. Iwata T. Watanabe M. Ogawa M. Ueda O. Kamada N. Inoue K. Arai H. Suzuki H. J. Biol.

The high pressure liquid chromatography system consisted of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model LC200 gradient pump, an AS 200 Autosampler, and an LC 295 programmable UV-visible light detector set at 292 nm. Liver Glycogen Analysis—Quantification of liver glycogen was by the method of Passonneau and Lauderdale (26Passonneau J. Lauderdale V. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Glycogen was extracted from acidified liver homogenates and hydrolyzed to glucose with amyloglucosidase (Sigma). Glucose was determined by a glucose oxidase-coupled Trinder assay (Sigma). Adenylate Nucleotide Analysis—ATP and ATP/ADP ratios were measured using the ApoGlow™ kit (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications; Rockville, MD). Samples (0.5 mg tissue) were collected and rapidly frozen. Tissues were thawed and homogenized in the presence of a nucleotide-releasing mixture supplied by the manufacturer. Acid-extracted ATP was assayed with a luciferase-based system with picomolar sensitivity. ADP was converted to ATP and measured after a 5-min incubation at 22 °C. Pancreatic Histology—Whole pancreas from mice perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde was embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned (thickness = 5 μm). Islet numbers were assessed by sequential observation of hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections. Care was exercised to separate islets from patches of connecting ducts and intervening connective tissue, and not to re-score the same islet in successive sections. Islet-like, encapsulated structures larger than 100 μm that were detected in at least three consecutive sections were scored as islets. The total pancreatic area studied was similar in all sections. PITPα– / – Mice Develop to Term—Ablation of PITPα function in the mouse was achieved using two independent null alleles. First, a homologous recombination vector was constructed where exons 8–10 of the PITPα gene are replaced with a neo cassette (Fig. 1A). This mutation (PITPαΔ::neo*) deletes PITPα residues 162–257, a region critical for PITPα function (17Alb Jr., J.G. Phillips S.E. Rostand K. Cotlin L. Pinxteren J. Manning T. Guo S. York J.D. Sontheimer H. Collawn J.F. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 739-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Second, survey of the Lexicon Genetics OmniBank™ gene trap library (see “Experimental Procedures”) identified an insertion mutation in the PITPα structural gene (PITPα::neo/puro). This allele is genetically similar (although not identical) to PITPαΔ::neo* as it also truncates PITPα after residue 162 (Fig. 1B). Mice were derived from each targeted ES cell line. PITPα– / + offspring are phenotypically normal and fertile, and mice homozygous for either of these two mutations exhibit indistinguishable phenotypes. The phenotypic data presented below were obtained from both PITPαΔ1::neo* and PITPα::neo/puro homozygous animals. Intercrosses with heterozygous mice carrying either PITPαΔ1::neo* or the PITPα::neo/puro allele yielded genotypes consistent with a fully penetrant autosomal recessive mutation. From a dedicated pool of 408 live births, 89 PITPα– / – progeny were recovered (Fig. 1C). The genotypic distribution of 106 PITPα+ / +, 213 PITPα– / +, 89 PITPα– / – corresponds to a 1.000:2.009:0.840 ratio that approximates closely the 1:2:1 ratio predicted by Mendel's rules. Correct gene targeting in the progeny was verified by PCR genotyping and immunoblotting of brain extracts with a specific PITPα antiserum (Fig. 1D). Antibodies directed against the PITPα N terminus failed to detect a truncation product in mice homozygous for PITPαΔ1::neo* or PITPα::neo/puro, suggesting that both alleles represent null mutations. Finally, we find that relative PITPβ levels are unchanged in PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / – brain (Fig. 1D), indicating that PITPα– / – mice do not activate compensatory processes that increase PITPβ expression. Neonatal Mortality of PITPα– / – Mice—PITPα– / – mice failed to thrive and died at a very young age. In a sample pool of 57 PITPα– / – mice, 40% died within 48 h after birth (Fig. 2A). These early P0 and P1 deaths were not characterized by obvious external abnormalities. Moreover, postmortem analyses revealed that the stomachs of the expired PITPα– / – mice contained copious quantities of milk, indicating that mutant animals had nursed. Of the PITPα– / – progeny that survived past P1, a steady incidence of mortality was observed between P2 and P11. Almost all mice expired by P11, and only one PITPα– / – mouse lived to P14 (Fig. 2A). PITPα– / – progeny that survived past P1 were initially indistinguishable from PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / + littermates in size, external morphology, and behavior. By P4, however, two phenotypes rapidly asserted themselves. First, most PITPα– / – mice were moribund and exhibited little spontaneous movement. These mice did respond to touch, however. By contrast, ∼10% of the PITPα– / – mice experienced spontaneous seizures. All PITPα– / – mice were severely ataxic and were generally incapable of maintaining themselves upright. We also observed coarse action tremors upon limb extension in PITPα– / – mice. Second, these mutant mice failed to thrive. Although the PITPα– / – mice gained body mass, they did so slowly (Fig. 2B). By P10, surviving PITPα– / – mice were 2.5-fold less massive than their PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / + littermates (Fig. 2C). PITPα– / – Mice Suckle Effectively—Several lines of evidence indicate that the failure of PITPα– / – mice to thrive is not the simple consequence of neurological defects. We observed PITPα– / – mice in the act of suckling, and postmortem analyses indicated both copious quantities of milk in stomachs of these mice (Fig. 2D) and substantial amounts of digested matter throughout the PITPα– / – intestinal tract (not shown). The suckling competence of PITPα– / – mice notwithstanding, the mutant animals exhibited pathologically low body fat levels. This reduction is obvious when the subcutaneous fat pads of PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / – mice are compared. Whereas PITPα+ / + controls exhibit large axillary and inguinal fat pads, these structures are absent from PITPα– / – animals (Fig. 2D). Chemical analyses of eviscerated carcasses quantified these differences; PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / – mice exhibited total body fat contents of 15.0 ± 1.1 and 4.0 ± 0.5% of total body mass, respectively (Fig. 2E). Significantly, the relative water contents of PITPα+ / + and PITPα– / – carcasses are similar (Fig. 2E), indicating that PITPα– / – mice are not dehydrated, as would be expected if there were substantial suckling defects. The relative fat-free dry mass contents and carcass bone ash contents are also comparable (Fig. 2E). Consistent with those measurements, we find that organ/total body mass ratios in PITPα– / – mice for brain, liver, and other major organs are also proportional to total body mass (not shown). Elevated Apoptosis and Purkinje Cell Defects in PITPα– / – Cerebellum—Nissl staining does not reveal obvious defects in development or morphology of PITPα– / – cerebrum, thalamus, hippocampus, or cerebellum. Normal cellularity was observed in all regions examined (data not shown). However, PITPα insufficiencies evoked functional defects in the cerebellum. These defects were apparent at several levels. Whereas TUNEL staining showed a sparse and random distribution of apoptotic foci in wild-type brain, apoptosis was more prevalent throughout PITPα– / – cerebellum. This is particularly evident in the external granule layer of mutant cerebellum (Fig. 3A). Second, we find Purkinje cell defects in PITPα– / – animals. Purkinje cells normally align themselves into a sharply defined monolayer that lies between the molecular and external granular layers of the cerebellum (Fig. 3B). These cells elaborate well developed apical dendritic stalks which arborize into luxurious branches that penetrate into the molecular layer of the cerebellum. PITPα– / – Purkinje cells, while retaining normal flask-shaped cell body morphologies, exhibit either abbreviated apical dendritic stalks or no obvious stalks at all (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the dendritic branches emanating from the abbreviated apical stalks are less arborized than those of PITPα+ / + Purkinje cells. We also observed cases where these cells exhibit defects in spatial alignment, reside off of the defined layer, or are otherwise misoriented. Degenerative Disease in PITPα– / – Cerebellum—PITPα– / – cerebellum suffered major degenerative insult as judged by the extent of reactive gliosis. Wild-type cerebellum shows low levels of GFAP, a specific marker for activated astrocytes (Fig. 3C). By contrast, PITPα– / – cerebellum exhibits a dramatic staining for GFAP, and reactive gliosis is especially prominent in the white matter trunk of this organ (Fig. 3C). Even in these relatively less affected areas, GFAP immunohistochemistry suggests some 10% of the cells represent activated astrocytes that are frequently seen to be enveloping neuron cell bodies (Fig. 3D). Reactive gliosis is not observed throughout the mutant brain. Whereas PITPα– / – cerebellum and brain stem are heavily infiltrated with activated glial cells, and the subthalamic region is also involved, significant gliosis is not observed in the neocortex, striatum, hippocampal formation, and other forebrain regions (not shown). Finally, electron microscopy reveals ER defects in cerebellar neurons of PITPα– / – mice. These defects manifest themselves as significant vacuolations of the smooth ER region, even though adjacent regions of rough ER retain normal morphology (not shown). Such vacuolations are not observed in smooth ER of PITPα+ / + cerebellar neurons. Neurodegeneration and Inflammation in PITPα– / – Spinal Cord—We consistently observed WM deficits in PITPα– / – cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord. Whereas ventral WM is well developed in PITPα+ / + cervical spinal cord, the corresponding WM regions are thin and sparse in PITPα– / – animals (Fig. 4A). WM to GM area ratios in cervical spinal cord are 0.45 ± 0.1 for PITPα+ / + and 0.32 ± 0.02 for PITPα– / – mice, respectively (p < 0.01; n = 6). In addition to the WM deficits, evidence of inflammation pervades all regions of the PITPa – / – spinal cord. Toluidine blue O-staining reveals areas of abnormally heavy staining in the ventral horn where motor neuron cell bodies reside, suggesting cell damage in these areas (Fig. 4A). Moreover, whereas the WM/GM interface of PITPα+ / + cervical spinal cord presents normal vascular structures, neurons, and accessory cells, corresponding regions of the PITPα– / – spinal cord exhibit densely stained cells and damaged neurons (Fig. 4B). These pathologies encompass a spectrum of cell death events. These range from occasional apoptotic neurons (condensed nuclei, fragmented cytoplasm; not shown) to large numbers of neurons undergoing aponecrotic processes (Fig. 4B). Aponecrosis is a form of cell death associated with reductions in cellular ATP and increases in ADP levels (27Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N. Tempestini A. Orlandini G.E. Capaccioli S. Zecchi Orlandini S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Analyses from six PITPα– / – mice indicate that 18 ± 1% of the total motor neuron cell bodies in the ventral horn exhibit properties of aponecrosis. These include pericytoplasmic vacuolation, reduced cytoplasmic contents, and cytoplasmic proliferation of irregular electron-translucent vesicles (Fig. 4B). We did not observe aponecrotic motor neurons in the ventral horn of PITPα+ / + spinal cord. Extensive vacuolation and membrane blebbing is prevalent in cells that line the vasculature of PITPα– / – spinal cord (not shown). Axons surrounding capillaries and small vessels in the GM are enlarged and often damaged. This is unlikely to represent a perfusion artifact, as this phenotype was not recorded in any of the spinal cord sections analyzed from 14 PITPα+ / + mice. Toluidine blue O-staining reveals the presence of cells containing an abundance of purple intracellular granules in the perivascular matrix (Fig. 4C, left panel). This obvious purple metachromasia is diagnostic of inflammatory mast cells (29Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Prog. Allergy. 1984; 34: 1-141PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bebo Jr., B.F. Yong T. Orr E.L. Linthicum D.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we find extratissular macrophages in perivascular tissue or even in the vessels themselves (Fig. 4C, right panel), suggesting the blood/brain barrier of PITPα– / – mice is itself compromised. Finally, spinocerebellar injury in PITPα– / – mice also includes processes that resemble those of other myelin-related central nervous system inflammatory disorders (31Pender M.P. Stanley G.P. Yoong G. Nguyen K.B. Acta Neuropathol. 1990; 80: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). First, macroscopic swelling in the dorsal spinal columns is apparent. The non-neuronal area (neuropil) comprises 54 ± 3% in PITPα+ / + spinal cord (n = 6; p = 0.01) and 70 ± 6% of total area in PITPα– / – spinal cord, respectively. Degenerative processes in neuropil, typified by swollen axons lacking organelles and cytoskeletal filaments, are also obvious (not shown). Second, demyelination is scored in both WM and GM areas of PITPα– / – mice and especially in the dorsal spinal columns. Supporting cells that may be remodeling myelin are also observed (Fig. 4D). The fragility of the mutant central nervous system notwithstanding, a variety of PITPα– / – neurons are amenable to primary culture. Cultured cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and spinal cord dorsal root ganglion neurons from PITPα– / – mice are not more fragile than their PITPα+ / + counterparts in any obvious way. Indeed, titration of nerve growth factor concentrations from 50 to 5 ng/ml revealed no differences in the thresholds of trophic factor required to sustain viability of PITPα– / – versus PITPα+ / + dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture (not shown). PITPα– / – cerebellar granule cells are similarly robust. These data suggest a significant cause of neuronal injury in PITPα– / – mice is a hostile physiological environment, rather than some overriding cell autonomous defect. Lipid Dysregulation in PITPα– / – Enterocytes—Failure of PITPα– / – mice to thrive suggests a malabsorption disorder. Histolog"
https://openalex.org/W2011659866,"Specific docking interactions between MAPKs and their activating MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) are crucial for efficient and accurate signal transmission. Here, we report the identification of a MAPK-docking site, or “D-site,” in the N terminus of human MKK4/JNKK1. This docking site conforms to the consensus sequence for known D-sites in other MKKs and contains the first of the two cleavage sites for anthrax lethal factor protease that have been found in the N terminus of MKK4. This docking site was both necessary and sufficient for the high affinity binding of the MAPKs JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, p38α, and p38β to MKK4. Mutations that altered conserved residues in this docking site reduced JNK/p38 binding. In addition, a peptide version of this docking site, as well as a peptide version of the JNK-binding site of the JIP-1 scaffold protein, inhibited both MKK4/JNK binding and MKK4-mediated phosphorylation of JNK1. These same peptides also inhibited JNK2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that transcription factors, MKK4, and the JIP scaffold compete for docking to JNK. Finally, the selectivity of the MKK4, MEK1, and MEK2 D-sites for JNK versus ERK was quantified. The MEK1 and MEK2 D-sites displayed a strong selectivity for their cognate MAPK (ERK2) versus a non-cognate MAPK (JNK). In contrast, the MKK4 D-site exhibited only limited selectivity for JNK versus ERK.

In contrast, the MKK4 D-site exhibited only limited selectivity for JNK versus ERK. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MKK, MAPK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; JNKK, JNK kinase; SEK, SAPK/ERK kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH3, Src homology-3; MKP, MAPK phosphatase. are activated by a wide variety of stimuli and contribute to the regulation of diverse responses, often in a cell context-dependent manner. Their ubiquity and versatility raise the issue of how they achieve specific coupling of signal to cellular response (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Central to these cascades is a MAPK kinase (MKK) that phosphorylates and thereby activates the MAPK. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate multiple targets, including transcription factors, other kinases, and other enzymes. In mammals, there are three major MAPK pathways (the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 modules) that each contain two to four different MAPKs regulated by two different MKKs (2Garrington T. Johnson G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). (Some MAPKs are also called ERKs, and some MKKs are also called MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs).) In general, the MKKs in one pathway do not phosphorylate MAPKs in other pathways. How this selectivity is achieved is incompletely understood. The JNK pathway is activated primarily in response to cytokines and environmental stress and plays an important role in the regulation of stress-induced apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 3Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar, 4Davis R.J.

Dev. 2002; 12: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Key targets phosphorylated by JNK include components of the AP-1 transcription factor such as c-Jun and ATF2. Current thinking suggests that the JNK cascade and AP-1 can promote proliferation or differentiation and survival or death depending on the cell type, the nature and duration of the stimulus, and the activity of other signaling pathways (6Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar, 7Lin A. Bioessays. 2002; 25: 17-24Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The JNK cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer (8Kennedy N.J. Sluss H.K. Jones S.N. Bar-Sagi D. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J.

Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). There are three different JNK proteins (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) encoded by separate genes. Two protein kinases that activate JNK have been identified: MKK4 (also known as JNKK1 and SEK1) and MKK7/JNKK2. Although both MKK4 and MKK7 activate JNK, they are functionally distinct in several ways (4Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). First, although both kinases activate JNK by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr, MKK4 prefers Tyr, and MKK7 prefers Thr (15Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, MKK4 is activated primarily by environmental stress, and MKK7 by cytokines. Third, MKK4 (but not MKK7) can also activate the p38 MAPK. Finally, MKK4 (but not yet MKK7) is a candidate tumor/metastasis suppressor, as inactivating mutations in the MKK4 gene (MAP2K4) have been found in ∼5% of a wide variety of tumor types (16Yoshida B.A. Dubauskas Z.

As in other MAPK pathways, the formation of stable complexes between MKKs and MAPKs is thought to contribute to signal transmission and specificity in the JNK pathway (19Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y.

Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and Elk-1 (32Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) as well as in other transcription factors, phosphatases, scaffolds, other kinases, and other proteins (see Fig. 1B) (reviewed in Refs. 33Enslen H.

Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). D-sites appear to be portable modular motifs that mediate the interaction of MAPKs with multiple binding partners, contributing to both signal transmission and specificity. Yet, the fact that distinct docking sites share a core consensus sequence suggests that there might be limits to the specificity intrinsic to docking interactions. The D-sites in MEK1, MEK2, MKK3, and MKK6 have been shown to be substrates for cleavage by the lethal factor protease of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) (35Vitale G. Bernardi L. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar); furthermore, lethal factor cleavage has been shown to compromise the ability of some of these enzymes to activate their cognate MAPKs (36Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F.

MKK4 is also cleaved by lethal factor at two sites in its N terminus (see Fig. 1A) (35Vitale G. Bernardi L. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), but whether one or both of these cleavage sites are also MAPK-docking sites has not heretofore been examined. A putative D-site that fits the consensus sequence (K/R)2–3-X 1–6-(L/I)-X-(L/I) has been identified in MKK4 (26Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but has not previously been shown to be functional; this D-site corresponds to the first of the two lethal factor cleavage sites. Here, we show that this D-site is indeed functional, necessary, and sufficient for JNK binding; quantify its selectivity for JNK versus ERK2; and provide evidence that it competes with D-site-containing substrates for binding to JNK. Genes—The following human genes were used in this study: MEK1 (MAP2K1; GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_002755), MEK2 (MAP2K2; accession number NM_030662), MKK4 (MAP2K4; accession number NM_003010), JNK3α1 (MAPK10; accession number NM_ 002753), p38α (MAPK14; L35253), and p38β (MAPK11; accession number NM_002751).

These included fusions of glutathione S-transferase (GST) to human c-Jun-(1–89), ATF2-(19–96), and Elk-1-(307–428) (all from Cell Signaling Technology; the GenBank™/EBI accession numbers of the corresponding full-length human proteins are NM_002228, NM_001880, and NM_005229, respectively); inactive (K52R mutation) mouse ERK2 (Cell Signaling Technology; accession number BAA01733); unactivated rat ERK2 (Calbiochem; accession number M64300); unactivated human JNK1α1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; accession number L26318), JNK1β1 (Calbiochem; accession number U35004), and JNK2α2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; accession number L31951); activated human JNK2α2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; accession number L31951) and mouse ERK2 (New England Biolabs Inc.; accession number BAA01733); and activated human MEK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; accession number A46723) and mouse MKK4-(35–397) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; accession number U18310). Anti-ERK2 and anti-JNK antisera was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmids for in Vitro Transcription/Translation—To construct pGEM-JNK3 (a gift from Douglas M. Molina of this laboratory), the JNK3α1 coding region was amplified by high fidelity PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase, primers LB119 and LB120 (see Table I), and a cDNA clone obtained from the IMAGE consortium (38Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) as the template (IMAGE ID 632588, GenBank™/EBI accession numbers AA191055 and AA188639). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z (Promega).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence (5′ → 3′)UseLB117GCGGGATCCACCATGTCTCAGGAGAGGCCCACGTTCpGEM-p38αLB118CGCTCGAGTGGGATCAACAGAACAGAAACCApGEM-p38αLB119GCGGGATCCACCATGAGCCTCCATTTCTTATACTACpGEM-JNK3LB120CGGTCGACGGGAGACTCTCACTGCTGTTCApGEM-JNK3JB804CGGGTCGACCACCTTCTGCTTCTGGpGEM-MEK1(1-60)JB805CGGGTCGACAACCTTGGCTTTCTGpGEM-MEK2(1-64)p38βUpGCGAATTCACCATGTCGGGCCCTCGCGCpGEM-p38βp38βDownGCGTCGACTTATCACTGCTCAATCTCCAGGCTGpGEM-p38βMKK4ForBegGCGGGATCCACCATGGCGGCTCCGAGCCCGAGCGGpGEM-MKK4(FL)MKK4_37-94FGCGGGATCCACCATGCAAGGGTAAACGCAAAGCACTGAAGpGEM-MKK4(37-end)MKK4_47endFNewGCGGGATCC ATGAATTTTGCAAATCCACCTTTCAAATCTACAGCpGEM-MKK4(47-end)MKK4endRNewCGGGTCGACTCAATCGACATACATGGGAGAGCTGGGAGTAGpGEM-MKK4(X—399)MKK4_37-94FmutGCGGGATCCACCATGCAGGGTGAAGCCGAAGCACTGAAGTTGAATTTTGCAAA TCCACpGEM-MKK4(37-94)mutDH700GCGGGATCCACCATGGCGGCTCCGAGCCCGAGCpGEM-MKK4(1-94)DH701CGGGTCGACGTGTTGTTCAGGGGAGATCTTCAGTTTTCCTGpGEM-MKK4(X—94)M4ForMut1GATCC ATGCAGGGTGCACGCAAAGCACTGAAGTTGAATTTTGCAAATCCACCT TTCAAATCTACAGpGEX-MKK4(37-94)(K40A)M4RevMut1CGCGCTGTAGATTTGAAAGGTGGATTTGCAAAATTCAACTTCAGTGCTTTGCG TGCACCCTGCATGpGEX-MKK4(37-94)(K40A)pGEXBssHIIDestroyFwdGCTGGGCGCAATGCGAGCCATTACCGAGpGEX-2SDM-MKK4-(1-94)pGEXBssHIIFormingFwdCCACCTTTCAAATCTACAGCGCGCTTTACTCTGAATCCCAATCCTACAGGpGEX-2SDM-MKK4-(1-94) Open table in a new tab The MKK4 constructs were generated using pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK4 (a gift from Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School) as the template for PCR and MKK4endRNew as the reverse primer. For pGEM-MKK4 (full-length), the forward primer used was MKK4ForBeg. For pGEM-MKK4-(37–399) and pGEM-MKK4-(47–399), MKK4_37–94F and MKK4_47endFNew were used as the forward primers, respectively. All three MKK4 PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI before being inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z. The p38α open reading frame was amplified by PCR using primers LB117 and LB118 and a cDNA clone obtained from Invitrogen (Genestorm clone ID RG000027) as the template. The resulting PCR product was cut with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into pGEM4Z that had been cut with BamHI and SalI, yielding pGEM-p38α. Plasmid pGEM-p38β was constructed following a similar strategy, using primers p38βUp and p38βDown, Invitrogen Genestorm clone ID RG002657 as the template, and cutting with EcoRI and SalI. Plasmids for the Production of GST Fusion Proteins—The vector used for generating the GST fusion proteins was pGEXLB (26Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a derivative of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). In pGEXLB, an encoded Pro residue is replaced with a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly sequence to promote the independent functioning of the GST and fusion moieties. To construct pGEXLB-JNK3 (a gift from Douglas M. Molina), the JNK3 coding region was excised from pGEM4Z-JNK3 by restriction digest with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB. The MEK1-(1–60) coding sequence was amplified by PCR with primers SP6PL (26Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and JB804 (see Table I) using pGEM-MEK1 (26Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as the template; digested with BamHI and SalI; and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB, yielding pGEXLB-MEK1-(1–60). Plasmid pGEXLB-MEK2-(1–64), containing MEK2 residues 1–64, was generated by a similar procedure using primers SP6PL and JB805, pGEM-MEK2 (26Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as the template, and cutting with EcoRI and SalI. Plasmid pGEXLB-MKK4-(1–94) was generated by PCR amplification using primers DH700 and DH701 and the template pSR3α-JNKK1 (a gift from Michael Karin, University of California at San Diego). The PCR product was subsequently digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB. The pGEXLB-MKK4-(37–94) wild-type and mutant constructs were generated using the pGEM-MKK4-(1–94) construct as the template. The wild-type construct was generated using the forward primer MKK4_37–94F, whereas the mutant construct was generated using the forward primer MKK4_37–94FMut; in both cases, DH701 was the reverse primer. Both MKK4 PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI before being inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z. To generate the MKK4 D-site mutant constructs, an adaptor oligonucleotide approach was utilized. Site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide pGEXBssHIIDestroyFwd and its complement was carried out to destroy a BssHII site at bases 4102–4107 within the β-lactamase gene of pGEXLB-MKK4-(1–94). A unique BssHII site was then introduced by silent substitution at codons 57 and 58 of the MKK4-(1–94) open reading frame; this was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide pGEXBssHIIFormingFwd and its complement. This new plasmid, pGEX-2SDM-MKK4-(1–94), was then digested with BamHI and BssHII to excise a 168-bp fragment encoding residues 1–58. The excised fragment was replaced with annealed oligonucleotide pairs encoding residues 37–58 and containing BamHI and BssHII sticky ends. These oligonucleotide pairs contained the particular docking site mutations. For example, the K40A mutant of the pGEXLB-MKK4-(37–94) mutant construct was generated using oligonucleotides M4ForMut1 and M4RevMut1 (Table I). The other mutants (see Fig. 5A) were constructed by the same procedure, except that oligonucleotides encoding the indicated substitutions were employed. Transcription and Translation in Vitro—Proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were produced by coupled transcription and translation reactions (SPT3, Novagen). Translation products were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and quantified as described previously (24Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

Binding Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified as described (26Bardwell A.J.

An additional assumption was that 100% of the input molecules were active (i.e. capable of binding). For the reaction A + B ⇔ AB (where A is the 35S-labeled protein, and B is the GST fusion protein), Kd ≡ ([A]eq × [B]eq)/[AB]eq, where [A]eq = [A]0 – [AB]eq; [B]eq = [B]0 – [AB]eq; and [A]0 and [B]0 are the input concentrations of A and B, respectively. [AB]eq is the percentage of A that co-sediments with B multiplied by [A]0. Kd estimates are calculated from multiple replicate experiments; two representative examples are shown in Table II.Table IIBinding assay data for MKK4/JNK3 interactionExperiment35S-protein (5 nm)GST fusionμgμmBindingaPercent of the input 35S-labeled protein that bound to the GST fusion protein.Kd bCalculated based on the known input concentrations and percent binding (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).%μ mA-1MKK4GST-JNK3404.05.470.0A-2MKK4GST-JNK3404.08.642.6A-3MKK4GST-JNK3404.016.919.7A-4MKK4GST-JNK3404.012.129.1A-5MKK4GST-JNK3404.09.737.1A-6MKK4GST-JNK3101.03.627.0A-7MKK4GST-JNK3101.05.019.0Mean34.9S.D.17.7S.E.7.2B-1JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)506.912.648.3B-2JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)506.939.110.8B-3JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)506.915.238.9B-4JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)405.612.339.4B-5JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)101.47.317.6B-6JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)101.410.511.8B-7JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)101.48.614.8B-8JNK3GST-MKK4-(1-94)101.46.719.2Mean25.1S.D.14.7S.E.5.6a Percent of the input 35S-labeled protein that bound to the GST fusion protein.b Calculated based on the known input concentrations and percent binding (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Open table in a new tab Peptides and Peptide Array—The soluble peptides used in this study (see Fig. 6B) were synthesized by United Biochemical Research, Inc. (Seattle, WA). Custom synthesis of the peptide arrays used in this study was performed by Jerini AG (Berlin, Germany). The peptides were N-terminally acetylated and anchored to the membrane via a chemical linker at their C termini. Typically, an ∼5-cm2 membrane containing 50 peptide spots was used in an experiment. The membrane was first equilibrated by incubation with binding buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 125 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 12.5% (v/v) glycerol) for 15 min at room temperature and then blocked by incubation with the same buffer containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with 10 ml of the same buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and ∼25 pmol of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled JNK3 protein that had been partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from 500 μl of reticulocyte lysate. This incubation was for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed for 1 min at room temperature in 100 ml of buffer A and then for 1 min in 100 ml of ice-cold buffer A, allowed to dry, and quantified on a PhosphorImager™ (Amersham Biosciences). For quantification, “-fold over background” was determined, i.e. the counts emitted from the peptide spot divided by an average of several background spots of the same area taken from other parts of the membrane where no peptides were coupled. Protein Kinase Assays—The protein kinase assays for MEK2 phosphorylation of ERK2 and for ERK2 phosphorylation of Elk-1 were performed as described (39Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions (20 μl) for MKK4 phosphorylation of JNK1 contained kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), 2 μm (1.8 μg) unactivated human JNK1, 0.02 units (∼15 ng) of active full-length mouse MKK4, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the indicated concentration of peptide. Reactions were for 20 min at 30 °C. JNK1 phosphorylation was quantified by SDS-PAGE (12% gels), followed by analysis of relative incorporation using the PhosphorImager. Kinase reactions (20 μl) for JNK2 phosphorylation of c-Jun or ATF2 contained kinase assay buffer, 1 μm (740 ng) GST-c-Jun or 1 μm (700 ng) GST-ATF2, 0.8 milliunits (∼5 ng) of active human JNK2, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the indicated concentration of peptide. Reactions were for 20 min at 30 °C and were analyzed and quantified as described above.

The accumulation of hypernegative supercoiling in the absence of topoisomerase I can lead to R-loop formation by the nascent transcript and template strand, leading to suppression of transcription elongation. Here we show by affinity chromatography and overlay blotting that E. coli DNA topoisomerase I interacts directly with the RNA polymerase complex. The protein-protein interaction involves the β′ subunit of RNA polymerase and the C-terminal domains of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, which are homologous to the zinc ribbon domains in a number of transcription factors.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that have functional roles in many vital cellular processes (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

Among different classes of topoisomerases, type IA topoisomerases found in archea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes share the mechanistic feature of cutting and rejoining a single strand of DNA via a 5′-phosphotyrosine linkage and homologous amino acid sequences (3Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I (encoded by the topA gene) is the most extensively studied example of this class of enzyme. Its most apparent physiological role is the maintenance of steady-state DNA supercoiling (4Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 415-433Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Zechiedrich E.L.

During transcription, the movement of the RNA polymerase complex on the DNA template creates local transcription-driven supercoiling with negative supercoiling generated behind the RNA polymerase and positive supercoiling generated ahead of the RNA polymerase (6Liu L.F.

Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DNA gyrase is needed for removing the positive supercoils, and topoisomerase I is responsible for removing the excess negative supercoils. In the absence of topoisomerase I function due to mutation in the topA gene, the accumulation of hypernegative supercoiling can lead to R-loop formation by nascent transcription and template stranding with the consequent suppression of transcription elongation (8Drolet M.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA polymerase was also found to copurify with Tn5 transposase, but the copurification was reduced in extracts from a topA mutant strain, suggesting that the interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA topoisomerase I was responsible for the copurification of RNA polymerase with Tn5 transposase (10Yigit H.

Maltose-binding Protein Affinity Chromatography—A PCR fragment encoding the E. coli topA gene was generated by Pfu DNA polymerase (from Stratagene) and cloned into the XmnI site of pMal-c2X (New England BioLabs) to create a fusion protein with MBP 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; DIG, digoxigenin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. linked to the N terminus of topoisomerase I. Expression of MBP-topoisomerase I and MBP in E. coli TB1 cells was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells from a 250-ml culture were lysed by lysozyme treatment combined with freeze-thawing in phosphate-buffered saline. The soluble extract obtained after centrifugation was applied to 1 ml of amylose resin (New England BioLabs) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the column were eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. RNA Polymerase Affinity Chromatography—Polyol-responsive monoclonal antibodies against E. coli RNA polymerase β′ subunit (NT73) was purchased from Neoclones and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose according to published procedures using 0.9 ml of the antibodies (15Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The NT73 affinity matrix was mixed with 1 ml of extracts of E. coli BL21 cells prepared from 400 ml of culture expressing intact topoisomerase I (11Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 40% ethylene glycol with 0.75 m NaCl. Blotting of RNA Polymerase with Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled Topoisomerase I and Its Subdomains—Purified RNA polymerase (0.8 μg) was electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel to separate the subunits. The proteins were transferred onto either supported nitrocellulose membrane for chemiluminescence detection or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for color detection. Topoisomerase I and its subdomains were labeled with DIG using the labeling kit from Roche Applied Science. Each DIG-labeled protein was incubated with the membrane at 25 °C for 1 h. Anti-DIG antibodies linked to peroxidase were used for detection by the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-DIG antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase were used for color detection with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Roche Applied Sciences). After color detection, the position of the topoisomerase I-binding signal was marked and photographed before staining of the nylon membrane by Coomassie Blue. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase (3 units) was carried out with procedures similar to those described previously (16Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction (30 μl) contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 11 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm each of GTP, CTP, and UTP, 0.5 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid pBR322. Transcription was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. After deproteinization by phenol extraction, the DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel with 0.5× TPE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer with the indicated chloroquine concentrations for detection of positively supercoiled DNA (17Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-dimensional agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. When analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA was visualized by hybridization to 32P-labeled probes as described previously (17Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Synthesis of the 14-kDa C-terminal Fragment in Vivo— DNA coding for the 14-kDa C-terminal fragment of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was generated by PCR using the Pfu DNA polymerase and inserted into the pBADThio-TOPO expression vector (from Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pBAD14K has the 14-kDa C-terminal fragment fused to the carboxyl end of thioredoxin and under the control of pBAD promoter. E. coli strain TOP10 with wild-type topoisomerase genotypes (from Invitrogen) was transformed with either pBAD14K or the control plasmid pBAD/Thio expressing thioredoxin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A 600 reached 0.5, when transcription from the PBAD promoter was induced by addition of 0.005% arabinose. Cell growth was continued for 4 h at 37 °C before harvest of the cell pellets for plasmid preparation using the Qiagen kit. Plasmid DNA supercoiling was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using chloroquine concentrations specific for identification of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (16Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was visualized by hybridization to a 32P-labeled probe and by autoradiography. Survival Rates after N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) Treatment—RFM445 (gyrB22(couR)gyrB203(Ts)), RFM475 (gyrB22(couR)gyrB203(Ts), and Δ(topAcysB)) and its transformants were cultured in LB broth at 37 °C to stationary phase (>18 h). Plasmid pJW312 (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for expression of full-length topoisomerase I, whereas its linker insertion derivative pJW2277ter (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for expressing Top85 lacking the 14-kDa C-terminal fragment (19Beran-Steed R.K. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmid for expression of Top67 lacking the 30-kDa terminal fragment was constructed by introduction of a termination codon in pJW312 via site-directed mutagenesis (14Ahumada, A., and Tse-Dinh, Y.-C. (2002) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/3/13.Google Scholar). The cells were washed and resuspended in M9 medium as described (20Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) before treatment for 1 h with 8 mm NEM at 37 °C. The rate of survival was determined by serial dilutions and plating of treated cells as well as control cells not treated with NEM. Colonies on LB plates were counted after 36 h of incubation at 37 °C. Direct Interaction between E. coli DNA Topoisomerase I and RNA Polymerase—Extract of E. coli cells expressing recombinant E. coli DNA topoisomerase I with MBP fused to its N-terminal end was applied to amylose resin. The bound topoisomerase I and any associated cellular proteins were then eluted with buffer containing maltose. Identical procedures were carried out with elution of recombinant MBP from amylose resin. When the maltose eluate fractions were analyzed by Western blotting, RNA polymerase α and β′ subunits were detected in the eluate fractions from cells expressing MBP-topoisomerase I but not in the eluate fractions prepared from cells expressing MBP (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that the linkage of DNA topoisomerase I to MBP is required for binding of RNA polymerase to the amylose resin. The Zinc Ribbon Domains of Topoisomerase I Are Responsible for the Interaction with RNA Polymerase—An RNA polymerase affinity column was prepared using polyol-responsive monoclonal antibodies against the β′ subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase (15Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Soluble extracts of E. coli BL21 cells expressing DNA topoisomerase I (11Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 145-151Google Scholar) or its subdomains (12Zhu C.-X. Samuel M. Pound A. Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Ahumada, A., and Tse-Dinh, Y.-C. (2002) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/3/13.Google Scholar) were applied individually to the affinity column in separate experiments carried out with identical procedures (Fig. 2). Topoisomerase I could be detected in the bound proteins eluted from this affinity column with buffer containing 40% ethylene glycol and 0.75 m NaCl. In similar experiments carried out separately with lysates expressing an individual topoisomerase I subdomain, it was determined that the 67-kDa N-terminal transesterification domain (Top67) did not bind to the affinity column but the 20-kDa (ZD2) and 14-kDa C-terminal fragments could bind to the RNA polymerase affinity column. These two fragments contain three and two copies of zinc ribbon domains, respectively, and are homologous to the zinc ribbon domains in transcription regulators including RPB9, TFIIS, and TFIIB (21Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, only the three zinc ribbon domains on ZD2 have Zn(II) bound to tetracysteine motifs (13Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of the RNA polymerase subunits to this affinity column was confirmed by both Coomassie Blue staining of the eluted proteins and Western blot analysis using antibodies against the α, β, and β′ subunits (Fig. 2c). The β′ Subunit of RNA Polymerase Interacts with Topoisomerase I—E. coli RNA polymerase was expected to bind to the affinity matrix as a multisubunit complex. To determine which subunit was responsible for the interaction with DNA topoisomerase I, the RNA polymerase subunits were electrophoresed in a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto membrane. Overlay blotting was carried out using DIG-labeled topoisomerase I, DIG-labeled Top67, DIG-labeled ZD2, and DIG-labeled 14-kDa fragment. All of these DIG-labeled proteins, except DIG-labeled Top67, gave a positive chemiluminescence signal with peroxidase-linked anti-DIG antibody at a position where RNA polymerase β and β′ subunits would migrate in the 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3a). This result was in agreement with the data in Fig. 2b and showed that DNA that might have been present in the E. coli protein extract during binding to the affinity columns was not required for interaction between DNA topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase. There was also no signal when the RNA polymerase subunits on the membrane were blotted with DIG-labeled bovine serum albumen. To determine whether the β or β′ subunit was interacting with topoisomerase I, a 5% polyacrylamide gel was used for SDS-gel electrophoresis of the RNA polymerase subunits to better separate these two high molecular weight subunits. After transfer, the membrane was incubated with DIG-labeled ZD2 followed by alkaline-phosphatase linked anti-DIG antibodies. The signal of the DIG-topoisomerase I fragment bound to the nylon membrane was developed with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reagent. The position of the signal was marked on the membrane and photographed alongside a ruler. The nylon membrane was then stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize both the β and β′ subunits in the gel lane analyzed previously with the alkaline-phosphatase linked anti-DIG antibodies. A comparison with the previously marked and photographed signal from alkaline phosphatase indicated that the topoisomerase I subdomain was interacting with the β′ subunit (Fig. 3b). The experiment was repeated using DIG-topoisomerase I or DIG 14-kDa fragment, and both of these also interacted with the β′ subunit (Fig. 3b and data not shown). Direct Interaction between E. coli RNA Polymerase and Topoisomerase I Is Important for Removal of Transcription-driven Negative Supercoils—It has been proposed that topoisomerase I plays an important physiological role in the removal of negative supercoils formed during transcription because of the movement of the RNA polymerase complex (6Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 7Tsao Y.-P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In an in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of DNA topoisomerase I, positive supercoiling of the DNA template results from the removal of transcription-driven negative supercoils by topoisomerase I (7Tsao Y.-P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the direct interaction between E. coli RNA polymerase and topoisomerase I is important for the removal of transcription-driven negative supercoils, a recombinant 14-kDa C-terminal fragment (purified from an overexpression system (12Zhu C.-X. Samuel M. Pound A. Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar) at >99% purity as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gel (data not shown)) was also added to the in vitro transcription reaction. The 14-kDa C-terminal fragment could compete with topoisomerase I for interaction with E. coli RNA polymerase, and the formation of positively supercoiled DNA template was found to be inhibited (Fig. 4). In a relaxation reaction in the absence of RNA polymerase, the 14-kDa fragment has no significant effect on the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by DNA topoisomerase I; thus so the 14-kDa fragment does not inhibit the catalytic activity of DNA topoisomerase I (Fig. 4c). The significance of the RNA polymerase-topoisomerase I interaction for removal of transcription driven supercoils was also demonstrated in vivo. The 14-kDa C-terminal domain was expressed in E. coli as a thioredoxin fusion protein via the tightly regulated PBAD promoter (22Schleif R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Accumulation of hypernegative supercoils in the plasmid DNA was observed when synthesis of the 14-kDa C-terminal fragment by pBAD14K was induced by addition of 0.005% arabinose to the culture (Fig. 5a). The induced 14-kDa C-terminal domain was expected to compete with topoisomerase I for interaction with RNA polymerase, impeding the removal of transcription-driven negative supercoils by DNA topoisomerase I. The level of 14-kDa C-terminal domain synthesis and resulting accumulation of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA did not vary significantly when the arabinose concentration was varied between 0.001 and 0.1% (data not shown). Induction of expression of thioredoxin in the control pBAD/THIO plasmid under the same experimental conditions did not result in accumulation of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 5b). Zinc Ribbons Are Important for in Vivo Function of Topoisomerase I during Stress Response—An 85-kDa truncated topoisomerase I lacking the 14-kDa C-terminal fragment (Top85) has been shown previously to be active in relaxation of supercoiled DNA (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Beran-Steed R.K. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The in vitro relaxing activity of Top85 was >75% of that of the full-length enzyme, albeit with lower processivity in high salt (19Beran-Steed R.K. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In vivo, Top85 could fully complement the viability of the E. coli strain AS17 that has a temperature-sensitive topoisomerase I (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Top85 has three of the five zinc ribbon domains present in topoisomerase I. We hypothesize that during stress response, when rapid transcription of induced genes takes place, direct interaction between topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase via the zinc ribbon domains may be important for survival. We have previously shown that the E. coli strain RFM475 with the topA gene deleted is much more sensitive to killing by the toxic electrophile NEM than the isogenic topA + strain RFM445 (20Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The increased sensitivity of RFM475 to NEM can be reversed by the presence of a plasmid expressing DNA topoisomerase I (20Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Strain RFM475 was transformed with plasmids expressing full-length topoisomerase I or its truncated forms lacking the C-terminal fragments. Comparison of the survival rates of the RFM475 transformants after NEM treatment (Fig. 6) showed that the survival rate of the transformant expressing Top85 was higher than the transformant expressing Top67 but still about 100-fold lower than that of the transformant expressing the full-length topoisomerase I. Although not required for viability of E. coli under optimal laboratory growth conditions, the absence of the 14-kDa fragment in topoisomerase I thus affected the function of topoisomerase I in stress response significantly. The results presented here support a role of the C-terminal zinc ribbon domains in E. coli DNA topoisomerase I for interacting with the β′ subunit of RNA polymerase, so that negative DNA supercoiling formed during transcription can be removed immediately. The rapid removal of transcription-driven negative supercoils would prevent the formation of R-loops (8Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suppression of R-loops during transcription has been proposed to be an essential function for E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (24Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows that the number of zinc ribbon domains in type IA DNA topoisomerases found in different organisms varies from zero to five (20Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If present, these zinc ribbon domains can potentially interact with RNA polymerase in these organisms during transcription. Other DNA topoisomerases have also been shown previously to be involved directly in transcription. Human topoisomerase I, a type IB topoisomerase, has been shown to be a cofactor of RNA polymerase II transcription (25Merino A. Madden K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 26Kretzachmar M. Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11508-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas topoisomerase IIα is required for RNA polymerase II transcription on chromatin templates (27Mondal N. Parvin J.D. Nature. 2001; 413: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have observed previously that a recombinant plasmid expressing the 14-kDa C-terminal domain of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I under the T7 promoter was unstable in E. coli BL21DE3 (12Zhu C.-X. Samuel M. Pound A. Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to construct a recombinant plasmid expressing the 14-kDa C-terminal domain as a MBP-fusion protein in pMal-c2X were unsuccessful. The results showing the interference of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I function during transcription by the 14-kDa C-terminal domain would account for the instability of these recombinant plasmids. It may be possible for topoisomerase I function or DNA supercoiling to be modulated via targeting of the protein-protein interactions between topoisomerase I and its partners in E. coli. Besides Tn5 transposase and RNA polymerase in E. coli, cellular proteins in other organisms may also interact with type IA topoisomerases. This is particularly intriguing for mammalian type IA topoisomerases. There are two type IA topoisomerases (TOP3α and TOP3β) present in both human and mouse (28Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc.

Biol. 2000; 299: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Human TOP3α has been shown to interact with the Bloom Syndrome helicase, BLM (33Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that interaction between Bloom Syndrome helicase and human TOP3α is important for genomic stability (36Hu P. Beresten S.F. van Brabant A.J. Ye T.Z. Pandolfi P.P. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Ellis N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The domains in TOP3α and TOP3β responsible for the interactions with the RecQ family of helicases have not been identified experimentally. Multiple transcripts from alternative splicing with tissue specific expression pattern give rise to variant forms of TOP3β that have different numbers of zinc ribbon domains (31Ng S.-W. Liu Y. Hasselblatt K.T. Mok S.C. Berkowitz R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This can affect the interaction of TOP3β with other cellular proteins. The potential involvement of these zinc ribbon domains in protein-protein interactions may play the important role of directing different forms of mammalian type IA topoisomerases to complexes involved in replication, transcription, recombination, or DNA repair.

https://openalex.org/W2104868426,"C1, the complex that triggers the classical pathway of complement, is assembled from two modular proteases C1r and C1s and a recognition protein C1q. The N-terminal CUB1-EGF segments of C1r and C1s are key elements of the C1 architecture, because they mediate both Ca2+-dependent C1r-C1s association and interaction with C1q. The crystal structure of the interaction domain of C1s has been solved and refined to 1.5 Å resolution. The structure reveals a head-to-tail homodimer involving interactions between the CUB1 module of one monomer and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) module of its counterpart. A Ca2+ ion is bound to each EGF module and stabilizes both the intra- and inter-monomer interfaces. Unexpectedly, a second Ca2+ ion is bound to the distal end of each CUB1 module, through six ligands contributed by Glu45, Asp53, Asp98, and two water molecules. These acidic residues and Tyr17 are conserved in approximately two-thirds of the CUB repertoire and define a novel, Ca2+-binding CUB module subset. The C1s structure was used to build a model of the C1r-C1s CUB1-EGF heterodimer, which in C1 connects C1r to C1s and mediates interaction with C1q. A structural model of the C1q/C1r/C1s interface is proposed, where the rod-like collagen triple helix of C1q is accommodated into a groove along the transversal axis of the C1r-C1s heterodimer. C1, the complex that triggers the classical pathway of complement, is assembled from two modular proteases C1r and C1s and a recognition protein C1q.

These acidic residues and Tyr17 are conserved in approximately two-thirds of the CUB repertoire and define a novel, Ca2+-binding CUB module subset. The C1s structure was used to build a model of the C1r-C1s CUB1-EGF heterodimer, which in C1 connects C1r to C1s and mediates interaction with C1q. A structural model of the C1q/C1r/C1s interface is proposed, where the rod-like collagen triple helix of C1q is accommodated into a groove along the transversal axis of the C1r-C1s heterodimer. The classical pathway of complement, a major element of innate immunity against pathogens, is triggered by C1, a 790-kDa complex formed from association of a recognition protein C1q with two modular serine proteases, C1r and C1s, that respectively mediate internal activation and proteolytic activity of the complex (1Cooper N.R.

Rev. 2001; 180: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). C1q is a protein with the overall shape of a bouquet of flowers, comprising six heterotrimeric collagen-like triple helices that associate to form a N-terminal “stalk” and then diverge to form individual “stems,” each terminating in a C-terminal globular domain (Ref. 4Kishore U. Reid K.B.M. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar; see Fig. 5). C1r and C1s have homologous modular structures with a N-terminal C1r/C1s, uEGF, bone morphogenetic protein (CUB) module (5Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol.

This modular architecture is shared by the mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), a group of enzymes involved in the triggering of the lectin pathway of complement (8Fujita T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Whereas the enzymatic properties of C1r and C1s are mediated by their C-terminal regions, the N-terminal CUB1-EGF domains have interaction properties that are essential to the assembly of the C1 complex. Thus, it is well established that C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s, the tetrameric catalytic subunit of C1, assembles through Ca2+-dependent heterodimeric C1r-C1s interactions involving the CUB1-EGF segment of each protease (9Thielens N.M.

In an effort to decipher the structure-function relationships of the C1 complex at the atomic level, we have used a dissection strategy that has yielded precise insights into the activation mechanism of C1r (18Budayova-Spano M.

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We now report the x-ray structure of the CUB1-EGF moiety of C1s, a domain that in the C1 complex associates with the corresponding part of C1r and has the additional ability to form homodimers in the absence of C1r (9Thielens N.M.

The structure reveals a novel, Ca2+-binding CUB module subset and yields insights into the C1q/C1r/C1s interface in the C1 complex. Production and Purification of the Recombinant C1s CUB1-EGF Domain—A DNA fragment encoding the C1s signal peptide and the N-terminal CUB1-EGF segment (residues 1–159 of the mature protein) was amplified by PCR using VentR polymerase and the pBS-C1s plasmid (21Luo C. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Gal P. Sarvari M. Tseng Y. Tosi M. Zavodszky P. Arlaud G.J. Schumaker V.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a template, according to established procedures. The sequences of the sense (5′-CGGGATCCATGTGGTGCATTGTCCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGGGTACC CTAATTAACTCCGCAATTCTTC-3′) primers introduced a BamHI restriction site (underlined) at the 5′ end of the polymerase chain reaction product and a stop codon (bold type) followed by a KpnI site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The amplified DNA was purified using the Geneclean kit (Bio 101), digested with BamHI and KpnI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was characterized by restriction mapping and checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). The recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac™ system (Invitrogen Corp.), amplified, and titrated as described previously (22Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). High Five cells (1.75 × 107 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 in Sf900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) for 96 h at 28 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, and diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture supernatant containing the C1s CUB1-EGF segment was dialyzed against 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.1, and loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto a Q-Sepharose-Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) (2.8 × 12 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a 1-liter linear gradient from 75 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions containing the recombinant fragment were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, precipitated by addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 60% (w/v), and left overnight at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, and applied onto a TSK G3000 SWG column (7.5 × 600 mm) (Toso Haas) equilibrated in the same buffer. The purified fragment was concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml by ultrafiltration on a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). Chemical and Functional Characterization of the Recombinant Protein—SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously (9Thielens N.M. Aude C.A. Lacroix M.B. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14469-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique on a Voyager Elite XL instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) under conditions described previously (23Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). High pressure gel permeation chromatography was performed on a TSK G3000 SWG column (7.5 × 600 mm) (Tosohaas) equilibrated in 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing either 1 mm EDTA or CaCl2 and run at 1 ml/min. Analysis by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of the interaction between the C1s CUB1-EGF domain and intact C1r was performed at 25 °C using an upgraded BIAcore instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The running buffer for protein immobilization was 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The C1s CUB1-EGF domain was diluted to 35 μg/ml in 10 mm formate, pH 3.0, and coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) using the amine coupling chemistry (BIAcore amine coupling kit). Binding of purified plasma-derived human C1r (24Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Duplaa A.-M. Colomb M.G. Mol. Immunol. 1979; 16: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was measured over 250 resonance units of the immobilized C1s CUB1-EGF segment, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4. Equivalent volumes of the C1r samples were injected over a surface with immobilized ovalbumin to serve as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of bulk refractive index background. Regeneration of the surface was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 5 mm EDTA. The data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of both the association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously, using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) was calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (k off/k on). Crystallization and Data Collection—The C1s CUB1-EGF fragment was concentrated to 6.0–7.8 mg/ml in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,50mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4. The crystals were obtained at 20 °Cbythe hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and of a reservoir solution composed of 30% (v/v) PEG 400, 0.2 m CaCl2, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The crystals obtained were used for micro-seeding in a drop with reservoir solution containing 16% (v/w) PEG 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 8.7% glycerol, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. From this were obtained crystals suitable for high resolution x-ray data collection. A native data set with space group P1 was measured at the ESRF beamline ID14-EH2 to a resolution of 1.5 Å. The images were processed using the MOSFLM program package (25Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 50-61Google Scholar), and the data were scaled using the Collaborative Computational Project 4 suite (26Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—A preliminary structure was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by first transferring the crystal to a solution with a lower concentration of MgCl2 (0.15 m) and then by soaking in a mother liquor containing 0.5 mm TbCl3 and 0.15 m MgCl2. The heavy atom derivative data set was collected at the ESRF beamline BM30 at 3.0 Å resolution and indexed using XDS (27Kabsch W. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 730-734Google Scholar). Two heavy derivative sites were located using the Patterson heavy atom search method implemented in CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The correct enantiomorph was found by visual inspection of the electron density map. The protein region was distinguishable from the solvent. Solvent flattening was carried out with DM (29Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Model building was carried out with the graphics program TURBO (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). The quality of the initial maps permitted the construction of up to 60% of the 318 residues in the asymmetric unit. This initial model was refined using CNS and then used as the molecular replacement search model for the high resolution native data set. The ensuing map was improved with WARP, v5.0 (31Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 5: 458-463Crossref Scopus (2564) Google Scholar), allowing automatic building of 86% of the model (269 residues) at this stage. The automatic water molecule search and refinement for the high resolution model was done with CNS. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the code 1NZI. Modeling of the C1r/C1s/C1q Interface—Modeling of the C1r-C1s CUB1-EGF heterodimer was carried out in three steps. First, the structure of the C1s CUB1 module was used as a scaffold for the C1r CUB1 model. After careful examination of the sequence alignment of the CUB1 modules of C1s and C1r, the residues in the structure of C1s CUB1 were replaced by the corresponding residues from the C1r sequence using the graphics program TURBO (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). Next, the C1r EGF structure determined by NMR spectroscopy (32Bersch B. Hernandez J.-F. Marion D. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1204-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was superimposed onto the atomic coordinates of the C1s EGF B module using the interactive graphics program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Lowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The program gave an root mean square of 1.05 Å based on the 33 Cα positions used to carry out the superimposition. Loop 10 of each EGF module was excluded from the this calculation because of the difference in length and conformation. Finally, the heterodimer was assembled by taking the Protein Data Bank file of the C1s homodimer and superimposing the C1r CUB1 and EGF models onto monomer B of the C1s homodimer. The model of the C1q collagen arm is based on published statistical information derived from collagen-like structures (34Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The arrangement of the A, B, and C chains in the heterotrimeric triple helix is derived from the crystal structure of the C1q globular domain, 2C. Gaboriaud, J. Juanhuix, A. Gruez, M. Lacroix, C. Darnault, D. Pignol, D. Verger, J-C. Fontecilla-Camps, and G. Arlaud, unpublished data. and the alignment of the collagen triplets shown in Fig. 5 is the only one compatible with this structure. Different configurations of the C1q/C1r/C1s interface were tested using computer graphics, looking for the most appropriate positioning in terms of shape and charge complementarity between the C1q and C1r-C1s models. Consistency with previously published biochemical data was also included in the selection of the most plausible model (see “Discussion”). The model depicted in Fig. 5 allows ionic interaction between unmodified lysine residues A59, B61, and B65 of C1q and acidic residues of C1r (Asp61, Glu137 or Glu138, and Asp127, respectively). In this configuration, hydrophobic residues of C1q are positioned in a favorable environment at the C1s-C1r interface: methionines B68 and C67 point toward the central six-residue hydrophobic cluster, whereas residues A74, A77, C70, C71, and C74 are in the vicinity of the distal hydrophobic pocket. Characterization of the C1s Interaction Domain—Expression of the C1s CUB1-EGF domain in a baculovirus/insect cells system led to the production of large amounts of material (∼20 mg/liter of cell culture). Purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography followed by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and gel permeation. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the purified protein was homogeneous and migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 25.5 and 20.5 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry analysis yielded a value of 18,129 ± 9 Da consistent with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal Glu1–Asn159 segment of C1s (calculated mass, 18,125 Da). Analysis by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that the immobilized C1s CUB1-EGF domain was able to bind C1r in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, with a K D value of 20.7 nm, similar to the values of 10.9 and 20.2 nm determined previously for intact C1s and the larger N-terminal C1sα fragment, respectively (12Thielens N.M.

Gel filtration analysis of the C1s CUB1-EGF domain indicated that the protein eluted significantly earlier in the presence of Ca2+ ions than in the presence of EDTA, consistent the known ability of the C1s interaction domain to form Ca2+-dependent homodimers (9Thielens N.M.

Overall Structure—The structure of the CUB1-EGF interaction domain of human C1s was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined at 1.5 Å into a very well defined electron density map (Fig. 2D). The final R work and R free factors are 0.229 and 0.246, respectively, and the refined model has excellent stereochemistry (Table I). In agreement with previous findings (9Thielens N.M. Aude C.A. Lacroix M.B. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14469-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Busby T.F. Ingham K.C.

Immunol. 1997; 34: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the CUB1-EGF segment of C1s associates as a Ca2+-dependent homodimer (Fig. 2). Within each monomer, the CUB1 and EGF modules are assembled in a linear fashion with a Ca2+ ion bound at the intermodular interface (site I). A second Ca2+ ion is bound to the distal part of each CUB1 module (site II). The two monomers interact in a head-to-tail fashion involving major contacts between the CUB1 module of one molecule and the EGF module of its counterpart, the resulting assembly displaying a noncrystallographic pseudo 2-fold symmetry. The C-terminal residues are located at either end of the dimer, indicating where the CUB2 modules follow (Fig. 2, A and B). The overall structure is rather elongated, with a length of approximately 85 Å and a width of 20–40 Å. A side view of the structure (Fig. 2C) reveals that whereas one side is relatively flat, the opposite side is markedly concave and forms a groove. A Novel, Ca2 + -binding CUB Module Structure—Compared with the CUB domain topology established from the x-ray structure of two spermadhesins (35Romero A. Romao J.J. Varela P.F. Kölln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Sanz L. Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the C1s CUB1 module reveals a number of particular features (Fig. 3). Like the N-terminal CUB module in C1r and the MASPs, the C1s CUB1 module shows a deletion at its N-terminal end (Fig. 3C). As a result, this module lacks not only the first of the two disulfide bridges characteristic of most CUB domains but also the first two β-strands present in the previously determined CUB structures (Fig. 3A). Thus, whereas CUB domains of the spermadhesin family are organized in two five-stranded β-sheets, each containing two parallel and four anti-parallel strands (35Romero A. Romao J.J. Varela P.F. Kölln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Sanz L. Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the C1s CUB1 topology consists of two four-stranded β-sheets, each made of anti-parallel strands (strands 3, 10, 5, and 8 and strands 4, 9, 6, and 7). A further specific feature of the C1s CUB1 structure is the 3/10 helical conformation of the loop (H1) connecting strands β5 to β6, which is deleted in the spermadhesins (Fig. 3, A and C). Loops 3 and 9, on the same side of the module, and the large insertion loop 7 (a specific feature of the C1r/C1s/MASP family) also exhibit significant differences in length and/or conformation compared with their counterparts in the spermadhesin CUB structures (Figs. 3, A and C). In contrast to these modifications in solvent-exposed regions, the hydrophobic core observed in the spermadhesin family is highly conserved in the C1s CUB1 domain, the 18 hydrophobic or aromatic residues defining the CUB domain signature (5Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) being conserved in C1s (Fig. 3C). Compared with the spermadhesins, the C1s CUB1 domain shows root mean square deviation values of 1.40 Å (aSFP), 1.50 Å (PSP-I), and 1.54 Å (PSP-II), based on 80–86 homologous residues. An unexpected feature of the structure is the occurrence of a Ca2+-binding site (site II) at the distal end of each CUB1 module. The Ca2+ ion is coordinated by six oxygen ligands, namely one side chain oxygen of Glu45, both carboxylate oxygens of Asp53, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp98, and two water molecules (Fig. 3B). The bond distances are in average 2.4 Å, the characteristic value for known Ca2+-binding sites in proteins (36Harding M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ca2+ ion, its ligands, and the neighboring residues Tyr17, Asn101, and Phe105 also partake in an intricate network of hydrogen bonds that connect together strands β5, β6, β9, and β10 and loops L3 and L9 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the Ca2+ ion is the central element of a network of interactions that extensively stabilize the distal end of the C1s CUB1 module. The Ca2+ ion in site II is exposed to the solvent and exchangeable for Tb3+, as seen in the heavy atom derivative. Partial replacement by Mg2+ was also observed in crystals grown at high MgCl2 concentrations. Subtle differences in the coordinating ligands were observed between monomers A and B of the homodimer, including in some cases the involvement of a further water molecule contributing a seventh ligand. Of the residues involved in the coordination of Ca2+ and the associated network of hydrogen bonds, Asn101 and Phe105 appear to be strictly specific to the CUB1 modules of the C1r/C1s/MASP family (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Tyr17 and the Ca2+ ligands Glu45, Asp53, and Asp98 are conserved in approximately two-thirds of the CUB module repertoire, strongly suggesting that these residues define a novel CUB module subset with the ability to bind Ca2+. This subset is possibly more representative in terms of structure than the spermadhesins. Ca2 + -binding Site I and the Intra-monomer CUB1-EGF Interface—The C1s EGF module exhibits a fold similar to that described for other modules of this type (6Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), with one major and one minor anti-parallel double-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 2A). Loop 10, which is disordered in the C1r EGF module (32Bersch B. Hernandez J.-F. Marion D. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1204-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is much shorter in C1s (Fig. 4B) and structurally well defined, except Phe123 in monomer A. The remainder of the C1r and C1s EGF modules shows a root mean square deviation value of 0.90 Å. As predicted from the amino acid sequence (3Arlaud G.J. Gaboriaud C. Thielens N.M. Rossi V. Bersch B.

In this report we demonstrate that NOG1 is functionally linked to ribosome biogenesis. In sucrose density gradients Trypanosoma brucei NOG1 co-sediments with 60 S ribosomal subunits but not with monosomes. 60 S precursor RNAs are co-precipitated with NOG1. Together with the nucleolar localization of NOG1, these data indicate that NOG1 is associated with a precursor particle to the 60 S subunit. Disruption of NOG1 function through RNA interference led to a dramatic decrease in the levels of free 60 S particles and the appearance of an atypical rRNA intermediate in which ITS2 was not cleaved. Overexpression of mutant nog1 with a defect in its GTP binding motif on a wild type background caused a modest defect in 60 S biogenesis and a relative decrease in processing of the large subunit rRNAs. In contrast to the mutant protein, neither the N-terminal half of NOG1, which contains the GTP binding motifs, nor the C-terminal half of NOG1 associated with pre-ribosomal particles, although both localized to the nucleolus.

Generation of a functional ribosome requires the transient association and function of non-ribosomal proteins in pre-ribosomal complexes located primarily in the nucleolus. The pathway of ribosome biogenesis appears to be generally conserved throughout eukaryotes but has been most well studied in yeast where a number of such complexes have been identified (1Harnpicharnchai P.

Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), plus many of the proteins required for biogenesis of both ribosomal subunits (5Grandi P. Rybin V.

After removal of the 5′ external transcribed spacer, the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) 1The abbreviations used are: ITS1, first internal transcribed spacer; RNAi, RNA interference; TAP, tandem affinity purification; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: ITS1, first internal transcribed spacer; RNAi, RNA interference; TAP, tandem affinity purification; kb, kilobase(s). is cleaved to release the precursor of the 18 S rRNA (6Klootwijk J.

Yeast. 1995; 11: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Separate particles then go on to form the 60 S and 40 S subunits (4Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 66 S precursor to the 60 S subunit is actually a series of particles that differ in the status of their rRNA processing and associated proteins. However, within the 66 S particle, cleavage of ITS2 releases the 5.8 S rRNA, and a defined series of rRNA cleavages results in the mature rRNAs. The 66 S precursor is further processed, then moves to the nucleoplasm and is exported to the cytoplasm as an immature 60 S subunit (8Ho J.H. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cleavage of ITS1 and ITS2 are early events in Trypanosoma brucei (9White T.C. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9471-9489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, processing of large subunit sequences is considerably more complex, with mature transcript sizes of 1840 (LSU1), 1570 (LSU2), 220, 180, 140, and 70 nucleotides (9White T.C. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9471-9489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).In addition to ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus is the site of other processes such as tRNA processing or gene silencing (10Gotta M.

Cell. 1999; 97: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although most of the nucleolar proteins studied thus far participate in ribosome biogenesis, the functions of many nucleolar proteins remain undefined (13Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). One such protein, NOG1, was originally identified in the protozoan T. brucei via a two-hybrid screen using the nucleolar phosphoprotein NOPP44/46 (14Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOG1 is a GTP-binding protein that is conserved among eukaryotes. In those species studied thus far (T. brucei, S. cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens), NOG1 is nucleolar (14Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data base searches with the G1 and putative effector motifs of the NOG1 GTP binding domain identified a larger family of related GTP-binding proteins called the ODN family, which also includes the DRG (15Sazuka T. Tomooka Y. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Kumar S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Obg proteins (16Trach K. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Okamoto S. Itoh M. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 170-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Maddock J. Bhatt A. Koch M. Skidmore J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6426-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DRGs and Obgs as well as prokaryotic NOG-like proteins are homologous throughout their length to the amino half of NOG1, which contains the GTP binding motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of ODN proteins shows that they are not closely related to other GTP-binding protein families.The function of Obg proteins has been studied to some degree. Intriguingly, Bacillus subtilis Obg, which is required for the stress activation of transcription factor σB (19Scott J.M. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4653-4660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was found to associate with ribosomal particles, possibly via rpl13 (20Scott J.M. Ju J. Mitchell T. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2771-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given these data and the fact that NOG1 is nucleolar, we postulated that NOG1 is involved in ribosomal biogenesis. During the course of these studies, other workers show that NOG1 is co-precipitated with tagged proteins known to be involved in 60 S biogenesis in yeast (21Du Y.C. Stillman B. Cell. 2002; 109: 835-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Saveanu C. Bienvenu D. Namane A. Gleizes P.E. Gas N. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In the studies presented, we show that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated disruption of NOG1 function causes defects in 60 S biogenesis and that the GTP binding motif is required for function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—Initial studies were done using the procyclic form T. brucei TREU667, grown in Cunningham's media (24Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For in vivo expression of NOG1 constructs, we employed procyclic form 29-13 strain (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), which expresses T7 RNA polymerase and the Tet repressor to allow regulated expression of the epitope-tagged genes or double-stranded RNA. The 29-13 cells were cultured in SDM-79 (26Brun R. Schononberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) with 15% fetal calf serum containing 15 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain the T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor constructs. After transfection, stable transfectants were selected using 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin as described (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with 2–2.5 μg/ml Tet.NOG1 Constructs—The plasmid pLEW79-NOG1-Myc was made by amplifying the cloned NOG1 gene with the sense primer 5′-CGTTTCTAAGCTTATGTCCACAATCTACAAT and antisense primer 5′-TACTTACTCGAGTTATCTAGAGCGTCTGTCGCGTC, which contain the restriction sites HindIII and XbaI in their 5′ ends. The PCR product was cloned into pBS-KS+. As with other coding regions, the NOG1 gene in the plasmid was sequenced to confirm the integrity of the open reading frame. To generate GTP-binding-deficient nog1-g1, we performed site-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-GGGTTCCCCAACGTCGCTGCGGCAAGTTTCATGAACAA and 5′-CTTGTTCATGAAACTTGCCGCAGCGACGTTGGGGAACCC, which specify a GKS to AAA mutation in the G1 motif (amino acids 181–183) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The wild type and mutant NOG1 genes were excised using HindIII and XbaI and used to replace the CK2a1 gene in pLew-CK2α-Myc (27Park J.H. Brekken D.L. Randall A.C. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a derivative of Tet-regulated expression plasmid pLew79 (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). To generate tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged proteins (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), we used a pLew79 derivative modified by the addition of a sequence encoding the TAP tag (pLewTAP, a gift of Kenneth Stuart and Achim Schnaufer). Full-length NOG1 (sense primer above and antisense primer 5′-CCGGATCCGCGTCTGTCGCGTCTGCCGTTAG) and codons 335–667 (sense primer 5′-CGTTTCTAAGCTTATGTCCACAATCTACAAT and antisense primer as for full-length) were amplified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The fragments were excised with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the same sites in pLewTAP.A NOG1 gene fragment (nucleotides 4–488 relative to the start codon) was amplified by PCR with primers containing HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (sense primer, 5′-GCACTAAGCTTTCCACAATCTACAATTTCAAAACG and antisense primer 5′-GCTTACTCGAGGCAGTCGAGACATGTGTTGC). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and subcloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pZJM, an RNAi vector that contains convergent Tet-regulated promoters (a gift of Dr. Paul Englund) (29Wang Z.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).Polysome Analysis and Particle Purification—Polysome analysis was performed as described (30Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. NaCl was omitted from the buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) since it disrupted the association of NOG1 with the particle (similar to the NaCl-sensitive association of Obg with the ribosome (20Scott J.M. Ju J. Mitchell T. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2771-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Sucrose gradients were adjusted to 10–40%. Protease inhibitors were included (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 10 μm E-64). No GTP or GDP was present. Approximately 4 × 108 cells were separated on each 12-ml gradient by centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 230,000 × g for 2 h unless otherwise stated. Fractions were collected using an ISCO model 185 density gradient fractionator, with the polysome profile monitored at A 254. Aliquots of each fraction (20 μl, except where noted) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis.Procyclic form lysates expressing NOG1-TAP (2 × 108 cells) were prepared using the same buffers as for polysome analysis (except that RNasin was increased 3-fold) and added to a preincubated complex of rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and sheep anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynal). After 1 h at 4 °C, the complexes were washed 3 times, and the associated RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).Northern Analysis—Procyclic form RNA, prepared with TRIzol reagent, was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized with various RNA probes for ITS2 (a riboprobe), ITS3 (5′-ACGACAATCACTCACACACACATGGC), ITS5 (5′-TCATAAATGTTGTGTGCTGAGATGGC), and ITS7 (5′-TATGTAGTACCACACAGTGTGACGCG) as well as α-tubulin (a riboprobe) derived from the insert of plasmid pZJM. The probe spanning the junction between 5.8 S and ITS2 is 5′-TTGTTTTTATATTCGACACTGAGAA, where the underlined portion corresponds to ITS2 sequences.Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE 10% acrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with antibodies or antisera followed by horseradish peroxidase coupled to goat anti-rabbit Ig, goat anti-mouse Ig, or protein A and developed with the ECL or ECL Plus systems (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-TbNOG1 629L (14Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used at 1:500 to 1:5000, anti-Nopp44/46 (31Parsons M. Ledbetter J.A.

Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Sleath P.R. Parsons M. Reed S.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar) was used at 1:2500. For detection of TAP-tagged protein, blots were incubated with a mixture of rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase plus horseradish peroxidase coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG. For quantitative immunoblots, 125I-labeled protein A was used as the detection agent, and radioactivity was quantitated by phosphorimaging. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (35Das A. Park J.-H. Hagen C.B. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2615-2623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the blocking solution was 10% nonfat milk plus 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-NOG1, anti-Nopp44/46, and anti-Myc were used at 1:500, 1 μg/ml, and 5 μg/ml respectively. The TAP tag was detected using rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG.RESULTSNOG1 Co-sediments with the 60 S Ribosomal Subunit—Because the related B. subtilis Obg protein is associated with ribosomes, we tested whether NOG1 co-sediments with ribosomal particles in T. brucei. Cell lysates were prepared and fractionated over sucrose gradients. A substantial fraction of NOG1 was degraded in the cell lysate (Fig. 1B, lane T) despite the presence of a broad spectrum of protease inhibitors. The smaller immunoreactive species were not seen when cells were immediately boiled in SDS sample buffer (14Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other proteins did not show this high susceptibility to degradation (Fig. 1B).Shown in Fig. 1A is a polysome profile from a gradient in which the centrifugation time was increased over previous studies (30Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to better separate the 60 S and 80 S particles. Under these conditions the polysomes, which represent mRNA molecules being translated by increasing numbers of ribosomes, are not well resolved. Fractions from the gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting to determine where the NOG1 proteins localized within the gradient (Fig. 1B). Two peaks of NOG1 (Fig. 1B) were seen in the gradient fractions. The first peak, which contained the bulk of the degraded protein and little intact NOG1, was at the top of the gradient with the soluble proteins (Fig. 1B, fractions 1–7). The second peak, which contained the full-length protein (closed arrowhead) and a specific degradation product (open arrowhead), was further down the gradient in the region of the 60 S subunit (Fig. 1B, fractions 15–18). No significant amount of NOG1 was found in the fractions containing polysomes, indicating that NOG1 is not associated with translating ribosomes (Fig. 1B, fractions 23–24, fractions 25–31 are not shown).We monitored the presence of several other proteins in the gradients (Fig. 1B). The 60 S-associated protein P0 was present in the 60 S to 80 S region as well as in the polysomes, as expected for a protein functioning in the GTPase center of the ribosome (36Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both cytosolic and organellar forms of the monomeric protein phosphoglycerate kinase were localized predominantly at the top of the gradient. NOPP44/46, which can physically associate with NOG1 (14Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sedimented as a soluble protein under the conditions employed (not shown).NOG1 Association with Ribosomal RNA Precursors—To verify that the NOG1-containing particle was indeed the 60 S ribosomal precursor, we tested whether it contained rRNA precursors. The ribosomal DNA locus encodes the small subunit rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 6 RNAs that together correspond to the large subunit rRNA. Because neither the intermediates nor the full sequence of processing events have been defined in the parasite, we probed Northern blots with sequences corresponding to ITS2, ITS3, ITS5, and ITS7 (Fig. 2B), identifying RNA processing intermediates shown in Fig. 2A. We detected the previously described precursors of 10 (the primary transcript), 5.9, and 0.61 kb (a 5.8 S precursor) (37Hartshorne T. Toyofuku W. Hollenbaugh J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 733-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Also seen was the 5.1-kb intermediate containing ITS3, ITS5, and ITS7 (but not ITS2). In addition, we identified two precursors that hybridized only to ITS3 (3.9 and 0.56 kb) and two that hybridized only to ITS7 (0.52 and 0.36 kb). No precursors that hybridized solely to ITS5 were detected using probes to two different regions.Fig. 2T. brucei rRNA processing intermediates. A, schematic of early events in rRNA processing in T. brucei (47Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LSU1, LSU2, SR1, SR2, SR4, SR6, and 5.8 S are all components of the 60 S ribosome. In addition to those species previously described, transcripts marked by an asterisk were identified from the current study. Boxes delimit the regions of the mature rRNAs. Transcripts detected by the ITS7 probe have not been characterized to determine whether they are precursors of SR 4 or SR6. The intermediates are lettered in correspondence with Fig. 2B, and sizes are indicated. The transcript shown in brackets is seen in cells depleted for NOG1 (see Fig. 4). B, Northern analysis of rRNA precursors in total RNA. RNA was isolated from TREU667 procyclic forms separated on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes.

These antibodies react with the C terminus of NOG1 and were able to efficiently precipitate TbNOG1 when expressed in S. cerevisiae. 2B. C. Jensen, unpublished results. However, only a small percentage of the protein could be precipitated from T. brucei lysates even at higher antibody concentrations. This suggests that the NOG1 epitopes are obscured, potentially by being present in a particle, when expressed in its native organism. Therefore, we turned to a cell line expressing NOG1 with a TAP tag at the C terminus in a Tet-inducible system. The TAP tag contains a calmodulin binding domain followed two Ig binding domains of protein A (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). In cell lysates, the protein A domain was exposed to affinity reagents, whereas the calmodulin domain was not. 2B. C. Jensen, unpublished results. We collected NOG1-TAP using a combination of rabbit antibodies (to bind protein A) and sheep anti-rabbit Ig coupled to magnetic beads. Similar purifications were done on the parental line 29-13 (Fig. 3) and uninduced cells (not shown). RNA was isolated and assayed for the presence of rRNA precursors and tubulin. Ethidium bromide staining showed that mature rRNAs were not present, but some higher molecular weight species were detected in the NOG1-TAP samples (not shown). The first cleavage event occurs in ITS2, and probing with this sequence showed that the 5.9-kb precursor as well as the 0.61-kb product was present in the NOG1-TAP complexes (Fig. 3). Probing with ITS3 (Fig. 3) also showed the 5.9- and 5.1-kb precursors, but the 3.9-kb transcript was not highly enriched. We could not assess whether the 0.56-kb ITS3-containing precursor was significantly enriched due to the weak signal in total RNA plus trailing of degraded RNA into the small RNA region. Probing with ITS7 confirmed the presence the two larger transcripts, but the presence of the smaller transcripts was equivocal.Fig. 3Northern analysis of RNA co-precipitated with NOG1. RNA was isolated from affinity purification with NOG1-TAP or untransfected 29-13 cells. As a control, 1 μg of total RNA was loaded (Tot); also shown is a 10-fold darker exposure of that lanes (10X Tot). After separation on a 1.5% agarose gel, the samples were hybridized with probes to ITS2, ITS3, and ITS7 to detect 60 S precursors as well as a probe to α-tubulin to test specificity. The band labeled αT in the ITS7 probing is a residual signal left from probing for α-tubulin. The sizes of the bands seen are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitation by phosphorimaging showed that ∼10-fold more of the 5.9 and 5.1 precursors were present in the NOG1-TAP precipitates than in 1 μg of total RNA. In contrast, in TAP purifications from the non-expressing parental line 29-13, the signal associated with these transcripts was 9-fold less than that seen in 1 μg of total RNA. As a specificity control, we assessed the abundance of a non-ribosomal RNA, α-tubulin, in the precipitates by Northern analysis and phosphorimaging. Whether isolated from control or NOG1-TAP purifications, the amount of α tubulin RNA was only a few percent that seen in 1 μg of RNA (NOG1-TAP averaged 2.5%, 29-13 averaged 0.2%). Thus, there is a cumulative 360-fold enrichment of ITS3-containing precursors in the NOG1-TAP purification compared with tubulin. The specific enrichment of 60 S ITS sequences in NOG1-TAP purification demonstrates that the NOG1-containing particles are precursors to the 60 S subunit.Reduction in NOG1 Results in a Defect in Ribosome Biogenesis—To assess the functional association of NOG1 and ribosome biogenesis, we used double-stranded RNAi to reduce the level of NOG1. A fragment of NOG1 corresponding to the 5′ end of the coding region was inserted into the RNAi vector pZJM, which allows expression of the double-stranded RNA to be regulated by Tet. When RNAi was induced by the addition of Tet, the growth of the cells slowed and eventually stopped (Fig. 4A). As with most other RNAi experiments in T. brucei where the construct confers a deleterious effect, a resistant population grew out somewhat later. At day 8 after induction, the levels of NOG1, estimated by quantitative immunoblot analysis and phosphorimaging, were reduced to 7% of the uninduced level (Fig. 4B). Data were normalized to the levels of the control protein, cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase.Fig. 4NOG1 RNAi causes a defect in 60 S biogenesis. Procyclic forms (29-13) were stably transfected with a construct that allows the Tet-induced expression of double-stranded RNA corresponding to NOG1, causing partial depletion of NOG1. A, growth curve. The cell numbers were measured by particle counting, and cumulative cell density was calculated adjusting for dilutions required to maintain cultures. B, immunoblot analysis. Day 8 lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-NOG1 followed by 125I-labeled protein A. C, polysome analysis. Day 8 lysates (same cells as shown in panel B) were fractionated on analytical sucrose gradients. The inset is a magnification of the region of the gradient containing mRNAs translated by either two or three ribosomes. Arrowheads point to half-mer peaks seen in NOG1-depleted cells. D, Northern analysis. RNA was prepared on day 8 after the addition of Tet to the NOG1 RNAi line or its parent 29-13. The blots were probed with ITS2, ITS3, and a probe spanning the junction of 5.8 S rRNA and ITS2. A novel cleavage product appears at 2.6 kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sucrose density gradient fractionation of day-8 cells revealed a dramatic decrease in the abundance of 60 S subunits as well as the presence of half-mers (shoulders on the polysome peaks) (Fig. 4C). Half-mers are seen for S. cerevisiae mutants defective in 60 S biogenesis and result from a bottleneck in assembly of the 60 S subunit onto the 40 S-mRNA complex (see for example Refs. 38Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford J.L.J. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 39Zanchin N.I. Roberts P. DeSilva A. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5001-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tet induction had no effect on the polysome profile of the parental line 29-13. These data demonstrate that NOG1 is required for 60 S biogenesis.To assess whether knockdown of NOG1 was associated with specific defects in rRNA processing, RNA was isolated from cells on day 8 after induction of RNAi. Blots were hybridized with a probe to ITS2, which showed the accumulation of an atypical RNA at 2.6 kb. This species did not hybridize to ITS3 or to ITS1 probes, but it did hybridize to a probe spanning the junction of the 5.8 S rRNA and ITS2. This mapping indicates that the atypical intermediate likely spans 5.8 S through LSU1, with a cleavage in ITS3 just after LSU1 (see Fig. 2A). Although this molecule does not accumulate to a significant degree in wild type cells, a low level of hybridization in that region suggests that it may be an alternative processing intermediate.Both Domains"

MTM1 and MTM2 are mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 4B), respectively, although the mechanisms whereby MTM dysfunction leads to these diseases is unknown. To gain insight into MTM function, we undertook the study of MTMs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses representative homologues of the four major subgroups of MTMs identified in mammals. As in mammals, we found that C. elegans MTMs mediate distinct functions. let-512 (vps34) encodes the C. elegans homologue of the yeast and mammalian homologue of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34. We found that reduction of mtm-6 (F53A2.8) function by RNA inhibition rescued the larval lethality of let-512 (vps34) mutants and that the reduction of mtm-1 (Y110A7A.5) activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals. Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also function as positive regulators of biological processes.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The founding member of this gene family, MTM1, was identified originally because it was mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (3Laporte J. Hu L.J. Kretz C. Mandel J.L. Kioschis P. Coy J.F. Klauck S.M. Poustka A. Dahl N. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Individuals with a mutant MTM1 gene exhibit a severe congenital myopathy resulting from an arrest in muscle differentiation during embryogenesis. A second gene, MTM2, has been shown to be mutated in a number of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome type 4B (4Bolino A. Muglia M. Conforti F.L. LeGuern E. Salih M.A. Georgiou D.M.

CMT is a hereditary demylinating peripheral neuropathy involving a defect in the folding pattern of Schwann cells. The MTM family is conserved with at least 10 members identified in mammals (1Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin.

Sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons have led to the division of MTMs into at least four subgroups, of which one lacks phosphatase activity due to an alteration in an essential catalytic residue. Although MTM proteins with catalytic activity were initially thought to function as dual-function protein phosphatases (3Laporte J. Hu L.J. Kretz C. Mandel J.L. Kioschis P. Coy J.F. Klauck S.M.

Bolhuis P.A. Fardeau M. Samson F. Bertini E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1505-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), recent evidence indicates that MTMs function primarily as lipid phosphatases to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) (3)P (7Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In particular, recombinant MTMs are 20–500,000× more active using PI(3)P as a substrate compared with protein substrates, and overexpression of a substrate-trapping MTM mutant led to a 2-fold increase in PI(3)P levels (7Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, a deletion of the MTM gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp-MTM) led to an increase in PI(3)P levels, whereas the overexpression of hMTM1 led to a reduction of PI(3)P levels (8Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PI(3)P is one of four known lipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI(3)P is primarily regulated by class III PI3-kinases (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R.

Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Class III PI3-kinases are evolutionarily conserved with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme Vps34p, the prototypic member of this group (11Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In contrast to other phospho-lipid products, PI(3)P is present constitutively in all mammalian cells. Genetic studies of vps34 in yeast and its mammalian homologue have demonstrated critical roles for VPS34 in protein trafficking, endocytosis, pinocytosis, and autophagy (12Stenmark H. Gillooly D.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem.

Formation of PI(3)P on specific endosomal membranes acts to recruit proteins containing FYVE or Phox homology domains that can directly bind PI(3)P and can function as downstream effectors of class III PI3Ks (15Corvera S.

PI(3)P levels can also be directly generated by the class II PI3K as well as by the dephosphorylation of the class I PI3-kinase products PI3,4(P)2 and PI3,4,5(P)3 by 4 and 5 PI-phosphatase (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 10Katso R.

MTMs have been proposed to function as negative regulators of PI(3)P levels in a manner analogous to the regulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4,5)P3 by the PI3 phosphatase PTEN (1Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Laporte J. Blondeau F. Buj-Bello A. Mandel J.L. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, although only a single PTEN isoform has been identified, MTMs constitute a large family of PI(3)P phosphatase with at least some family members performing non-redundant functions. The mechanism(s) that accounts for the specific non-redundant functions of different MTMs is unknown. In addition, although PTEN is the only enzyme capable of dephosphorylating the 3 phosphate in PI(3,4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3)P signaling can be terminated by several mechanisms that are independent of MTM function. For example, PI(3)P signaling in yeast can be inhibited by the phosphorylation of PI(3)P at the 5 position by Fab1p, a PI3,5-kinase, as well as by hydrolysis of PI(3)P in the yeast vacuole (19Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The multitude of MTMs and alternative mechanisms for modulating PI(3)P levels suggest that MTMs might function in the regulation of only specific pools of PI(3)P in specific subcellular contexts. Presently, a direct link between an MTM and the regulation of specific subcellular pools of PI(3)P or a specific biologic function has not been made. Several possibilities could explain the specific functions of MTMs and why MTM1 and MTMR2 are not functionally redundant to either each other or to other MTM family members. MTMs could function non-redundantly to regulate PI(3)P if they exhibited unique cell expression patterns or localize to unique subcellular compartments within a given cell. In fact, it has recently been shown that MTM1 and MTM2 exhibit over-lapping but distinct patterns of subcellular localization when overexpressed in a muscle cell line (20Kim S.A. Taylor G.S. Torgersen K.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4526-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Alternatively, MTMs could dephosphorylate targets other than PI(3)P (5Cui X. De Vivo I. Slany R. Miyamoto A. Firestein R. Cleary M.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to dephosphorylating PI(3)P, hMTM1 has been shown to dephosphorylate Vps34 when expressed in S. pombe, and MTMR3 has been shown to dephosphorylate both PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3)P (8Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function and regulation of MTMs, we explored the roles of MTMs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans Methods and Strains—Standard methods for culturing and handling C. elegans strains were used (31Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following mutations were used in our studies: KR1440, dpy-5(e61) let-512(h797) unc-13(e450) I; sDp2 (I;f); KR890, dpy-5(e61) let-512(h510) unc-13(e450)I; sDp2(I;f) (21McDowall J.S. Rose A.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 60-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Transgenic Worms—Green fluorescence protein (GFP) transcriptional reporter constructs were generated by first amplifying 2–4 kb of DNA 5′ to the predicted ATG start sites using PCR and wild type C. elegans genomic DNA and then cloning this fragment into the vector pPD96.62 (gift of A. Fire) upstream and in-frame to the nuclear localization signal-GFP coding sequences The promoter region amplified for mtm-6 (F53A2.8) corresponded to nucleotides 25,981–29,300 of cosmid F53A2, mtm-3 (T24A11.1) corresponded to nucleotides 20,213–22,695 of T24A11, and mtm-1 (Y110A7A.5) corresponded to nucleotides 33304–34510 of YAC Y110A7A. Extrachromosomal arrays were generated by co-injecting GFP reporter constructs with the lin-15 rescuing plasmid, pSK1 (22Clark S.G. Lu X. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1994; 137: 987-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), into lin-15(n765ts) animals. MTM-6::GFP full-length (amino acids 1–677) and MTM-1::GFP (amino acids 1–592) fusion proteins were generated by amplifying the complete coding region from the cDNA by PCR and cloning in-frame with the GFP coding sequences in the plasmid pPD95.75 (gift of A. Fire) containing the mtm-6 promoter sequences. The GFP-MTM-6 mutant lacking the GRAM (glucosyltransferase, Rab-like GTPase activators and myotubularins) domain was deleted in the first 38 amino acids (delta 3–38), whereas the GFP-MTM-6 mutant lacking the FYVE domain was truncated at amino acids 596 (amino acids 1–596) using PCR. cDNA clones, YK31h5 and YK114h02 for MTM-6 and MTM-1, respectively, were provided by Y. Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). GFP expression was visualized using an epifluorescence microscopy using the Leica DMRE or by the Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. RNA Inhibition (RNAi)—RNAi was performed by injecting double-stranded RNA or by the method of RNAi feeding (23Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Coding regions of MTMs were amplified using PCR and genomic DNA and then were cloned into topo 1 (Invitrogen). For RNAi by injection, RNA was synthesized in vitro and injected into L4 animals. The F1 progeny were screened. For RNAi by feeding, the appropriate coding regions of each gene were cloned into the vector L4440 (gift of A. Fire). HT115(DE3) E. coli containing the RNAi plasmids were grown overnight, and one drop of bacteria was plated onto nematode growth media plates containing 6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and carbenicillin (25 μg/ml) per plate. After drying, L4 stage hermaphrodites were placed onto each plate and F1 progeny were scored. The region amplified for mtm-6 corresponded to nucleotides 25,981–29,300 of cosmid F53A2, mtm-3 corresponded to nucleotides 13658–14397 of T24A11, mtm-1 corresponded to nucleotides 35648–36121 of YAC Y110A7A, mtm-5 (ceSBF1) corresponded to nucleotides 38975–39395 of H28G03.6, cup-10 (mtmr-9) corresponded to nucleotides 38975–39395 of YAC Y39H10A (1Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and class II PI3-kinase corresponded to nucleotides 11235–11764 of F39B1. Localization of GFP::2XT10G3.5-FVYE—C. elegans expressing the tandem FYVE domains of T10G3.5 were a gift from F. Muller and have been previously described (24Roggo L. Bernard V. Kovacs A.L. Rose A.M. Savoy F. Zetka M. Wymann M.P. Muller F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP::2XT10G3.5-FVYE was induced in transgenic worms by heat shocking worms at 30 °C for 30 min. Coelomocyte Uptake of GFP—arIs37(pmyo-3::ssGFP) animals express GFP with a signal sequence in the body wall muscles that is secreted into the pseudocoelomic cavity (25Fares H. Greenwald I. Genetics. 2001; 159: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). The secreted GFP is endocytosed by coelomocytes and subsequently degraded. Worms with defective endocytotosis accumulate GFP in the pseudocoelomic cavity and exhibit diffuse green fluorescence with only low levels of fluorescence observed in the coelomocytes, whereas wild type worms exhibit bright green intracellular staining of coelomocytes with low levels of fluoresence seen in the pseudocoelomic cavity. Analysis of MTM Function in C. elegans—Mammalian MTMs have been divided into four major subgroups on the basis of sequence comparisons (2Laporte J. Blondeau F. Buj-Bello A. Mandel J.L. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Analysis of the C. elegans genomic sequence identified five MTMs with one gene corresponding to each of the three subgroups of the PTPase live mammalian MTM and two genes belonging to the anti-phosphatase or catalytically inactive subgroup (Fig. 1). Based on sequence homology to mammalian MTMs, the phosphatase live MTM F53A2.8 is referred to as mtm-6, T24A11.1 as mtm-3, and Y110A7A.5 as mtm-1, whereas the phosphatase inactive MTM CeH28G03.6 is referred to as mtm-5. CeY39H10A.3, which is also a phosphatase inactive MTM, is most similar to the mammalian MTMR-9, although it is also referred to as coelomocyte uptake defective (cup)-10 based on its identification in a genetic screen to identify genes that mediate fluid phase uptake in coelomocytes (Fig. 1 and Table I) (1Wishart M.J.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the function of the MTMs in C elegans, MTM gene activity was reduced by RNAi. mtm-3 (RNAi) animals exhibited a mild egg laying defect, whereas animals injected with RNAi against the other myotubularins appeared unaffected. The egg laying defect observed in mtm-3 (RNAi) animals was not enhanced if one or more of the other MTMs were co-inactivated by RNAi. Simultaneous RNAi of two or more MTMs also failed to elicit obvious phenotypes, aside from that seen with mtm-3 alone. Together, these results suggest that other MTMs do not act redundantly with mtm-3 in normal egg laying. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that MTMs perform some functions that are not seen by RNAi injection due to the failure of RNAi to inactivate all MTM function. Interestingly, two other MTMs, mtm-6 and mtmr-9, were found in a separate set of experiments to function in endocytosis in C. elegans. Mutations in both genes were identified in a screen to identify genes required for the endocytosis by coelomocytes of GFP secreted from body wall muscles into the body cavity and have been referred to previously as coelomocyte uptake-defective genes (25Fares H. Greenwald I. Genetics. 2001; 159: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, RNAi of vps34 as well as of mtm-3 have been shown to inhibit celomocyte uptake of GFP using this assay (Ref. 25Fares H. Greenwald I. Genetics. 2001; 159: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). These findings indicate that both vps34 and MTM family members play essential roles in fluid phase endocytosis in coelomocytes. RNAi of C. elegans mtm-6 Rescues Larval Lethality of let-512 Mutants—let-512 encodes the only C. elegans vps34 homologue. let-512 mutants typically die during the L3 to L4 larval stages (24Roggo L. Bernard V. Kovacs A.L. Rose A.M. Savoy F. Zetka M. Wymann M.P. Muller F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We tested whether inactivation of MTM function by RNAi could rescue the late larval lethality of let-512 mutants to investigate whether MTMs function as PI(3)P phosphatases. Only inhibition of mtm-6 (F53A2.8) function by RNAi rescued let-512 larval lethality (Fig. 2). We used the let-512(h797) strain KR1440, which is homozygous for dpy-5, let-512, and unc-13 on chromosome I and contains the free duplication sDP2 that covers dpy-5 and let-512. Animals that harbor sDP2 are rescued for the dpy-5 and let-512 phenotypes and are viable, whereas animals that lack sDP2 are Dpy, Let, and Unc die as larvae. Rescue of the lethal phenotype produce animals that are Dpy Unc adults. Therefore we assayed rescue of the let-512 phenotype by the presence of adult Dpy animals. We failed to identify any surviving adult Let-512 Dpy-5 (Unc) animals from either uninjected (0 Dpy/112 non-Dpy) or control injected (0 Dpy/86 non-Dpy) animals. By contrast, inactivation of mtm-6 by RNAi injection allowed let-512 mutants to survive to the adult stage, as evidenced by the presence of adult Dpy Unc animals. From several injected animals, 45 adult Dpy Unc animals and 91 non-Dpy Unc animals were recovered (45 Dpy/91 non-Dpy) (Fig. 2). The rescued let-512 mutants produced embyros that failed to hatch. We also tested four other let-512 alleles and observed similar results, indicating that rescue was specific for the let-512 mutation. Using the same RNAi protocol, the inactivation of mtm-1 or mtm-3, either alone or in combination, did not rescue the lethality of the let-512 mutant (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The inactivation of mtm-6 and a second MTM, either mtm-1 or mtm-3, produced a similar level of rescue to that observed by inactivating mtm-6 alone (Fig. 1). These findings suggest that only mtm-6 functions in the let-512-mediated pathway required for larval development, as only inactivation of mtm-6 rescued lethality. Sequence analysis of the coding region of one of the let-512 mutants rescued by mtm-6 (RNAi), KR890: dpy-5(e61) let-512(h510) unc-13(e450)I; sDp2(I;f), revealed an A to G transition mutation that is predicted to generate a termination codon at residue 168 in the LET-512 protein. As this lesion would produce a truncated LET-512 protein that lacks the PI3-kinase catalytic domain, it likely eliminates all activity and would represent a null allele. This data indicates that LET-512 cannot be the source responsible for generating PI(3)P in the let512 mutants rescued by mtm-6 (RNAi) and would indicate that PI(3)P must be generated by other PI3-kinases in mtm-6(RNAi) let-512 rescued animals. C. elegans has a class I PI3-kinase, encoded by age-1, and a class II PI3-kinase, encoded by F39B1.1. Class II PI3-kinases can generate PI(3)P both directly by acting on PI and indirectly by generating PI(3,4)P2, which can then be dephosphorylated at the 4 position to generate PI(3)P. To determine whether the F39B1.1 might provide PI3K activity in the let-512 mutants we determined whether rescue of let-512 mutants in worms injected with mtmt-6 (RNAi) is inhibited by co-injecting F39B1.1 (RNAi). Injection of F39B1.1 (RNAi) together with mtm-6 (RNAi) reduced the rescue of let-512 mutants by 80% (8 adult Dpy Let-512 Unc animals and 76 non-Dpy non-Let Unc Dpy) compared with worms injected with mtm-6 (RNAi) alone (45 Dpy Let-512 Unc animals and 91 non-Dpy non-Let Unc Dpy). The failure to rescue was not due to toxicity induced by F39B1.1 (RNAi) because injection of F39B1.1 (RNAi) by itself in control N2 worms did not result in toxicity. Thus, these findings suggest that in the setting of reduced MTM function, a class II PI3K can compensate for the loss of let-512 function. Expression Pattern of the MTMs—As most mammalian MTMs are expressed ubiquitously (1Wishart M.J. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Laporte J. Blondeau F. Buj-Bello A. Mandel J.L. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the functional differences observed for each MTM is unlikely a consequence of expression pattern differences. We examined the pattern of MTM gene expression in C. elegans using transcriptional GFP reporters. DNA sequences upstream of the predicted ATGs of the three catalytically active MTMs were used to drive expression of a nuclear localization signal-GFP fusion protein, and the GFP expression was visualized by fluoresence microscopy (Fig. 3). We found that each MTM exhibited a relatively specific pattern of expression that overlapped minimally with other MTMs. mtm-6::gfp was expressed predominantly in intestinal cells, whereas mtm-3::gfp was expressed predominantly in neurons in the head with a low level of expression also detected in posterior intestinal cells which is a common artifact for GFP expression vectors. Reporter expression of mtm-1 was seen mostly in a few neurons in the head and in the tail. These observations reveal that each of the phosphatase active MTMs exhibit a unique expression pattern. Interestingly, we observed the highest levels of let-512::gfp expression in the intestine, which corresponds to the tissue with the high levels of mtm-6::gfp expression (Fig. 3). Thus, the rescue of let-512 mutants by mtm-6 (RNAi) likely reflects a rescue of intestinal defect. Although this analysis suggests that these MTMs might have non-overlapping expression patterns, the caveat is that these reporter constructs are not showing all the tissues in which these genes are expressed. This is exemplified by the fact that we know that both MTM-1 and MTM-6 function in coelomocytes, yet we do not see GFP in this tissue using these reporters. Cellular Localization of MTMs—MTMs contain several domains that might function in subcellular targeting of MTMs via either protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions. As such, individual MTMs might be targeted to different subcellular domains and regulate discrete pools of PI(3)P. To determine the subcellular localization of mtm-6, a full-length MTM-6-GFP fusion protein was expressed under the mtm-6 promoter. We observed the MTM-6-GFP fusion protein at high levels in a uniform pattern associated with the apical membrane of the intestinal cell (Fig. 4). By contrast, expression of GFP alone, or a GFP fusion protein containing only the MTM-6 FYVE domain, exhibited a diffuse cytosolic expression in the intestine (Fig. 4). We also expressed a full-length MTM-1-GFP fusion protein in the intestine using the mtm-6 promoter and found that it exhibited a cytosolic localization, which was indistinguishable from GFP alone (Fig. 4). These results indicate that MTM-6 is localized to the apical membrane and that MTMs can have distinct subcellular distributions within the same cell. To ascertain which domain of MTM-6 F53A2.8 is needed for apical localization, we examined the subcellular localization of MTM-6-GFP fusion proteins containing various regions of the MTM-6 protein. MTM-6 contains a putative amino-terminal GRAM domain, a PTP catalytic domain, a set interaction domain (SID), and a carboxyl-terminal FYVE domain. The GRAM domain is a novel 70 amino acid domain located at the amino terminus of several MTMs and has been proposed to act as an intracellular protein or lipid-binding signaling module (26Doerks T. Strauss M. Brendel M. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 483-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The SID was identified initially on the basis of its interaction with the SET domain of the Hrx protooncogene (5Cui X. De Vivo I. Slany R. Miyamoto A. Firestein R. Cleary M.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and might also mediate protein-protein interactions. Although both MTM-6 and MTM-1 contain putative GRAM and SID domains, only MTM-6 contains a FYVE domain, suggesting that this domain might target MTM-6 to the plasma membrane. However, neither the GRAM nor the FYVE domains are required for apical targeting as MTM-6-GFP"

This capacity is markedly attenuated in mature animals and humans greater than 2 years of age. Few studies have investigated biological differences between juvenile and adult osteoblasts that mediate successful osteogenesis. To identify possible mechanisms for this clinical observation, we investigated cellular and molecular differences between primary osteoblasts derived from juvenile (2-day-old) and adult (60-day-old) rat calvaria. Data demonstrated that juvenile osteoblasts contain a subpopulation of less differentiated cells as observed by spindle-like morphology and decreased osteocalcin production. Juvenile, compared with adult, osteoblasts showed increased proliferation and adhesion. Furthermore, following rhFGF-2 stimulation juvenile osteoblasts increased expression of collagen Iα1 (5-fold), osteopontin (13-fold), and osteocalcin (16-fold), compared with relatively unchanged adult osteoblasts. Additionally, juvenile osteoblasts organized and produced more matrix proteins and formed 41-fold more bone nodules. Alternatively, adult osteoblasts produced more FGF-2 and preferentially translated the high molecular weight (22 kDa) form. Although adult osteoblasts transcribed more FGF-R1 and juvenile osteoblasts transcribed more FGF-R2 at baseline levels, juvenile osteoblasts translated more FGF-R1 and -R2 and showed increased phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings begin to explain why juvenile, but not adult, osteoblasts successfully heal calvarial defects.

Since this osteogenic capacity rapidly diminishes, older children and adults with non-healing cranial defects present a difficult reconstructive challenge and a substantial biomedical burden. Studies have documented a paracrine interaction between the underlying juvenile dura mater and the overlying cranial osteoblasts during the bone induction processes of calvarial morphogenesis, cranial suture fusion, and calvarial ossification (3Bradley J.P.

Previous studies have focused on the cellular and molecular differences between juvenile and adult dura mater, which are critical to calvarial bone induction. In contrast, few studies have investigated the effects of age on the cellular and molecular differences between juvenile and adult-derived calvarial osteoblasts (11de Pollak C. Arnaud E. Renier D. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Developmentally, mesenchymal cells enter the osteoblastic lineage and undergo a spatial and temporal progression (12Mansukhani A. Bellosta P. Sahni M. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Frenkel B. Montecino M. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 69-86Google Scholar). Early pre-osteoblasts proliferate before maturing into bone-producing osteoblasts. Osteoblasts direct osteogenesis through the production of extracellular matrix, mineralization of matrix, and regulation of bone remodeling through resorption and deposition. For osteoblasts to proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and eventually form bone, they must be able to produce and organize a variety of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix molecules. As osteoblasts adhere to a new environment, they initially attach to fibronectin and the cell body begins to flatten (14LeBaron R.G. Athanasiou K.A. Tissue Eng. 2000; 6: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At this point, the cell organizes its actin bundles and cytoskeletal proteins including integrins. These molecules then signal the cell to enter either a proliferative or differentiated state. Progression of osteoblast differentiation corresponds to sequential gene expression. Proliferative pre-osteoblasts express early markers of differentiation including runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and collagen Iα1 (15Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). As osteoblasts mature they begin to express intermediate markers of differentiation including osteopontin, an extracellular matrix protein associated with matrix formation and maturation (17Zur Nieden N.I. Kempka G. Ahr H.J. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mature osteoblasts express the extracellular matrix protein osteocalcin, which is associated with increased matrix mineralization and decreased proliferation (18Candeliere G.A. Liu F. Aubin J.E. Bone. 2001; 28: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The progression of osteoblast differentiation and the expression of the previously mentioned genes are tightly regulated by several factors including fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

Heath J.K. Ishimaru T. Eto K. Morriss-Kay G.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3375-3384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 exerts its biological effect upon binding to its receptors (FGF-R 1–4) for differential regulation of osteogenesis (31Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). These tyrosine kinase receptors become phosphorylated upon FGF-2 binding and activate ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways (32Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). While FGF-R3 and -R4 are restricted to areas of growth plate development and cranial musculature respectively, FGF-R1 and -R2 are found in areas of the frontal and parietal bones and coronal sutures (23Iseki S. Wilkie A.O. Morriss-Kay G.M. Development. 1999; 126: 5611-5620PubMed Google Scholar, 33Moore R. Ferretti P. Copp A. Thorogood P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FGF-R1 transcription is associated with highly differentiated osteoblasts, while FGF-R2 transcription is associated with more proliferative osteoblasts (23Iseki S. Wilkie A.O. Morriss-Kay G.M. Development. 1999; 126: 5611-5620PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 binds with equal affinity to FGF-R1 and -R2 (31Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J.

To investigate the effects of age on osteoblast biology and assess FGF-2 signaling in this system, we established primary juvenile (2-day-old) and adult (60-day-old) rat calvarial osteoblast cultures. The data demonstrated that juvenile osteoblast cultures, as compared with adult osteoblast cultures, contained a larger subpopulation of less differentiated immature cells, as indicated by spindle-like morphology and decreased osteocalcin production. Additionally, juvenile osteoblasts showed increased proliferation, attachment, and expression of osteogenic genes in response to rhFGF-2. Juvenile osteoblasts increased production and organization of several key cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins as well as increased bone nodule formation 41-fold. Finally, juvenile osteoblasts produced less FGF-2 protein, while demonstrating increased FGF-R1 and -R2 mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation upon stimulation. These results suggest that FGF-2 caused juvenile osteoblasts to initially increase proliferation and later to become more differentiated, while it had little effect on adult osteoblasts. Taken together, the data begin to demonstrate the competency of juvenile, but not adult, animals to respond to FGF-2 stimulation and successfully orchestrate calvarial osteogenesis. Cells and Culture Conditions—All experiments were performed in accordance with Stanford University Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA). For all animals, the first day of life was considered the first day after birth. Animals were housed in light and temperature controlled facilities and given food and water ad labitum. Osteoblasts were harvested from juvenile (2-day-old) and adult (60-day-old) rats (28Spector J.A. Greenwald J.A. Warren S.M. Bouletreau P.J. Crisera F.E. Mehrara B.J. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr.

In brief, calvariae were meticulously stripped free from dura mater and overlying pericranium, washed with serial dilutions of betadine in phosphate-buffered saline, then digested 5 times for 15 min in 0.2% dispase II and 0.1% collagenase A at 37 °C (digestions 3–5 were pooled for osteoblast cultures). Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Cultures were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% Fungizone (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were passed by trypsinization, plated in tissue culture dishes, and allowed to grow to subconfluence. Freshly harvested cells less than 4 passages were used for all experiments. Proliferation Assay—Proliferation rates were measured through cell counting and proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) Western blot analysis. 50,000 juvenile and adult osteoblasts were plated separately on tissue culture plates in triplicate. Cells were harvested each day post-plating and cell number was determined by counting with a hemacytometer. To determine the effects of FGF-2 on osteoblast proliferation, PCNA production was analyzed by Western blot analysis of cells grown to subconfluence in cell culture dishes with or without 10 ng/ml rhFGF-2 (Invitrogen) in DMEM with 1% FBS for 24 h. Assays were repeated at least three times and statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with *, p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Adhesion Assay—50,000 freshly isolated and first passage juvenile and adult osteoblasts were plated separately. At each time point (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 h) after plating, attached cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 0.25% crystal violet. Cell adhesion was measured by cell counting. Assays were repeated at least three times and statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with *, p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Immunofluorescence—The presence and organization of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix molecules was analyzed by immunofluorescence. 8000 juvenile and 16,000 adult first passage osteoblasts were seeded on 2.5% bovine serum albumin-coated 8-well Lab-Tek II Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Cells were cultured in media with 1% FBS overnight with or without 10 ng/ml rhFGF-2 stimulation. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X for 10 min, and blocked with 1% Triton-X/2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-integrin α1, anti-integrin α2, anti-integrin α3, anti-integrin β1, and anti-pFAK (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FGF-2, anti-vitronectin, anti-fibronectin, phalloidin (F-actin) (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and anti-osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for goat, mouse, and rabbit as well as DAPI nuclear stain were purchased from Molecular Probes. Nuclei were stained with 300 nm DAPI for 5 min then rinsed with water. Cover slips were mounted and fluorescence was enhanced with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Photographs were taken with the Zeiss AxioPlan Immunofluorescence microscope equipped with Zeiss AxioCam HRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Controls for each antibody consisted of probing with the secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody. RNA Isolation and Purification—To study the mRNA expression profiles, 1.5 × 106 juvenile and adult osteoblasts were plated separately on 10-cm culture plates. Upon subconfluence, cells were cultured overnight in media containing 1% FBS and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml of rhFGF-2 protein. RNA was harvested after 1, 3, 5, 10, and 24 h of rhFGF-2 stimulation and isolated in 6 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total cellular RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA isolated from cells in serum-free media alone served as controls for all groups. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (Amersham Biosciences). Ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands was performed to confirm RNA integrity. Probe Preparation—Rat probes for collagen Iα1, osteopontin, and 18 S were 727, 532, and 334-base pair PCR-amplified fragments cloned into the EcoRI cloning sites of pCR2.1, respectively (35Mehrara B.J. Rowe N.M. Steinbrech D.S. Dudziak M.E. Saadeh P.B. McCarthy J.G. Gittes G.K. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1999; 103: 536-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Additionally, rat probes for FGF-R1 (forward 5′-CCCGGGGCATGGAGTATCTT-3′, reverse 5′-GCCACAATCCGGTCCAGGTCTTC-3′) and FGF-R2 (forward 5′-GCCCGGCCCTCCTTCAGTTTAG-3′, reverse 5′-GAGGATGGGCCGGTGTGGTG-3′) were amplified by RT-PCR. All PCR generated probes were sequenced to confirm sequence identity through BLAST search. For Northern blot analysis, 100 ng of each complementary DNA (cDNA) probe was labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) using Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unlabeled nucleotides using Sephadex G-50 DNA-grade Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences). A specific activity of at least 1 × 105 cpm/ml of cDNA probe was used for all experiments. Northern Blot Analysis—To determine relative mRNA expression levels in cell cultures, Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (28Spector J.A. Greenwald J.A. Warren S.M. Bouletreau P.J. Crisera F.E. Mehrara B.J. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2002; 109 (discussion 643–634): 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10–20 micrograms of total cellular RNA was fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to Nytran positively charged nylon membranes (Schleicher and Scheull, Keene, N.H.) and cross-linked by ultraviolet light (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were prehybridized with ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) at 68 °C for 1 h, followed by hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP labeled rat cDNA probe for 6 h at 68 °C. Stringency washes were performed with 1× sodium saline citrate (1× = 15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature for 10 min followed by 0.1× sodium saline citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 68 °C for 10–20 min. Membranes were exposed to phosphorimaging plates overnight and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Resulting images were quantified using ImageQuant image analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). Equal RNA loading and uniformity of blot transfer were assessed by stripping and reprobing the same membranes with a probe for rat 18 S. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Juvenile and adult osteoblasts were grown to subconfluence then either harvested or stimulated with 10 ng/ml rhFGF-2 for 24 h. For analysis of receptor phosphorylation, cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml rhFGF-2 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma, stock of 200 mm in water, pH 10) for 15 min before harvesting cells. Cell cultures were scraped off the plate in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysate was harvested by incubating cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 4 °C and sheared with a syringe. Debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. For membrane preparation, cells were swelled in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) (36Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. Remaining supernatant sheared with a syringe and further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pelleted membrane associated proteins were then collected. Protein concentration was assessed with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). 50–200 μg of protein was boiled for 10 min then loaded onto a 6% or 15% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 5% stacking gel. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) 0.45-μm pore size, overnight at 20 V. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Membranes were probed with following antibodies: anti-FGF-2, anti-PCNA, anti-Flg (FGF-R1), anti-Bek (FGF-R2), or anti-p-Try (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for mouse and rabbit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and antibodies specific for goat were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Band intensity was quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad). Real-time PCR—Reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of total RNA from each time point using oligo(dT)-priming in separate 50-μl reactions according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Taqman® Reverse Transcription Reagent Kit; Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed in 20-μl reactions using Sybr Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) for 15 min at 95 °C for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min in the ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Each primer set was first tested to determine optimal concentrations, and products were run out on a 3% agarose gel to confirm the appropriate size. Each cDNA sample was evaluated separately for osteocalcin (forward 5′-GAGCTAGCGGACCACATTGG-3′, reverse 5′-GGCAACACATGCCCTAAACG-3′) and GAPDH (primer set purchased from Applied Biosystems). cDNA prepared from pooled samples was used to construct a standard curve for each gene. Values for each gene were normalized to expression levels of GAPDH. Assays were repeated at least 3 times and statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with *, p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Bone Nodule Staining—Bone nodule staining was performed to assess the ability of osteoblasts to form bone nodules. 400,000 juvenile and adult osteoblasts were plated in triplicate on 6-well tissue culture plates. Upon confluence, cells were cultured in differentiation media (BGJb media, 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% Fungizone) and monitored for 28 days. Bone nodules were stained using the Von Kossa method (28Spector J.A. Greenwald J.A. Warren S.M. Bouletreau P.J. Crisera F.E. Mehrara B.J. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2002; 109 (discussion 643–634): 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in formalin for 30 min, incubated with 1% aqueous silver nitrate for 15 min under UV light, stained with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min, and finally counter-stained with 1% Safranin O for 10 min. Photomicrographs of the bone nodules were analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Extent of Maturation in Juvenile and Adult Osteoblasts— Initial studies assessed states of differentiation in juvenile (2-day-old) and adult (60-day-old) rat calvarial osteoblasts based on properties of morphology and osteocalcin production. After 3 days in culture, freshly harvested juvenile and adult osteoblast cultures contained mixed populations of adherent cells; however, juvenile cultures contained a larger subpopulation of immature spindle-shaped cells, while adult cultures contained a larger subpopulation of mature cuboidal cells (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence for osteocalcin, a late marker of differentiation, demonstrated that adult osteoblast cultures showed uniform intense immunoreactivity for osteocalcin (91% positive), while juvenile osteoblast cultures had a mixed population of immunoreactive cells (57% positive) as compared with background fluorescence and nonspecific binding to control (NIH3T3) cells (Fig. 1B). Proliferation and Attachment Rates—Differences in morphology and osteocalcin production suggested varied states of differentiation between juvenile and adult osteoblasts and led to investigation of proliferation and attachment rates. Juvenile osteoblasts proliferated significantly faster than adult osteoblasts on days 3–12 (Fig. 2A). This result may have been due to the ability of juvenile osteoblasts to attach more rapidly than adult osteoblasts and transmit mitotic signals. Therefore, to investigate attachment rates, attached primary osteoblasts were quantitated over a 16-h period. The 16-h cutoff time was necessary to prevent contamination of results by cellular proliferation. Significantly more freshly harvested juvenile compared with adult osteoblasts attached to culture dishes throughout the study period (Fig. 2B). These differences were noted as early as a half-hour after plating. Furthermore, viability of the remaining floating cells was assessed at each time point to ensure that a decreased attachment rate was not a reflection of decreased viability. After 8 h, trypan blue exclusion indicated that 40% of the juvenile and 95% of the adult remaining floating cells were still viable (data not shown). These data may reflect the sensitivity of the juvenile cells to the harvesting process. To ensure that the attachment results were valid and not an after-affect of the harvesting process, first passage osteoblasts were assessed for attachment rates. These results were consistent with the initial attachment differences; significantly increased juvenile osteoblast attachment was noted at 4 h (Fig. 2C) and viability of remaining floating cells for both samples dropped to 30% by 8 h (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2159498694,"Replication of the segmented double-stranded (ds) RNA genome of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to use 10–12 different mRNAs as templates for (–) strand synthesis. Rotavirus serves as a model system for study of this process, since its RdRP (VP1) is catalytically active and can specifically recognize template mRNAs in vitro. Here, we have analyzed the requirements for template recognition by the rotavirus RdRP and compared those to the requirements for formation of (–) strand initiation complexes. The results show that multiple functionally independent recognition signals are present at the 3′-end of viral mRNAs, some positioned in nonconserved regions upstream of the highly conserved 3′-terminal consensus sequence. We also found that RdRP recognition signals are distinct from cis-acting signals that promote (–) strand synthesis, because deletions of portions of the 3′-consensus sequence that caused viral mRNAs to be poorly replicated in vitro did not necessarily prevent efficient recognition of the RNA by the RdRP. Although the RdRP alone can specifically bind to viral mRNAs, our analysis reveals that this interaction is not sufficient to generate initiation complexes, even in the presence of nucleotides and divalent cations. Rather, the formation of initiation complexes also requires the core lattice protein (VP2), a virion component that forms a T = 1 icosahedral shell that encapsidates the segmented dsRNA genome. The essential role that the core lattice protein has in (–) strand initiation provides a mechanism for the coordination of genome replication and virion assembly. Replication of the segmented double-stranded (ds) RNA genome of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to use 10–12 different mRNAs as templates for (–) strand synthesis.

The essential role that the core lattice protein has in (–) strand initiation provides a mechanism for the coordination of genome replication and virion assembly. Replication of the genome of most RNA viruses requires the specific recognition of template RNAs by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). 1The abbreviations used are: RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; dsRNA, double strand RNA; CS, consensus sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; nt, nucleotide(s); NonV, nonviral RNA. This event is followed by structural and positional changes of the RdRP that allow formation of the initiation complex and promoter escape (1Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Replication of the segmented double-stranded (ds)RNA genome of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family is complicated by the need of their RdRP to recognize 10–12 different template mRNAs (3Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2000; 277: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The initiation complexes that assemble from these RdRPs and mRNAs give rise to pre-virion cores, which catalyze the synthesis of one copy each of the multiple genome segments (4Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rotaviruses are the only members of Reoviridae whose replication process has been amenable to molecular dissection. Of particular importance for such studies has been the discovery that the rotavirus RdRP, whether purified from virions or expressed in recombinant form, has the capacity to specifically recognize template mRNAs and to catalyze the synthesis of full-length viral dsRNAs in fully definable in vitro systems free of host-derived components (5Chen D.Y. Zeng C.Q.-Y. Wentz M.J. Gorziglia M. Estes M.K. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7030-7039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The group A rotaviruses are the primary cause of acute dehydrating gastroenteritis in infants and young children throughout the world (8Kapikian A.Z. Hoshino Y. Chanock R.M. Knipe D. Howley M. Griffin O. Martin M. Lamb R. Roizman B. Straus S. Fields Virology. 4rth Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1787-1833Google Scholar). Their genome consists of 11 segments of dsRNA, each positioned at one of the vertexes of the T = 1 icosahedral core contained within the triple-layered rotavirus virion (9Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a segment of dsRNA, each vertex contains a copy of the RdRP, VP1 (10Valenzuela S. Pizarro J. Sandino A.M. Vasquez M. Fernandez J. Hernandez O. Patton J. Spencer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3964-3967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mRNA-capping enzyme, VP3 (11Chen D. Luongo C.L. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. Virology. 1999; 265: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The core lattice protein, VP2, forms the shell of the core and serves to anchor the core components VP1, VP3, and the genome (12Prasad B.V.V. Rothnagel R. Zeng C.Q.-Y. Jakana J. Lawton J.A. Chiu W. Estes M.K. Nature. 1996; 382: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Rotavirus entry is accompanied by the loss of the outer protein layer of the virion, yielding doublelayered particles, which catalyze the synthesis of the eleven viral mRNAs (13Estes M.K. Knipe D. Howley M. Griffin O. Martin M. Lamb R. Roizman B. Straus S. Fields Virology. 4rth Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1747-1785Google Scholar). The mRNAs direct protein synthesis and serve as templates for synthesis of (–) strand RNAs to form the dsRNA genome segments. The synthesis of the (–) strand RNAs occurs concurrently with the packaging of template mRNAs into nascent pre-virion cores and is coordinated such that packaging and replication lead to the formation of cores that contain one copy each of the eleven genome segments of dsRNA (4Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cores serve as intermediates in the morphogenesis of double- and triple-layered virus particles. The eleven rotavirus mRNAs possess 5′-methylated caps but lack 3′-poly(A) tails and share no sequence identity except at their termini (14Desselberger U. McCrae M.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 185: 31-66PubMed Google Scholar). For the group A rotaviruses, the mRNAs begin with the sequence 5′-GGC(U/A)7-3′ and, in most cases, end with the 3′-consensus sequence (3′CS), 5′-UGUGACC-3′ (14Desselberger U. McCrae M.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 185: 31-66PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mitchell D.B. Both G.W. Virology. 1990; 177: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell-free replication assays performed with disrupted virion-derived cores (open cores) have shown that viral mRNAs must contain the 3′CS or related sequence to serve as templates for (–) strand synthesis (16Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wentz M.J. Patton J.T. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7833-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional cis-acting signals are contained with viral mRNAs that enhance but are not essential for (–) strand synthesis (16Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enhancing signals are located at the 5′-end and upstream of the 3′CS at the 3′-end of the viral mRNAs. The 5′ and 3′ enhancing signals are believed to base pair in cis to form panhandle structures from which the 3′CS extends as a single-stranded tail (18Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7387-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the panhandle structure may be to ensure that the 3′CS is sterically accessible to the RdRP. Indeed, modifications made to the mRNA that alter the panhandle structure or that convert the 3′CS from a single-stranded to double-stranded form inhibit dsRNA synthesis (19Chen D. Barro M. Spencer E. Patton J.T. Virology. 2001; 281: 221-229Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Barro M. Chen D. Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2001; 288: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, both sequence and structure are critical factors influencing the ability of rotavirus mRNAs to function as templates in replication. Although electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) have demonstrated that the RdRP specifically recognizes signals located at the 3′-end of rotavirus mRNAs, such studies have not shown whether the signals are located within the 3′CS (6Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Patton J.T. Chen D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides playing a critical role in RNA replication, the 3′CS also contains a recognition signal for NSP3, a viral protein that increases the translation efficiency of the mRNAs (22Poncet D. Laurent S. Cohen J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Chizhikov V. Patton J.T. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Deo R.C. Groft C.M. Rajashankar K.R. Burley S.K. Cell. 2002; 108: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Studies with open cores have shown that the formation of the initiation complex for (–) strand synthesis is a salt-sensitive process that requires one or more core proteins, template mRNA, and GTP (25Chen D. Patton J.T. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Once formed, the initiation complex is resistant to salt-mediated disruption. Similarly, elongation of the (–) strand is a salt-resistant event. Replacement of open cores with purified recombinant (r) proteins in replication assays has shown that VP1 alone lacks polymerase activity, but when combined with the core lattice protein, the polymerase gains activity that directs dsRNA synthesis (7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lattice protein provides an undefined, but essential, function in the synthesis of (–) strand RNA by the viral RdRP. In this study, we have examined the requirements for template recognition by the RdRP and compared those for formation of the (–) strand initiation complex. Our analysis reveals that multiple functionally independent recognition signals are present at the 3′-end of viral mRNAs, some positioned in the non-conserved sequences upstream of the 3′CS. RdRP recognition signals are distinct from cis-acting signals involved in the formation of (–) strand initiation complexes, because deletion of portions of the 3′CS can cause the viral mRNAs to be poorly replicated while still being efficiently recognized by the RdRP. Although the RdRP can specifically bind to recognition signals in the absence of other proteins, the polymerase requires the core lattice protein to form the salt-resistant (–) strand initiation complex. Hence, template recognition and the formation of (–) strand initiation complexes by the RdRP differ in sequence and protein requirements. Preparation of rVP1 and rVP2—The baculoviruses rBVg1 and rBVg2 encode SA11 rVP1 and rVP2, respectively (7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce these proteins, spinner cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 (rVP1) and Sf9 cells (rVP2) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with the appropriate baculovirus and maintained in TNM-FH medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin at 1 μg/ml were included in the medium of rBVg2-infected cells. To prepare rVP1, rBVg1-infected cells were pelleted at 2 days post infection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and homogenized. The membrane fraction was removed by low speed centrifugation, and rVP1 was precipitated from the supernatant between 20 and 25% (w/v) of ammonium sulfate. rVP1 was dissolved in elution buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The peak fraction containing rVP1 was concentrated with a Centricon filtration unit and passed through a cationic exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing rVP1 were chromatographed on a Superdex-200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) using the elution buffer. The eluted rVP1 was stored at 4 °C. rVP2 was purified by CsCl centrifugation as described earlier (7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of purified proteins was determined by comparison with known amounts of bovine serum albumin electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Preparation of Templates for Transcription—The T7 transcription vector SP65g8R (16Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J.

The vector SP72/T3–0/EcoRV (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was linearized with EcoRV and used in T3 transcription reactions to produce a nonviral 60-nt RNA (NonV), which initiates with sequence gggatttgttgca, followed by a sequence corresponding to residues 29–78 of SP72. The vector T7B/T3–60(+) (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J.

The sequence of the g8-3′60 begins with three G residues followed by the 3′-terminal 60 residues of the SA11 gene 8 RNA. The vectors SP65g8-5′-3′ (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J.

The g8-5′-3′ probe links through the nonviral sequence UUAUU the first 88 nt and the last 50 nt of the SA11 gene 8 RNA, whereas g8-5′1–88 represents only the first 88 nt of the gene 8 RNA.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Synthesis of RNAs—Full-length g8, g8ΔCC and g8Δ3′CS, g8+AA, g8+CC, and g8–5′Δ1–88 plus-sense RNAs were produced with the Ambion T7 MEGAscript system (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA products of reaction mixtures were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and passed through Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Applied Science) to remove unincorporated NTPs. The quality of the mRNAs was assessed by electrophoresis on 1.25% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (Reliant gel system, Cambrex). RNA concentrations were calculated from optical densities at 260 nm. RNA probes used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were made with the Ambion T3 or T7 MEGAscript systems. Transcription was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols except that the concentration of cold UTP was reduced by one-fourth and 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was included per 80 μl of reaction mixture. Cold probes were trace-labeled by including [α-33P]UTP in reaction mixtures. The probes were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate g8-3′60 dsRNA, equal amounts of g8-3′60 (+) and (–) sense RNAs were heat-denatured and annealed by cooling in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 55 mm KCl. The annealed product was resolved by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel and recovered with a Qiaex II Kit (Qiagen). Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay—Procedures for characterization of rVP1-RNA interactions by EMSA were similar to those described earlier (21Patton J.T. Chen D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 32P-labeled probes (10 pmol) were incubated with rVP1 (2 pmol) in a final volume of 10 μl for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of competitor RNA. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis for 3–4 h at 175 V on nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm glycine, pH 9.1. Protein·probe complexes were detected by autoradiography, and the intensities of radiolabeled bands were quantified with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Replicase Assay—Based on results optimizing the replicase activity of rVP1 in the presence of rVP2, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 1.5% polyethylene glycol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 unit of RNasin, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm manganese acetate, 1.25 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 5 mm GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 5.6 pmol of each template mRNA, 2 pmol of rVP1, and 40 pmol of rVP2. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The 32P-labeled dsRNA products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Preparation of rVP1 and rVP2—To examine the function of the rotavirus RdRP and the core lattice protein in RNA replication, the recombinant baculoviruses rBVg1 and rBVg2 were used to express rVP1 and rVP2, respectively, in insect cells. rVP1 was purified to homogeneity from infected-cell lysates by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity and gel filtration column chromatography (Fig. 1). The behavior of rVP1 on gel filtration columns suggested that the protein was monomeric (data not shown). rVP2 was isolated from infected cell-lysates by CsCl centrifugation, a method based on the intrinsic capacity of the protein to self-assemble into core-like structures of ρ = 1.30 g/cm3 (7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). rVP1 Specifically Binds to the 3′-End of Gene 8 mRNA— Virion-derived VP1 has RNA-binding activity that specifically recognizes the 3′-end of rotavirus mRNAs (6Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether rVP1 had similar activity, the purified protein was incubated with 32P-labeled g8-3′60, an RNA probe with the same 3′-terminal 60-nt sequence as the viral gene 8 mRNA. Analysis of the reaction mixture by EMSA showed that the protein and probe interacted, forming rVP1·g8-3′60 complexes (Fig. 2A, lane 1). To address the specificity of the RNA-binding activity of rVP1, the protein was incubated with 32P-labeled g8-3′60 in the presence of increasing amounts of the unlabeled competitor RNAs g8-3′60, NonV, or NonV/A. The nonviral RNAs, NonV and NonV/A, are identical except the 3′-end of the latter contains a homopolymer A tail of 20-nt. The competition assays showed that the presence of NonV or NonV/A RNA had a minimal effect on the formation of rVP1·g8-3′60 complexes even when these competitors were in 20-fold excess over the probe (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to the nonviral RNAs, the viral-specific competitor RNA g8-3′60 successfully competed with the formation of rVP1·probe complexes to an extent approximately proportional to the ratio of probe to competitor in the reaction mixtures. These results show that rVP1 has specific affinity for the 3′-terminal 60-nt sequence of the gene 8 mRNA. To determine whether rVP1 possessed a single or multiple RNA-binding sites, we took advantage of the fact that the migration of rVP1·probe complexes on nondenaturing gels is affected by the size of the probe associated with the protein. For example, rVP1·probe complexes containing the 63-nt g8-3′60 RNA migrate more rapidly than complexes containing the 143-nt g8-5′-3′ RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 6). Electrophoretic analysis of reaction mixtures containing rVP1 and combinations of these two probes showed that the only complexes that were formed migrated like those that were formed in reaction mixtures containing rVP1 and either one of the probes (lanes 3–5 versus lanes 2 and 6). The absence of complexes in reaction mixtures containing both probes that migrated at a position intermediate of complexes formed with either one of the probes indicates that rVP1 was not able to simultaneously bind the g8-3′60 and g8-5′-3′ probes. These data suggest that the rotavirus RdRP has only a single RNA-binding site. Analysis of reaction mixtures containing 2 pmol of rVP1 and 10 pmol of 32P-labeled g8-3′60 by EMSA (Fig. 2, lane 1) showed that ∼18% (n = 6, S.D. = 4.9), or 1.8 pmol, of the probe interacted with the protein to form complexes. Given the assumption that each molecule of RdRP binds one molecule of the probe, this suggests that almost all rVP1 in the assay was functional with respect to RNA-binding activity. Replicase Activity Is Dependent on rVP1 and rVP2—Replicase assays were used to test whether purified rVP1 was enzymatically active. The reaction mixtures included full-length gene 8 mRNA as template for (–) strand synthesis and [32P]UTP to label newly made dsRNAs. Analysis of the radiolabeled products showed that rVP1 alone lacked replicase activity (Fig. 4, lane 1). Similarly, rVP2 alone did not direct dsRNA synthesis (lane 2). In contrast, reaction mixtures containing rVP1 and any amount of rVP2 possessed replicase activity that catalyzed the synthesis of gene 8 dsRNA (lanes 3–7). These results are consistent with an earlier report, which indicated that the rotavirus RNA polymerase requires the core lattice protein for activity (7Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of replicase activity was affected by the molar ratio of rVP1:rVP2 in reaction mixtures. When the ratio of rVP1:rVP2 was similar to the ratio of these proteins present at the vertexes of the core (1 molecule of VP1:5 dimers of VP2), the level of activity was maximal. Taken together, the results presented in Figs. 2 and 4 indicate that, although the rotavirus RNA polymerase can interact specifically with the 3′-end of viral mRNA in the absence of any other protein, the polymerase requires VP2 for catalytic activity. Hence, the protein requirements for template recognition and (–) strand synthesis are distinct. Factors Affecting Replicase Activity—Optimization of the replicase activity associated with rVP1 and rVP2 showed that maximal dsRNA synthesis occurred at 20 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5A). The need for Mg2+ was specific, because the level of dsRNA synthesis was much lower when Mn2+ was used at any concentration in place of Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). However, the synthesis of dsRNA increased an additional 3- to 4-fold when low concentrations (1–4 mm) of Mn2+ were included in replicase assays that contained the optimal concentration (20 mm) of Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). Thus, the two divalent cations have distinct roles in dsRNA synthesis, and both are necessary for the rotavirus RNA polymerase to achieve maximal catalytic activity. Time-course experiments showed that dsRNA synthesis continued for at least 24 h in replicase assays containing rVP1 and rVP2 (Fig. 6A). During the first 8 h of incubation, synthesis occurred in a near linear manner. To determine the elongation rate for (–) strand synthesis, a reaction mixture containing rVP1, rVP2, gene 8 mRNA, and GTP was incubated under conditions required for the formation of initiation complexes (25Chen D. Patton J.T. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Afterward, the elongation of (–) strand RNA was allowed to commence by the addition of [32P]UTP and cold NTPs to reaction mixtures. Aliquots taken from the mixture during the incubation period were analyzed for the synthesis of full-length gene 8 dsRNA by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B). The 1059-nt gene 8 dsRNA product was initially detected in reaction mixtures after 4 min of incubation indicating a maximum elongation rate of ∼270 nucleotides per min. This value is indistinguishable from the elongation rate of open cores (data not shown). The optimal synthesis of dsRNA by rVP1 and rVP2 occurred at 30 to 37 °C (data not shown), as was observed earlier with open core replication assays. Importance of 5′- and 3′-Sequences in (–) Strand Synthesis— Previous experiments performed with open cores have shown that the 3′CS has a critical role in (–) strand synthesis (16Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these earlier results, we observed that replicase assays containing rVP1 and rVP2 did not produce dsRNA from gene 8 template mRNAs, which lacked the 3′CS (Fig. 7, A and B). Replicase assays carried out with the recombinant proteins also confirmed earlier results showing that the 3′-CC of viral mRNA is important for (–) strand synthesis (19Chen D. Barro M. Spencer E. Patton J.T. Virology. 2001; 281: 221-229Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), because deletion of these residues reduced replication by two-thirds (Fig. 7B). We found that the addition of two extra nucleotides to the 3′-end (AA or CC) of the gene 8 mRNA had little effect on its ability to serve as a template for dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 7C). Not"

In vitro studies have indicated that NC may have important roles in reverse transcription as well. HIV-1 NC has been shown to enhance annealing of the tRNA primer to the primer-binding site to initiate reverse transcription (35Brule F. Marquet R. Rong L. Wainberg M.A. Roques B.P. Le Grice S.F.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This chaperone activity aids in tRNA/primer-binding site annealing, annealing of RNA and DNA in strand transfer, and genome dimerization and maturation. It is not clear if there are particular regions of NC that are responsible for chaperone activity or various components (helix destabilization (unwinding) or hybridization of complements) of this chaperone activity. A number of investigators have completed annealing assays with mutant NC proteins to determine what residues are necessary for NC chaperone capability. Studies examining the effect of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) NC mutants on the annealing of tRNAPro to MMLV RNA, as well as the dimerization of the genomic RNA segments, showed that the basic regions of NC are necessary for enhancement (55Prats A.C.

These studies indicated that the single zinc finger of MMLV NC could be removed and that chaperone activity was retained. Similar experiments were completed with genomic RNA sequences and NC derived from HIV. RNA dimerization and tRNA3Lys binding were observed in the presence of HIV-1 NC mutants containing only amino acid sequences exterior to the zinc fingers (49Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C.

Mutants with zinc fingers replaced by glycine-glycine linkers were able to enhance annealing, although the concentration of these proteins was often higher than used with wild-type NC. In vitro experiments have also been completed with ribozymes that will cleave RNA sequences upon annealing to them (60Muller G. Strack B. Dannull J. Sproat B.S. Surovoy A. Jung G. Moelling K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 61Tsuchihashi Z. Khosla M. Herschlag D. Science. 1993; 262: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Enhanced RNA cleavage was observed in the presence of wild-type NC as well as mutants containing the conserved basic residues with deleted zinc fingers (60Muller G. Strack B. Dannull J. Sproat B.S. Surovoy A. Jung G. Moelling K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that the basic residues of NC are an absolute requirement for chaperone activity (56de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Allain B. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 59de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 287: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Other annealing experiments have also been completed with NC proteins that retained the zinc fingers, but that contained mutated residues within these regions. Guo et al. (63Guo J. Wu T. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G. Henderson L.E. Gorelick R.J. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) completed annealing assays using sequences from the trans-activation response region of the HIV-1 genome. They used three types of proteins with mutations that alter either the structure of the zinc finger or the residues within the zinc finger that are not involved in zinc binding. Optimal annealing activity was observed only when the N-terminal zinc finger was not mutated. The effects of mutations to the C-terminal zinc finger were not as pronounced, although these results varied with the type of mutant constructed. The results are supported by experiments that tested the effect of altering the zinc finger structure on tRNA3Lys annealing to the primer-binding site (64Remy E. de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Muriaux D. Theilleux V. Paoletti J. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4819-4822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this case, the zinc fingers were shown to be necessary for the annealing reaction. Also, annealing assays completed with the nucleic acid sequences from the regions of (–)- and (+)-strand transfer in the presence of NC mutants unable to bind zinc showed that the requirement for the zinc finger structure differed depending on the nucleic acid sequence being used (65Guo J. Wu T. Anderson J. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G. Gorelick R.J. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8980-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Last, single DNA molecule stretching experiments have been completed with NC to examine its ability to destabilize the helix and to aid in transition to a coil structure. HIV-1 NC mutants were used in these experiments, and it was observed that the N-terminal finger of HIV-1 NC must be in the native position for optimal chaperone activity (52Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Wenner J.R. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Bloomfield V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 66Williams M.C. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8614-8619Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The study presented here investigates how NC-enhanced nucleic acid annealing differs for unstructured and structured nucleic acids. NC was shown to increase the annealing of both types of nucleic acids, indicating that it stimulates both the unfolding of structured nucleic acids and the direct hybridization of complements. NC zinc finger mutants were also used in annealing assays, which provided additional insight into the potential role of zinc fingers in annealing. The N-terminal zinc finger was shown to be necessary for the annealing of sequences with a high degree of secondary structure, whereas the C-terminal zinc finger was shown to be required for maximal annealing activity. Overall, the results suggest that the N-terminal finger is more important in unwinding secondary structures, whereas the C-terminal finger plays an accessory role.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmicon Research, Inc. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and Invitrogen. T4 polynucleotide kinase, Klenow polymerase, and T4 RNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. SP6 polymerase, alkaline phosphatase, NTPs, dNTPs, and RNase-free DNase I were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Radiolabeled compounds were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were from Fisher or Sigma.Preparation of Wild-type and Mutant NC Proteins—HIV-1 NC from the HIV-1 AIDS-associated retrovirus strain was prepared as described (15You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant NC proteins from the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain were prepared as explained previously (26Carteau S. Gorelick R.J. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are four differing amino acids between the NC proteins derived from the two HIV strains. NC from the AIDS-associated retrovirus strain contains two arginine residues in the C-terminal zinc finger that are substituted with lysine residues in NC from the NL4-3 strain. Aliquots of HIV-1 NC were prepared and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at –80 °C. Fresh aliquots were used for each experiment.Preparation of Oligonucleotides—RNA oligonucleotide 0.0rna was purchased from Dharmicon Research, Inc., and DNA oligonucleotide 0.0dna was from Invitrogen. The most highly structured pair of oligonucleotides, 21.7rna and 21.7dna, were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The RNA contained a 5′-fluorescein-6-carboxamidohexyl (FAM) end label, whereas the DNA contained a 4-[[(4-dimethylamino)phenyl]-azo]benzenesulfonicamino (DABCYL) group. Oligonucleotides 7.5rna and 16.3rna were transcribed from DNA oligonucleotide pairs. One DNA strand of each pair was 61 nucleotides long and contained the sequence for the SP6 promoter at the 5′-end, followed by the DNA sequence corresponding to the desired RNA. Twenty pmol of the 61-mer was combined with 40 pmol of a complementary 42-mer DNA in hybridization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1mm dithiothreitol, and 80 mm KCl). The hybrid reaction was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The 5′-overhang was filled in using Klenow polymerase at 37 °C. The hybrid was incubated for 1 h with Klenow polymerase and 200 μm dNTPs. The double-stranded DNA product was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. SP6 polymerase was then used to transcribe the 42-nucleotide RNA product. DNA was digested with DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× formamide dye. The RNA was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and then subjected to gel electrophoresis on an RNase-free 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. RNA was excised, eluted in formamide elution buffer (80% formamide, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)), and precipitated with ethanol. The 5′-end of the RNA was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Seventy-five pmol of RNA was incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C. The dephosphorylated RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25: 24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. All of the aforementioned oligonucleotides were resuspended in 30 μl of water and quantitated spectrophotometrically.RNA End Labeling—Oligonucleotides 0.0rna, 7.5rna, and 16.3rna were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP. Fifty pmol of dephosphorylated RNA was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 5′-end of the most highly structured sequence, 21.7rna, was connected to a FAM molecule. Therefore, this RNA was 3′-end-labeled with [5′-32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate as described. 2J. W. Brown, unpublished method. All labeled RNAs were purified on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, eluted, and precipitated as described above. RNAs were resuspended in 70 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8)) and quantitated spectrophotometrically.RNA/DNA Annealing Assay— 32P-5′-end-labeled RNA and the complementary DNA were diluted in TE buffer, separately heated to 90 °C for 3 min, and then transferred to ice for 5 min. The RNA (5 nm final oligonucleotide concentration and 0.21 μm nucleotide concentration) was then preincubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of mutant or wild-type HIV-1 NC (2 μm final concentration) for 2 min. Complementary DNA (10 nm final concentration and 0.42 μm nucleotide concentration) was separately preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min in the presence or absence of HIV-1 NC (2 μm final concentration). To start the reactions, 17 μl of DNA solution was added to 90 μl of reaction mixture containing the RNA. Final reaction concentrations were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2,80mm KCl, and 100 μm ZnCl2. Aliquots of 15 μl were removed at specific time points (as indicated) and added to 7.5 μl of stop solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 20 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.2% SDS, and 0.4 mg/ml yeast tRNA) (51Tsuchihashi Z. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were incubated in stop solution at 37 °C for 1 min before being transferred to ice. Reactions were then subjected to electrophoresis on 12 or 15% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography (67Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Irwin N. Janssen K.A. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or phosphoimager analysis using a Bio-Rad GS-525 phosphoimager. Percent annealing was determined by dividing the amount of annealed product (A) in each lane by the total RNA (annealed and single-stranded (S)) in each lane and multiplying by 100 (% annealed = A/(A + S) × 100).Annealing Detected by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—As was previously noted, 21.7rna was purchased with a FAM molecule on its 5′-end. The complementary DNA was purchased with a 3′-DABCYL group. Annealing assays were completed at 25 °C using a Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Instruments S. A., Inc.). The RNA and DNA were separately incubated in the presence or absence of wild-type NC, 1.1 NC, or 2.2 NC. The reactions were started by mixing 10.5 μl of the DNA/NC solution and 59.5 μl of the RNA/NC solution. The final concentrations of the RNA and DNA were 5 and 10 nm, respectively (0.63 μm total nucleotide concentration). NC was used at a final concentration of 2 μm, and the final concentrations of the reagents in the buffer were as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 100 μm ZnCl2. The excitation wavelength was 494 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. The emission bandwidth was 5 nm, and the spectrum was observed from 508 to 570 nm. The emission spectrum was taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 min. The intensity of the emission peaked at 517 nm. The intensity ratio (I r) was determined by dividing the peak intensity at a given time (I t) by the peak intensity at time 0 (I 0) (I r = I t/I 0). Three experiments were completed for each type of NC, and an average intensity ratio was determined and plotted versus time.RESULTSStructure of Substrate RNAs—The RNAs used in these experiments each contained 42 nucleotides. The structures are shown in Fig. 1. These structures were determined using both RNAdraw and mfold (68Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 69Matzura O. Wennborg A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 247-249PubMed Google Scholar). These structures were confirmed using RNase A and RNase T1 mapping (data not shown). The Gibbs free energy for unfolding is shown next to the structure. Nucleic acids were designed such that they would contain the same number of nucleotides, but have an increasing strength of secondary structures. Structures were chosen that did not have a high degree of GU (or GT in the complementary DNA) repeats due to reports indicating that NC may preferentially bind to these sequences (19Vuilleumier C.

https://openalex.org/W2089438534,"In this report, we describe a new lectin from the fungus Rhizopus stolonifer that agglutinates rabbit red blood cells. Agglutinating activity was detected in the extract of mycelium-forming spores cultured on agar plates but not in the mycelium-forming no spores from liquid medium. This lectin, which we designated R. stolonifer lectin (RSL), was isolated by affinity chromatography with porcine stomach mucin-Sepharose. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectral analysis showed that RSL is ∼4.5 kDa, whereas gel filtration indicated a mass of 28 kDa. This indicates that the lectin is a hexamer of noncovalently associated RSL monomers. RSL activity was very stable, since it was insensitive to heat treatment at 70 °C for 10 min. Analysis of RSL binding specificity by both microtiter plate and precipitation assays showed that N-glycans with l-fucose linked to the reducing terminal GlcNAc residues are the most potent inhibitors of RSL binding, whereas N-glycans without α(1–6)-linked fucose residues are ∼100-fold weaker inhibitors of binding. Oligosaccharides with α(1–2, –3, and –4) linkages showed no inhibition of binding in these assays. In a mirror resonance biosensor assay, high affinity binding was observed between RSL and the glycopeptide of bovine γ-globulin, which has N-glycans with α(1–6)-linked fucose residues. However, RSL showed only a weak interaction with the glycopeptide of quail ovomucoid, which lacks fucose residues. Finally, capillary affinity electrophoresis studies indicated that RSL binds strongly to N-glycans with α(1–6)-linked fucose residues. Together, these results show that RSL recognizes the core structure of N-glycans with α(1–6)-linked l-fucose residues. This specificity could make RSL a valuable tool for glycobiological studies.

Glycoconjugates possess a variety of structures, including glycoproteins and glycolipids, and are found on the surfaces of animal, plant, and microorganism cells. Determination of the structures and the distribution of glycoconjugates on cell surfaces is important for understanding their biological function. Lectins are useful in this regard because they have a specificity for defined carbohydrate structures. Lectins are also used for isolation and fractionation of glycoconjugates, cell separation, identification of microorganisms, and drug delivery (1Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions, and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 294-357Google Scholar).Fucose-containing glycoconjugates on cell surfaces are known to be important in cell-to-cell recognition and signaling. For example, sialyl Lewis X on endothelial cells is a ligand for selectins, which are involved in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation (2Lasky L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 113-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some pathogens can adhere to fucosylated glycoconjugates on surfaces of their host cells (3Bry L. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Science. 1996; 273: 1381-1383Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Similarly, during murine fertilization, a fucosyl residue on the zona pellucida of the egg is required for adhesion to the high affinity sperm-binding ligand (4Jonston D.S. Wright W.W Shaper J.H.

Fucose-containing glycoconjugates, such as H-blood antigens on tumor cells, also modulate cell growth, invasion, and metastasis (5Gorelik E. Xu F. Henion T. Anaraki F. Galili U. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 332-336PubMed Google Scholar).Although many lectins have been identified, only a few are fucosyl-specific, including the Lotus tetragonolobus (6Pereira M.E.A. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and Ulex europaeus (7Matsumoto I. Osawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 194: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) lectins from plants as well as the Anguilla lectin from eel (8Watkins W.M. Morgan W.T.J. Nature. 1952; 169: 825-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the Aleuria aurantia lectin from mushroom (9Kochibe N. Furukawa K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2841-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, an additional lectin that recognizes l-fucose-containing oligosaccharides should be a valuable tool for glycobiological research.Lectins are found in a variety of organisms including fungi. Although many fungal lectins have been reported recently (10Kawagishi H. Food Rev. Int. 1995; 11: 63-68Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Guillot J. Konska G. Biochem. Syst. Ecol. 1997; 25: 203-230Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Wang H.X. Ng T.B. Ooi V.E.C. Mycol. Res. 1998; 102: 897-906Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), most of them are from mushroom. Therefore, in the current study, we surveyed the lectins in fungi other than mushroom. Using a rabbit erythrocyte hemagglutination assay, we identified an agglutinating activity in an extract of the mycelium of the fungus Rhizopus stolonifer. Of several monosaccharides tested, only l-fucose inhibited the agglutinating activity of the crude extract, suggesting that the agglutinin was a l-fucose-specific lectin. We purified the lectin and examined its physical-chemical properties and carbohydrate binding specificity.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast extract and bactopeptone were purchased from Difco. Biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). The structures of the oligosaccharides are shown in Table I.

Neuraminidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens) was a gift from Drs. Tsukada and Ohta (Marukin-Chuyu, Uji, Kyoto, Japan). Peptide-N 4-(acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase and highly purified 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) and Beckman-Coulter (Fullerton, CA), respectively.Table IList of oligosaccharidesR. stolonifer (IFO 30816) was obtained from the Institute for Fermentation (Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan). The fungus was grown for 2 weeks at 30 °C on culture dishes (9.4-cm diameter) in a medium containing 10 g/liter bactopeptone, 40 g/liter glucose, and 30 g/liter agar.Preparation of Oligosaccharides—Glycopeptides were prepared from bovine γ-globulin, quail ovomucoid, and apotransferrin as described previously (13Oda Y. Nakayama K. Abdul-Rahman B. Kinoshita M. Hashimoto O. Kawasaki N. Hayakawa T. Kakehi K. Tomiya N Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26772-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides were released from their glycopeptides by hydrazinolysis (14Parente J.P. Strecker G. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 249: 199-204Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and separated by HPLC on a Cosmosil 5NH2 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) (15Parente J.P. Wieruszeski J.-M.

Man3GlcNAc2 (9) and Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2Fuc (16) were obtained from glycopeptides of quail ovomucoid and bovine γ-globulin, respectively. The oligosaccharides GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 (10) and Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 (11) were prepared from the glycopeptide of apotransferrin. Briefly, the oligosaccharide (10 mg) obtained from the glycopeptide of apotransferrin was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and was incubated with neuraminidase (1 unit) at 37 °C for 24 h. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to HPLC on a Cosmosil 5NH2 column to obtain the asialo-oligosaccharide (11). This asialo-oligosaccharide (5 mg) was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and digested with β-galactosidase (1 unit) at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally, the product (10) was purified by HPLC. The structures of the three oligosaccharides (9–11) obtained were confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR (16Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F.

Oligosaccharides GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2Fuc (13) and Man3GlcNAc2Fuc (12) were prepared by enzyme digestion of oligosaccharide 16. Briefly, the oligosaccharide 16 (5 mg) was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and digested with β-galactosidase (1 unit) at 37 °C for 24 h. The product (13; ∼4 mg) was purified by HPLC. Next, the oligosaccharide was digested with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (2 units) in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 24 h to produce oligosaccharide 12, which was purified by HPLC. Each portion (50 μg) of the products obtained from 16 was digested with l-fucosidase (200 milliunits) in 60 μlof50mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 24 h, and the aliquots were subjected to HPLC to confirm that the products were the oligosaccharide 10 and 9, respectively.Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled Oligosaccharides—Oligosaccharides were released from AGP and bovine γ-globulin with peptide-N 4-(acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase and labeled with APTS for capillary affinity electrophoresis as described previously (18Nakajima K. Oda Y. Kinoshita M. Kakehi K. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the glycoprotein (1 mg) was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (40 μl). Peptide-N 4-(acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase (5 milliunits, 5 μl) was added, and the solution was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and then heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated to dryness using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator (SpeedVac, Farmingdale, NY). The residue was dissolved in 2 m aqueous acetic acid (50 μl), and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 80 °C to remove sialic acids from the oligosaccharides. The residue was dissolved in 15% aqueous acetic acid (5 μl) containing 100 mm APTS. A freshly prepared solution of 1 m NaBH3CN in tetrahydrofuran (5 μl) was added, and the mixture was overlaid with mineral oil (100 μl, n D = 1.4670, d = 0.838; Aldrich) to prevent evaporation of the solvent. The mixture was kept for 90 min at 55 °C. Water (200 μl) was added to the mixture, and the fluorescent yellowish aqueous phase was collected. The aqueous layer was applied to a column of Sephadex G-25 (1 × 50 cm) equilibrated with water. The fluorescent fractions containing oligosaccharides were collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water (100 μl), and a portion (20 μl) was put aside for capillary affinity electrophoresis.Lectin Purification—R. stolonifer was cultured on an agar plate for 2 weeks at 30 °C. A 10-ml aliquot of PBS was poured onto the cultured plate, and mycelium was suspended with a glass pipette. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to a PSM-Sepharose column (1.0 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with PBS. Elution of protein was monitored by A 280. The column was washed with PBS containing 1 m NaCl until the A 280 of the eluate was below 0.01. The lectin was eluted with PBS containing 0.1 m l-fucose at 50 °C. The fractions containing lectin were dialyzed against distilled water using dialysis membrane (molecular weight cut-off 3500; Spectra/Por) and then lyophilized. The lyophilized material was dissolved in 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.0 × 100 cm) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The main lectin-containing peak was pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized.Protein Estimation—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. using bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Amino Acid Composition of the Lectin—The amino acid composition of the purified lectin was determined using an Applied Biosystems model 420/amino acid analyzer. Samples were hydrolyzed for 24, 48, and 72 h at 110 °C in 6 m HCl. The purified lectin was reduced and alkylated to obtain the S-pyridylethylated lectin. Cysteine was determined as S-(4-pyridylethyl)-cysteine (20Friedman M. Krull L.H. Cavins J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3868-3871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan was determined spectrophotometrically by the procedure of Edelhoch (21Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). The sugar content was determined using the phenol/sulfuric acid method of Dubois et al. with glucose as the standard (22Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39899) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Amino Acid Sequencing of the Lectin—Denatured proteins were separated in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol by Tricine-SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% slab gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE of the S-pyridylethylated lectin, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride (0.45 μm; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit was determined by automatic Edman degradation using a model 477A protein and peptide sequencing system (Applied Biosystems).Determination of Molecular Mass—The molecular mass of the purified lectin was determined by SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, gel filtration, and mass spectral analysis.The molecular mass from SDS-PAGE was estimated by comparison with standard proteins (Polypeptide standards; Bio-Rad). Gel filtration for estimation of the molecular mass was performed using a TSK SW2000 column (7.8 × 300 mm, TOSO; Tokyo) equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0. Elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The calibration proteins were used as follows: ovalbumin (45 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa).The molecular mass of the purified lectin and S-pyridylethylated lectin was also measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE PRO (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. The instrument was operated in linear operation using positive polarity. Samples (0.5 μl) were applied to a polished stainless steel target, and a solution (0.5 μl) of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1:1 ethanol/water was added. The mixture was allowed to air-dry at ambient temperature.Agglutination Activity Assay—Agglutination activity was measured in microtiter plates using serial 2-fold dilutions of lectin as described previously (24Oda Y. Minami K. Ichida S. Aonuma S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each well contained 25 μl of rabbit red blood cells (10% suspension), 25 μl of lectin solution diluted with PBS, and 50 μl of saline. To study effect of carbohydrate and metal ions on agglutination, carbohydrate or metal ion solution in saline (50 μl) was added, replacing the equivalent volume of saline. Agglutination was observed 1 h later.Biotinylation of Lectin and Glycopeptides—RSL and glycopeptides were biotinylated using biotinyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (25Shao M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The succiminidyl ester (20 μl; 50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) was added dropwise to a solution of lectin or glycopeptide (1.0 ml; 1.0 mg/ml in PBS) while it was agitated with a vortex mixer. After incubation for 90 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against PBS using dialysis membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 and 1000 (Spectra/Por) for lectin and glycopeptides, respectively) and stored at –20 °C until use.Microtiter-based Binding and Inhibition Assay—Microtiter wells (96 wells, flat bottom, Asahi Tekunogurasu, Tokyo, Japan) were incubated with bovine thyroglobulin (200 μl; 25 μg/ml in water) overnight at 4 °C. Next, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 0.25% BSA (PBS/BSA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing four times with PBS/BSA, the wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μl of biotinylated RSL and the same volume of PBS. The wells were next washed four times with PBS/BSA. The wells were incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (200 μl; 2 μg/ml in PBS containing 3% BSA) for 15 min at room temperature and then washed four times with PBS/BSA. Finally, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase substrate solution at room temperature. Color development was terminated after 10 min by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid (100 μl). The A 405 of each well was measured with a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad). For the inhibition assay, PBS was replaced with PBS containing carbohydrate in the reaction mixture. Biotinylated lectin was used at 2 μg/ml. To examine the effect of pH on the binding reaction, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, and Tris/HCl buffers were used instead of PBS as the solvents for the pH ranges 3–5, 6–7, and 8–10, respectively. All binding assays were performed in triplicate, and the averages are presented.Quantitative Precipitation and Inhibition Assay—The quantitative precipitation assay was carried out in microcentrifuge tubes essentially as described by Mo et al. (26Mo H.Q. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7666-7673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of glycoproteins (0–100 μg) were added to 5 μg of the purified RSL in 160 μl of PBS, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 4 °C for 48 h. The precipitate were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 150 μl of ice-cold PBS. The protein content of the precipitate was determined by the method of Lowry (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the inhibition assay, various amounts of inhibitors were added to the solution of the purified RSL (5 μg) and thyroglobulin (50 μg) in a final volume of 160 μl of PBS. The protein content of the precipitate was determined as described above, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated.Assay of Lectin Binding Using a Resonant Mirror Biosensor—A lectin-binding assay was performed using an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors Ltd., Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK). Streptoavidin was immobilized on the carboxymethyl dextran surface of a cuvette. Next, biotinylated glycopeptides of bovine γ-globulin or quail ovomucoid were immobilized according to the manufacturer's instructions (0.7 and 1.2 ng of glycopeptide bound/mm2 of bovine γ-globulin and quail ovomucoid, respectively). Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (PBST) (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.2) at 25 °C. The association phase of the binding reaction was initiated by the addition of lectin (1–5 μl) to PBST in the cuvette. After 5 min, the dissociation phase was initiated by quickly washing the cuvette three times with 100 μl of PBST. Regeneration of the cuvette was achieved by repeated washing with 20 mm HCl. FASTfit software (Affinity Sensors) was used to calculate the dissociation constant (K D).Capillary Affinity Electrophoresis—Capillary affinity electrophoresis was performed using a P/ACE MDQ glycoprotein system (Beckman Coulter) equipped with an argon-laser-induced fluorescence detection system according to the method of Nakajima et al. (18Nakajima K. Oda Y. Kinoshita M. Kakehi K. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, separation was performed at 25 °C using an eCAP N-CHO-coated capillary (20-cm effective length, 30-cm total length, 50-μm inner diameter; Beckman Coulter) and detection was performed using a 520-nm filter for emission and a 488-nm argon-laser for excitation. Tris acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) was used as the electrolyte. Prior to capillary affinity electrophoresis, APTS-labeled carbohydrates were analyzed. Next, the capillary was filled with same electrolyte containing a lectin at the specified concentration, and electrophoresis was performed. Data were collected and analyzed using 32 Karat software (version 4.0; Beckman Coulter).RESULTSLectin Purification—Rabbit erythrocyte agglutinating activity was detected in the extract of mycelium-forming spores cultured on agar-medium. However, when the fungus was cultured in liquid medium, it did not form spores, and agglutinating activity was not detected in either the culture filtrate or the mycelium extract. Therefore, fungus cultured on agar medium was used as a source of the lectin.The inhibitory effect of various carbohydrates on the agglutinating activity of the crude extract was similar to that of the purified lectin (Table II). Specifically, l-fucose but none of the other monosaccharides tested inhibited the agglutinating activity. Among the glycoproteins examined, thyroglobulin was the most potent inhibitor of agglutinating activity. PSM also demonstrated potent inhibitory activity in the agglutination assay.Table IIInhibitory effect of various carbohydrates on agglutinating activity of the purified lectinCarbohydrateMinimum concentration to completely inhibit an agglutinationl-Fucose25 mMd-Glucose>100 mMd-Galactose>100 mMd-Mannose>100 mMn-Acetyl-d-glucosamine>100 mMn-Acetyl-d-galactosamine>100 mMn-Acetylneuraminic acid>100 mMLactose>100 mMN,N′-Diacetylchitobiose>100 mMFucoidan125 μg/mlMannan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)>10 mg/mlFetuin200 μg/mlOvalbumin (hen)>10 mg/mlOvomucoid (hen)>10 mg/mlPorcine stomach mucin125 μg/mlThyroglobulin (bovine)25 μg/ml Open table in a new tab We attempted to purify the lectin using thyroglobulin-Sepharose, but little lectin activity was recovered. PSM-Sepharose was effective at binding the lectin, but only a small amount of lectin was eluted with l-fucose even at a concentration of 0.2 m when carried out at room temperature. However, ∼80% of the lectin activity was recovered using a 0.1 m l-fucose solution at 50 °C (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Porcine stomach mucin-Sepharose 4B column chromatography of crude extract. The crude extract was applied to a porcine stomach mucin-Sepharose 4B column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with PBS, followed by PBS containing 1 m NaCl. Lectin was eluted with PBS containing 0.1 m l-fucose at 50 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several peaks were revealed in gel filtration by A 280 readings, but only the fractions in the main peak showed agglutinating activity (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography of pooled active fractions from the porcine stomach mucin-Sepharose 4B column. The material was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.0 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea. Active fractions (arrow) were pooled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Therefore, the fractions in the main peak were pooled and used as the purified lectin (designated R. stolonifer lectin, RSL). After dialysis and lyophilization, about 2 mg of purified lectin were obtained from 20 culture plates.Agglutinating Activity—RSL agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes at minimum concentration of 4 μg/ml. Metal ions such as 100 mm Ca2+,Mg2+, or Mn2+ or metal ion chelation with 10 mm EDTA did not affect the agglutination activity of RSL. This indicates that the lectin does not require metal ions for binding. The lectin maintained full activity following heating at 70 °C for 10 min, but approximately half of the activity was lost following heating at 80 °C for 10 min. The inhibitory effect of various carbohydrates on the agglutinating activity of the purified lectin is shown in Table II. Only l-fucose completely inhibited the agglutinating activity at 25 mm. The other monosaccharides, lactose and N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, showed no inhibition at up to 100 mm. Fucoidan, a polymer of l-fucose, was also an inhibitor of RSL agglutination activity. Among the glycoproteins examined, thyroglobulin was the most potent inhibitor, and PSM also showed inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that RSL is a fucose-binding lectin.Molecular Mass and Molecular Structure—The purified lectin showed one band of ∼4.5 kDa on reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Similarly, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the molecular masses of the native lectin and S-pyrimidylethylated lectin are 4570 and 4783 Da, respectively (Fig. 3).Fig. 3MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of native and pyridylethylated lectin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The apparent molecular mass of the native lectin was estimated by TSK G2000SW gel filtration to be ∼28 kDa (data not shown). This suggests that the native lectin is a hexamer of noncovalently associated subunits. Neutral carbohydrate was not detected using the phenol/sulfuric acid assay.Amino Acid Composition and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence—As shown in Table III, the purified lectin contained high amounts of aspartic acid/asparagine and glutamic acid/glutamine as well as glycine and valine.Table IIIAmino acid composition of purified lectinAmino acidRatio to TyrProposed amino acid compositionAsp8.128Thr2.252Ser0.941Glu3.283Gly2.633Ala2.002Val4.725Ile0.881Leu2.312Cys1.982aCysteine was determined as S-(4-pyridylethyl)-cysteine.Tyr1.001Phe2.282Lys2.703His0.841Arg0.971Pro0.781Trp2bTryptophan was determined spectrophotometrically.Total residues40Calculated molecular mass: 4560-4570 Daa Cysteine was determined as S-(4-pyridylethyl)-cysteine.b Tryptophan was determined spectrophotometrically.

https://openalex.org/W2142092598,"The role of p53 in tumor suppression partly relies on its ability to transcriptionally regulate target genes involved in the initiation of cell cycle arrest or the activation of programmed cell death. In recent years many genes have been identified as p53-regulated genes; however, no single target gene has been shown to be required for the full apoptotic effect. We have identified TRAF4 as a p53-regulated gene in a microarray screen using a Murine 11K Affymetrix GeneChip hybridized with cRNA from the p53 temperature-sensitive cell line, Vm10. TRAF4 is a member the TRAF family of adaptor proteins that mediate cellular signaling by binding to various members of the tumor necrosis family receptor superfamily and interleukin-1/Toll-like receptor super-family. In contrast to its other family members, TRAF4 has not been shown to bind to a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily in vivo, nor has it been shown to regulate signaling pathways common to its other family members. Therefore the role of TRAF4 in a signaling pathway has not yet been established and requires further study. TRAF4 is specifically regulated by p53 in response to temperature sensitive p53, overexpression of p53 by use of an adenovirus, and stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage. The murine TRAF4 promoter contains a functional p53 DNA-binding site ∼1 kilobase upstream of the initiating methionine. TRAF4 localizes to the cytoplasm and appears to remain in the cytoplasm following DNA damage. Interestingly, the overexpression of TRAF4 induces apoptosis and suppresses colony formation. These data suggest a correlation that the orphan adaptor protein TRAF4 may play a role in p53-mediated proapoptotic signaling in the response to cellular stress.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses including DNA damage, nucleotide depletion, and oncogene stimulation (1Levine A.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The most well understood role of p53 in tumor suppression is the ability to activate or repress target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis (2Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 is required for p53-mediated G1 arrest and 14-3-3σ and GADD45 are p53 target genes important for the maintenance of a G2 arrest (4El-Deiry W.S.

Originally identified as adaptor proteins for members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) super-family, the TRAF proteins are involved with the activation of the stress response culminating in the activation of either c-Jun or NF-κB and/or the initiation of apoptosis depending on the cellular circumstance (22Bradley J.R.

While TRAF4 contains both the conserved C-terminal TRAF domain and the N-terminal RING finger domain common to all TRAF family members (except TRAF1 does not contain a RING finger domain), it also appears to have two potential nuclear localization signals, distinguishing it from other family members (29Regnier C.H.

Taken together, little is known about the biological function or regulation of TRAF4.In the present studies, we have identified TRAF4 as a p53-responsive gene. TRAF4 mRNA is induced in response to temperature-sensitive p53 at the permissive temperature, overexpression of wild-type p53, and to a lesser extent by the stabilization of p53 in response to exposure to DNA-damaging agents. The murine TRAF4 genomic locus contains a functional p53 DNA-binding element located ∼1 kilobase (kb) upstream of the translation start site. Localization by immunofluorescence shows that TRAF4 appears to reside in the cytoplasm, even after treatment of cells with chemotherapeutic agents. Overexpression of TRAF4 induces apoptosis and suppresses colony formation in multiple tumor cell lines suggesting a role for TRAF4 in p53-mediated apoptosis.Taken together, our results suggest a correlation that TRAF4 is a p53-regulated gene encoding a cytoplasmic protein that may mediate a role for p53 in tumor growth suppression. TRAF4 is the first adaptor protein shown to be directly regulated by p53 and thus may have a role in determining cell fate in response to stabilization of p53.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Culture Conditions—We maintained the Vm10, M3, SW480, SAOS2, CALU-6, and H460 cell lines in culture as previously described (11Sax J.K.

All assays were performed in triplicate.Apoptosis Assays—Cells were co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and GFP-Spectrin as 10% of total transfected DNA, harvested at indicated time points, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometric gating for both GFP and propidium iodide. Cells with less than 2N DNA content are scored as apoptotic cells. For caspase inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated with Me2SO or 20 μm z-VAD for ∼1.5 h and then co-transfected with the indicated plasmid including GFP-Spectrin at 10% of the total DNA. Cells were treated with either Me2SO or z-VAD containing media every 10–14 h for the duration of the experiments. Cells were then harvested at the indicated time points, stained with prodium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.Active caspase-3 was measured by fixing transfected cells using the Cytofix/Cytoperm solutions (BD Pharmingen), incubating cells with 0.25 μg/sample anti-active caspsae-3 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen), washed in Cytoperm, and then incubation with 0.25 μg per sample anti-rabbit IgG-PE (Caltag) and analyzed by flow cytometry.Colony Assays—Approximately 3 × 105 U2OS cells, 5 × 105 SW480 cells, 5 × 105 CALU-6 cells and 4 × 105 HCT116 cells were plated for 18–24 h prior to transfection in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected using a LipofectAMINE 2000/DNA conjugate suspended in Opti-Mem medium (Invitrogen). Approximately 24 h of post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and one-half of each well was placed into a T-25 in media under selection. U2OS and CALU-6 cells were selected with 0.25 mg/ml Hygromycin B. SW480 cells were selected with 0.4 mg/ml Hygromycin B. HCT116 cells were selected with 0.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B. Medium was changed every 2–3 days and cells were stained with Coomassie Blue 12–14 days after the beginning of selection. Each colony assay was repeated on at least two independent occasions in each cell line. Visible colonies were counted and percent colony suppression was calculated by dividing the number of colonies for each TRAF4 construct by pCEP4 and multiplying that number by 100. The percent values shown are an average of two independent experiments.Immunofluorescence—U2OS cells were seeded on Nalge Nunc glass chamber slides 18–24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ∼20–24-h post-transfection. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in goat serum for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:100 dilution in goat serum for 2–4 h at room temperature or at a 1:200 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated in goat anti-mouse FITC (Jackson Laboratories) at a 1:100 dilution in goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, slides were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting media (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Samples were treated with the indicated chemotherapeutic agents for 8 h ∼16–20-h post-transfection. Secondary antibody-only controls were performed and did not show detectable fluorescence.RESULTSTRAF4 mRNA Is Specifically Up-regulated in Response to p53—We used an oligonucleotide approach to screen for p53-activated transcriptional targets using cRNA derived from the p53-expressing temperature-sensitive cell line Vm10 cultured at different temperatures (11Sax J.K.

On the murine 11K Affymetrix GeneChip, levels of TRAF4 mRNA were 32.7-fold higher in the Vm10 cRNA from cells incubated at 32 °C (permissive temperature; wild-type p53 conformation) compared with cells incubated at 39 °C (restrictive temperature; mutant p53 conformation) (data not shown).Using two p53 temperature-sensitive murine cell lines, Vm10, and M3, we confirmed the up-regulation of TRAF4 mRNA in response to wild-type p53 at the permissive temperature by Northern blotting and quantitative Taqman RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). An even greater induction of TRAF4 mRNA was observed following treatment with Adriamycin only when p53 was in the wild-type conformation and not when p53 was in the mutant conformation (Fig. 1A). Moreover, TRAF4 mRNA was specifically induced by wild-type p53 in response to DNA damage in both HCT116 and PA1 human cancer cells and not in the E6-p53-degrading clones previously derived from these cell lines (34Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 623-633PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). TRAF4 mRNA does not appear to be obviously up-regulated by etoposide in the HCT116-neo or by adriamycin in the PAI-neo, however this could be due to different responses of each cell line to different chemotherapeutic treatments. More importantly, TRAF4 mRNA is specifically induced by p53 in response to various forms of DNA damage in more than one cell line, suggesting a correlation between stabilization of p53 by DNA-damaging agents and induction of TRAF4 mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). Overexpression of p53 by use of an adenovirus also induced the TRAF4 transcript in SW480 cells (Fig. 1B). Of note, there appears to be two transcripts of TRAF4 in the human cell lines that are very similar in size. Both transcripts appear to be positively regulated by p53. Northern blotting for the p21 transcript serves as a positive control for the p53-dependent induction of a known p53 target gene expressed in these cell lines. In addition, a Western blot for p53 protein stabilization in response to treatment with DNA-damaging agents in the HCT116 and PA1 stable cell lines shows p53 stabilization only in the neo stable clones and not in the E6, p53-degrading, stable clones (Fig. 1B).Finally, using a quantitative Taqman RT-PCR assay, TRAF4 mRNA was up-regulated by γ-irradiation in the wild-type p53 expressing cell line H460 (Fig. 2A). TRAF4 mRNA was also induced in the thymus of irradiated p53 wild-type mice but not in the irradiated p53 knock-out mice (Fig. 2B). As a positive control, quantitative Taqman RT-PCR analysis using p21 as the probe shows the p53-dependent up-regulation of p21 in the irradiated thymus (Fig. 2B). In addition, a Western blot against p53 protein shows the stabilization of p53 in wild-type irradiated thymus and not in the knock-out irradiated thymus (Fig. 2B). TRAF4 mRNA was not specifically induced by p53 in other tissues tested including the small intestine, spleen or lungs of irradiated p53 wild-type mice as compared with the p53 knockout mice. The Taqman RT-PCR of irradiated lung shown in Fig. 2B shows a similar, albeit small, level of induct"
https://openalex.org/W2119508775,"Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the first step in hypusine (N ϵ-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) synthesis in a single cellular protein, eIF5A precursor. The synthesis of deoxyhypusine catalyzed by this enzyme involves transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue in the eIF5A precursor protein to form a deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A intermediate, eIF5A(Dhp). We recently discovered the efficient reversal of deoxyhypusine synthesis. When eIF5A([3H]Dhp), radiolabeled in the 4-aminobutyl portion of its deoxyhypusine residue, was incubated with human deoxyhypusine synthase, NAD, and 1,3-diaminopropane, [3H]spermidine was formed by a rapid transfer of the radiolabeled 4-aminobutyl side chain of the [3H]deoxyhypusine residue to 1,3-diaminopropane. No reversal was observed with [3H]hypusine protein, suggesting that hydroxylation at the 4-aminobutyl side chain of the deoxyhypusine residue prevents deoxyhypusine synthase-mediated reversal of the modification. Purified human deoxyhypusine synthase also exhibited homospermidine synthesis activity when incubated with spermidine, NAD, and putrescine. Thus it was found that [14C]putrescine can replace eIF5A precursor protein as an acceptor of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to form radiolabeled homospermidine. The Km value for putrescine (1.12 mm) as a 4-aminobutyl acceptor, however, is much higher than that for eIF5A precursor (1.5 μm). Using [14C]putrescine as an acceptor, various spermidine analogs were evaluated as donor substrates for human deoxyhypusine synthase. Comparison of spermidine analogs as inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthesis, as donor substrates for synthesis of deoxyhypusine (or its analog), and for synthesis of homospermidine (or its analog) provides new insights into the intricate specificity of this enzyme and versatility of the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction.

In the first step, deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 2.5.1.46) facilitates the transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine, the donor substrate, to the eIF5A precursor (eIF5A(Lys)), the acceptor substrate, to form a deoxyhypusine-containing protein (eIF5A(Dhp)) (4Park M.H.

Biol. 1988; 250: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to complete hypusine synthesis and eIF5A maturation. The essential role of eIF5A and its hypusine modification is supported by gene disruption studies in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which inactivation of the two eIF5A genes (8Schnier J. Schwelberger H.G. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), or of the single deoxyhypusine synthase gene (9Sasaki K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), causes a loss of cell viability. Deoxyhypusine synthase is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of four identical subunits (11Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human enzyme in a complex with its cofactor, NAD, revealed four active sites at the interfaces of subunit dimers (11Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes a complex reaction normally involving two substrates, the polyamine spermidine (the donor of the butylamine moiety) and the protein substrate, the eIF5A precursor (the acceptor of the butylamine moiety), and a cofactor, NAD. We have established that deoxyhypusine synthesis occurs by way of a covalent enzyme-imine intermediate (12Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in four steps (Scheme 1, left-hand pathway): (i) NAD-dependent dehydrogenation of spermidine to form dehydrospermidine, (ii) transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from dehydrospermidine to the ϵ-amino group of an active site lysine residue (Lys-329 in the human enzyme) to form a covalent enzyme-imine intermediate, (iii) transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from the enzyme-imine intermediate to the N ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the eIF5A precursor (Lys-50 in the human protein (13Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) to form an eIF5A-imine intermediate, and (iv) reduction of this intermediate by enzyme-bound NADH to form a deoxyhypusine residue (14Wolff E.C. Wolff J. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9170-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the absence of eIF5A precursor, the enzyme has the ability to catalyze an alternate abortive reaction, cleavage of spermidine to 1,3-diaminopropane and Δ1-pyrroline (6Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxyhypusine synthase exhibits a remarkable specificity toward its substrates: it recognizes and modifies only one cellular protein, the eIF5A precursor. Previous studies with a large number of compounds structurally related to spermidine as inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthesis (15Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.B. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3053-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Lee Y.B. Folk J.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the topology of the proposed spermidine-binding pocket of the enzyme (11Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also revealed a narrow specificity toward the donor substrates, with spermidine being strongly favored. It was not known whether deoxyhypusine synthase can catalyze other reactions in polyamine metabolism or perform other cellular functions. Recently, Ober and Hartman reported that deoxyhypusine synthases from tobacco (18Ober D. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32040-32047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Senecio vernalis (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Ober D. Harms R. Witte L. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) can accommodate putrescine as an alternate butylamine acceptor, thus resulting in the production of homospermidine from spermidine (donor) and putrescine (acceptor) (Scheme 1, right-hand pathway). Another plant enzyme, homospermidine synthase, which can also catalyze the synthesis of homospermidine, was identified (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Böttcher F. Adolph R.-D. Hartmann T. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-689Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Böttcher F. Ober D. Hartmann T. Can. J. Chem. 1994; 72: 80-85Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the roots of certain plants, e.g. Asteraceae such as Senecio and Eupatorium, that produce pyrrolizidine alkaloids, defense chemicals against insects. Homospermidine is generated by this enzyme as the starting material for pyrrolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis (21Böttcher F. Adolph R.-D. Hartmann T. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-689Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After the purification of homospermidine synthase from S. vernalis and cloning of its cDNA (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (and a nearly identical one from Senecio vulgaris (23Ober D. Harms R. Hartmann T. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)), it became clear that this enzyme is closely related to deoxyhypusine synthase but not to a bacterial homospermidine synthase, which is known to catalyze synthesis of homospermidine from two molecules of putrescine (24Ober D. Tholl D. Martin W. Hartmann T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 411-419Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The S. vernalis homospermidine synthase shows a high homology to S. vernalis deoxyhypusine synthase (79%) and to those from human (61%) and tobacco (74%) (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Based on the high amino acid sequence identity and similarity of the physical properties of the purified enzymes, homospermidine synthesis by the plant homospermidine synthase was presumed to occur by a mechanism similar to, or identical with, that of deoxyhypusine synthase, using spermidine as the butylamine donor and putrescine as the acceptor. However, the plant homospermidine synthase is distinct from deoxyhypusine synthase in that it does not use eIF5A precursor as butylamine acceptor and does not catalyze synthesis of deoxyhypusine in plant eIF5A precursor (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Ober D. Harms R. Witte L. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that this enzyme, which is specific for plant secondary metabolism, evolved from a ubiquitous critical enzyme, deoxyhypusine synthase (19Ober D. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14777-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Ober D. Harms R. Witte L. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Ober D. Harms R. Hartmann T. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Synthesis of hypusine in eIF5A precursors has been deemed irreversible, because there are no known reactions to convert the hypusine residue back to a lysine residue. The novel feature of the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction, namely, the facile reversibility of deoxyhypusine synthesis, caught our attention by a fortuitous observation made in the course of assays of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, the enzyme that acts on eIF5A(Dhp) to form hypusine. We routinely prepared a radiolabeled substrate for deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, eIF5A([3H]Dhp), in an in vitro deoxyhypusine synthase reaction by incubation of eIF5A precursor, ec-eIF5A, with the enzyme, NAD, and [3H]spermidine, followed by removal of excess [3H]spermidine. During deoxyhypusine hydroxylase reactions, we often observed a loss of radioactivity from the labeled substrate protein that could not be attributed to proteolytic degradation, because protease inhibitors provided no protection. In fact the release of radioactivity from the substrate protein was greatly enhanced upon incubation of eIF5A([3H]Dhp) with a mixture of purified deoxyhypusine synthase, NAD, and 1,3-diaminopropane, suggesting a reversal of deoxyhypusine synthesis by the human enzyme (Scheme 2). This enhancement was also observed when 1,3-diaminopropane was replaced by putrescine. The flexibility of human deoxyhypusine synthase to adopt putrescine as a butylamine acceptor in this reverse reaction suggested that the human enzyme, like the plant enzymes, is also capable of homospermidine synthesis (Scheme 2, right-hand pathway). The results presented here provide definitive evidence that generation of spermidine or homospermidine from eIF5A([3H]Dhp) in this reversal reaction occurs by way of the enzyme-imine intermediate through transfer of its 4-aminobutyl moiety to acceptors, 1,3-diaminopropane or putrescine, and reveal highly specific, yet versatile, activities of deoxyhypusine synthase.

Recombinant human eIF5A precursor protein, ec-eIF5A, was purified from BL21(DE3) harboring pET11a encoding human eIF5A as described previously (27Joe Y.A. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25916-25921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human deoxyhypusine synthase was purified as described previously (28Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). eIF5A([3H]Hpu) was prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells cultured with [1,8-3H]spermidine (4Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7217-7222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of eIF5A([3H]Dhp)—The deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A intermediate, eIF5A([3H]Dhp), is the normal substrate for deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. It was prepared in radiolabeled form by deoxyhypusine synthase-catalyzed incorporation of the 3H-labeled butylamine portion of [1,8-3H]spermidine into recombinant eIF5A precursor protein, ec-eIF5A. The reaction mixture contained, in 15 ml, 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm NAD, 5 μm (75 nmol, 1.25 mg) ec-eIF5A, 6.7 μm (100 nmol, 1.5 mCi) [1,8-3H]spermidine, and 40 μg of purified deoxyhypusine synthase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the radiolabeled eIF5A intermediate protein was separated from [1,8-3H]spermidine by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45–80% saturation). The precipitated protein was redissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and ammonium sulfate precipitation was repeated three to four times. Finally, the dissolved protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT at 4 °C for 4 h. ∼99% of the total radioactivity of this preparation was precipitable with 10% trichloroacetic acid, indicating a complete removal of free [3H]spermidine. This preparation was routinely used as substrate for deoxyhypusine hydroxylase assays and was used in preliminary experiments as substrate for the deoxyhypusine synthase reversal reaction. However, it was found to contain unreacted ec-eIF5A protein and a small amount of the enzyme. Therefore, pure eIF5A([3H]Dhp) (free of [1,8-3H]spermidine, ec-eIF5A, and deoxyhypusine synthase) was prepared from the partially purified radiolabeled substrate protein by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono S column as described previously (26Park M.H.

This pure eIF5A([3H]Dhp) was used for determining the kinetic parameters and the results shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3. Virtually all of the radioactivity in acid hydrolysates of the trichloroacetic acid precipitates of both eIF5A([3H]Dhp) preparations was found in the deoxyhypusine position upon ion exchange chromatographic separation (data not shown).Fig. 2Trichloroacetic acid-soluble products of the deoxyhypusine synthesis reversal reaction, before (A) and after (B) reduction.

After drying, the hydrolyzed samples were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography as reported previously (6Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and basic amino acids and amines were detected fluorometrically after reaction with ortho-phthaldehyde (29Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The detection limit was ∼0.05 nmol. Kinetic Parameters—The conditions of reactions (enzyme amount and incubation time) were set to permit linearity of reaction with time and limited substrate consumption (<20%); Km and V max values were calculated with the “Enzyme Kinetics” program version 1.0c by D. G. Gilbert, dogStar software (Bloomington IN). Reversal of Deoxyhypusine Synthesis Reaction and Identification of Products—When purified eIF5A([3H]Dhp) was incubated with deoxyhypusine synthase in the presence of NAD and 1,3-diaminopropane, a rapid loss of labeled protein was observed with a concomitant increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity (Fig. 1A, lane 5, top panel, radioactivity in protein after SDS-PAGE; lower panel, trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity). The release of protein-bound radioactivity was dependent on deoxyhypusine synthase and NAD and was accelerated by addition of 1,3-diaminopropane (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5) suggesting an enzyme-mediated reversal of deoxyhypusine synthesis (Scheme 2). The disappearance of the radiolabeled protein was not due to a proteolytic degradation of eIF5A([3H]Dhp), because it was not prevented by addition of protease inhibitors (not shown). No labeled deoxyhypusine was detected in the trichloroacetic acid supernatant solution before (as shown later in Fig 2A) or after acid hydrolysis (not shown). Furthermore, this phenomenon was limited to eIF5A([3H]Dhp); no loss of the labeled protein was observed when the hypusine-containing protein, eIF5A([3H]Hpu), was incubated with deoxyhypusine synthase, NAD, and 1,3-diaminopropane (Fig. 1C, lanes 13 and 14). The reversal of deoxyhypusine synthesis was confirmed by the analysis of the reaction products by ion exchange chromatography, which showed the formation of spermidine in a complete reaction (Fig. 2A, filled circles). When the reaction mixture contained only eIF5A([3H]Dhp), enzyme, and NAD, a small amount of Δ1-pyrroline was detected in the trichloroacetic acid supernatant (Fig. 1A, lane 4, lower panel, and Fig. 2A, filled diamonds). We have shown previously that Δ1-pyrroline is generated by cyclization of the 4-aminobutyl side chain of the enzyme-imine intermediate when deoxyhypusine synthase is incubated with [1,8-3H]spermidine and NAD in the absence of the acceptor, eIF5A precursor (6Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore Δ1-pyrroline was expected to be generated also in the reverse reaction in the absence of the acceptor, 1,3-diaminopropane. When 1,3-diaminopropane was included in the mixture, Δ1-pyrroline was no longer detectable and most of radioactivity from eIF5A([3H]Dhp) was found in spermidine (Fig. 1A, lane 5, Fig. 2A, filled circles), suggesting a rapid transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety to the acceptor, 1,3-diaminopropane, in this reverse reaction (Scheme 2). Involvement of Enzyme-imine Intermediate in the Deoxyhypusine Synthase Reversal Reaction—The involvement of the enzyme-imine intermediate in the forward reaction of deoxyhypusine synthesis (Scheme 1) was demonstrated by its trapping into a stable adduct, Enz(Dhp), by NaBH3CN reduction as reported previously (12Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The evidence that conversion of eIF5A([3H]Dhp) back to eIF5A precursor and [3H]spermidine occurs by way of the same enzyme-imine intermediate (Scheme 2) was obtained by the trapping experiment shown in Fig. 1B. A radiolabeled enzyme band (41 kDa) was detected after NaBH3CN reduction of an incubation mixture containing eIF5A([3H]Dhp), a large amount of enzyme (1 μg) and NAD (lane 9). The enzyme labeling was dependent on NAD and NaBH3CN reduction. An identical reaction mixture to that in lane 9 but without NaBH3CN treatment showed no labeling of the enzyme (lane 11). The trichloroacetic acid supernatant of the reduced reaction mixture with enzyme, NAD, and eIF5A([3H]Dhp) contained a small amount of pyrrolidine, the reduction product of Δ1-pyrroline (Fig. 2B, filled diamonds). Addition of 1,3-diaminopropane to the above incubation mixture caused an almost complete release of label from eIF5A([3H]Dhp) (Fig. 1B, lane 10) with no labeling of the enzyme. The radioactive product was [3H]spermidine (Fig. 2B, filled circles) as was the case for lane 5. pH Dependence of the Deoxyhypusine Synthase Reversal Reaction—The deoxyhypusine synthase-catalyzed production of deoxyhypusine is optimum at pH 9.2–9.5 (20Ober D.

https://openalex.org/W2133298829,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> UvrD protein is a 3′ to 5′ SF1 helicase required for DNA repair as well as DNA replication of certain plasmids. We have shown previously that UvrD can self-associate to form dimers and tetramers in the absence of DNA, but that a UvrD dimer is required to form an active helicase-DNA complex <i>in vitro</i>. Here we have used pre-steady state, chemical quenched flow methods to examine the kinetic mechanism for formation of the active, dimeric helicase-DNA complex. Experiments were designed to examine the steps leading to formation of the active complex, separate from the subsequent DNA unwinding steps. The results show that the active dimeric complex can form via two pathways. The first, faster path involves direct binding to the DNA substrate of a pre-assembled UvrD dimer (dimer path), whereas the second, slower path proceeds via sequential binding to the DNA substrate of two UvrD monomers (monomer path), which then assemble on the DNA to form the dimeric helicase. The rate-limiting step within the monomer pathway involves dimer assembly on the DNA. These results show that UvrD dimers that pre-assemble in the absence of DNA are intermediates along the pathway to formation of the functional dimeric UvrD helicase."

Inhibition of PP1 by overexpression of nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription in transient transfection assays. A mutant of NIPP1 that was defective in binding to PP1 did not have this effect. Also the co-expression of PP1γ reversed the inhibitory effect of NIPP1. Adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of NIPP1 significantly reduced HIV-1 transcription induced by Tat-expressing adenovirus in CD4+ HeLa cells that contained an integrated HIV-1 promoter (HeLa MAGI cells). In addition, infection of HeLa MAGI cells with adeno-associated virus-NIPP1 prior to the infection with HIV-1 significantly reduced the level of HIV-1 replication. Our results indicate that PP1 might be a host cell factor that is required for HIV-1 viral transcription. Therefore, nuclear PP1 may represent a novel target for anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.

Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The activation domain of Tat (amino acids 1–48) interacts with the host Cdk9/cyclin T1, whereas the positively charged RNA binding domain of Tat (amino acids 49–57) binds to the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) RNA (1Green W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cdk9/cyclin T1 is a protein kinase that enhances transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 2629-2634Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The interaction of HIV-1 Tat with the bulge of TAR RNA and with cyclin T1 promotes binding of cyclin T1 to the loop of TAR RNA (3Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). As a result, Cdk9/cyclin T1 is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter (3Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

Cdk9 also stimulates elongation of transcription indirectly by relieving inhibition of transcription by several negative regulators, including the 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor and the negative elongation factor (6Wada T.

PP1 belongs to the PPP family of serine-threonine protein phosphatases, which also comprises PP2A (including PP4 and PP6), PP2B, and PP5 (9Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

Nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) is an R-subunit of PP1 that inhibits the dephosphorylation of a variety of substrates including phosphorylase a (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We recently showed that NIPP1 also inhibits the dephosphorylation of RNAPII CTD by PP1 (8Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We also found that NIPP1 associates with a CTD kinase complex (11Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The previously identified CTD phosphatase, FCP1, inhibits HIV-1 transcription in vitro (12Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, PP1 stimulates Tat-dependent transcription from HIV-1 LTR in vitro (14Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to analyze whether PP1 is required for HIV-1 transcription and for viral replication in vivo. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of nuclear PP1 inhibition on Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription in cultured cells. PP1 was inhibited by overexpression of NIPP1 fused to the green fluorescent protein (EGFP). PP1 inhibition was shown to inhibit the Tat-dependent expression of the lacZ reporter under control of the HIV-1 LTR. NIPP1 also inhibited HIV-1 transcription induced by extracellularly added Tat. Expression of PP1γ rescued the NIPP1-mediated inhibition of Tat-dependent transcription. To explore further the effect of PP1 inhibition, we created recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) which expressed either wild type or mutant NIPP1-EGFP fusion proteins. AAV-mediated delivery of NIPP1 but not the mutant NIPP1 into HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 LTR-lacZ reporter inhibited adeno-Tat-induced transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. Moreover, AAV-mediated delivery of NIPP1 to CD4+ HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 promoter reduced the replication of T-tropic HIV-1 virus. Taken together, our results indicate that PP1 is required for HIV-1 transcription. Materials—COS-7, HEK 293, 84-31, and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells containing integrated HIV-1 LTR-lacZ, anti-Tat rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and also expressing CD4 and T-tropic HIV-1 strain NL4–3 were obtained from AIDS Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health). Anti-EGFP antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—HIV-1 Tat was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on an Aquapore RP-300 column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by reversed-phase chromatography (15Deng L.

Plasmids—The reporter plasmid pJK2 contained HIV-1 LTR (–138 to +82) followed by a nuclear localization signal and the lacZ reporter gene (courtesy of Dr. Michael Emmerman, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA). It expresses nuclear localization signal-tagged β-galactosidase under the control of HIV-1 LTR (16Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid JK2ΔTAR contained a deletion of +19 to +87 nucleotides introduced by restriction digestion with BglII. The Tat expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ben Berkhout (University of Amsterdam) (17Verhoef K. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors for EGFP-fused NIPP1-(1–351) (WT NIPP1), NIPP1-(1–351)K193–197A/V201A/F203A/Y335D (PI mutant), NIPP1-(1–329), NIPP1-(143–224), and NIPP1-(143–224)V201A/F203A (RATA mutant) were described (18Jagiello I.

The expression vector for PP1γ-EGFP was prepared as described (19Ceulemans H. Vulsteke V. De Maeyer M. Tatchell K. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Transient Transfections—HEK 293, 84-31, and COS-7 were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed at 75% confluency using a Ca2+-phosphate protocol and the indicated reporter plasmids. After transfection the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h and then analyzed by FACS and by the assays of β-galactosidase activity. Where indicated, Tat transactivation was induced 24 h post-transfection with JK2 by the addition of purified Tat (residues 1–72; 200 ng/ml) and 100 μm chloroquine, as described previously (20Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to 75% confluency and transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity and by FACS. Recombinant Adeno-associated Viruses—Recombinant AAV vectors containing either the EGFP-fused NIPP1 gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (AAV.NIPP1) or mutant EGFP-fused NIPP1 K193–197A/V201A/F203A/Y335D (AAV.pA-RATA Y335D) were produced as described (21Xiao W. Chirmule N. Berta S.C. McCullough B. Gao G. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3994-4003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cis plasmid (which contains the gene of interest with AAV ITRs), the trans plasmid (with the AAV rep and cap gene), and a helper plasmid (pFΔ 6, which contains an essential region from the Ad genome) were co-transfected into HEK-293 cells at a ratio of 1:1:2 by calcium phosphate precipitation in an Ad-free system. The cells were harvested 96 h later. The AAV was purified through two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation, desalted by dialysis at 4 °C against PBS, aliquoted, and kept at 4 °C. The titer was determined by quantitative dot blot hybridization. The purity of the AAV vector preparation was addressed by colloidal brilliant blue G staining (Sigma) and Western blotting of viral proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Adeno-Tat—The E1-deleted recombinant Ad carrying Tat was generated as described previously (22Kozarsky K. Grossman M. Wilson J.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length HIV-1 Tat protein cloned into the plasmid pCXN was subcloned in the pAd.CMVlink plasmid. pAd.CMVlink and ClaI-digested adenoviral DNA were co-transfected into HEP-293 cells at a ratio of 3:1 by calcium phosphate precipitation to allow the recombination. The virus was purified through three rounds of plaque purification. Viruses were replicated in HEK-293 cells and were purified from a cell lysate by two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The purified virus was desalted on a Bio-Gel P-6 desalting column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS. The titer of the virus preparation was determined both by absorbance at 260 nm and by plaque assay (23Davis A. Wilson J.M. Dracopoli N.C. Haines J.L. Kort B.R. Moir D.T. Morton C.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Smith D.R. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1996: 12.4.7-12.4.15Google Scholar). The particle to plaque-forming unit ratio was less than 100. Purified viruses were suspended in PBS at the desired concentrations. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 20 min at room temperature in 50 μl of lysis buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA. Subsequently, 100 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) solution (72 mm Na2PO4 at pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml ONPG, 12 mm MgCl2, 180 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added and incubated at room temperature until a yellow color was developed. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The 96-well plate was analyzed in a micro plate reader at 414 nm (Lab Systems Multiscan MS). For the X-gal assay cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 4 mg/ml K3Fe (CN)6, 2.1 mg/ml K4Fe (CN)6 × 3H2O and 1 mm MgCl2 dissolved in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. HIV-1 Viral Infections—HeLa cells containing LTR-lacZ and also expressing CD4 were subcultured in a 96-well plate at 10,000 cells per well. The cells were infected with AAV-NIPP1 or AAV-NIPP1 PI mutant viruses at 106 plaque-forming units per well while cells were still in suspension. After 24 h of culturing the cells were infected with equal amounts of HIV-1NL4–3 (multiplicity of infection of 2.5) in 0.1 ml of culture medium with 20 mg/ml Polybrene. After 4 h of incubation the medium was removed; cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in complete DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 48 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and stained with X-gal at 37 °C for 30 min. Expression of NIPP1-EGFP Blocks HIV-1-activated Transcription in Cultured Cells—To analyze the contribution of PP1 to the control of HIV-1 transcription in intact cells, nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) was expressed as a fusion with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in HEK 293, COS-7, or HeLa cells. It has been shown previously (18Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the NIPP1-EGFP fusion protein was expressed to significantly higher levels than NIPP1 without this tag. As a control, we used a mutated version of NIPP1-EGFP (NIPP1-(1–351) K193–197A/V201A/F203A/Y335D, PI mutant) that no longer interacts with PP1 (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this mutant the PP1-binding sites in both the central and C-terminal domains of NIPP1 are mutated (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To explore whether the effects of NIPP1 were mediated by its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity, we also used a C-terminally truncated version NIPP1-(1–329), which lacks the RNA-binding and -hydrolyzing site (25Jin Q. Beullens M. Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EGFP tag allowed an analysis of the transfection efficiency by FACS or by fluorescence microscopy, which revealed that the wt and mutated NIPP1-EGFP were expressed in close to 100% of all cells (not shown). In accordance with previous observations (18Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both the wt and mutated NIPP1-EGFP were exclusively nuclear, whereas EGFP was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (not shown). The expression of the NIPP1-EGFP fusions was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with antibodies against EGFP (Fig. 1A). The expression of β-galactosidase from the HIV-1 LTR-lacZ vector (JK2) was analyzed using a qualitative X-gal-based assay or a quantitative ONPG-based assay (Fig. 1, B–D). In HEK 293 cells the co-transfection of the Tat-expressing vector and HIV-1 LTR-lacZ resulted in a 15-fold increase of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 2). The co-expression of NIPP1-EGFP blocked HIV-1 transcription nearly completely (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 3). In contrast, the co-expression of the PI mutant of NIPP1-EGFP, which cannot bind PP1, did not have an inhibitory effect on the Tat-mediated transcription (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 4). The co-expression of NIPP1-(1–329), which lacks the endoribonuclease catalytic site, also inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 1, B and C). In the absence of Tat, wt NIPP1 as well as NIPP1 PI and NIPP1-(1–329) moderately inhibited basal HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 1D). In COS-7 cells, Tat stimulated transcription from HIV-1 LTR even up to 40-fold (Fig. 1E, lane 2). Again, the co-transfection of wild type NIPP1, but not the PI mutant, inhibited Tat-activated transcription (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 4). Transcription from a mutant HIV-1 LTR with a deletion of the fragment encoding TAR RNA (HIV-1 LTRΔ TAR) was inhibited about 50% by both NIPP1 and mutant NIPP1 (Fig. 1E, lanes 7 and 8). In accordance with this result, in the absence of Tat, both NIPP1 and the NIPP1 PI mutant inhibited the basal HIV-1 transcription by about 60% (Fig. 1E, lanes 9–11) indicating that this effect of NIPP1 was not due to its ability to bind PP1. In vitro, the central domain of NIPP1 (residues 143–224) is an equally potent inhibitor of PP1 as full-length NIPP1 (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found that expression of EGFP fusion of NIPP1-(143–224) (Fig. 2A, lane 1) also inhibited Tat-induced HIV transcription (Fig. 2B, lane 3). However, mutation of the PP1-binding RVXF motif, as in NIPP1-(143–224) V201A/F203A (RATA mutant) (Fig. 2A, lane 2), abolished the inhibition of Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Collectively, our data indicate that the expression of NIPP1 fairly specifically and potently blocks Tat-dependent transcription from HIV-1 LTR in cultured cells and that this inhibition depends on the binding of PP1. The Effects of NIPP1 on the Tat-dependent HIV-1 Transcription Are Reversed by Co-expression of PP1—To analyze further the role of PP1 in the NIPP1-mediated inhibition of induced HIV-1 transcription, we expressed a PP1 isoform, PP1γ-EGFP (Fig. 2A, lanes 3). Expression of PP1 per se did not affect the Tat-dependent transcription (Fig. 2C, lane 3). But the NIPP1-EGFP-mediated inhibition of Tat-dependent transcription (Fig. 2C, lane 4) was completely reversed by the expression of PP1 (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Our results indicate that NIPP1 inhibits Tat-dependent HIV-transcription because it inhibits PP1, which appears to be necessary for transcription. Overexpression of PP1 titrates NIPP1, which explains why co-expression of NIPP1 and PP1 is not inhibitory. The Inhibition of Tat-dependent Transcription by NIPP1 Is Not the Result of a Reduced Expression of Tat—The inhibition of PP1 might deregulate the expression of Tat and in this way affect Tat-dependent transcription. To analyze whether Tat was a limiting factor in transfection experiments in this study, both the Tat-expressing vector as well as the HIV-1 LTR-lacZ expression vector (JK2) were titrated. We found that even a 10-fold decrease in the amount of Tat-expressing plasmid did not reduce the level of transactivation in COS-7 cells or HEK 293 cells (data not shown). In contrast, the Tat-activated HIV-1 LTR-lacZ expression was strictly dependent on the amount of HIV-1 LTR plasmid in COS-7 cells or HEK 293 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the amount of HIV-1 LTR and not Tat was a limiting factor for lacZ expression in our transfection assays. The expression of Tat was analyzed in COS-7 cells transfected with the Tat-expressing vector and immunostained with anti-Tat polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3). Tat expression was visualized by indirect immunostaining with TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Fig. 3D). No staining was found in untransfected cells (Fig. 3E). We observed no significant difference in Tat expression in the cells transfected with Tat alone or co-transfected with Tat and either NIPP1-EGFP or mutant NIPP1-EGFP expression vectors (Fig. 3, A and D). Expression of NIPP1, analyzed earlier in Western blot (Fig. 1A), was monitored here by fluorescence of EGFP (Fig. 3B). To investigate further whether the inhibitory effect of NIPP1 on Tat-dependent transcription was dependent on the expression of Tat, HIV-1 transcription was activated by addition of purified Tat protein to the culture medium (20Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The purified Tat increased HIV-1 transcription about 5-fold (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, HIV-1 LTRΔTAR, in which the TAR sequence was deleted, was only slightly (less than 2-fold) induced by Tat protein (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). Again, the expression of NIPP1-EGFP but not the mutant NIPP1-EGFP blocked the Tat-induced transcription (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, neither NIPP1-EGFP nor mutant NIPP1-EGFP expression has an effect on transcription from the mutant HIV-1 LTRΔTAR (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of NIPP1-EGFP blocked Tat-activated transcription and that this effect was not the result of a decreased expression of Tat. AAV-mediated Delivery of NIPP1 Inhibits Induced HIV-1 Transcription from an Integrated HIV-1 Promoter—In cells infected with HIV-1, transcription from the integrated HIV-1 promoter is very inefficient in the absence of Tat as compared with the strong basal transcription from the naked DNA in vitro or transcription from the transiently transfected DNA containing HIV-1 promoter (1Green W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of NIPP1 expression on the induction of an integrated HIV-1 promoter using HeLa cells with an integrated HIV-1 LTR that controls lacZ reporter (16Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express NIPP1 and Tat, we used viral gene-mediated transfer. The wt or PI mutant of NIPP1 was expressed using AAV viral gene transfer, whereas Tat was expressed using adeno-Tat virus. Infection of the HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 LTR-lacZ with adeno-Tat dramatically induced Tat-activated lacZ expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2). Infection of the HeLa cells with AAV-NIPP1 but not AAV-NIPP1 PI mutant prior to the infection with adeno-Tat virus reduced activated HIV-1 transcription by 50% (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). Because both NIPP1 and the PI mutant of NIPP1 were expressed as fusions with EGFP, allowing equal infectivity to be ensured, their distinct effects cannot be ascribed to differences in gene delivery efficiency (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that PP1 is an essential factor also during HIV-1 transcription from the integrated HIV-1 promoter. AAV-mediated Delivery of NIPP1 Inhibits Replication of HIV-1—We further analyzed the effect of PP1 inhibition on HIV-1 transcription using a single HIV-1 replication assay. CD4+ HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 LTR-lacZ (HeLa MAGI cells) (16Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were infected with T-tropic HIV-1 strain NL4-3 virus. Following the infection by HIV-1, production of Tat leads to the expression of β-galactosidase detected by staining the cells with X-gal (Fig. 6, A, lane 1, and B). AAV-mediated delivery of NIPP1 but not the PI mutant of NIPP1 decreased about 6-fold the number of X-gal-positive cells (Fig. 6, A, lanes 2 and 3, and C and D). As a control to detect all cells containing HIV-1 LTR-lacZ, HeLa MAGI cells were infected with adeno-Tat virus (Fig. 6, A, lane 4, and E). In non-infected cells, the expression of HIV-1 LTR was not detectable (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that inhibition of PP1 efficiently blocks HIV-1 viral replication. Recent studies (1Green W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 2629-2634Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar) firmly established that Tat-induced transcription from the HIV-1 promoter is regulated at the level of RNAPII CTD phosphorylation. Whereas the role of the Tat-associated CTD kinase Cdk9/cyclin T1 has been well established (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 2629-2634Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar), the role of the protein phosphatases in the function of Tat is not very well understood. RNAP II CTD is dephosphorylated by a well established CTD phosphatase, FCP1 (26Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tat inhibits FCP1, and this inhibition may alleviate FCP1-mediated pausing of transcription (12Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have recently reported (8Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that PP1 also functions as a CTD phosphatase. We have shown that PP1 and FCP1 contribute equally to the dephosphorylation of RNAPII in vitro (8Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vivo a PPP-type phosphatase dephosphorylates ∼40% of all RNAPII when cells are treated with high concentrations of flavopiridol (8Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PP1 associates with the preinitiation complex and stimulates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro (14Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the inhibition of PP1 by overexpression of NIPP1, a nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (9Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), might have a regulatory effect in HIV-1 transcription. NIPP1 inhibits the dephosphorylation of a variety of substrates by PP1 including phosphorylase a (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reported NIPP1-mediated inhibition of splicing in vitro is independent of its ability to inhibit PP1 (27Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent studies (29Parker L. Gross S. Beullens M. Bollen M. Bennett D. Alphey L. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 789-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the expression of NIPP1 in Drosophila is lethal and that this phenotype is reversed by co-expression of PP1, indicating that the lethality stems from the inhibition of PP1. It is unclear which nuclear process is affected and causes the embryonic lethality of the NIPP1 transgenic flies, but our studies (see Ref. 14Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and the present study) show that PP1 has an effect on transcription. Indeed, in the present paper we provide evidence that overexpression of NIPP1 inhibits HIV-1 transcription and that the inhibition correlates with the ability of NIPP1 to bind and inhibit PP1. We have examined the role of NIPP1 in cultured cells by overexpression, using transient transfections and adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer. Overexpression of NIPP1 potently inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription. A NIPP1 mutant that does not bind PP1 was not inhibitory to transcription, whereas a mutant of NIPP1 that lacked the endoribonuclease active site was still inhibitory. Moreover, expression of the central domain of NIPP1 but not its RATA mutant, which is incapable of binding to PP1, also potently inhibited Tat-induced transcription. Therefore, the effect of NIPP1 on HIV-1 transcription is likely to be accounted for by inhibition of the nuclear pool of PP1. This conclusion is further supported by our observation that the effect of NIPP1 on HIV-1 transcription was reversed by the co-expression of PP1γ. This effect of co-expression of PP1γ is likely to be accounted for by titration of NIPP1, resulting in a lesser inhibition of the endogenous pools of PP1. Interestingly, the co-expression of PP1γ did not rescue the inhibition of basal transcription by NIPP1 (not shown). Therefore, it seems likely that PP1 is involved in the regulation of Tat-activated but not the basal HIV-1 transcription. It is possible that the mechanism of transcriptional stimulation by Tat includes a transient activation of PP1. Because Tat induces Cdk9/cyclin T1 to phosphorylate RNAP II CTD (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 2629-2634Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 30Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it will be of interest to investigate whether Tat induces phosphorylation of NIPP1 by Cdk9/cyclin T1. It is not yet clear what are the substrates of PP1 during HIV-1 transcription. Because PP1 may function as a CTD phosphatase (8Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and because CTD phosphorylation regulates transcriptional elongation (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 2629-2634Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar), it is possible that PP1 catalyzes a transient dephosphorylation of the CTD during Tat-dependent transcription. Our preliminary studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Tat induces PP1 to dephosphorylate Ser-2 CTD of promoter proximal but not promoter distal RNAPII. 2T. Ammosova and S. Nekhai, unpublished data. In addition, PP1 may be involved in dephosphorylation of other proteins, such as autophosphorylated Cdk9. Cdk9 phosphorylation is important for the binding of Cdk9/cyclin T1·Tat complex to TAR RNA (30Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments indicate that both PP2A and PP1 dephosphorylate autophosphorylated Cdk9 in vitro, 2T. Ammosova and S. Nekhai, unpublished data. but it remains to be examined which of the two phosphatases dephosphorylates Cdk9 during transcription. The finding that PP1, and perhaps also NIPP1, has a role in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription will open up a more general question of whether PP1 regulates the transcription of host cellular genes as well. It is possible that HIV-1 Tat, serving to recruit Cdk9, activates the NIPP1/PP1 holoenzyme in order to up-regulate transcription of HIV-1 genes. Alternatively, PP1 may have an unrecognized role in the general regulation of the transcription of cellular genes. A more detailed study will address the questions of the regulation of different cellular promoters by PP1, the identification of the substrates for PP1 during HIV-1 and non-HIV-1 transcription, and the effects of Tat on dephosphorylation of these substrates by PP1. Uncovering a novel regulatory pathway of Tat-mediated transcription may provide additional valuable targets for HIV-1 therapeutics.

Activation of factor V by α-thrombin is required for the interaction of the cofactor with factor Xa and prothrombin. Factor Va and factor Xa interact stoichiometrically in the absence of phospholipids with a Kd of 0.8 μm, and the interaction is dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ (14Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J.

Interestingly, proexosite I of prothrombin, which is present at a low affinity state on the molecule, and its affinity for its ligands increases by ∼100-fold following activation and formation of thrombin (33Anderson P.J.

Thrombin, factor Xa, and the RVV-factor V activator can produce factor Va by discrete proteolytic cleavages (for details see reviews (1Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2003; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Cawthern M. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev. Eukariotic Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 241-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)). It has also been reported that a protease from the venom of Naja naja oxiana produces a factor Va-like molecule lacking a major portion of the carboxyl terminal domain of the heavy chain, with diminished cofactor activity (46Bakker H.M. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Yukelson L.Y. Ebberink R. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20662-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for this diminished cofactor activity, which is mostly observed at low factor Xa concentrations, have yet to be elucidated. The present study was undertaken to understand the role of the last 13 amino acids from the COOH-terminal portion of the heavy chain of the cofactor. Thus, our present study adds to the knowledge regarding the structure/function relationships required for an active factor Va molecule. Materials and Reagents—Hepes, Sepharose CL-4B, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine brain, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) from hen egg were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The thromboplastin reagent used in the clotting assays was purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (Durham, NC).

Human prothrombin, α-thrombin, and human factor V were purified as previously reported (49Lundblad R.L. Kingdom H.S. Mann K.G.

The enzyme from the snake venom N. nigricollis nigricollis (NN) was prepared as described (52Hassan, M. I.

Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide representing amino acid residues 697–709 of factor Va heavy chain (DYQNRLAAALGIR, D13R) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. (Mereyside, UK). The synthetic pentadecapeptide representing factor V residues 337–351 from factor Va heavy chain previously shown to have no effect on prothrombinase activity (PVIPANMDKKYRSQH, P15H) as well as the peptide shown to contain a binding site for factor Xa (EYFIAAEEV, AP4′) were synthesized, in the Biotechnology Core of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH), purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and characterized by mass spectrometry as described (48Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS were prepared as previously described (56Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the phospholipid vesicles were determined by phosphorous assay (57Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Generation of Various Factor V Species—The various factor V species were generated by incubation of single chain human plasma factor V with the purified enzymes. Phospholipid vesicles slightly increase the rate of cleavage of factor V by NN, whereas PCPS vesicles diminish the rate of activation of factor V by α-thrombin (58Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17132-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the experiments studying the effect of α-thrombin on factor VNN were conducted in the absence of PCPS vesicles. The nomenclature for the proteolyzed factor V products is as follows: factor VIIa: human factor V incubated with α-thrombin (1 unit/ml, ∼10 nm) at 37 °C for 5 min; factor VNN: human factor V (220 nm) incubated with NN venom enzyme (2.4 nm) at 37 °C for 3 h; factor VIIa/NN: factor VNN incubated with α-thrombin (1 unit/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. In all cases, 20 nm hirudin was added following proteolytic treatment. To generate factor VRVV, 212 nm human factor V was incubated at 37 °C with 4.2 nm RVV-V activator for 2 h. In some experiments following full activation to factor VRVV, 2.1 nm APC and 50 μm PCPS vesicles were added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h. Aliquots were taken at the time points indicated in the figure legends and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cleavage of Factor VIIa by NN Protease and Inactivation by APC— α-Thrombin-cleaved human factor VIIa (212 nm) was incubated at 37 °C with 50 μm PCPS vesicles and 2.1 nm NN protease. After 3 h, 2.1 nm APC was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h. At selected time intervals prior to and subsequent to addition of APC, aliquots of the mixture were withdrawn and assayed for cofactor activity in a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma. At the same intervals, aliquots were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. Determination of Factor Va Cofactor Activity—Cofactor activity was measured at selected time intervals by clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma and standardized to the percentage of control (50Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.R. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 80: 243-275Google Scholar). In a typical assay 50 μl of factor V-deficient plasma was mixed with an equal volume of the sample to be analyzed. To start the assay 100 μl of the PT reagent (Simplastin Excel) was added while rocking the tube at 37 °C. The assay end point was determined by visualization of the fibrin clot. Control experiments using a solution of RVV-V activator or NN alone (in the absence of factor V) in the clotting assay, at the same concentrations that are used to cleave factor V, gave no interference with the clotting process (with or without normal plasma). Thus, trace amounts of snake venom enzymes when introduced in plasma during the clotting assay (or in the prothrombinase assay) did not interfere with the results obtained. The assay was initiated with the addition of the factor Va followed by the addition of thromboplastin. Measurements of Rates of Thrombin Formation using DAPA—Functionally defined apparent dissociation constants (Kd ,app) for factor Xa binding to factor Va-PCPS were inferred from an assay measuring α-thrombin generation at various factor Xa concentrations (59Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 60Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MPF-44A fluorescence spectrophotometer with a λex 280 nm (slit at 8 nm), λem 550 nm (slit at 16 nm), and a 500-nm long pass filter in the emission beam. In a typical experiment a mixture (∼80 ml) composed of prothrombin (1.4 μm), PCPS vesicles (20 μm), and DAPA (3 μm) was incubated in the dark for 20 min in 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, buffer. An aliquot of the mixture (1800 μl) was added to a cuvette containing the indicated factor V species (0.5 nm), and the base line fluorescence was monitored for 15–20 s at ambient temperature. Factor Xa (100 pm to 10 nm) was then added to initiate the reaction. α-Thrombin generation was continuously monitored by the change in the fluorescence intensity of DAPA present in the reaction mixture. The use of DAPA in the reaction mixture prevents feedback reactions catalyzed by the newly formed thrombin. Determination of the Apparent Binding Constants for Factor Xa—To determine the apparent dissociation constant (Kd ,app) of factor Xa for the various factor Va species, a titration with factor Xa measuring prothrombin activation (1.4 μm) was performed using concentrations ranging from 100 pm to 10 nm. The Kd ,app for the factor Va-factor Xa interaction is given by Equation 1, Kd=[Va]F·[Xa]F[Va·Xa](Eq. 1) where [Va]F and [Xa]F are the concentrations of free factor Va and factor Xa; the final concentration of factor Va within the mixture was 0.5 nm. The initial rate of thrombin formation for each factor Xa concentration was plotted as a function of the factor Xa concentration (using the software DeltaGraph PRO, 3.5, Delta Point Inc., Monterey, CA) using the quadratic equation that is the solution for Equation 1 (16Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall, New York, NY1992: 15-18Google Scholar).

Prior to each experiment, the maximum amount of complex formed under the above conditions was verified by replacing [Va]F and [Xa]F in Equation 1 by, [Va]F=[Va]T-[Va·Xa](Eq. 3) [Xa]F=[Xa]T-[Va·Xa](Eq. 4) where [Va]T and [Xa]T are the total concentrations of factor Va and factor Xa. Inhibition of Thrombin Formation—The formation of thrombin was also analyzed using the fluorescent thrombin inhibitor DAPA as described (48Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LLC, Norwalk, CT) with λex = 280 nm, λem = 550 nm, and a 500-nm long pass filter in the emission beam (Schott KV-500). The buffer used in all cases was composed of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS(Ca2+), “assay buffer”). The final concentration of factor Va in the mixture was 4 nm with factor Xa at 10 nm, prothrombin at 350 nm, PCPS vesicles at 10 μm, in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Factor Va was incubated with the peptides (at concentrations ranging from 0.5 nm to 100 μm) for 10 min and added to the assay. The initial rate of thrombin formation (nm IIa·min–1) was calculated as described (48Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The concentration of peptide given in each figure is the final concentration of the peptide in the assay mixture. All data were initially analyzed and stored using the software FL WinLab (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and further analyzed and plotted with the software Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy of [OG488]-EGR-hXa was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer in L-format as recently described (48Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Anisotropy measurements were performed in a quartz cuvette under constant stirring (low) with λex = 490 nm, λem = 520 nm with a long pass filter (Schott KV-520) in the emission beam. At each addition, anisotropy was measured for 20 s and eight successive readings were averaged. In all cases, the total addition of peptide did not exceed 10% of the volume of the reaction. All data were initially ana"
https://openalex.org/W1987329471,"Hsp90 complexes contain a class of co-chaperones characterized by a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which mediates binding to a carboxyl-terminal EEVD region in Hsp90. Among Hsp90 TPR co-chaperones in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only Cns1 is essential. The amino terminus of Cns1, which harbors the TPR domain, is sufficient for viability when overexpressed. In a screen for temperature-sensitive alleles of CNS1, we identified mutations resulting in substitutions of conserved residues in the TPR domain. Mutations in CNS1 disrupt in vitro and in vivo interaction with Hsp90 and reduce Hsp90 function, indicating that Cns1 is a bona fide co-chaperone. Genetic interactions between CNS1 and another Hsp90 co-chaperone, CPR7, suggest that the two co-chaperones share an essential role in the cell. Although both the TPR and the isomerase domains of the cyclophilin Cpr7 are required for viability of cns1 mutant cells, this requirement does not depend on the catalytic function of the isomerase domain. Instead, hydrophilic residues on the surface of this domain appear to be important for the common Cns1·Cpr7 function. Although both co-chaperones interact with Hsp90 primarily through the carboxyl terminus (EEVD), Cns1 and Cpr7 are mostly found in complexes distinct from Hsp90. EEVD is required for normal growth in cns1 mutant cells, demonstrating for the first time in vivo requirement for this conserved region of Hsp90. Overall, our findings reveal a considerable degree of complexity in the interactions not only between Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, but also among the co-chaperones themselves.

The number of Hsp90 substrates identified to date is large and, although they differ greatly in structure and function, most appear to be proteins involved in signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 4Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). How Hsp90 regulates a vastly diverse group of client proteins remains an important question. In part, this versatility can be attributed to the assistance of co-chaperone proteins that modulate the role of Hsp90 in vivo. These co-chaperones impinge on several properties of Hsp90, including its ATPase activity, physical conformations, interaction with substrates, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization (5Prodromou C.

Thus, a clear understanding of how Hsp90 function requires investigation of the roles played by its co-chaperones. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp90 is encoded by two genes, HSP82 and HSC82, either of which is sufficient for viability (12Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The largest subset of Hsp90 co-chaperones is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat domains, which mediate binding to Hsp90. TPR-containing co-chaperones were first identified in Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes (reviewed in Ref. 13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). One of these, Hop (Sti1 in S. cerevisiae) can bridge Hsp90 and another essential chaperone, Hsp70, via two sets of TPR domains (14Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Two classes of large TPR-containing immunophilins have also been identified in Hsp90 complexes: FK506-binding proteins FKBP51 and FKBP52, and cyclophilin CyP40, which binds cyclosporin A (CsA) (16Ratajczak T. Carrello A. Mark P.J. Warner B.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. House A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13187-13192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22067-22070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a carboxyl-terminal TPR domain, both immunophilin groups contain peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains in the amino termini. Although S. cerevisiae does not possess orthologs of the large FKBPs, it contains two CyP40 relatives: Cpr6 and Cpr7 (18Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Warth R. Briand P.A. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another protein found in Hsp90 complexes, Cns1, is essential for viability and in this regard unique among the TPR co-chaperone family (20Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have addressed the roles played by TPR co-chaperones with regard to in vivo function of Hsp90. Assays that measure the activity of heterologous Hsp90 substrates such as maturation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) revealed the requirement for Cpr7 and Sti1 for full Hsp90 activity (22Duina A.A. Chang H.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Chang H.C. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sti1 and Cpr7 are also required for normal growth; the functional relationship between these co-chaperones is revealed by the severe growth defect of cells containing null alleles of both genes (22Duina A.A. Chang H.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The tetratricopeptide repeat domains in these co-chaperones consist of a tandem array of three repeat units, each of which forms a pair of anti-parallel α-helices (24Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Conserved amino acids at specific positions within the TPR units define the TPR fold, whereas other residues line an internal groove formed by the overall structure and make direct contacts with the EEVD sequence found at the end of the Hsp90 carboxyl terminus (15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 25Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although EEVD is conserved in all Hsp90 homologs, the deletion of this sequence does not affect growth of S. cerevisiae cells (26Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This finding brings into question the importance of the Hsp90 carboxyl terminus in vivo and suggests either that there is an alternative mode of interaction between Hsp90 and TPR co-chaperones or that their physical association is not required. The role of immunophilin PPIase domains in Hsp90 function also remains unclear. It is possible that the catalytic activity these proteins show in vitro (27Pirkl F. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Mayr C. Richter K. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34140-34146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is involved in protein folding and may even be important for the mechanism of Hsp90 action on some substrates. However, a mutant form of the yeast cyclophilin Cpr7 in which the PPIase domain has been deleted supports full Hsp90 activity and normal growth (29Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Kurtz R.B. Chang H.C. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10819-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A functional relationship between Cpr7 and Cns1 was first revealed by the discovery that overexpression of CNS1 can suppress both the slow growth phenotype and decreased Hsp90 activity that result from deletion of CPR7 (20Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Cns1 contains a three-unit TPR domain related to those found in Hsp90-associated immunophilins, a direct interaction between Cns1 and Hsp90 has not been demonstrated prior to this study. Furthermore, Cns1 can associate with Cpr7 (20Dolinski K.J. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7344-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although whether this interaction is direct or whether it requires Hsp90 is unclear. In addition, the full scope of Hsp90 functions in which these co-chaperones participate remains unknown. In this study, we have taken different approaches to investigate the function of Cns1 in general and its role in Hsp90 complexes in particular. We isolated temperature-sensitive alleles of CNS1 and assessed their effects on Hsp90 activity and Hsp90-Cns1 physical interactions. We have also more fully explored the functional relationship between Cns1 and Cpr7 by examining genetic interactions between cpr7 and cns1 mutants. Our studies reveal that in cells with compromised Cns1 function the PPIase domain of Cpr7 and the EEVD Hsp90 carboxyl terminus are essential for viability. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Standard genetic techniques and growth media were used in the study. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method (30Ito H. Fukuda Y.

Minvielle-Sebastia (Institute de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, Bordeaux 2 Université, Bordeaux, France) (34Cullin C. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Yeast. 1994; 10: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). pGAL-Cns1ΔC (pJM165) contains a segment of the CNS1 ORF from bp 1 to 636 in pYeF1. pJM105 was described previously (21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pMT100 is a TRP1-marked CEN vector expressing wild-type Cns1 3HA-tagged at the carboxyl terminus under control of the endogenous promoter. Plasmids encoding cns1-1 (pMT207) and cns1-2 (pMT206) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pMT100. A plasmid expressing Cns13C (pMT105) was made by ligating the fragment corresponding to the CNS1 open reading frame from the original plasmid isolated in the screen for temperature-sensitive alleles into pMT100. pGST-Cpr7 (pJM5) has been described previously (22Duina A.A. Chang H.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). pGST-Cns1-(1–212) (pJM158), pGST-Cns1-(81–212) (pJM157), and pGST-Cns1-(213–385) (pJM159) were made by PCR amplification of the corresponding regions of CNS1 ORF and ligating into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). pGST-Cns1 (pJM161) was made by PCR amplification of the region of CNS1 ORF between 639 and 1155 bp and ligating into pJM158. Plasmids expressing mutant forms of GST-Cns1, i.e. pGST-Cns1G90D (pMT142), pGST-Cns1C140R (pMT140), and pGST-Cns13C (pMT138), were made by ligation of mutant cns1 from appropriate vectors into pJM161. pURA3-GPD-His6-Hsp82ΔEEVD (pMT179) was made by replacing codon 705 in pURA3-GPD-His6-Hsp82 (isolated from GPD:HSP82FP cells) with a stop codon using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). A plasmid encoding the wild-type was replaced by pMT179 in GPD: HSP82FP to generate AS5 strain. pSC1 was used for overexpression of Cpr7 under the control of endogenous promoter in a multicopy URA3-marked plasmid. Plasmids expressing Cpr7 and Cpr7TPR under control of the endogenous promoter have essentially been described previously (29Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Kurtz R.B. Chang H.C. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10819-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) except that the selectable marker was replaced with LEU2, resulting in plasmids pMT160 and pMT175, respectively. A plasmid expressing GAL-driven FLAG-tagged Cpr7 (pMT194) was made by PCR amplification of the CPR7 and ligation into the pESC-LEU vector (Stratagene). For the experiment shown below in Fig. 7a, Cpr7 was expressed from pMT184, which contains a TRP1 instead of a LEU2 selectable marker. Cpr6PPI-Cpr7TPR chimera (pMT204) is expressed from a pRS425-based vector, which contains bp 1–600 of the CPR6 ORF and bp 603–1191 of CPR7 ORF under control GAL promoter. pCpr7PPI-Cpr6TPR (pMT200) was made by PCR amplification of fragments of CPR7 ORF from start to 603 bp and CPR6 ORF from 538 bp to the end and ligation into pESC-LEU vector. pCpr7R64A (pMT203) and pCpr7K67P, N68G (pMT188) were made by site-directed mutagenesis of pMT160. Normal expression levels of the wild-type and mutant forms of Cpr7 were confirmed by Western blotting. Screen for Temperature-sensitive Alleles of CNS1—JMY84h cells containing pJM105 were co-transformed with 50–100 ng of linearized pRS314 and 100–200 ng of mutagenic PCR reaction products. Conditions used for mutagenic PCR were the following: 10 ng of pJM105 template, 100 ng of each primer, 0.4 mm MnCl2, 0.25 mm normal dNTPs, 0.05 mm lower dNTP, and buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001%). Primers were designed to amplify the entire CNS1 ORF, 600 bp of the promoter and ∼200 bp of vector sequences flanking the gene. Transformants were selected on the medium lacking uracil and tryptophan. Colonies were grown for 3 days and replicaplated onto medium containing 5-FOA at 23 and 37 °C. DNA was isolated from the colonies that grew at 23 °C but not at 37 °C, transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and re-introduced into the original yeast strain. These plasmids were sequenced to determine mutations responsible for the phenotype. Screen for Multicopy Suppressors of cns1ts Alleles—cns1-1 cells were transformed with a S. cerevisiae genomic library prepared using multicopy URA3-marked plasmids (gift of P. Hieter, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) and grown on plasmid-selective medium at permissive temperature (23 °C). After 3 days, the cells were replica-plated onto plasmid-selective medium at 23 and 37 °C and incubated for 3–5 days. Plasmid dependence of the ability to grow at the non-permissive temperature was confirmed by streaking these cells on 5-FOA. Plasmid DNA was isolated from cells exhibiting suppressed phenotype, transformed into E. coli DH5α, and re-introduced into cns1-1 recipients. Genomic inserts present were identified by sequencing. Assays of β-Galactosidase Activity (GRE, HSE, and FUS1)— MTY189h or JMY84h cells containing wild-type and mutant CNS1 on TRP1-marked plasmids were transformed with the appropriate reporter plasmids. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (22Duina A.A.

Protein Interaction Assays—Lysis of yeast cells was performed essentially as described previously (21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1 mm dithiothreitol was omitted in preparing lysates that were used for purification on Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). Protein Concentrations Were Determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay—Precipitations using GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell.

BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RIL pLysS E. coli cells (Stratagene) were used in all experiments except for the one shown in Fig. 1a. GPD:HSP82FP or AS5 cells were used to analyze endogenous yeast Hsp90 complexes. These experiments were performed as described previously (21Marsh J.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7353-7359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that additional washes were performed with a buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and that 200 mm imidazole was used for elution of Hsp90 complexes. Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) was added to the eluted fractions without precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and samples were frozen prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant His6-Hsp90 was used to test the interactions between Hsp90 and truncated forms of Cns1. In this experiment, E. coli lysate prepared as described above was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 30 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently bound to E. coli lysates expressing GST fusions of truncated and full-length Cns1 for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was washed with phosphate-buffered saline five times, and bound proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA using 150 mm imidazole as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto Protran® nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Equal amounts of loaded sample and efficient transfer were confirmed by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following antisera were used for immunoblotting: GST (Amersham Biosciences), HA (12CA5, BAbCO, Inc.), FLAG (M2, Kodak), Hsp90 (gift of A.

It was purified by passing over CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which was bound to yeast lysates expressing the amino terminus of Cns1 and, consequently, recognizes the carboxyl terminus. Analytical Centrifugation of Purified Cns1—Cns1 was purified according to the following procedure. 3 liters of logarithmically growing E. coli BL21 cells harboring pJM161 were induced to express the fusion protein with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed as described. Lysates were cleared by filtration on 0.2 μm membrane (Corning). Lysate was bound to the column twice by gravity flow. Products from the overnight cleavage with thrombin (Sigma) were eluted and concentrated using an Ultra-free filter device, M r cutoff limit 30,000 (Millipore). The sample was subjected to gel filtration on a 100-ml Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing Cns1 were collected and concentrated in the same manner as described above. This sample was dialyzed with two 1.5-liter volumes of buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 16 °Cina Beckman Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge. Six samples of purified Cns1 were prepared, resulting in A 230 values of 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0. Approximately 100 μl of each sample was loaded into 1.2-cm path length cells, centrifuged at 14,000 and 20,000 rpm in an An-60 Ti rotor, and allowed to reach equilibrium. Data sets were fitted individually and simultaneously using software packages that employ a non-linear least squares method: WinNonLin 1.050, Sednterp 1.01, and Beckman Optima Xl-A/XL-1 4.2. The partial specific volume was 0.7362 ml/mg, and the viscosity of the buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) was 1.1090 mg/ml. Two models for fitting were used: the first one assumed an ideal solution of a single species, and the second one used monomer-dimer equilibria with a fixed monomer molecular weight of Cns1 of 44,107 (determined from the amino acid sequence). Gel Filtration—200 ml of logarithmically growing cells expressing His6-Hsp82 or His6-Hsp82ΔEEVD were harvested and lysed in the equilibration buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) as described above. Lysates were centrifuged twice in the TL-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min. A Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) was washed in equilibration buffer. 1.5 mg of total protein was resolved on the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected using Biotech Liquid Chromatography Collector LCC-500 (Amersham Biosciences).

To better understand how motor neurons are targeted in Spinal muscular atrophy patients, it is important to study the role of SMN protein in cell death. In this report, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to study the loss-of-function of SMN in Drosophila S2 cells. A 601-base pair double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of Drosophila SMN (dSMN) was used for silencing the dSMN. Our data indicate that dSMN RNAi resulted in more than 90% reduction of both RNA and protein. Further analysis of S2 cells by cell death ELISA and flow cytometry assays revealed that reduction of dSMN expression significantly increased apoptosis. The cell death mediated by SMN depletion is caspase-dependent and specifically due to the activation of the endogenous caspases, DRONC and DRICE. Significantly, the effect of dSMN RNAi was reversed by a peptide caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk. These results suggest that dSMN is involved in signal pathways of apoptotic cell death in Drosophila. Hence, the model system of reduced SMN expression by RNAi in Drosophila could be exploited for identification of therapeutic targets.

SMA is clinically categorized as types I, II, and III based on age of onset and clinical progression. Type I (severe) infants have onset of weakness within the first six months of life and typically die within the first two years. Type II (intermediate) children experience symptoms before age two and never walk unassisted. Type III (mild) patients exhibit less severe clinical symptoms with a highly variable age of onset. It was found that the survival of motor neuron (SMN) gene is the SMA-determining gene and is deleted, converted, or mutated in >95% of SMA patients. There are two human SMN genes, SMN1 and SMN2 (1Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Le Paslier D. Frezal F. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). However, only loss of the SMN1 gene causes the disease. SMN2 is maintained in most of the SMA patients, in many cases with multiple copies. However, 80% of SMN2 products are the alternatively spliced SMNΔ7 that lacks exon 7 and is unstable, whereas the primary product of SMN1 is full-length SMN mRNA. It has been demonstrated that clinical severity of SMA disease is inversely correlated with the number of SMN2 copies in SMA patients (2Vitali T. Sossi V. Tiziano F. Zappata S. Giuli A. Paravatou-Petsotas M. Neri G. Brahe C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that disease progression is inversely dosage-dependent on full-length SMN proteins produced. Mice have only a single copy of the SMN gene that does not undergo alternative splicing of exon 7 and therefore is a functional SMN1 homologue. Homozygous knockout of the mouse SMN gene is embryonic lethal at a very early developmental stage (3Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). By crossing mice transgenic for human SMN2 into a SMN+/– heterozygous mouse, animals with an hSMN2/– genotype were born. These mice did not die in utero, implying SMN2 can rescue the lethality of homozygous knockout. A single copy of human SMN2 was sufficient to restore mouse viability from SMN–/– lethality; however, severe weakness developed and the mice died within few days after birth. Mice with eight copies of hSMN2, on the other hand, appear normal, providing additional evidence that SMN2 functions as a disease modifying gene by producing low levels of full-length SMN, explaining the correlation between disease severity and SMN2 copy numbers (4Monani U.R. Coovert D.D. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2451-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SMN homologues have been also isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (5Miguel-Aliaga I.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the SMN proteins from these species retain a number of properties identified in the human SMN, including RNA binding activity and self-association. Defects of SMN proteins in C. elegans, D. rerio, and S. pombe affect cell viability and growth. Drosophila models have been generated by ectopic over-expression of human SMN protein domains that may function as dominant negatives to disrupt the endogenous dSMN protein, resulting in abnormal positioned wings and legs or in many cases, pupal lethality (10Miguel-Aliaga I. Chan Y.B. Davies K.E. van den Heuvel M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of function of a protein using dominant negative mutants can yield misleading results if the expressed protein has additional functions or if it interacts with its endogenous counterpart (11Hudson D.F. Morrison C. Ruchaud S. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 281-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During the last few years, RNA interference has emerged as a promising and powerful technology to investigate the loss-of-function of a protein by specifically suppressing expression of a gene in a population of cells. Thus, RNAi was used to investigate the mechanisms of SMN-deficiency-induced cell death in a cell culture model, the insect S2 cells. Our results showed that cells with SMN expression suppressed by RNAi underwent apoptosis. Apoptosis occurred via a caspase pathway-dependent process by activation of DRONC, an apical caspase in Drosophila, which further activated its effector caspase, DRICE. Furthermore, Z-VAD-fmk (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone), which is a cell-permeable caspase inhibitor, efficiently blocked cell death induced by SMN deficiency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that investigation of factors that mediate SMN and caspase-dependent apoptosis may provide clues on functions of the SMN protein and targets for identification of small molecules/drugs for SMA therapy. Antibodies—To generate antibodies specific for Drosophila SMN, a plasmid construct containing full-length of dSMN was fused to glutathione-S-transferase in pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-dSMN antibodies (dSMNAb) were raised against the fusion protein in rabbits and affinity purified by the GST or GST-fusion proteins that were covalently linked to glutathione Sepharose-4B resin (12Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the human SMN are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). Anti-HA antibody 12CA5 is from Roche Molecular Diagnostics. The monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody is from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal rabbit anti-DRONC, rabbit anti-DRICE, and monoclonal mouse anti-DIAP1 (Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1) antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Bruce A. Hay (CalTech, Pasadena, CA). Cell Culture and Apoptosis Induction—S2 cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.434 mg/ml of GlutaMax at 27 °C. For apoptotic induction as a positive control, cells were treated with 1 μm actinomycin D for 7 h. For all the analyses, three independent experiments were conducted. Plasmid Constructs—The 0.7-kilobase fragment of dSMN coding region with HA-tag was cloned into KpnI and SalI sites of a Drosophila expression vector, pRmHa-3, containing the metallothionein promoter (13Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) or the pcDNA3 vector. Expression of the HA-dSMN protein in pcDNA3-HA-dSMN transfected mammalian C33A cells or in the pRmHa-3-HA-dSMN transfected S2 cells that were induced by 500 μm copper sulfate for 6–8 h was detected by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody or anti-dSMN antibodies. Similarly, a construct for human SMN was generated in pRmHa-3. Expression of hSMN in S2 cells was detected by immunofluorescence with anti-hSMN antibodies as described below. RNAi in S2 Cells and Z-VAD-fmk Treatment—PCR products containing coding sequences for the dSMN (forward primer: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG AAG ACG TAC GAC GAG TCG-3′; and reverse primer: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG GTG GTG CTG GCT TCT TTC-3′; product length, 601bps; bold and italics letters represent T7 promoter sequences) and control Drosophila Presenilin (dPsn) gene (forward primer: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG TG GCT GCT GTC AAT CTC-3′; and reverse primer: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG CGA TAG CAA CGC TTC TTG-3′; product length: 543bps) were obtained and gel-purified. Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) were generated by in vitro transcription with Ribomax T7 Transcription kit (Promega) and digested with Rnase-free DNase. The dsRNA products were ethanol precipitated and annealed by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min and then slowly allowed to cool at room temperature. The annealed dsRNA products were analyzed on a 1% agaorse gel to ensure the majority of dsRNA existed as a single band. The dsRNA (2 μg) and/or plasmid DNAs (2 μg) were introduced into cells by using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase inhibition was achieved by using 50 μm of Z-VAD-fmk (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) in the culture medium. Semi-quantitative Multiplex RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from cells transfected with dSMN dsRNAs, yeast tRNA, dPsn dsRNAs, or mock-transfected. For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used. To amplify the endogenous dSMN and dPsn transcripts, a multiplex RT-PCR was performed using primers from dSMN and dPsn under the following PCR condition (94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 28 cycles and then 72 °C 10 min extension). The reaction gave rise to two bands (dSMN and dPsn), each of which was used as an internal control for their relative expression levels, and they were quantified on an agarose gel by gel-documentation software (UVP, Upland, CA). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were grown in 100 mm cell culture dishes and transfected with dsRNA of dSMN and controls. After 72 h cells they were harvested and lysed with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin each), and the amount of protein was quantified by BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein from control and dsRNA of dSMN transfected cells were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli's buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and separated on 12% and/or 15% SDS-PAGE, and the resolved gels were blotted on Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The transblots were probed with antibodies against dSMN, anti-DRONC, full-length anti-DRICE, and anti-DIAP1 (15Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) followed by secondary horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. In all cases, blots were stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 2% SDS and 90 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with anti-tubulin for loading controls. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured on glass cover slips coated with poly l-lysine and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and blocked with 3% IgG-free bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for one hour. The cells were incubated with primary anti-SMN (1:100) or anti-HA (1:100) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate and/or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 50) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were applied for one hour. The localization of proteins was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Flow Cytometric Assay for Apoptosis—Cells were co-transfected with dsRNAs and GFP expression plasmid as described above and collected 72 h later for staining with Annexin V for flow cytometric analysis. Untreated and cells treated with 1 μm actinomycin D and cells undergoing necrosis were collected in parallel. All cells were collected by centrifugation (500 × g for 2 min), resuspended in binding buffer to which Annexin V-Cy5 was added according to the manufacturer's instructions (MBL International). The cells were immediately analyzed on a BD-LSR Facstar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Argon and HeNe lasers and the recommended filters. The resulting data was analyzed using Flowjo software (version 4.1.1) (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). Cell Death Detection ELISA Assay for Apoptosis—To quantitate apoptotic cell death using a complementary assay, we performed ELISA assays as described in the manufacturer's manual using a Cell Death Detection kit (Roche). This assay is based on the quantitative sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones. This ELISA provides a quantitative in vitro determination of histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates and determined photometrically at 405 nm. Cell lysates equivalent to 10,000 cells were used for ELISA analysis. Characterization of Drosophila SMN Protein—To investigate expression of Drosophila SMN (dSMN) protein, two antibodies against GST-dSMN protein were raised in rabbits and then affinity-purified. The dSMN gene was sub-cloned into HA-tagged pcDNA3 vector and transfected into mammalian C33A cells. Western blot analysis shows that both dSMN antibodies specifically recognized a single band in C33A cells transiently transfected with the HA epitope-tagged full-length Drosophila SMN cDNA (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 1), but not in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 2). The band was also confirmed as HA-dSMN by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The molecular mass of HA-dSMN is 28 kDa, 10 kDa smaller than that of the human SMN, consistent with the length of their open reading frame sequences. HA-tagged dSMN was also cloned into a Drosophila vector pRmHa-3 and transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. The HA-tagged dSMN protein expression was detected in transfected cell lysates probed with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 2), and the band was undetected in control cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 1). By using anti-dSMN antibodies, higher expression of dSMN was detected in HA-dSMN transfected cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 2) than in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 1) as judged by immunoblot analysis. The antibodies clearly recognized the endogenous dSMN protein in S2 cells as a single band with a molecular mass of 27 kDa, indicating the specificity of both antibodies. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody showing equal amounts of proteins (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels) were loaded. RNAi Suppresses Expression of SMN in S2 Cells—To determine the effect of depletion of dSMN protein in cultured S2 cells, a 601-bp fragment of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the dSMN gene was transfected into the cells. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that transfection of dsRNA of dSMN in cells robustly inhibited (> 90%) its corresponding endogenous target after 72 h. The transcript of another endogenous gene, dPsn, was not affected. Similarly, cells treated with dsRNA of dPsn suppressed > 90% of its transcript, whereas the level of dSMN expression was unaffected (Fig. 2A). Similar results were confirmed in two other RNAi experiments. Silencing of dSMN expression was monitored by immunoblotting the dSMN protein. The amount of the endogenous dSMN protein was reduced to 90% in dSMN RNAi cell lysates (Fig. 2B, lane 2), and the level was unaffected in cells treated with yeast tRNA (control) (Fig. 2B, lane 1). There was no appreciable difference between the amounts of tubulin (loading control) in control and dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we also analyzed the effect of RNAi after 24 and 48 h, and the level of dSMN expression was only slightly suppressed, whereas the level of dPsn expression was reduced to 90% after 24 h (data not shown), suggesting the relative stability of dSMN mRNA. Immunolocalization of SMN in S2 Cells—Because there is no report on expression of Drosophila SMN protein in cells, we sought to determine the localization of dSMN protein in S2 cells. Constructs of both dSMN and hSMN, tagged and/or untagged in the pRmHa-3 vector were generated and co-transfected into cells. After 72 h, protein expression was induced by 500 μm of copper sulfate for 6–8 h. Immunofluorescence assay revealed co-localization of dSMN and hSMN proteins to the nucleus (Fig. 3, F–H). Staining for human SMN was also detected as discrete, punctate sub-nuclear dots in co-transfected cells, reminiscent of “gems” in the nucleus of some of S2 cells (Fig. 3L). With purified anti-dSMN antibodies, we identified the localization of the endogenous Drosophila SMN in cells, and it was diffusely distributed throughout cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). However, enriched localization was detected in the nucleus when dSMN was over expressed (Fig. 3B). Only the endogenous level of the dSMN protein expression was detected in HA-dSMN transfected but non-induced cells (Fig. 3C). The localization could not be seen in cells treated with dsRNA of dSMN (Fig. 3D), indicating specificity of anti-dSMN antibodies. Staining to cytoplasm and nucleus in some cells transfected with both dsRNA and HA-dSMN may be due to incomplete suppression of HA-dSMN over-expression or those cells failed to conceive the dsRNA (Fig. 3E). Deficiency of dSMN in S2 Cells Induces Apoptosis—To investigate how motor neurons die in SMA patients, it is important to understand the mechanisms of cell death induced by SMN deficiency. Accordingly, we used RNAi to suppress SMN expression in S2 cells. Morphological changes were observed in dSMN dsRNA-treated cells after 48 h (Fig. 3, I–K). The cells were stained with Annexin V-Cy5 and analyzed for apoptosis by flow cytometry. As a positive control for induction of apoptosis, cells were treated with a low concentration of actinomycin D (1 μm) (Fig. 4B) that has been previously shown to effectively induce apoptosis (16Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas untreated S2 cells were used as negative controls (Fig. 4A). The percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells indicates an increase in phosphatidyl-serine on the cell surface of cells in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Furthermore, there was an increase in apoptosis (25.8%) in the dSMN dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4D) compared with the baseline percent apoptosis (9.17%) of the cells transfected with the GFP marker and CAT dsRNA (Fig. 4C). This result is representative of three separate experiments. In these three experiments, the mean percent apoptosis in SMN dsRNA/GFP co-transfectants was 18.8 ± 4.0%, whereas the mean percent apoptosis in the control-treated cells was 8.3 ± 0.9%. The association between SMN dsRNA treatment and apoptosis within each of the three experiments was found to have a p value of <0.0001 by the Chi-squared test. As controls (not shown), necrosis was induced in a subpopulation of cells using 10 μm actinomycin D. Loss of membrane integrity of necrotic cells was confirmed by Trypan Blue staining (data not shown). The necrotic cell population was identified by analysis of the flow cytometric parameters forward and side scatter as previously described (17Patel C.A. Mukhtar M. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9717-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Necrotic cells were gated out of the entire analysis. The independent cell death ELISA confirmed increased apoptosis in these cells following treatment of dSMN dsRNA (Fig. 4E). dSMN Deficiency-induced Apoptosis Is Caspase-dependent and Blocked by a Caspase Inhibitor—To test whether the apoptosis resulting from the depletion of SMN in S2 cells is caspase-dependent or -independent, we analyzed by immunoblot to detect the activation of the endogenous caspases using anti-DRONC and anti-DRICE antibodies. It was previously demonstrated (18Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 19Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L.

Richardson H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40416-40424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that these two caspases interacted with each other, and the DRONC was an upstream factor that processes the effector caspase DRICE. Our results clearly indicate that whereas there was no processing of the ∼50 kDa DRONC precursor in the control cell lysates (CAT dsRNA) (Fig. 5A), its cleaved fragments (∼40 kDa (Pr1) and ∼37 kDa (Pr2)) were evident in dSMN RNAi cell lysates (Fig. 5A). The first cleaved product (Pr1) of DRONC may be due to autocatalytic processing, which has been demonstrated earlier (19Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the second cleavage product (Pr2) is the resulting product of apoptosis, which is consistent with results obtained in S2 cells previously (21Muro I.

The disappearance of full-length DRONC correlated very well with the increasing activation of caspase due to dSMN RNAi. Because DRONC interacts with DRICE, we also examined processing of DRICE using anti-DRICE antibody. Similar to what has been found for DRONC, our immunoblot results indicate that there was no processing of DRICE in control (CAT dsRNA) transfected cells, but accumulation of its processed (cleaved) products (∼28, ∼26, and ∼19 kDa) were detected in cell lysates of RNAi (Fig. 5B), and these analyses suggest that they are enzymatically activated in dSMN RNAi cell lysates. Furthermore, Z-VAD-fmk treatment reversed the effect of dSMN RNAi as indicated by ELISA and flow cytometric assays (Fig. 6, A–D). The percent of apoptosis in the control dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 6C) was 11%, whereas in the dSMN dsRNA-treated cells, percent apoptosis was 19% (Fig. 6B). This result is consistent with the increased apoptosis observed with the dSMN dsRNA (Fig. 4). In three similar experiments, the mean percent apoptosis in SMNdsRNA/GFP co-transfectants was 21.5 ± 6.5%, whereas the mean percent apoptosis in the Z-VAD-fmk-treated was 18.7 ± 5.4%. Thus, there was little effect of Z-VAD-fmk on Annexin V binding to apoptotic S2 cells. In the Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells, the percentage of transfected cells surviving increased from 26 to 63% (Fig. 6D), a percentage similar to that of control transfected cells (Fig. 6C). This demonstrates an appreciable effect of the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk upon the survival of S2 cells treated with dsRNA of dSMN. Further, cell lysates were extracted from control, dSMN RNAi, and dSMN RNAi with Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells and were immunoblotted for DRONC and DRICE protein. The results confirm that there was no accumulation of processed DRONC and DRICE products in lysates prepared from Z-VAD-fmk co-treated cells (Fig. 7). However, the endogenous expression of DIAP1, a known cellular caspase inhibitor, which belongs to the family of IAPs (22Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) was unaffected by dSMN RNAi (Fig. 5C), and this suggests that cell death may be independent of DIAP1 pathway.Fig. 7Z-VAD-fmk reverses the effect of dSMN RNAi.

Several proteins are involved in this process including Cox17p, Sco1p, and Cox11p. Cox17p, an 8-kDa protein, is the only molecule thought to be involved in shuttling copper from the cytoplasm into mitochondria. Given the small size of Cox17p, we have taken a random and site-directed mutagenesis approach to studying structure-function relationships in Cox17p. Mutations have been generated in 70% of the Cox17p amino acid residues, with only a small subset leading to a detectable respiration-deficient phenotype. We have characterized the respiration-deficient cox17 mutants and found in addition to the expected cytochrome oxidase deficiency, a specific lack of Cox2p and the presence of a misassembled cytochrome oxidase in a subset of mutants. These results suggest that Cox17p is involved upstream of Sco1p in delivering copper specifically to subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase and predict the existence of a subunit 1-specific copper chaperone.

Thus far, of the ∼30 proteins known to function in the COX assembly pathway, three have been implicated solely in the provision of copper to COX, namely Cox17p, Sco1p, and Cox11p.

Studies in Rhodobacter sphaeroides first suggested a role for Cox11p in assembly of the CuB and magnesium centers of cytochrome oxidase (11Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Yeast Cox11p was recently shown to bind copper and is thus thought to be involved in the provision of copper to the CuB site in subunit 1 of yeast COX (12Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas both Sco1p and Cox11p are integral components of the mitochondrial inner membrane, Cox17p is a soluble copper chaperone with several unique features that warrant further investigation. Cox17p contains no known mitochondrial targeting signals, and its mitochondrial import mechanism has not been delineated. It is currently unclear whether Cox17p enters mitochondria with bound copper. The presence of bound copper would predict that Cox17p retains some degree of secondary structure, contrary to our current understanding of mitochondrial import mechanisms in which proteins are unfolded before import. Although there are a few examples of proteins found in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion (e.g. adenylate kinase (13Schricker R. Angermayr M. Strobel G. Klinke S. Korber D. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28757-28764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), Cox17p is the only molecule that acts as a putative shuttle between the two subcellular compartments. To date, there is very little structural information for Cox17p and the crystal structure for this protein has not yet been solved. Here we report the analysis of a series of cox17 mutants, only some of which show impairment in their ability to complete COX assembly. A subset of these mutants also demonstrates a specific loss of subunit 2 suggesting that Cox17p, acting upstream of Sco1p, provides copper exclusively to the CuA site. Our results therefore predict the existence of a second mitochondrial copper chaperone. Strains—All mutants were studied in the background of either the “a” or “α” mating type of the yeast cox17 null mutant, W303ΔCOX17 (ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 cox17::TRP1) (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Media for growth of yeast have been described previously (14Myers A.M. Crivellone M.D. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3388-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Mutants—cox17 mutants were created by either site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-based random mutagenesis, using pG74/ST8 as a template (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This construct contains the COX17 gene on a 750-bp HindIII fragment in YEp352. Site-directed mutants were generated by PCR with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers specific for the mutation. The mutagenesis was carried out using 10 ng of template DNA and a PCR program of 30 s at 95 °C, followed by 12 or 16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 14 min at 68 °C. The amplified plasmid was digested with DpnI and transformed into DH5α cells. Clones were sequenced using the LongReadIR automated sequencing system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) to verify the presence of the mutation. Random mutants were obtained by a PCR-based amplification method (15Xu H. Petersen E.I. Petersen S.B. el-Gewely M.R. BioTechniques. 27. 1999: 1102-1104Google Scholar) using 120 μm manganese and 120 μm dITP. The COX17 fragment was digested with SphI and HindIII and transferred into YEp352 (16Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) for sequencing. Upon identification of a single coding region mutation, fragments were subcloned into YCplac33 (17Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) for subsequent transformation. Miscellaneous Methods—Yeast were transformed according to the method of Schiestl and Gietz (18Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), and prototrophic selection of transformants was followed by replica plating onto YEPG (rich ethanol/glycerol medium) to score for respiratory growth. Purification and segregation analyses were carried out to ensure the co-segregation of the uracil prototrophy and the respiratory growth phenotype. Wild-type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal (rich galactose medium) and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations, cytochrome oxidase activity, and mitochondrial cytochrome spectra were all measured using standard methods (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, 15% gels with glycerol, or 16.5% gels containing 6 m urea. Immunoblotting analysis was carried out as described previously using antibodies against subunits of cytochrome oxidase or Cox17p (9Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The band densities on the Western blot with the mitochondrially encoded COX subunits were quantitated using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nihimage/Default.html). Cox17p Is Surprisingly Resistant to Mutation—Genes encoding Cox17 proteins have been identified in virtually all eukaryotes investigated to date. The only other eukaryotic proteins displaying any homology to the Cox17 proteins are the mammalian metallothioneins (19Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although it is clear that these proteins function quite differently. Metallothionein binds 12 mol of copper/mol of protein (20Dameron C.T. Harrison M.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1091S-1097SCrossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) compared with two or three for Cox17p (4Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to Cox17p, which binds copper very loosely (4Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), metallothionein exhibits tight binding of this metal. Whereas the structure of metallothionein has been studied extensively (20Dameron C.T. Harrison M.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1091S-1097SCrossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), very little structural information is available for Cox17p. To gain an understanding of how Cox17p may function as a copper chaperone we have taken advantage of its small size and carried out a combination of PCR-based random and site-directed mutagenesis of the COX17 gene. Each cox17 mutant was identified through automated sequencing, subcloned into a CEN plasmid, and transformed into a cox17 null mutant. All transformants were tested to ensure co-segregation of the uracil prototrophy and the respiratory phenotype. We assessed the effect of each mutation on the ability of Cox17p to restore respiratory competence to the null mutant. We introduced mutations at more than two-thirds of the Cox17p amino acid residues, accounting for three-quarters of the conserved residues. Surprisingly, only about one-sixth of the mutants showed a respiration-deficient phenotype (Fig. 1). Even among the mutations at conserved residues only 40% had an adverse effect on Cox17p function. As shown in Table I, mutations at Cys-24, -26, -47, and -57 completely ablated respiratory function, whereas the C36S mutant grew at about half the wild-type rate. Because mutations at the Cys residues at positions 23, 24, and 26 have already been extensively studied (5Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), they were not characterized further in this study. In contrast to an earlier report in which a C47S mutant was shown to be respiratory-competent (5Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), our C47R mutant was completely respiration-deficient. A mutation at the only Cys residue that is not conserved between yeast and humans, Cys-16, was dispensable for respiratory function. We also found that a variety of different mutations at Arg-33 and Asp-34 had adverse effects on Cox17p function. Although the introduction of uncharged residues at these positions retarded respiratory growth, the juxtaposition of two identical charges at these two residues, which are normally opposite in charge, resulted in a complete loss of respiratory growth. We also identified a mutant encoding a Cox17p truncated at residue 40, which was unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources (Table I). However, when this mutant was expressed from a high copy plasmid, the strain exhibited growth at a rate about one-third that of the wild type (data not shown).Table IGrowth phenotype of respiration-deficient cox17 mutantsMutationaMutant strains are designated by the Cox17p amino acid substitution they express.GrowthbGrowth refers to growth rate of the mutant strain on ethanol/glycerol when compared with that of the wild-type strain.MutationGrowthC24R0D34V1/4V25D1/2D34R0C26R0C36S1/2R33D0G41*0R33A1/2C47R0D34A1/2C57Y0a Mutant strains are designated by the Cox17p amino acid substitution they express.b Growth refers to growth rate of the mutant strain on ethanol/glycerol when compared with that of the wild-type strain. Open table in a new tab In general, the rate of growth of a strain on a non-fermentable carbon source is a reflection of the activity of cytochrome oxidase. To determine whether the growth rates of the cox17 mutant strains on ethanol/glycerol correlated with catalytic function, we isolated mitochondria from these strains and measured their COX activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the residual COX activities (expressed as a percentage of wild type) displayed by the mutant strains were comparable with their respiratory growth rates. Those strains that were unable to grow on ethanol/glycerol displayed COX activities similar to that seen with the cox17 null mutant. Some cox17 Mutants Have a Misassembled COX—Most COX assembly mutants studied to date have shown a correlation between their respiratory phenotypes, their residual COX activity, and the amount of assembled holoenzyme. The amount of assembled COX is indicated by the size of the characteristic cytochrome aa 3 peak at 603 nm as revealed by spectral analysis of mitochondrial cytochromes (21Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many COX assembly mutants are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, have no COX activity, and no discernible spectral signal at 603 nm. Thus far, the only exception to this generality is a S240F sco1 mutant we reported recently (9Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which showed a cytochrome aa 3 peak that was shifted to the blue by about 5 nm, indicative of a misassembled enzyme. To assess the COX assembly status of our cox17 mutants we analyzed their mitochondrial cytochrome spectra. The mutants fell into three distinct categories. One set, as exemplified by the D34V mutant shown in Fig. 3, had spectral signals that were comparable with their respiratory growth rate and their residual COX activity. The spectral signal in these mutants did not appear to be shifted when compared with the peak seen with W303, the wild-type strain. Two mutants, R33D and G41*, had no residual COX activity and no discernible peak at 603 nm and were thus identical to the cox17 null mutant (not shown). The third and most interesting group of mutants displayed a cytochrome aa 3 peak despite having no detectable COX activity and being unable to respire. In each case, as shown for the C47R mutant (Fig. 3), the peak was shifted by about 2 nm to the blue, indicating an abnormal environment for the hemes and thus suggesting the presence of a misassembled COX holoenzyme. cox17 Mutants Display a Selective Loss of Subunit 2—Through the study of many different COX mutants, assembly is thought to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon in yeast. One of the characteristics of this phenotype is the nearly complete loss of steady state levels of the mitochondrially encoded COX subunits (22Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In almost all cases, the nuclear-encoded subunits are found at or near wild-type levels. The S240F sco1 mutant is an exception, having a shifted COX spectral signal combined with a specific loss of subunit 2 (9Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, subunit 1 levels in the S240F sco1 mutant are at or near wild-type levels. To determine the status of the mitochondrially encoded COX subunits in the cox17 mutants, we subjected mitochondrial extracts to Western blot analysis. The cox17 null mutant displays an almost complete loss of subunits 1, 2, and 3 when compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 4). For mutants such as D34V, which exhibited about one-quarter of the wild-type levels of COX activity, the Cox2p level was reduced by 40% compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 4) along with nearly normal levels of subunit 1 (73% of the wild-type level). However, for those mutants that were completely unable to respire, there were decreased but still readily detectable levels of Cox1p, which bears the CuB site. Quantitation of Cox1p band densities for C47R, R33D, and D34R revealed 18, 13, and 49% residual protein, respectively, compared with that seen in wild-type mitochondria. In contrast, there was virtually no detectable Cox2p (Fig. 4), comparable with what is observed with the cox17 null mutant and the S240F sco1 mutant. We also assessed the level of Cox3p, which does not bear any copper atoms, and found that the levels of this subunit were somewhat decreased in the non-respiring mutants (20–47% of wild type) but higher than that seen with the cox17 null mutant. This reduction in the steady state level of Cox3p was also observed for the S240F sco1 mutant (data not shown). None of the mutations were found to have any effect on the nuclear-encoded COX subunits, consistent with previous studies of the cox17 null mutant. Some cox17 Mutants Are Impaired in Their Mitochondrial Uptake—The distribution of Cox17p in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial intermembranous space is consistent with its role as a metal chaperone that shuttles copper to the mitochondrial inner membrane (4Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because a subset of the cox17 mutants displayed no COX activity yet were able to partially assemble the enzyme, we evaluated the steady state levels and distribution of the Cox17 proteins in these strains. Under wild-type conditions, about 60% of Cox17p is associated with mitochondria (4Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When both mitochondrial and postmitochondrial supernatant fractions from the mutants are analyzed by Western blotting with a Cox17p-specific antibody virtually all strains, with the exception of the V25D mutant, reveal decreased steady state levels of Cox17p in both fractions when compared with the wild-type strain W303 (Fig. 5). This reduction in steady state Cox17p levels also appears to be comparable with the levels of assembled COX in the strains that retain some ability to respire (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Interestingly, the C47R mutant lacks any detectable Cox17p signal in mitochondria although the protein is present in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that the Cox17p in this mutant has a reduced ability to enter the mitochondrial intermembranous space. Likewise, as seen in Fig. 5, mutants R33D and D34R display a strongly decreased signal in the mitochondrial fraction and a stronger than expected signal in the cytosolic fraction, again suggestive of difficulties with mitochondrial uptake. It is also interesting to note that the majority of mutants appear to accumulate a lower molecular weight band that may be a Cox17p degradation product (marked with a question mark in Fig. 5). This polypeptide is clearly recognized by the Cox17p antibody, which is directed to the C terminus of the protein and is particularly abundant in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction. We have found that Cox17p is surprisingly resistant to mutation, probably reflecting an intrinsic physical property of this protein. An analysis of its amino acid sequence strongly suggests that Cox17p may fall into the class of natively unfolded proteins. A relative lack of hydrophobic amino acids, along with a large number of charged residues that result in extreme pI values, is a hallmark of “natively unfolded” proteins (23Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). When compared with globular proteins, natively unfolded proteins contain lower amounts of the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp as well as lower amounts of Cys, Ile, Leu, Val, and Asn, which contribute order to a protein. Natively unfolded proteins are also enriched in Gly, Ala, Glu, Gln, Ser, and Pro, and the basic amino acids Lys and Arg, which promote disorder. When compared with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome (24Denning D.P. Uversky V. Patel S.S. Fink A.L. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33447-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) Cox17p has a relative enrichment in disordering residues (56.5 versus 46%) and a relative depletion of ordering residues (29 versus 38.1%). These levels are similar to those seen with the nucleoporin Nup2p, which exhibits characteristics of a natively unfolded protein (24Denning D.P. Uversky V. Patel S.S. Fink A.L. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33447-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nup2p is involved in nuclear trafficking and shuttles between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (24Denning D.P. Uversky V. Patel S.S. Fink A.L. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33447-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a situation that may be analogous to the proposed shuttling of Cox17p between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial intermembranous space. Confirmation of the exact nature of Cox17p structure requires further biophysical characterization, but a more flexible secondary structure may explain the ability of Cox17p to retain its function in the presence of non-conservative amino acid substitutions. A number of the mutants we have studied here exhibit different phenotypes from those reported in an earlier study (5Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In particular, a mutation at Cys-47 did not result in a respiration deficiency when mutated to Ser, whereas the C47R mutant in our study was completely unable to grow on ethanol/glycerol. It seems likely that the nature of residue 47 is critical for Cox17p and that the charge and bulkiness of the Arg substitution interfere with its function. The study of the cox17 mutants has also highlighted the importance of the Arg-33 and Asp-34 residues, which along with most of the Cys residues, appear to be the only conserved residues affected by non-conservative replacements. We have created a variety of substitutions at these positions and found that only the introduction of an oppositely charged residue results in a complete respiration deficiency. These results suggest that the juxtaposition of two opposite charges at this location is critical for Cox17p function. The cox17 mutants described here fall into three groups. Some of the mutants have a decreased ability to respire, retaining detectable levels of Cox2p and a cytochrome aa 3 peak, both of which correlate with their residual COX activity and respiratory growth. Another set of mutants has no COX activity and no spectral peak in the 600 nm region. The rest of the mutants, which are all completely respiration-deficient, are more informative and show the same extensive loss of subunit 2 as a strain completely lacking Cox17p. However, there are two important differences between the cox17 null mutant and point mutants such as C47R. Although the null mutant has no detectable spectral peak at 603 nm, these mutants all have a detectable peak in the 600 nm region, indicative of a small amount of misassembled enzyme. All of these mutants also show some retention of subunit 1 (approximately one-sixth or more of wild-type levels) when compared with the null mutant. This phenotype is similar to that of the S240F sco1 mutant (9Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and suggests that Cox17p, like Sco1p, may be delivering copper solely to the CuA site. From our study of the S240F sco1 mutant, we proposed that the specific loss of subunit 2 occurs because the CuA site remains unoccupied, although experimental evidence for the presence of copper at the CuB site on subunit 1 has not yet been obtained. The phenotype for the cox17 mutants may not be as distinct as that seen with the sco1 mutant because Cox17p functions further upstream in COX assembly than Sco1p, providing more opportunity for degradation by mitochondrial proteases (25Rep M. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the presence of mutant Cox17p even at extremely low levels (see below) may be enough to stabilize intermediates in the assembly pathway and prevent the complete degradation of subunits 1 and 3. A model for the COX assembly pathway in mammals has proposed that subunits 2 and 3 are brought into the assembling enzyme at the same time (26Nijtmans L.G. Taanman J.W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which may explain some loss of Cox3p when Cox2p is degraded. Because this is the first report regarding the status of Cox3p in COX assembly point mutants, a wider screen of other COX assembly mutants may provide an explanation for the loss of subunit 3. The model for COX assembly also proposes that assembly of subunit 1 is an early event that requires the action of Cox11p (12Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) for addition of copper to the CuB site. As seen with both the S240F sco1 and cox17 mutants, the specific loss of subunit 2 suggests that copper addition to the CuA site occurs late in assembly. This provides a temporal separation in the requirements for Cox11p and for Sco1p/Cox17p at the two distinct copper sites. Because Cox17p appears to play a role in copper delivery specifically to Cox2p, it suggests that there is another copper chaperone that provides copper for subunit 1. Cox19p is a recently identified COX assembly factor with a weak homology to Cox17p characterized by a conservation of the spatial distribution of the Cys residues (27Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As Cox17p and Cox19p share a similar subcellular distribution, Cox19p may be a candidate for such a copper chaperone. In addition to suggesting that Cox17p may serve as a copper chaperone specific for subunit 2, the mutants presented here may help to shed light on the pathway for mitochondrial uptake of Cox17p. Most of our mutants exhibit decreased steady state levels of Cox17p but still have a small pool of detectable Cox17p in mitochondria. Only two mutants, C47R and C57Y, appear to lack mitochondrially localized Cox17p. However, on very long exposures of Western blots there is detectable Cox17p in the mitochondria from the C57Y strain (data not shown). Because there is a detectable cytochrome aa 3 spectral peak in the C47R mutant along with detectable levels of subunit 1, we believe that there is a small but undetectable amount of mutant Cox17p present in the mitochondria. Previous experiments had shown that a Cox17 fusion protein that appeared to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm was able to completely rescue the respiration deficiency of the cox17 null mutant (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), suggesting that even undetectable amounts of Cox17p are adequate for complete COX assembly. In addition, our finding that a mutant lacking the C-terminal one-third of Cox17p (G41*) can still confer some degree of respiratory competence when present at high copy number suggests that the C terminus may not be essential for mitochondrial uptake of Cox17p. Cox17p appears to be a unique molecule, given its lack of homology with any other known yeast protein. In this study, we have identified several amino acid residues that appear to be important for the structure and function of Cox17p. Further biochemical and biophysical characterization of both wild-type and mutant proteins should facilitate the elucidation of Cox17p structure. In addition, further analysis of the cox17 mutants described here may help define the features of Cox17p that contribute to its function as a copper chaperone including the properties that are involved in mitochondrial localization. As mentioned previously, Cox17p does not have any recognizable mitochondrial targeting sequences. Yeast genetic screens, using the mutants that exhibit an altered distribution of Cox17p, may allow identification of factors involved in mitochondrial uptake of Cox17p, the mechanism of which remains completely unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2065773774,"The primary function of telomerase is to maintain preexisting telomere tracts. In the ciliate Euplotes crassus, however, telomerase RNP structure and substrate recognition are altered during macronuclear development to facilitate de novo telomere addition. We found that E. crassus harbors three TERT genes encoding the telomerase catalytic subunit that not only vary in their nucleotide and predicted protein sequences, but also in their expression profiles. Expression of EcTERT-1 and -3 correlates with the requirement for telomere maintenance, while that of EcTERT-2 correlates with de novo telomere synthesis. All three genes appear to require ribosomal frameshifting for expression of catalytically active protein. The transcriptionally active form of EcTERT-2 exists only transiently in mated cells and is absent from the vegetative macronucleus. Thus, telomerase expression in Euplotes is controlled by unique regulatory mechanisms that culminate in a developmental switch to a different catalytic subunit with properties suited to de novo telomere addition."
https://openalex.org/W2022039464,"Death receptor CD95 gene expression is frequently low in human breast tumors and is up-regulated by genotoxic treatments in a p53-dependent manner. We have evaluated the relative contribution of promoter and intronic p53 consensus sites to the regulation of the human CD95 gene in breast tumor cells following doxorubicin treatment. Deletion constructs of the promoter region and site-directed mutagenesis of p53 consensus sites in a fragment spanning 1448 bp of the 5′-promoter demonstrate that these sites are not involved in the observed up-regulation of the CD95 gene upon doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, a p53 consensus site located within the first intron of CD95 gene is absolutely required for the inducible expression of CD95 upon genotoxic treatment in breast tumor cells. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of the two most common p53 mutants found in human breast tumors that are associated with resistance to doxorubicin reveals that these mutations completely eliminate the ability of p53 protein to transactivate CD95 gene expression. On the other hand, Bcl-2 overexpression albeit preventing doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, has no effect on p53-mediated CD95 up-regulation in breast tumor cells. Altogether, these results indicate the lack of involvement of p53 consensus sites of the CD95 promoter region and the pivotal role of intronic p53-responsive element in the regulation of human CD95 gene expression in breast tumor cells.

Therefore, treatments that either induce the expression of CD95 or sensitize tumor cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis could be of therapeutic importance. Genotoxic drugs as well as radiation therapy have been widely used to induce apoptosis in breast tumor cells (12McCloskey D.E. Armstrong D.K. Jackisch C. Davidson N.E. Recent. Prog. Horm.

We and others have reported recently that different antitumor agents, such as DNA-damaging drugs, ionizing radiation, and interferon-γ, up-regulate the expression of CD95, and other pro-apoptotic proteins in breast cancer cells, thereby sensitizing these tumor cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis (10Keane M.M.

Although several activities have been reported for p53, its tumor suppressor function is mainly due to its ability to block cell cycle progression and to induce apoptosis in response to different genotoxic stresses. Transcriptional activation by p53 contributes to both functions, growth arrest and apoptosis, even though some transcriptionally independent activities of p53 has also been implicated, particularly in the apoptotic response (19Agarwal M.L.

The p53 gene is one of the most often mutated in human tumors and the majority of these mutations are missense in one allele, producing full-length mutant inactive proteins with increased stability, while the other allele is often lost (20Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar, 22Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N.

Major mutational “hot-spots” occur in four of five domains that are highly conserved in evolution and contain amino acids essential for p53 function. Therefore, these mutations usually create proteins that fail to bind to p53-specific DNA responsive sites and activate transcription (24Raycroft L. Schmidt J.R. Yoas K. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and p53 seem to mutually modulate each other since p53 down-regulates the expression of Bcl-2 (27Borresen A.-L.

However, despite the importance of p53 mutations and deregulation of Bcl-2 expression in breast tumor development, the impact of these changes on CD95 expression has not been evaluated. A consensus binding site for p53 (34el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar) located in the first intron of the CD95 gene has been involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene by p53 (18Müller M.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that other p53 consensus elements of the CD95 promoter region may collaborate with the intronic element in the regulation of CD95 expression (18Müller M. Strand S.

However, direct evidence supporting this proposition is still lacking. In this study, we analyzed the p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of the CD95 gene in human breast tumor cells. We have searched for p53 responsive elements in the upstream regulatory region (URR) of the CD95 gene that cooperate with the p53 intronic site in the transcriptional activation of this gene upon genotoxic stress. For this purpose we have generated constructs harboring different fragments of the URR of the CD95 gene fused to the p53 enhancer of the first intron. Despite the presence of several p53 consensus sequences, we have found no functional p53 responsive elements within a 1448 bp region of the URR of the CD95 gene. A minimal region of this promoter was sufficient to achieve proper transactivation of CD95 by the intronic element. EMSA and ChIP studies further demonstrated the importance of the intronic site. In addition, we analyzed the capacity of the two most common p53 missense mutants found in breast tumors to transactivate the CD95 gene, and investigated the effect of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein on p53-mediated up-regulation of CD95 in breast tumor cells. Cell Cultures and Treatments—The human breast tumor cell line MCF-7, expressing wild type p53, and the p53-null human lung carcinoma-derived cell line H1299 were kindly provided by Dr. M. Ruiz de Almodovar (University of Granada, Granada, Spain) and Dr. J. A. Pintor-Toro (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Sevilla, Spain), respectively. Cells were maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm l-glutamine, and gentamycin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator. MCF-7 cells stably expressing the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein were generated as described previously (14Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A.

Plasmids—Several putative p53 responsive elements are found within the promoter and first intron of the human CD95 gene. The nucleotide sequences and position relative to the ATG start codon of these sites are: p53RE1 (AGACAAGCCT.... ctACAAGaCT, –1329/–1302), p53RE2 (GcGCAAGagT.AcACAgGTgT, –220/–200) and p53RE3 (AGGCcAGCCCtGGCTgcCCa, –110/–91) in the promoter region, and p53iRE (GGACAAGCCCtGACAAGCCa, +433/+452) in the first intron of the CD95 gene. Variant nucleotides compared with the perfect p53 consensus sequence are shown in lowercase letters. A 1448-bp fragment upstream from the ATG start codon of the CD95 gene (numbering according to Ref. 37Rudert F. Visser E. Forbes L. Lindridge E. Wang Y. Watson J. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was generated by PCR amplification with KlenTaq-LA polymerase Mix (Clontech laboratories, CA) and using the following primers: sense 5′-GGGGGATCCATACCATCCTCCTTAT-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGAGATCTGGTTGTTGAGCAATCCTCCGAA-3′. Genomic DNA obtained from Jurkat cells, was used as template. The fragment was purified and subcloned into the BglII site of the promoterless pXP2 luciferase reporter plasmid to generate the pCD95 1448Luc construct. Similarly, the pCD95 391Luc and pCD95 170Luc plasmids were generated by cloning into pXP2 the corresponding fragments amplified with the primers: sense 5′-GGGGGATCCGTGCAACGAACCCTGACTC-3′ and sense 5′-GGGGGATCCCGGTTTACGAGTGACTTGGCTGGA-3′, respectively, together with the antisense primer described above. Constructs pI-CD95 1448Luc, pI-CD95 391Luc and pI-CD95 170Luc were generated by subcloning a 500-bp region from the first intron of the CD95 gene into the BamHI site of the pXP2 polylinker, upstream from the promoter region of the previously described plasmids, pCD95 1448Luc, pCD95 391Luc and pCD95 170Luc, respectively. The 500-bp intronic fragment was also amplified by PCR from Jurkat genomic DNA using the primers: sense 5′-CGGGATCCGTGAGCCCTCTCCTGCCCGGGTG-3′, and antisense 5′-CGGGATCCCTGAAGGCTGCAGGCTCTCTCC-3′. The pC53-SN3 (wt p53) and pC53-SCX3 (143Ala mutant p53) plasmids were generously provided by Dr. M. Oren. The pRL-CMV plasmid was from Promega (Madison, WI). Mutant versions of the luciferase reporter plasmids and the p53 expression vector were prepared by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and two oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector (template) and containing the desired mutation. To generate the mutants of pI-CD95 391Luc with substitutions within either the described intronic p53-binding element (18Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-M. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) (pmI-CD95 391Luc) or the putative promoter p53-responsive elements RE2 and RE3 (pI-CD95 m391Luc), the following primers were used, together with their respective complementary antisense oligonucleotides: 5′-AACTCCTGGAGGGGCCCTGACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGACAATAAAAGCCAAAGGT-3′ for mutation of intronic p53-RE; 5′-CTGATCTCGCGGGGGAGTGACACACA-3′ and 5′-AGTGACACAAGGTTGTTCAAAGACG-3′ for mutation of p53-RE2; 5′-ACACCCTGAGGGGGGCCCTGGCTGCC-3′ for mutation of p53-RE3. The p53 mutant versions were prepared by using the following primers and their respective complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-CGGCATGAACTGGAGGCCCATCCTC-3′ for mp53–248Trp and 5′-GCTTTGAGGTGCATGTTTGTGCCTG-3′ for mp53–273His. Mutated nucleotides are underlined in the primers described above. The final products of all reactions were sequenced to confirm the introduction of the expected mutations. Cell Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells were plated at a density of either 2 × 105 (MCF-7 cells) or 105 (H1299 cells) per 35-mm tissue culture dish the day before transfection with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids described above and 1 ng of the Renilla expression plasmid pRL-CMV as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Where indicated, the p53 expression plasmids or the pCMVneo vector were also co-transfected in a ratio of 1:1 (MCF-7 cells) or 1:5 (H1299 cells) versus the luciferase reporter plasmid. For luciferase assays, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS and lysed before determining luciferase activity according to the manufacturer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) in a FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Germany). All transfection experiments were carried out in duplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For nuclear protein extractions, MCF-7 growing in 100-mm plates were treated with 500 ng/ml doxorubicin. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES pH7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0,75 mm spermidine, and 0.15 mm spermine), containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were then centrifuged and incubated with buffer C (20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, and 2 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 30 min in a rocking platform. Nuclei were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were immediately stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford procedure. EMSA was performed as described (38Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. J.

Nuclear proteins (3 μg) were incubated with 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier and 4 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (DBD) (10% polyvinylethanol, 12,5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 20 μl on ice for 10 min. Then, 2 μl (1 ng/μl) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (40 × 106 cpm/μg) was added to the reaction mixture, and it was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Where indicated, 3 μl of the anti-p53 antiserum pAb421, or 3 μl of conditioned medium from X63 myeloma cell line as control antibody, were added to the cellular extract before addition of the probe. The sequence of the oligonucleotide probe (5′-gatcCTCCTGGACAAGCCCTGACAAGCCAAGCCA-3′) has been described previously (38Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Rivas A.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed as previously described (40Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 2C. Gallego, personal communication. Briefly, MCF-7 cells (107) were incubated in 1% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min, and monolayers were washed twice with PBS. Cells were scraped off following addition of 0.05% trypsin solution in PBS, washed once with PBS plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) plus a protease inhibitor mixture, for 20 min on ice. Cell lysates were then sonicated to yield chromatin fragments of 500–1000 bp. After centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 × g, supernatants were collected and diluted 1:10 in IP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS) plus protease inhibitor mixture and precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 4 h with rocking at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed by rocking overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody anti-p53 (Pab421, Oncogene Research Products). Antibody/protein/DNA complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads, previously blocked with 1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C, by rocking for 5 h at 4 °C and then washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, twice with IP wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and once with TE buffer. Precipitates were extracted twice with 50 μl of lysis buffer for 10 min at room temperature after which elutions were pooled, diluted 1:10 in IP dilution buffer, and immunoprecipitated as above. Precipitates were then extracted twice with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) by shaking on vortex for 20 min. Both elutions were combined, and 0.3 m NaCl and 10 μg of RNase A were added, and incubated overnight at 67 °C to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking. Samples were then treated with proteinase K for 1–2 h at 45 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated at –20 °C overnight with ethanol in the presence of glycogen and tRNA as carriers, and finally resuspended in 30 μl of water. For PCR amplification, 3-μl samples were used as template and 35 PCR cycles, each consisting of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, were performed by using the following primers: sense 5′-AACGCTGGAGGACTTGCTTT-3′and antisense 5′-CACCCGCGCCGGAGCGGACCTTTG-3′, which encompass the p53 responsive element within the first intron of the human CD95 gene. Northern Blot—Total RNA (20 μg) was run on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized to a DNA probe for CD95 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), using a random primer labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The 0.7 kb XhoI-BamHI DNA fragment of the pBLF58-1 plasmid (41Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S.I. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) was used as probe. Immunoblot Detection of Proteins—Following detachment with RPMI/EDTA, MCF-7 cells (5 × 105) were washed with PBS and lysed in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. Cell samples were sonicated, and proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and detected as described previously (14Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with mouse anti-human Bcl-2 mAb (DAKO, Denmark), anti-p53 sheep polyclonal IgG Ab (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) and rabbit anti-CD95 polyclonal Ab (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Determination of Apoptotic Cells—Phosphatydilserine (PS) exposure on the surface of apoptotic cells was detected by flow cytometry after staining with Anexin-V-FLUOS (Roche Applied Science). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan cytometer using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Characterization of Genotoxic Stress-induced p53-mediated Up-regulation of CD95 Gene Expression in Human Breast Tumor Cells—Induction of a p53 response upon DNA damage leads to the up-regulation of several apoptotic proteins (29Miyashita T.

Among these, death receptor CD95 (Fas/APO-1) has been shown to be elevated in a number of tumor cells following genotoxic insults (15Sheard M.A. Vojtesek B. Janakova L. Kovarik J. Zaloudik J. Int. J.

In breast tumor cells, we recently reported that different DNA damaging treatments up-regulated the expression of CD95 protein in a p53-dependent manner (14Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, we show that p53-dependent up-regulation of CD95 is also observed at the mRNA level in breast tumor MCF-7 cells. Treatment of these cells with the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin up-regulated CD95 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). However, doxorubicin-induced CD95 expression was completely abrogated in MCF-7 cells expressing the human papillomavirus E6 protein (14Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), that drives p53 to the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway. It has been suggested that p53 consensus sites in the region 5′ upstream of the ATG start codon may cooperate with a p53 intronic element in the regulation of CD95 expression in hepatoma cells (18Müller M.

In addition, NIPP1 is an interactor of protein phosphatase-1 and a COOH-terminal NIPP1 fragment displays an RNase E like endoribonuclease activity. A yeast two-hybrid screening resulted in the identification of the Polycomb group protein EED (embryonic ectoderm development), an established transcriptional repressor, as a novel NIPP1 interactor. NIPP1 only interacted with full-length EED, whereas two EED interaction domains were mapped to the central and COOH-terminal thirds of NIPP1. The NIPP1-EED interaction was potentiated by the binding of (d)G-rich nucleic acids to the central domain of NIPP1. Nucleic acids also decreased the potency of NIPP1 as an inhibitor of PP1, but they did not prevent the formation of a ternary NIPP1·EED·PP1 complex. EED had no effect on the function of NIPP1 as a splicing factor or as an endoribonuclease. However, similar to EED, NIPP1 acted as a transcriptional repressor of targeted genes and this NIPP1 effect was mediated by the EED interaction domain.

NIPP1 contains binding sites for PP1 in its central and COOH-terminal domains (2Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

More recently, we demonstrated that NIPP1 is required for a late step in the assembly of spliceosomes (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which are the complexes of small nuclear RNAs and proteins that catalyze pre-mRNA splicing. The splicing function of NIPP1 depends on the NH2-terminal third (residues 1–142) of NIPP1, which largely consists of a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and on residues 225–329 in the COOH-terminal domain of NIPP1. The FHA domain of NIPP1 interacts with phosphorylated forms of the splicing factors SAP155 (9Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

It is not known how residues 225–329 of NIPP1 contribute to spliceosome assembly. The extreme COOH terminus of NIPP1 (residues 329–351) does not appear to be involved in spliceosome assembly but has binding sites for PP1 and for A/U-rich single-stranded nucleic acids (3Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Jin Q. Beullens M. Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 329–351 as well as NIPP1-(225–351), which may exist as a splice variant known as NIPP1γ (12Van Eynde A. Perez-Callejon E. Schoenmakers E. Jacquemin M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or Ard1 (13Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), displays an endoribonuclease activity with a specificity that is similar to that of the bacterial RNase E (11Jin Q. Beullens M. Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a key regulator of the decay and processing of various RNAs. Remarkably, in full-length NIPP1, the endoribonuclease activity is restrained by the central domain, suggesting that the expression of this activity is under tight control. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are part of a transcriptional memory mechanism that maintains genes in the repressed state once they are inactivated (14Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Raaphorst F.M. Otte A.P. Meijer C.J. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 682-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among the genes that are silenced by the PcG proteins are the homeotic genes, which play a key role in the establishment of the body plan during early embryonic development. The PcG proteins are also implicated in the random and imprinted inactivation of the X chromosome and in the regulation of autosomal imprinted loci (17Mager J. Montgomery N.D. Pardo-Manuel de Villena F. Magnuson T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. dela Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y. Science. 2003; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Two major PcG complexes have been distinguished known as the Polycomb-repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 (14Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The PRC1 complex is the largest complex and consists in vertebrates of the BMI-1, RING1, HPC, and HPH proteins. The PRC2 complex is composed of the proteins EED (embryonic ectoderm development) and EZH2. Although the PcG complexes have been purified as separate entities, considerable evidence suggests that they can interact transiently. It has recently been demonstrated that EZH2 functions as a methyltransferase and methylates nucleosomal histone H3 on Lys-9 and Lys-27, which facilitates the binding of the PRC1 complex (19Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Recruitment of PRC1 would then prevent the access of nucleosome-remodeling factors, such as SWI/SNF, leading to the formation of a repressive chromatin state. A further complexity in the understanding of PcG-mediated transcriptional repression arises from observations that the PcG complexes also contain non-PcG proteins and that the composition of the PcG complexes is cell-type and differentiationdependent (23Poux S.M.R. Pirrotta V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For example, the PRC2 complex has been reported to contain the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, which may contribute to the transcriptional repression by the PRC2 complex (24van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 25Tie F.F.T. Prasad-Sinha J. Jane E. Harte P.J. Development. 2001; 128: 275-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the association of HDACs with the PRC2 complex has not been a universal finding (19Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y.

Another component of the PRC2 complex is the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which has been suggested to mediate the binding of the PRC2 complex to specific DNA sequences, the so-called Polycomb response elements (26Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As a component of the PRC2 complex, EED is essential for a proper anterior-posterior patterning of the primitive streak in early gastrulation (27Shumacher A. Faust C. Magnuson T.

Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y. Science. 2003; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). However, EED is also expressed in a variety of adult tissues (30Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Schumacher A. Lichtarge O. Schwartz S. Magnuson T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and functions in a cell-type and differentiation-dependent manner. For example, EED represses proliferation of myeloid and B-cell precursors in adult bone marrow (33Lessard J. Schumacher A. Thorsteinsdottir U. van Lohuizen M. Magnuson T. Sauvageau G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) but promotes the differentiation of early intrathymic T-cell precursors. Intriguingly, EED also suppresses the development of thymic lymphomas induced by the carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosurea. To identify protein interactors that mediate the spliceosomal function of the COOH-terminal domain of NIPP1 and/or modulate its endoribonuclease activity, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with NIPP1-(225–351) as bait. This study led to the identification of the PcG protein EED as a novel interactor of NIPP1. We did not find any evidence for a role of EED in the spliceosomal and endoribonuclease functions of NIPP1. However, like EED, NIPP1 functioned as a potent transcriptional repressor. The latter NIPP1 effect depended on binding sites for EED but did not require functional interaction sites for either splicing factors or PP1. Materials—poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), and poly(G) were obtained from Sigma, and the 20-mer poly(dC) and poly(dG) were purchased from Sigma. Microcystin-Sepharose was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. PP1 was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (34DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant inhibitor-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared as described previously (35Park I.K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide comprising the COOH terminus of NIPP1 (341PGKKPTPSLLI351) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody. The NIPP1 antibodies were affinity-purified on the peptide coupled to bovine serum albumin and linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The NIPP1 antibodies were labeled with digoxygenin as detailed by Jagiello et al. (4Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human recombinant polyhistidine-tagged EED was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The EED antibodies were affinity-purified on His-EED linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Monoclonal hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (clone 12CA5), polyclonal GAL4 DNA-binding domain (sc-577), GST antibodies (sc-459), His antibodies (sc-803), HDAC2 antibodies (sc-7899), PP1 antibodies (Sc-7482), and YY1 antibodies (sc-281) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako. Digoxygenin antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase were delivered by Roche Applied Science. The cDNA of full-length bovine NIPP1 was cloned into the pGEX-2TK vector inframe with GST protein. To generate GST-NIPP1-(1–329), a stop codon was introduced in codon 330 of the latter construct. NIPP1-(143–224) and NIPP1-(225–351) were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector in-frame with GST. The bacterial GST-tagged NIPP1 (fragments) were expressed and purified as described previously (10Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with the exception that the proteins were expressed at 18 °C to prevent proteolytic degradation. The cDNA encoding human EED was cloned into the pET16b vector in-frame with a polyhistidine tag. EED fragments and the mutants EED I193N and EED L196P were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol of Stratagene. The His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni2+-pentadentate-chelator-Sepharose (Affiland). The cDNA of full-length NIPP1 was also cloned into the pGMEX vector (AMRAD Pharmacia Biotech) for the expression of GST-tagged NIPP1 in mammalian cells. The sequence of all of the DNA constructs was verified on an ALFII sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Assays—NIPP1-(225–351), cloned into the pEG202 vector in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain, was used as bait for a two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library. In this library, the cDNAs are subcloned behind a galactose-inducible promotor in the pJG4 –5 vector in-frame with the B42 activation domain. Interacting proteins were identified by growth of the yeast strain EGY188 in a +galactose/–leucine medium. The use of a second plasmid-born lacZ reporter gene (pSH18 –34) with upstream LexA operators enabled a second screening involving the expression of β-galactosidase in the presence of galactose. Altogether we screened 4 × 106 clones yielding six positive clones all encoding full-length EED. To map the interaction sites between NIPP1 and EED, mutants or fragments of NIPP1 (Fig. 1) were subcloned into the pEG202 vector while mutants or fragments of EED (Fig. 1) were cloned into the pJG4 –5 vector. The interaction between EED and NIPP1 (mutants) was quantified by the assay of β-galactosidase activities in liquid cultures using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (Clontech yeast protocol handbook). GST Pull-down Assays and Immunoprecipitations—GST and GST fusions of NIPP1 (fragments) were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) that has been preblocked with TBS plus bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After washing with TBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the beads were incubated with either COS-1 cell lysates or polyhistidine-tagged EED (mutants) for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were sedimented (30 s at 1000 × g), washed three times with 500 μl of TBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and probed for the presence of GST-NIPP1 and His-EED. The cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 μm leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 20 mm NaF. For immunoprecipitations, mouse embryo (7.5 dpc, including decidua) extracts, cell lysates, or a mixture of purified GST-NIPP1 and His-EED (plus or minus PP1 and nucleic acids as indicated) was incubated for 1–4 h at 4 °C with either NIPP1 or EED antibodies coupled to protein A-TSK (Affiland) beads. After three washes with 500 μl of TBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the beads were screened for the presence of NIPP1 and EED by Western analysis and for PP1 by the assay of phosphorylase phosphatase activities. Cell Culture—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection with mammalian expression vectors encoding GST or GST-NIPP1. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm butyrate. After lysis of the cells, ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) was added to disrupt protein-DNA interactions, and after an incubation for 30 min at 0 °C, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g) and the supernatants were used for GST pull-down assays. Phosphorylase Phosphatase Assays—The trypsin-revealed protein phosphatase activities were measured as described previously (1Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate. One unit of phosphatase released 1 nmol of phosphate/min at 30 °C. The inhibitory potency of NIPP1 and NIPP1-(1–329) was assayed in the presence of 0.4 nm PP1C. Transcriptional Repression Assays—We used the assay described by Thiel et al (36Thiel G. Kaufmann K. Magin A. Lietz M. Bach K. Cramer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Thiel G. Lietz M. Bach K. Guethlein L. Cibelli G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For these experiments, EED, NIPP1, and the indicated mutants were subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pM in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–147). COS-1 cells and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For repression assays, 0.06 × 106 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate. After 1 day, the cells were transfected with (i) 50 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmid containing 5 GAL4-binding sites (UAS) either upstream of the SV40 promotor (plasmid pUAS5-SV40-Luc) or downstream of the polyadenlylation signal (plasmid pSV40-Luc-UAS5), (ii) 100 ng of GAL4 (fusion) encoding plasmid, and (iii) 20 ng of the β-galactosidase encoding plasmid. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activities were measured in a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Labsystems) using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). The β-galactosidase activities were measured with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. The luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activities. The data are represented as means ± S.E. of percentages of the luciferase activity that were measured with GAL4 (n = 4–9 separate transfections). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis of the NIPP1-EED Interaction—A yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library with the COOH-terminal third of NIPP1 (residues 225–351) as bait resulted in the identification of the transcriptional repressor EED as an interacting protein (Fig. 1B). A deletion of the RNA-binding domain of NIPP1 as in NIPP1-(225–329) improved the binding to EED considerably, but a further deletion as in NIPP1-(225–310) abolished the interaction, indicating that residues 310–329 are essential for the binding of EED (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, NIPP1-(280–329) was also found to interact with EED in the two-hybrid assay. We have not been able to explore the interaction between EED and full-length NIPP1 in two-hybrid assays since the latter already induced the expression of the reporter gene in the absence of EED. Surprisingly, NIPP1-(1–224) was also found to interact with EED, indicating that NIPP1 contains a second EED-binding site in its NH2-terminal two-thirds. Using additional NIPP1 fragments, this second EED interaction site was mapped to the central domain (residues 143–224). Both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal deletions of the latter NIPP1 fragment as in NIPP1-(167–224) and in NIPP1-(143–209) abolished the binding of EED. The central domain of NIPP1 also contains two binding sites for PP1. One of these represents a polybasic stretch (residues 193–197) that is important for the inhibition of PP1 (2Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, mutation of this polybasic stretch as in NIPP1-(143–224)-K193A,R194A,K195A,R196A,K197A did not hamper the interaction with EED in two-hybrid assays (data not shown). A second PP1-binding site in the central domain of NIPP1 is represented by the 200RVTF203 sequence (2Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This sequence is a variant of the so-called RVXF motif that is present in most interactors of PP1 (38Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The RVXF motif of NIPP1 is flanked by two serines (Ser-199 and Ser-204), and phosphorylation of these serines or their replacement by aspartic acid impedes the binding of PP1 (2Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that NIPP1-(143–224)-S199D,S204D interacted normally with EED in a two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Collectively, the above data indicate that EED and PP1 have distinct binding sites in the central domain of NIPP1. The two-hybrid screening with NIPP1-(225–351) as bait yielded six prey clones that all encoded full-length EED (441 residues). There is considerable evidence that murine EED is a larger polypeptide (535 residues), and this was explained by the use of an upstream Val-encoding GTG as translation initiation codon. However, the corresponding Val triplet in the human EED gene is a GTA, which is never used as a translation initiation codon. We and others (26Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Schumacher A. Lichtarge O. Schwartz S. Magnuson T. Genomics. 1998; 54: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have therefore used the first ATG as the putative translation initiation codon, yielding a protein of 441 residues, which is similar to the size of Drosophila EED (425 residues) better known as ESC. Based on the Protein Sequence Analysis program (bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/), EED largely consists of seven WD40 domains (Fig. 1A). WD40 domains are protein-interaction domains that often occur tandemly in proteins. WD40 repeats are known to fold into four-strand β-blades that, similar to the pieces of a pie, form a circular structure known as a β-propeller (39Ng J. Li R. Morgan K. Simon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6663-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EED is predicted to form a seven-bladed β-propeller. We found that the deletion of the first one or the last three WD40 domains abolished the ability of EED to interact with the central and carboxyl-terminal domains of NIPP1 in two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1B). Likewise, EED-(1–156), EED-(157–289), and EED-(290–441) did not interact with the NIPP1 fragments. Interestingly, two point mutants, i.e. I193N and L196P, did not interact with NIPP1 either. These two residues are predicted to reside in the third WD40 domain (Fig. 1B), and the same mutations of the corresponding residues in mouse EED are embryologically lethal (L196P) or hypomorphic (I193N) (27Shumacher A. Faust C. Magnuson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The latter two EED mutants are also inactive in transcriptional repressor assays (see also Fig. 8) (30Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and do not interact with EZH2 (40Denisenko O. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5634-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Co-precipitation of NIPP1 and EED—The NIPP1-EED interaction that was detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of both components from the yeast extracts using antibodies against either NIPP1 or HA-tagged EED (Fig. 2A). Likewise, the immunoprecipitation of endogenous NIPP1 or EED from mouse embryo extracts (Fig. 2B) or COS cell lysates (data not shown) resulted in the co-precipitation of EED or NIPP1, respectively. Furthermore, EED in COS cell lysates co-precipitated in pull-down experiments with exogenous GST-NIPP1 (Fig. 2C). Finally, purified recombinant His-EED could be pulled down with GST-NIPP1, proving that the NIPP1-EED interaction is direct and does not involve a third component (Fig. 2D). Importantly, the His-EED I193N and His-EED L196P mutants, which did not interact with NIPP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1B), could not be pulled down with GST-NIPP1 (Fig. 2D). The NIPP1-EED and NIPP1-PP1 Interactions Are Modulated by Nucleic Acids—We have subsequently explored whether previously identified interactors of NIPP1 interfere with the binding of EED.

https://openalex.org/W2086940027,"Type XIX collagen was discovered from the sequence of rhabdomyosarcoma cDNA clones. The chain is composed of a 268-residue amino terminus, an 832-residue discontinuous collagenous region, and a 19-residue carboxyl peptide. Light microscopy immunohistochemistry of adult human tissues demonstrated that type XIX is localized in vascular, neuronal, mesenchymal, and some epithelial basement membrane zones. It also appears to be involved in events linked to skeletal myogenesis. In this report, we have presented the first direct evidence for the molecular structure of type XIX collagen. Using human umbilical cord, native type XIX was purified by neutral salt extraction and by ion exchange and antibody affinity chromatography. Type XIX was found to represent only ∼10–6% of the dry weight of tissue, making it by far the least abundant collagen ever isolated. Transmission electron microscopy after rotary shadowing revealed the appearance of rodlike structures with multiple sharp bends, a small nodule at one end of the molecule, and a total length of 240 nm. Domain-specific antibodies were used to identify the nodule as the noncollagenous amino terminus, whereas the location of most kinks corresponds to major interruptions separating the five collagenous subdomains. More than half of the type XIX molecules observed were present in oligomers of different size and complexity, resulting from association of the amino-terminal domains. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that these supramolecular aggregates are dependent upon and/or stabilized by intermolecular disulfide cross-links and that the globular amino terminus contains a high affinity, heparin-binding site. The polymorphic conformational states of this rare collagen, and its ability to self-assemble into a higher order structure provide focal points for future determination of biologically significant functions in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2027284945,"The exosome is a complex of 3′ → 5′ exoribonucleases that functions in a variety of cellular processes, all concerning the processing or degradation of RNA. Paradoxically, the previously described cDNA for the human autoantigenic exosome subunit PM/Scl-75 (Alderuccio, F., Chan, E. K., and Tan, E. M. (1991) J. Exp.

Here, we describe the cloning of a more complete cDNA for PM/Scl-75 encoding 84 additional amino acids at its N terminus. We show that only the longer polypeptide is able to associate with the exosome complex. This interaction is most likely mediated by protein-protein interactions with two other exosome subunits, hRrp46p and hRrp41p, one of which was confirmed in a mammalian two-hybrid system. In addition we show that the putative nuclear localization signal present in the C-terminal region of PM/Scl-75 is sufficient, although not essential for nuclear localization of the protein. Moreover, the deletion of this element abrogated the nucleolar accumulation of PM/Scl-75, although its association with the exosome was not disturbed. This suggests that this basic element of PM/Scl-75 plays a role in targeting the exosome to the nucleolus.

Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PM/Scl-75 has been suggested to be an AU-rich element binding protein, involved in the recruitment of the exosome to this class of mRNAs (19Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Like five other exosome proteins, PM/Scl-75 contains an RNase PH domain, which is homologous to the prokaryotic 3′-5′ exoribonuclease RNase PH. Based on mutual interactions between exosome components and structural similarity with the bacterial protein polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a component of the bacterial degradosome, recently a model for the structure of the human exosome was generated. In this model the six proteins containing an RNase PH domain form the core of the exosome, which adopts a hexameric ring structure (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cloning of a cDNA encoding the human PM/Scl-75 protein revealed an acidic polypeptide sequence of only 39.2 kDa. Its migration at 75 kDa in SDS-PAGE was explained by its highly charged C-terminal half (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In immunofluorescence experiments the protein showed mainly nucleolar localization (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although it was also found to be present in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of human cells (19Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of the protein shows homology to the bacterial RNase PH protein (8Saira Mian I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal half is characterized by a region of ∼100 amino acids highly enriched in acidic residues. Close to the C terminus a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located consisting of seven basic residues (KRRKKKR) (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This cDNA of PM/Scl-75 has been used in a number of transfection experiments to study its subcellular localization and association with the exosome. Although similar experiments with most other exosome components were successful, EGFP fusion proteins of PM/Scl-75 were unable to enter the nucleolus, and PM/Scl-75 failed to interact with other exosome components in a mammalian two-hybrid system (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the previously described protein sequences of PM/Scl-75 are most likely incomplete. We have cloned and characterized additional cDNAs encoding PM/Scl-75 that in comparison with the original sequence encode 84 additional amino acid residues at its N terminus. In contrast to the previously described PM/Scl-75 polypeptide, this longer variant appeared to be able to associate with the exosome and to accumulate in the nucleolus. cDNA Cloning and Construction of Deletion Mutants—All cDNAs used were cloned into pACT and pBIND vectors (Promega) or suitable pEGFP vectors (Clontech) by PCR or via available restriction sites. The data base accession numbers of the cDNAs used are BC000747 (hRrp4p), AF281132 (hRrp40p), AF281133 (hRrp41p), D29958 (hRrp42p), AF281134 (hRrp46p), M58460 (PM/Scl-75a), L01457 (PM/Scl-100), AF151866 (hCsl4p), R27667 (hDis3p), AF025438 (OIP2), and NM_058219 (hMtr3p). The sequences of the cDNAs encoding PM/Scl-75c-α and PM/Scl-75c-β were submitted under accession numbers AJ505989 and AJ517294, respectively. Deletion mutants of PM/Scl-75 were constructed using suitable internal restriction sites. Bioinformatics—Predictions of functional domains and putative NLSs were done using the Pfam data base of Hidden Markov models (21Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and the PredictNLS server (22Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), respectively. Sequence data base searching was performed using BLAST on GenBank™ data bases containing either ESTs or genomic sequence information. Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To visualize the proteins, the blots were incubated with autoimmune patient or rabbit sera diluted 5000- and 500-fold, respectively, in blocking buffer (4% skimmed milk, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Nonidet P-40). As secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti human IgG or swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Immunoglobulins) were used, 5000-fold diluted in blocking buffer. Visualization was performed by chemiluminescence. In Vitro Translation—Radioactively labeled proteins were produced using a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's procedure in a total volume of 25 μl, containing ∼1 μg of circular plasmid DNA (pCI-neo; Promega), containing the coding sequence of the protein, and in the presence of [35S]methionine. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesis of cDNA from 1 μg of RNA was performed using a reverse transcription system (Promega) with 10 pmol of PM/Scl-75-specific primer. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 90 min at 42 °C. For RT-PCR 1 μl of cDNA was added to 49 μl of the reaction mixture containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 20 pmol of forward and reverse primer, and 8 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed using a T3 thermocycler (Biometra): 2 min at 94 °C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; and 5 min at 72 °C. 10 μl of PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The following primers were used: RT primer, 5′-CAGGTGTAGAAACAACTTCTGAAGGAGG-3′; PM/Scl-75 reverse primer, 5′-CACCAAGAGATCTGACTGCCTGCCAG-3′; PM/Scl-75a forward primer, 5′-AGATCTCGAG CCTGTATGGGCGGGCTGGTTAGGATTC-3′; and PM/Scl-75c forward primer, 5′-AGATCTCGTCGACCGAATTCCATGAAGGAAACGCCACTC-3′. Transient Transfection of HEp-2 Cells and Direct Immunofluorescence—For transfection, cDNAs were cloned into suitable pEGFP vectors (Clontech), allowing expression of the proteins fused to the C terminus of the EGFP protein. HEp-2 (human epithelioma, ATCC number CCL-23) cells were grown to 80% confluent monolayers by standard tissue culture techniques in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For immunoprecipitation, ∼10 × 106 cells were transfected with 20–30 μg of DNA in 1600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum by electroporation, which was performed at 270 V and 950 microfarad using a Gene-Pulser II (Bio-Rad). After transfection, the cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture flasks and cultured overnight. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and homogenized by sonication. For fluorescence microscopy, ∼2 × 106 cells were transfected with 10–20 μg of DNA in 800 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum by electroporation, as described above. After transfection, the cells were seeded onto cover-slips and cultured overnight. The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed in PBS twice, briefly rinsed in acetone, dried, and finally mounted with PBS/glycerol. The expressed EGFP-tagged proteins were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation—Polyclonal antibodies from rabbits and patients were coupled to protein A-agarose beads (Biozym) in IPP500 (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with IPP500 and once with IPP150 (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). For each immunoprecipitation, the cell extract was incubated with the antibody-coupled beads for1hat4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with IPP150, and the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—All of the interactions were analyzed using the CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega), essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3–4 × 105 COS-1 cells seeded in one well of a 6-well plate were transfected with three vectors (1 μg each), pACT and pBIND, either with or without insert, and the pG5luc reporter vector using 5 μl of FuGENE Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), as described by the manufacturer. After 40–48 h of growth, the cells were harvested using 500 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the activity of both the firefly luciferase and the control Renilla luciferase were determined using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 Luminometer. In brief, 100 μl of firefly luciferase substrate solution was added to 20 μl of cell extract, and the luminescence was measured to determine the efficiency of the interaction. Next, 100 μl of Renilla luciferase substrate solution (containing a quencher for the firefly luciferase activity) was added, and again the luminescence was determined to monitor the transfection efficiency. Amino Acid Sequence of PM/Scl-75—Several amino acid sequences for the human PM/Scl-75 polypeptide have been reported previously. Besides the first sequence ever described (here referred to as PM/Scl-75a-α, accession number M58460) (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a splicing variant containing the sequence encoded by an additional exon (PM/Scl-75a-β, accession number HSU09215) and a sequence containing 68 additional amino acid residues at the N terminus (PM/Scl-75b-α, accession number Q06265) have been reported. Moreover, the sequence reported for Mus musculus PM/Scl-75 (accession number Q9JHI7) contains, compared with the human PM/Scl-75a-α, 84 additional amino acids residues at the N terminus (23Bliskovski V. Liddell R. Ramsay E.S. Miller M.J. Mock B.A. Genomics. 2000; 64: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The reported heterogeneity in sequences for the N-terminal region of the human PM/Scl-75 prompted us to screen the human EST data bases with the available human and mouse PM/Scl-75 cDNA sequences. These analyses demonstrated that in humans PM/Scl-75 sequences are expressed that fully correspond to the N-terminal region of the mouse protein. Thus, in comparison with PM/Scl-75a the human protein may also contain 84 additional amino acids. Based upon these data extended open reading frames for the human PM/Scl-75 were generated (PM/Scl-75c-α and PM/Scl-75c-β) and submitted to the EMBL data base under accession numbers AJ505989 and AJ517294. Fig. 1a shows the sequence of PM/Scl-75c, in which the differences with previously described PM/Scl-75 sequences are indicated. In Fig. 1b a schematic overview of the human polypeptides and their mRNAs is shown. It is important to note that PM/Scl-75a lacks a significant part of the RNase PH domain as predicted by Pfam (21Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The RNase PH domain is expected to be important for the interactions of PM/Scl-75 with other exosomal proteins in the core of the exosome (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When the cDNA sequences are compared with the human genome, it is clear that the difference between the sequences is due to the use of an apparent alternative promotor in the PM/Scl-75 gene or to alternative splicing of the PM/Scl-75 pre-mRNA, as is illustrated in Fig. 1c. The 5′ end of the cDNAs of PM/Scl-75c is encoded by an alternative first exon and lacks the first 234 nucleotides of the first exon of PM/Scl-75a. The protein sequence of PM/Scl-75b was derived from a cDNA very similar to that of PM/Scl-75a. The PM/Scl-75b cDNA contains a stretch of 8 instead of 7 thymidine residues at position 395–402 (which may be due to a sequencing error of the original clone), leading to a longer open reading frame (23Bliskovski V. Liddell R. Ramsay E.S. Miller M.J. Mock B.A. Genomics. 2000; 64: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To investigate which of the corresponding mRNAs are actually expressed in human cell lines, RNA isolated from HEp-2, HeLa, 293, Jurkat, and MOLT-4 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the PM/Scl-75a/b and PM/Scl-75c mRNAs. Both mRNAs were found to be present in all cells lines (results not shown). To discriminate between PM/Scl-75a and PM/Scl-75b, the RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that the T-stretch consisted of 8 thymidine residues in all cases, indicating that the expressed mRNA corresponds to PM/Scl-75b. Strikingly, however, no evidence for the existence of mRNAs encoding either PM/Scl-75a or PM/Scl-75b was found in the EST data bases, strongly suggesting that PM/Scl-75c is the most abundantly expressed isoform of the protein. To generate cDNAs encoding PM/Scl-75c, we performed PCR on human teratocarcinoma and placenta cDNA libraries using primers specific for the 5′ region of PM/Scl-75c. The PCR products obtained were sequenced and found to be identical to the sequence of the cDNA encoding PM/Scl-75c as derived from the EST data bases. The polypeptides encoded by the PM/Scl-75a-α and PM/Scl-75c-α cDNAs were produced by in vitro transcription/translation, and their migration in SDS-PAGE gels was compared with that of PM/Scl-75 from a cytoplasmic HeLa cell extract, which was detected by immunoblotting using anti-PM/Scl-75 rabbit antibodies (Fig. 2). The results showed that the migration of PM/Scl-75c was identical to that of HeLa cell PM/Scl-75. The migration of in vitro translated PM/Scl-75a was clearly different, in agreement with previous observations (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To investigate the occurrence of the extra exon (10*) that is present in the β variant of PM/Scl-75 (Fig. 1d, exon a), the GenBank™ EST data base was screened for sequences containing the exon-exon junctions 10*–11 and 10–11. In total, 52 ESTs encompassing this region were identified, 10 of which contained exon 10*, indicating that both splice variants of PM/Scl-75 are expressed but that the isoform lacking exon 10* may be more abundant. Taken together, these results indicate that PM/Scl-75c-α is the predominant isoform of PM/Scl-75 but that at least four splice variants exist that differ by their N terminus and the presence or absence of 17 amino acids encoded by exon 10*. The Subcellular Localization of PM/Scl-75—To investigate the subcellular localization of PM/Scl-75 polypeptides, constructs encoding PM/Scl-75a-α, PM/Scl-75c-α, and PM/Scl-75c-β tagged with EGFP were generated. The fusion proteins were expressed in transiently transfected HEp-2 cells and as a control the endogenous PM/Scl-75 protein in HEp-2 cells was visualized by immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-PM/Scl-75 antibodies. Whereas the highest concentration of the endogenous PM/Scl-75 protein was found in the nucleoli (Fig. 3A), EGFP-PM/Scl-75a-α failed to enter the nucleoli and accumulated in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3B). In contrast, EGFP-tagged PM/Scl-75c-α and PM/Scl-75c-β efficiently entered the nucleolus of HEp-2 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These data indicate that the N-terminal 84 amino acids of PM/Scl-75c are important for nucleolar accumulation and that the 17 amino acids encoded by exon 10* do not affect this process. To investigate whether the N-terminal region of PM/Scl-75c is sufficient for nucleolar targeting, the N-terminal 98 amino acids of PM/Scl-75c were fused to the N terminus of EGFP, and the subcellular localization of this fusion protein was analyzed in transfected HEp-2 cells. This fusion protein distributed throughout HEp-2 cells, similar to EGFP alone (data not shown). Previously, a sequence element (KRRKKKR) with similarity to NLSs has been reported to reside at the C-terminal end of PM/Scl-75 (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this element in nuclear and nucleolar entry, mutants of PM/Scl-75a-α and PM/Scl-75c-α lacking the C-terminal 39 amino acids were generated (ΔNLS). As can be seen in Fig. 3E, PM/Scl-75a-α ΔNLS failed to enter the nucleus. Remarkably, PM/Scl-75c-α ΔNLS still was transported to the nucleus but was unable to enter the nucleolus (Fig. 3F). Finally, an EGFP fusion protein was expressed containing only the C-terminal 39 amino acids of PM/Scl-75. Fig. 3G shows that this element is sufficient for transportation of EGFP to the nucleus. These data show that both N- and C-terminal elements of PM/Scl-75 are involved in its nuclear entry and that the C-terminal elements (also) play a role in nucleolar targeting. The Association of PM/Scl-75 with the Exosome—In addition to elements directly involved in subcellular transport processes, the association with the exosome may also play a role in the subcellular localization. To investigate the effect of the mutations on the association with the exosome, immunoprecipitations with anti-EGFP antibodies were performed using lysates of HEp-2 cells transfected with constructs encoding the EGFP-tagged PM/Scl-75 mutants. The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by Western blotting, using a human serum (Ven96) reactive with several exosome proteins (including PM/Scl-100, PM/Scl-75, hRr4p, hRrp41p, and hRrp42p). The patient serum stained the different PM/Scl-75 fusion proteins very efficiently, which shows that all variants/mutants were expressed at similar levels. The results showed that many endogenous exosome proteins (although PM/Scl-100 was not detected in the immunoprecipitates) co-precipitated with both PM/Scl-75c-α and PM/Scl-75c-αΔNLS but not with PM/Scl-75a-α (Fig. 4a). In a similar type of experiment, we demonstrated that both the α and β form of PM/Scl-75c can be incorporated in the exosome complex (Fig. 4b). Previously, we demonstrated that PM/Scl-75a-α was not able to interact directly with any other exosome component in a mammalian two-hybrid system, although its yeast counterpart (Rrp45p) is known to interact with yeast Rrp41p (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs encoding PM/Scl-75a-α, PM/Scl-75c-α, and 10 (putative) human exosome components (hRrp4p, hRrp40p, hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRrp46p, PM/Scl-100, hCsl4p, hRrp44p/hDis3p, OIP2, and hMtr3p) were cloned in both the pACT (in-frame with the sequence encoding the VP16 transcription activation domain) and pBIND (in-frame with the sequence encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain) vectors of the Checkmate mammalian two-hybrid system. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with each pair of these constructs, and after 40–48 h the luciferase activity of extracts prepared from these cells was determined. This revealed that, in contrast to PM/Scl-75a-α, PM/Scl-75c-α fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was able to interact with hRrp41p fused to the VP16 activation domain (Fig. 5). This interaction was confirmed by a complementary experiment in which the fusion domains were exchanged (data not shown). The interaction of PM/Scl-75c with hRrp41 adds further evidence to the model for the human exosome, in which PM/Scl-75 is flanked by hRrp41p and hRrp46p (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternative Splicing of PM/Scl-75—As can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the subcellular localization and exosome association of the PM/Scl-75c-β isoform, containing the extra exon 10*, in living cells was indistinguishable from that of the PM/Scl-75c-α isoform. The data from the EST libraries (see above) suggested that the α isoform is more abundantly expressed than the β isoform. To shed more light on this issue, we studied their expression in several cell lines by Western blotting. The ratio between the amounts of the α and β isoforms appeared to vary significantly between different cell lines, although in most cells analyzed PM/Scl-75c-α was at least as abundant as PM/Scl-75c-β. Fig. 6 shows that in Jurkat, HeLa, and HEp-2 cells (lanes 1–3) the amount of both isoforms is comparable. In COS1 and 293 cells (lanes 4 and 5) the α isoform of PM/Scl-75 appears to be the most abundant one. In HeLa cells, the relative level of PM/Scl-75-β was significantly higher in nuclear extracts than in cytoplasmic extracts (lanes 6 and 7), suggesting a predominant nuclear localization for PM/Scl-75c-β. In this study we have shown that the previously reported cDNA and amino acid sequences for the human polymyositis/scleroderma autoantigen PM/Scl-75 are probably incomplete. We cloned a cDNA with an extended N terminus, and only the longer form of PM/Scl-75 was able to associate with the exosome complex, to interact with at least one other exosome subunit, and to enter the nucleolus, three functional activities that are shared with other exosome subunits. The presence of exon 10* in the coding sequence of PM/Scl-75 (observed in a previously reported splice variant) did not affect the behavior of PM/Scl-75 with regard to its subcellular localization and exosome association. In addition, PM/Scl-75 was shown to contain both N- and C-terminal elements involved in its nuclear localization, the latter of which also appeared to be responsible for nucleolar accumulation of this protein. The Amino Acid Sequence of PM/Scl-75—The cDNA of PM/Scl-75a-α (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) lacks the first exon compared with the cDNA of PM/Scl-75c-α, and as a consequence the open reading frame starts at another methionine. Note that the 5′ end of the PM/Scl-75b-α cDNA is identical to that of PM/Scl-75a-α, with the exception of one additional nucleotide in the former, leading to a longer open reading frame in the 5′ region (23Bliskovski V. Liddell R. Ramsay E.S. Miller M.J. Mock B.A. Genomics. 2000; 64: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The expression of mRNAs corresponding to these two types of cDNAs is most likely due to the existence of alternative promoters and transcription initiation sites in the gene of this protein (Fig. 1c). In contrast to PM/Scl-75c-α the expression of PM/Scl-75a-α and PM/Scl-75b-α mRNAs is not supported by entries in the EST data bases. A TBLASTN search of the human EST data base with the N-terminal 80 amino acids of the mouse sequence resulted in 49 of 50 hits that fully matched the N terminus of the additional sequence. No ESTs were observed encoding the sequence corresponding to the N terminus of PM/Scl-75a or PM/Scl-75b. Nevertheless, the latter was detected in several cell lines by RT-PCR, followed by sequencing of the products. The lack of expression of PM/Scl-75a-α is supported by the observation that the corresponding in vitro translated protein migrates faster than the PM/Scl-75 protein from HeLa cells (Fig. 2) (1Alderuccio F. Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, immunoblotting of primate cell extracts with rabbit anti-PM/Scl-75 antibodies revealed several minor polypeptide bands, including one with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (Figs. 2 and 6), which is similar to the migration of PM/Scl-75a-α. Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal region of the major PM/Scl-75 isoform corresponds to the sequence encoded by PM/Scl-75c-α and that as a result of an alternative promoter PM/Scl-75b-α is produced. The expression of mRNAs either containing or lacking exon 10* (Fig. 1d) is supported by a series of data base entries and thus is consistent with the expression of two splicing variants (designated α and β). Western blot analyses of extracts of several primate cell lines indeed show a doublet for PM/Scl-75, in agreement with the simultaneous expression of these splice variants in a variety of cells. Interestingly, the results of HeLa cell fractionation experiments suggested that the β isoform might accumulate somewhat more efficiently in the nucleus than the α isoform. Transport of PM/Scl-75 to Nucleus and Nucleolus—Previously, the C-terminal element of PM/Scl-75, rich in basic amino acids, was proposed to be a nuclear localization sequence. Here, we have shown that this element indeed can direct a reporter protein to the nucleus. However, this element did not appear to be essential for nuclear import of PM/Scl-75, as long as PM/Scl-75 was able to interact with the rest of the exosome complex. On the other hand, the basic sequence element of PM/Scl-75 is important for nucleolar accumulation of this protein. Based upon the presence of putative NLS sequences in at least two other exosome proteins, hRrp41p (amino acids 85–90, ERKRRP) and PM/Scl-100 (amino acids 752–758, AKKRERA), two mechanisms for nuclear entry of the exosome can be envisaged. First, the nuclear import of the completely assembled exosome may be mediated by the concerted action of several signals. Second, partially assembled parts of the exosome may enter the nucleus and assemble into a complete exosome in the nucleoplasm or nucleolus. All of these basic elements may also be involved in nucleolar targeting of the exosome, because elements rich in basic residues have been demonstrated to play an essential role in nucleolar accumulation (24van Eenennaam H. van der H.A. Janssen R.J. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3680-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Association of PM/Scl-75 with the Exosome—The direct interaction between PM/Scl-75c and hRrp41p supports the model for the human exosome that we recently proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 7 (20Raijmakers R. Vree Egberts W. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The minor isoform of the protein, PM/Scl-75b, most likely is also capable of interacting with hRrp41p and the exosome, because it contains the complete RNase PH domain (Fig. 1b). Another interaction predicted by that model, between PM/Scl-75 and hRrp46p (Fig. 7), could not be detected in the mammalian two-hybrid system. PM/Scl-75 represents together with hRrp41p the equivalent of one PNPase subunit in the structurally related PNPase trimer, and the two RNase PH domains of PNPase interact with each other via their most C-terminal sequences. The failure of PM/Scl-75 to interact with its putative neighbor hRrp46p, which is predicted to be mediated by the N-terminal regions of their RNase PH domains, might be due to the fact that the hRrp46p cDNA that was used is also incomplete. Very recently an alternative sequence for hRrp46p was published (25Yang X.F. Wu C.J. Chen L. Alyea E.P. Canning C. Kantoff P. Soiffer R.J. Dranoff G. Ritz J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5517-5522PubMed Google Scholar) that contains an N terminus with 33 additional amino acids. Although the complete RNase PH domain is present in the original sequence of hRrp46p, it is possible that some flanking amino acids might be required for the interaction with PM/Scl-75, either by making direct contacts or by stabilizing the proper conformation of the RNase PH domain. Another explanation might be the possible interference of the fusion parts of the mammalian two-hybrid constructs, which are both attached to the N terminus of the proteins to be analyzed. Whether the AU binding properties of PM/Scl-75 (19Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) are also influenced by the extra N-terminal sequence remains to be investigated, although this activity is most likely mediated by the C-terminal part of the protein, because the RNase PH domain is responsible for the interaction of the protein with the exosome complex. Because no functional differences were found between the splice variants PM/Scl-75-α and PM/Scl-75-β, and both PM/Scl-75b and PM/Scl-75c contain the complete RNase PH domain, the function of this multiplicity of PM/Scl-75 splice variants remains to be identified, although the function of the β form might be specific for the nucleus given its increased nuclear accumulation.

The structural basis of inhibition by a multidomain Pot II family inhibitor was revealed recently by the structure of the ternary complex between the two-headed tomato inhibitor-II (TI-II) and two molecules of subtilisin Carlsberg. Here we report the 2.15-Å resolution crystal structure of the unbound form of TI-II that reveals significant conformational flexibility in the absence of bound proteinase molecules. The four independent copies of unbound TI-II in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell display a range of different conformations when compared with the bound form of the inhibitor, most strikingly in the orientations of the inhibitory domains and in the conformations of the reactive site loops. One of the two linker segments (residues 74 to 79) between the two domains as well as the adjacent β-strand in Domain I (residues 80–85) is well ordered in all four copies of the unbound inhibitor, even though this region appeared to be disordered in the structure of the ternary complex. Conformational flexibility seen in the reactive site loops of unbound TI-II suggests a mechanism by which the inhibitor can balance the need for tight binding with the need for broad inhibitory function.

This 13.5-kDa protein is a potent inhibitor of subtilisin (K i = 9 nm) that also possesses a remarkable dual specificity toward chymotrypsin (K i = 30 nm) and trypsin (K i = 80 nm) (1Plunkett G. Senear D.F. Zuroske G. Ryan C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Pot II inhibitors accumulate systemically in plant tissue as a result of wounding or pest attack and have been isolated from wounded tomato and tobacco leaves (1Plunkett G. Senear D.F. Zuroske G.

The systemic response to wounding or pest attacks originates from complex signaling cascades initiated by the binding of systemin (9Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) to a cell-surface receptor (10Scheer J.M. Ryan Jr., C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The wide distribution and inducible expression of Pot II PIs underline the fundamental importance of these proteins to pest defense in commercially important crops. To this effect, the inhibitory properties of PIs have already been exploited in the production of transgenic plants overexpressing PIs in an attempt to control destruction by pests (16Thornburg R.W.

Theor. Appl. Genet. 2000; 101: 519-526Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of inhibition in PIs is required to fully harness the potential benefits of these proteins to crop protection. TI-II and other Pot II PIs belong to the class of “standard mechanism, canonical” proteinaceous inhibitors of serine proteinases (21Laskowski M.J. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which consists of at least 18 nonhomologous families. The PIs from this large and diverse class bind to the active sites of proteinases in a substrate-like manner (22Laskowski M.J. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar) through “reactive site loops” (23Ozawa K. Laskowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3955-3961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (24Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar), where P1 is the residue N-terminal to the scissile bond and P1′ is the residue C-terminal to the scissile bond, residues P4 to P2′ of each inhibitor typically interact with binding pockets S4 to S2′ on the proteinase. The reactive site loop adopts a relatively extended conformation and forms a distorted antiparallel β-strand pair with residues near the active site of the proteinase (25Bolognesi M. Gatti G. Menegatti E. Guarni M. Marquart M. Papamokos E. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 839-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Similar to many other families in the standard, canonical mechanism class of PIs, the Pot II family has many members that consist of multiple inhibitory domains, each of which contains a reactive site loop. The crystal structure of the TI-II: (subtilisin)2 complex revealed that TI-II consists of two structurally related domains, each containing a reactive site loop capable of independently binding a proteinase molecule (26Barrette-Ng I.H.

Anderson M.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 203-213PubMed Google Scholar) sequence repeats with high sequence similarity to the sequence repeats in TI-II. The combination of multiple inhibitory domains within a single PI likely plays an important function, but interactions between the multiple inhibitory domains within a single PI remain poorly characterized. Crystallographic studies of multidomain Pot II inhibitors, starting with the structure of the TI-II:(subtilisin)2 complex, are just beginning to suggest the importance of multiple inhibitory domains within a single PI. A central paradox in understanding the mechanism of proteinase inhibitors is how these proteins can bind tightly to proteinases in a substrate-like manner without being rapidly hydrolyzed like a substrate. Many structural and biochemical studies (21Laskowski M.J. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) on a wide range of structurally diverse PIs and their cognate proteinases have revealed a variety of mechanisms allowing PIs to achieve their biologically important functions. These mechanisms include various strategies for stabilizing the reactive site loop using disulfide bridges, extensive hydrogen bonding networks, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts to prevent hydrolysis and to promote tighter binding by reducing the loss in entropy upon binding. In addition to the need for resistance to hydrolysis and tight binding, however, reactive site loops from broad-spectrum PIs must also retain sufficient conformational flexibility to allow the recognition by a variety of proteinase-active site clefts (21Laskowski M.J. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J.

To further extend the earlier x-ray crystallographic structure determination of a ternary complex consisting of TI-II bound to two molecules of subtilisin Carlsberg (26Barrette-Ng I.H. Ng K.K.-S. Cherney M.M. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24062-24071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the structure of unbound TI-II has now been determined to 2.15-Å resolution. Four copies of the unbound inhibitor are contained within the asymmetric unit of the crystalline unit cell, thereby providing a unique opportunity to examine the significant range of conformational flexibility present in the global structure of the inhibitor, as well as in the local structure of the reactive site loops. An analysis of the range of conformations sampled by the four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit provides substantial insight into the importance of conformational flexibility between domains as well as within reactive site loops. Purification and Crystallization—TI-II was prepared from transgenic tomato plants that overexpressed a prosystemin transgene, resulting in the synthesis and accumulation of high levels of TI-II in the leaves (∼1 mg/ml leaf juice). Leaves from 1000 young tomato plants were collected (∼800 g of leaf tissue) and blended with 1600 ml of a buffer containing 0.01 m sodium citrate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, and 0.7% sodium hydrosulfite, pH 4.3. The homogenate was expressed through eight layers of cheesecloth by hand squeezing. The debris retained in the cloth was resuspended in 400 ml of buffer, and the mixture was further expressed. The combined, expressed liquid was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins in the supernatant liquid were precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and stirring at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation as above. The pellet was solubilized in 600 ml of water, and the remaining debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting solution was placed in a flask and immersed in a boiling water bath with stirring until the temperature of the liquid was 70 °C. The contents of the flask were then cooled rapidly in an ice bath to room temperature, and the precipitated proteins were repelleted by centrifugation. The solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.01 m Tris, 0.10 m KCl buffer, pH 8.1. The retentate was passed through a 3 × 12-cm column containing chymotrypsin-Sepharose CL4B affinity resin (36Cuatrecasas P. Anfinsen C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 345-378Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar) that had been equilibrated with the buffer. The column was then washed with three bed volumes of buffer and then with 8 m urea, pH 3, to elute the inhibitor proteins that were bound to chymotrypsin. The eluate was dialyzed against several changes of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized and stored. The preparation yielded about 80 mg of dry material containing about 24 mg of TI-II and 14 mg of inhibitor I. TI-II protein was purified to homogeneity using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. A Vydac (Hesperia, CA) 218TP510 C18 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) was used with a 90-min gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. TI-II eluted as a single peak at 53 min. The yields of inhibitor from this step were nearly quantitative. TI-II protein obtained was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of a 1 mm solution of TI-II and 2 μl of 7% (w/v) PEG 10000 and 50 mm ammonium sulfate. Small crystals grew within 1–2 weeks. Macroseeding was used to produce crystals with typical dimensions of 0.2 × 0.1 × ∼0.05 mm. The crystals belonged to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 58.31 Å, b = 105.94 Å, c = 81.35 Å, α = 90°, β = 104.14°, and γ = 90°. The V m for four TI-II molecules (13,500 Da) per asymmetric unit is 2.26 Å3/Da. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals used for data collection were prepared by harvesting into a solution identical to the crystallization solution with the addition of 5% (w/v) PEG 400 and equilibrating overnight against a well solution containing the crystallization solution with the addition of 20% (w/v) PEG 400. Immediately before flash freezing in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K, the crystals were briefly transferred into a cryoprotectant solution identical to the crystallization solution, with the addition of 25% (w/v) PEG 400. Data were measured from a ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector using 0.97-Å wavelength radiation at beamline 9-2 (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory). Data were recorded as 180 1° oscillations at a crystal-to-detector distance of 250 mm and processed using the HKL suite of programs (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to amplitudes using TRUNCATE (38Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The solvent content of the unbound inhibitor crystals was calculated to be 59, 45, or 32% if three, four, or five copies of TI-II were present in the asymmetric unit, respectively. Molecular replacement searches were performed using BEAST (39Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The structure of TI-II from the TI-II:(subtilisin)2 complex (PDB code 1OYV), with all the side chains and temperature factors retained, was used as the search model for molecular replacement calculations. Cross-rotation functions calculated using data to a maximum resolution of 3.5 Å in BEAST (39Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) gave two solutions (log-likelihood-gain scores of 23.0 and 21.1). Each rotation function solution was used to calculate a translation function using data to a maximum resolution of 3.5 Å, each yielding one clear solution (log-likelihood-gain scores of 22.5 and 14.9). Using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), the two solutions were subjected to Patterson correlation refinement, and the relative orientation of the two solutions was determined using a translation search, followed by rigid body refinement (R-factor of 0.51). A third solution was identified using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) by carrying out Patterson correlation refinement and translation searches on other high-scoring solutions from the cross-rotation search. The three solutions were subjected to rigid body refinement, yielding an R-factor of 0.46. The fourth solution could not be identified using Patterson correlation refinement and translation searches. Instead, a non-crystallographic, 2-fold rotational symmetry element relating two of the three positioned molecules was identified and was applied to the third molecule to generate the fourth molecule in the asymmetric unit. After rigid body refinement of the four molecules, the R-factor was 0.42. The electron density map calculated using the molecular replacement solution revealed a good fit of the model to the core regions of the inhibitor. In addition, there was clear electron density for the interdomain residues 74–85 in all four copies of TI-II in the asymmetric unit. Because these residues were not modeled in the structure of TI-II in complex with subtilisin, they were placed by manual inspection using the molecular graphics program XFIT (41McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The N and C termini, and the loop encompassing residues 101–105, showed the greatest variation among the four copies. The model was subjected to iterative rounds of manual model building using XFIT (41McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refinement against a maximum-likelihood target using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Further refinement of the structure was performed using REFMAC v. 5.0.36 (42Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) with individual TLS parameters refined separately for Domain 1 and Domain 2. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used at any point during refinement, because of significant differences in conformation among different copies. Residues 1 and 117–123 are missing from all four copies of TI-II.

Open table in a new tab Global Structure of the Unbound Form of TI-II—The structure of unbound TI-II (Fig. 1) was determined by the molecular replacement technique to 2.15-Å resolution, using the coordinates of TI-II in complex with two molecules of subtilisin Carlsberg (26Barrette-Ng I.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24062-24071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1OYV) as the search model (refer to Table I for crystallographic parameters). There are four copies of TI-II (designated as A, B, C, and D) in the asymmetric unit, and the overall conformation of each copy is similar in most regions to that of TI-II from the complex (26Barrette-Ng I.H.

TI-II adopts an elongated shape with approximate overall dimensions of 50 × 25 × 15 Å; it consists of two structurally similar inhibitory domains (Domains I and II). Each inhibitory domain adopts the fold determined previously for the single-domain Pot II inhibitors (48Greenblatt H.M. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Mol.

Both domains also contain one turn of a 310 helix, comprising residues 30–32 in Domain II and residues 90–92 in Domain I. An inhibitory reactive site loop is found in each domain, and these loops are positioned at opposite ends of the elongated molecule (Fig. 1), thereby allowing a single inhibitor to bind to two proteinase molecules simultaneously. As first deduced from the structure of PCI-I in complex with SGPB and proven by the structure of TI-II in complex with subtilisin Carlsberg, the sequence repeats present in TI-II do not correspond to individual structural domains (26Barrette-Ng I.H.

J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 201-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Instead, Domain I consists of the first 15 residues and of residues 80–116, whereas Domain II consists of residues 18–73. Although both domains adopt the same fold, the structures of each domain differ in detail. The two most important structural differences between Domain I and Domain II are: (1Plunkett G. Senear D.F. Zuroske G. Ryan C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) the N terminus of the reactive site loop in Domain I lies at the N terminus of the protein, but in Domain II, this segment is connected by a loop to the last β-strand of the small β-sheet (corresponding to the C terminus of Domain I); and (2Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) the loop composed of residues 20–26 in Domain II is shortened by four residues in Domain I and includes the only cis-peptide bond in the structure (Tyr-83 to Pro-84). Domains I and II are linked together by two polypeptide segments consisting of residues 16–17 and 74–79. The linker consisting of residues 74–79, as well as several adjacent residues (residues 80–85), appeared to be disordered in the structure of TI-II bound to subtilisin, because electron density corresponding to this region could not be detected. In contrast, in all four copies of unbound TI-II, the entire region was well defined by unbiased electron density maps calculated before modeling the structure of this"

Lysyl oxidase in addition has tumor suppressor activity, and phenotypic reversion of transformed cell lines is accompanied by increased lysyl oxidase expression. The mechanism of low expression of lysyl oxidase in tumor cells is unknown. The present study investigates the hypothesis that autocrine growth factor pathways maintain low lysyl oxidase expression levels in c-H-ras-transformed fibroblasts (RS485 cell line). Autocrine pathways were blocked with suramin, a general inhibitor of growth factor receptor binding, and resulted in more than a 10-fold increase in lysyl oxidase expression and proenzyme production. This regulation was found to be reversible and occurred at the transcriptional level determined using lysyl oxidase promoter/reporter gene assays. Function blocking anti-fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) antibody enhanced lysyl oxidase expression in the absence of suramin. Finally, the addition of FGF-2 to suramin-treated cells completely reversed suramin stimulation of lysyl oxidase mRNA levels. Data support that an FGF-2 autocrine pathway inhibits lysyl oxidase transcription in the tumorigenic-transformed RS485 cell line.

Lysyl oxidase catalyzes the final step of collagen and elastin cross-linking by oxidative deamination of the ϵ-amino group of hydroxylysine and lysine residues (1Kagan H.M. Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The resulting peptidyl aldehyde products undergo spontaneous condensations with unmodified lysine residues or with other peptidyl aldehyde residues to generate covalent cross-linkages required for the biosynthesis of mature functional extracellular matrices. Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a 50-kDa proenzyme, secreted into the extracellular environment, and then processed by proteolytic cleavage, resulting in a functional 30-kDa enzyme and an 18-kDa propeptide. Evidence supports that 30-kDa lysyl oxidase is active and that the 50-kDa proenzyme is enzymatically inactive (2Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol.

In particular, lysyl oxidase expression is diminished in cell lines transformed with ras or ras-dependent oncogenes. NIH3T3 cells transformed by overexpression of c-H-ras (RS485 cells) are tumorigenic and have low levels of lysyl oxidase expression (14Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M.

Long term treatment of RS485 cells with interferon-α/β resulted in the isolation of stable phenotypic revertant cell lines (19Samid D. Flessate D.M. Friedman R.M. Mol. Cell.

As noted above lysyl oxidase is consistently down-regulated in cancer cells and in transformed cell lines, and studies support that lysyl oxidase transcription is diminished in transformed cells (17Hamalainen E.R.

It is important to realize, however, that the mechanisms responsible for diminished lysyl oxidase transcription in transformed cells are not well understood. Epigenetic regulation of methylation of the lysyl oxidase promoter plays a role (21Contente S. Kenyon K. Sriraman P. Subramanyan S. Friedman R.M. Mol. Cell.

In the present study, we investigate the hypothesis that autocrine growth factor pathways diminish lysyl oxidase transcription in tumor cells. Autocrine growth factor pathways occur in certain tumors and in tumor cell lines and can contribute to the transformed phenotype and tumorigenicity. For example, malignancy is maintained by autocrine pathways that, respectively, include elevated production and responsiveness in different tissues to FGF-2, 1The abbreviation used is: FGF, fibroblast growth factor.1The abbreviation used is: FGF, fibroblast growth factor. epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor (24Fukumoto M.

Our working hypothesis is that autocrine growth factor pathways that include FGF-2 down-regulate lysyl oxidase and are responsible for the low levels of lysyl oxidase expression observed in the c-H-ras-transformed RS485 cell line. Suramin is a polysulfonated naphthylurea and was initially used in the treatment of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis (34Sullivan K.A. Kim B. Buzdon M. Feldman E.L. Brain Res. 1997; 744: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Its anticancer activity was later identified, and suramin has been introduced into clinical trials for adrenal, lung, and prostate cancer (35La Rocca R.V. Stein C.A. Danesi R. Jamis-Dow C.A.

Moreover, suramin is active against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (40Dhar S. Gullbo J. Csoka K. Eriksson E. Nilsson K. Nickel P. Larsson R. Nygren P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Suramin inhibits the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, and this mechanism is believed to primarily contribute to its therapeutic effects (24Fukumoto M. Takahashi J.A. Murai N. Ueba T. Kono K. Nakatsu S. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 4059-4065PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sullivan K.A. Kim B. Buzdon M. Feldman E.L.

Results indicate that suramin increases lysyl oxidase expression more than 10-fold in RS485 cells and that regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. Treatment of RS485 cells with a function blocking FGF-2 antibody in the absence of suramin increases lysyl oxidase mRNA expression. Exogenously added FGF-2 prevented suramin stimulation of lysyl oxidase expression. Data taken together support the hypothesis that an autocrine FGF-2 pathway contributes to lysyl oxidase down-regulation in RS485 cells. Down-regulation of lysyl oxidase via autocrine growth factor pathways is likely to be an important contributing mechanism in tumorigenesis. In addition, normalization of lysyl oxidase expression may be a beneficial outcome of cancer therapeutic drugs, whose mechanism is to block autocrine growth factor pathways. Chemicals—Suramin was either provided by the Division of Cancer Treatment Diagnosis and Centers, National Cancer Institute, and Parke-Davis or was purchased from Sigma. Anti-FGF-2-neutralizing antibody clone bFM-1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA. FGF-2 was purchased from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available and were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—RS485 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, and cultures were refed every 2 days. For experiments in which the effects of suramin were determined, cells in logarithmic growth phase were dissociated with trypsin/EDTA and inoculated at 250,000 cells/plate. After 24 h, media were then changed to contain up to 150 μm suramin and cultured as required for the experimental design. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from RS485 cells was isolated using RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Ten μg samples of denatured RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 18% formaldehyde. Gels were transferred in 10× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) by capillary blotting overnight to Gene Screen (DuPont) nylon membranes (15Krzyzosiak W.J. Shindo-Okada N.

Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar) and was hybridized at 42 °C as previously described (27Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X. Takala T.E. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For normalization and as a measure of constant loading of gels, blots were stripped and rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S rRNA probe (45Hillis D.M. Dixon M.T. Q. Rev. Biol. 1991; 66: 411-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were assessed and normalized by densitometric scanning using the Versa Doc Model 3000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Pulse Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—RS485 cells were grown in 100-mm plates with 0 or 150 μm suramin as described above. At visual confluence, cultures were refed and incubated for 20 min with 7 ml/plate of serum-free and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% nonessential amino acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin with or without suramin (150 μm). Cultures were then placed in fresh media with or without suramin (150 μm) supplemented with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 5 h, media were harvested and prepared for immunoprecipitation (2Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constant counts/min were used for immunoprecipitation with lysyl oxidase anti-serum and with preimmune serum as control. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lysyl Oxidase Enzyme Activity—RS485 cells cultured with or without 150 μm suramin were grown as described above. At visual confluence, cells were refed with serum-free, phenol red-free media and further cultured in the presence or absence of suramin. After 24 h, the media were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Lysyl oxidase activity was determined using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled fluorescent assay method based on the oxidation of Amplex Red and using 1,5-diaminopentane as the substrate for lysyl oxidase (46Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Solutions were prepared in a final volume of 2 ml containing 1.2 m urea, 0.05 m sodium borate, pH 8.2, 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, 10 μm Amplex Red, 10 mm 1,5-diaminopentane, and 500–1000 μl of media. A parallel set of solutions was prepared with 500 μm β-aminopropionitrile to completely inhibit the activity of lysyl oxidase. After incubation of all the samples at 37 °C for 30 min, the difference in fluorescence intensity was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 563 nm and an emission wavelength of 587 nm. The rate of the production of hydrogen peroxide was calculated by comparison of fluorescence changes to that of a standard curve prepared using hydrogen peroxide. The units of enzyme activity are defined as the nmol of hydrogen peroxide produced/min above the β-aminopropionitrile controls. Determinations of DNA to normalize enzyme activity measurements were performed from each cell layer (47Vytasek R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Subconfluent RS485 cells were co-transfected with pSV2β-gal and with firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs at a mass ratio of 1:19. The luciferase constructs were (a) the pGL2 basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains no promoter driving the luciferase gene, (b) the pGL2 control plasmid, which contains luciferase driven by the SV40 early promoter, and (c) the lysyl oxidase promoter construct (pPL1), which contains luciferase driven by the mouse lysyl oxidase promoter (nucleotides –2079 to +435) cloned into the KpnI and BglII sites of pGL2 basic (22Reynaud C. Gleyzal C. Jourdan-Le Saux C. Sommer P. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-Grand). 1999; 45: 1237-1247PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (48Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were treated with 0 or 150 μm suramin and cultured for an additional 24 h. Cells were then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured immediately after addition of the substrate (luciferase assay system; Promega) using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). β-Galactosidase activity in the lysate was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (β-galactosidase enzyme assay system; Promega), and the values were used to normalize the efficiency of transfection. Dose-dependent Regulation of Lysyl Oxidase by Suramin— RS485 cells were plated as described under “Methods and Materials.” After 24 h, the sub-confluent cultures were then treated continuously with different concentrations of suramin up to 150 μm, with media changes every 2 days. At visual confluence (after 2–5 days in culture), total RNA was then isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, a dose-dependent up-regulation in the steady state lysyl oxidase mRNA level was found. At least a 10-fold increase was observed in lysyl oxidase mRNA levels in cells treated with 150 μm suramin. Reversibility of the Regulation of Lysyl Oxidase—If suramin blocks autocrine growth factor pathways that control lysyl oxidase expression, then lysyl oxidase regulation by suramin should be reversible. Thus, the reversibility of suramin-induced up-regulation of lysyl oxidase mRNA levels was examined. RS485 cells were treated with suramin (0–150 μm) and cultured for 2 days. The medium was then replaced with suramin-free medium for different time intervals (36 and 48 h). RNA was isolated from cells before and after removal of suramin and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Fig. 2 shows that lysyl oxidase mRNA levels increase with suramin treatment as expected (lanes 1–4). After removal of suramin, lysyl oxidase mRNA levels were decreased at both time points (lanes 5–10). Maintenance of RS485 cells in the continuous presence of suramin for the entire experimental period results in persistent high elevation of lysyl oxidase mRNA levels (lanes 11–12). Thus, data support that suramin-stimulated lysyl oxidase expression is reversible. This is consistent with the notion that suramin increases lysyl oxidase mRNA levels by reversibly inhibiting autocrine growth factor pathways. Lysyl Oxidase Biosynthesis—We next investigated whether increased lysyl oxidase protein production and processing accompanies the suramin stimulation of RS485 cells. Cells were treated with (control) or 150 μm suramin as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the synthesis of lysyl oxidase protein was determined by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine for 5 h followed by immunoprecipitation of secreted and radiolabeled lysyl oxidase from media. These conditions of pulse labeling allow the detection of all forms of lysyl oxidase (2Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 3 shows the increased levels of pro-lysyl oxidase enzyme (47–50 kDa) in media samples from suramin-treated cells (lane 4), indicating that suramin increased the biosynthesis and secretion of pro-lysyl oxidase. Only a small proportion of immunoprecipitated lysyl oxidase was fully processed (∼30 kDa) lysyl oxidase enzyme. No immunoprecipitated lysyl oxidase protein bands could be detected or identified from control RS485 cells not treated with suramin (lane 1), as expected due to the very low expression of lysyl oxidase in these tumor cells. Effect of Suramin on Active Lysyl Oxidase Production—To determine whether lysyl oxidase enzyme activity increased as a result of suramin treatment, RS485 cells were first treated in complete medium in the presence or the absence of 150 μm suramin as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then cultured for an additional 24 h in serum-free medium with or without suramin. Accumulated enzyme activity was then measured in these media samples and was normalized to the amount of DNA in the cell layer. As shown in Table I, suramin increased lysyl oxidase activity in RS485 cell media by a factor of 2.2. This relatively small increase in enzyme activity in suramin-treated RS485 cells compared with mRNA increases is consistent with our finding of predominant production of unprocessed 50-kDa pro-lysyl oxidase summarized in Fig. 3 and reflects deficient proenzyme processing to active enzyme in suramin-treated cells. Note that phenotypically normal NIH3T3 cells constitutively express more than 10-fold higher levels of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity than RS485 cells (Table I), consistent with previous data (9Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Table ILysyl oxidase activity in cell culture mediaCell typeLO activity (H2O2 nmol/min/mg of DNA)RS48500.12 ± 0.01RS485 with 150 μm suramin0.26 ± 0.04NIH3T31.90 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab Time-dependent Up-regulation of Lysyl Oxidase by Suramin—To investigate mechanisms of regulation of lysyl oxidase by suramin, we next determined the time-dependent up-regulation of steady state levels of lysyl oxidase mRNA by suramin. RS485 cells were treated with 0 or 150 μm suramin. Total RNA was isolated at different time intervals and was then subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, suramin increased the steady state lysyl oxidase mRNA levels within 4 h of treatment, increasing to a maximum level at 16–20 h. Lysyl Oxidase Promoter Activity in Luciferase Reporter Constructs—Because of the rapid and highly significant up-regulation of lysyl oxidase mRNA levels by suramin, we suspected that observed regulation could be at the transcriptional level. Assay of transcriptional activity was accomplished using a murine lysyl oxidase promoter reporter construct. Cells were transfected with lysyl oxidase promoter-driven luciferase gene construct (pPL1) that contained 2 kbp of lysyl oxidase promoter. Control plasmids were the SV40 promotor-driven luciferase gene construct (pGL2 control) and pGL2 basic containing no promoter. Each luciferase construct was co-transfected with pSVβ-gal to allow for normalization. Cells were then treated with 0 or 150 μm suramin for 24 h, and the luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. The 24-h time point was chosen based on the time study (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the values of luciferase activity normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Suramin increased the luciferase activity of RS485 cells transfected with pPL1 by 2–4-fold in four different experiments (p < 0.01). By contrast and as expected, luciferase activity in cells transfected with pGL2 control was unaffected by suramin (control cells, 264.6 ± 25.3 luciferase units/milliunits of β galactosidase activity; suramin-treated cells, 268.2 ± 37.0 luciferase units/milliunits of β-galactosidase activity). There was essentially no luciferase activity in control and suramin-treated cells transfected with the pGL2 basic vector, as predicted (Fig. 5). Effects of Function-blocking FGF-2 Antibody—To investigate the presence and role of autocrine growth factor pathways in RS485 cells in lysyl oxidase regulation, we next determined the effect of function blocking FGF-2 antibody on lysyl oxidase expression in RS485 cells. Our working hypothesis is that RS485 cells produce and respond to FGF-2, resulting in low lysyl oxidase expression. If true, then interference of this autocrine growth factor pathway with suramin or, alternatively, w"

We show here that transcription of the gene encoding the θ subunit of mouse CCT, Cctq, is regulated by the ternary complex factors (TCFs), Elk-1, Sap-1a, and Net (Sap-2). Reporter gene assay using HeLa cells indicated that the Cctq gene promoter contains a cis-acting element of the CCGGAAGT sequence (CQE1) at –36 bp.

The CQE1-dependent transcriptional activity in HeLa cells was virtually abolished by overexpression of the DNA binding domains of TCFs. Overexpression of full-length TCFs with Ras indicated that exogenous TCFs can regulate the CQE1-dependent transcription in a Ras-dependent manner. PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK, significantly repressed the CQE1-dependent transcription. However, no serum response factor was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the CQE1 element.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Double torus-like structure of CCT with 8-fold symmetry was revealed by electron microscopy (12Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G.

Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and CCT is composed of eight different subunits of ∼60 kDa each: α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ–1, η, and θ (13Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These subunits are encoded by independent genes (15Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and share 30% identity at the amino acid sequence level (1Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We determined entire nucleotide sequences of all of the genes encoding CCT subunits and showed that many of them exhibit strong transcriptional activity comparable with the combination of SV40 promoter and enhancer (15Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The expression levels of CCT subunits are strongly correlated with growth rate and markedly up-regulated at G1/S transition through early S phase in cultured cells (16Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37070-37078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CCT subunits are significantly increased in tumor tissues, and the expression levels of CCT subunits are highly correlated with that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (17Yokota S. Yamamoto Y. Shimizu K. Momoi H. Kamikawa T. Yamaoka Y. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of different subunits are basically similar but distinct in synthesis and degradation rates, leading to differential turnover (18Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4664-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although CCT is up-regulated during recovery from chemical stress (19Yokota S.I. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and heat shock transcription factors may mediate the up-regulation (20Kubota H. Matsumoto S. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this stress response is unrelated to cell growth. Recently, we found that transcription of the gene encoding the α subunit of CCT, Ccta, is regulated by selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription-activating factor family transcription factors ZNF143 and ZNF76 (21Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The level of ZNF143 is regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (22Adachi K. Tanaka T. Saito H. Oka T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although these results suggested that a transcriptional control mechanism related to cell growth plays a role in CCT subunit regulation, little is known about common transcriptional mechanisms controlling the expression of different CCT subunits. Elk-1 (Ets-like transcription factor), Sap-1a (SRF accessory protein), and Net (new Ets transcription factor; also called Sap-2) comprise the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily of the Ets domain transcription factors (23Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem.

Ets family proteins specifically recognize DNA sequences containing the core trinucleotide GGA using a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (23Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv.

The core sequence is essential for Ets factor binding, and its flanking sequences are important for determining the different sequence specificity of these proteins. Elk-1, Sap-1a, or Net forms ternary complexes with serum response factor (SRF) on the serum response elements (SREs) of immediate early gene promoters, including c-fos (27Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and egr-1 (28Clarkson R.W. Shang C.A. Levitt L.K. Howard T. Waters M.J. Mol.

These three TCF subfamily proteins share three conserved domains: the DNA-binding domain localized at the amino terminus (30Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the SRF-binding domain in the middle portion (31Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional activation domain whose activity is stimulated by phosphorylation by MAPK at the carboxyl terminus (32Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 33Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R.

Although the sequence specificity and transcriptional activity of Elk-1 and Sap-1a are similar each other, Net differs from these proteins by containing two additional domains, the Net-inhibitory domain (35Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the CtBP interaction domain of Net (36Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which strongly inhibit the transcription of target genes. Although the TCF subfamily proteins alone show no significant binding to SREs (33Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the Drosophila E74 gene promoter contains a DNA element recognized by these factors independently of SRF (37Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 65-70PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about SRF-independent target sequence of Elk-1, Sap-1a, or Net in mammalian genes. Here, we examined transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the mouse CCT θ subunit, Cctq, and found that the Cctq gene promoter contains a cis-acting element (CQE1) recognized by Elk-1, Sap-1a, and Net independently of SRF. By overexpression of the TCF subfamily proteins with Ras, CQE1-dependent transcriptional activity was regulated in response to Ras activity. CQE1-dependent transcriptional activity of the Cctq gene, as well as activity of a reporter construct containing the Ccta gene promoter, was significantly affected by a MAPK inhibitor. We discuss the role of TCF subfamily proteins in Cctq gene transcription and possible common effects of the Ras/MAPK pathway on the growth-dependent expression of different CCT subunit genes.

Antibodies against human Elk-1 (I-20), Sap-1a (C-20), Net (C-20), SRF (G-20), and phosphorylated Elk-1 (B-4) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Reporter and Effector Constructs—The reporter construct containing the 5′-flanking region and first intron of the mouse Cctq gene in the firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3-basic (pCQL) was described previously (15Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The first intron of pCQL was removed by a PCR-mediated subcloning method using an intronless sequence as a primer. The resulting construct (pCQL-pro) was deleted unidirectionally from 5′ upstream of the Cctq promoter by a modified method of Henikoff (39Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 3: 351-359Crossref Scopus (2828) Google Scholar) using mung bean nuclease instead of S1 nuclease (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, some deletion constructs were produced by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and insertions were also introduced into the reporter constructs by PCR. Tandem repeats of cis-acting DNA elements were produced by cloning self-ligated synthetic oligonucleotides. A firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (–80 to +38) was constructed by cloning a PCR-amplified DNA fragment into the pGL3-basic vector (named ptk-80Luc). Human Elk-1 (40Rao V.N. Huebner K. Isobe M. ar-Rushdi A. Croce C.M. Reddy E.S. Science. 1989; 244: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Sap-1a (27Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and Net (Sap-2) (33Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) cDNAs were amplified from human cDNA libraries (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using previously published sequences as primers and cloned into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (41Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding the DNA binding domains of Elk-1-(1–95), Sap-1a-(1–95), and Net-(1–95) were also subcloned into pCAGGS using PCR-based methods. Nucleotide sequences of the reporter and effector constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Ras expression vectors pCMV-Ras, pCMV-RasV12, and pCMV-RasN17 (Clontech) and the internal control sea pansy expression vector pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI) were purchased from the sources shown. Supercoiled plasmid DNA prepared by ultracentrifugation in CsCl solution was used for transfection. Cell Culture and Reporter Gene Assay—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO). Cells (3.0 × 105) were plated in 35-mm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then transfected with a total of 1.2 μg of reporter, effector, and internal control plasmid DNA using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of exposure to the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% serum for 19 h. Luciferase activities of transfected cells were determined using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the activity of firefly luciferase was normalized against that of the sea pansy enzyme. Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins— The cDNA fragments encoding DNA binding domains of human Elk-1, Sap-1a, or Net were subcloned into the GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences). Escherichia coli carrying each plasmid were cultured overnight at 20 °C. Bacteria were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 mm (p-amidinophenyl-)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and the GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified proteins were stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extract was prepared according to Sadowski and Gilman (42Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared by labeling double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides with [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment. HeLa cell nuclear extract (5 μg) or purified GST fusion proteins (20 ng) were preincubated for 10 min on ice in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, and labeled probes (0.1 ng) were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes of probe DNA and binding proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) in 0.25× TBE buffer at 150 V and 4 °C for 2.25 h and visualized using a STORM 820 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Cis-acting Elements Up-regulating Cctq Gene Transcription—Previously, we reported a firefly luciferase reporter gene construct driven by the mouse Cctq gene promoter/enhancer (pCQL) (15Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This contains a DNA fragment from 2027 bp upstream of the transcription start point to the second exon of Cctq and showed strong transcriptional activity: 1.6-fold a combination of the SV40 promoter and enhancer in HeLa cells. By removing the first intron, the reporter construct containing the 2027-bp promoter of Cctq (pCQL-pro) (Fig. 1A, top) was produced. To search for cis-acting elements in the Cctq promoter, the 2027-bp promoter region of pCQL-pro was unidirectionally deleted from the 5′-end (Fig. 1A). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with these constructs, and luciferase activities of cell extracts were determined. In the segment extending from –2027 to –176, activities down-regulating Cctq transcription were detected. Trans-acting factors repressing Cctq promoter activity may bind this region. No significant effect on Cctq transcription was observed for the region between –176 and –85. Deletion from –85 to –40 slightly reduced transcriptional activity, suggesting a contribution of weakly positive cis-acting elements, including a possible Sp1-binding site found in this region (Fig. 1C). Deletion from –40 to –19 remarkably reduced the activity to 30%, indicating the existence of strong cis-acting elements in this region. Since transcriptional activity was almost completely abolished by deleting the construct from –19 to –3, this region is probably important for the initiation of transcription. To analyze the strong cis-acting activity immediately downstream of –40 bp in more detail, double point mutations were introduced into the reporter gene construct containing the Cctq promoter up to –40 bp, and the luciferase activities of these constructs were analyzed using HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Mutations on the residues from –36 to –29 bp reduced the activity by 40–60% relative to wild type, whereas mutations on residues from –40 to –37 bp or –28 to –25 bp exhibited little effect. These results indicate that the eight residues from –36 to –29 bp make a significant contribution to Cctq transcription and suggest that a trans-acting factor recognizes the 8-bp-long element CCGGAAGT. We named this element CQE1 (for Cctq gene transcription-activating element 1). Results very similar to Fig. 1, A and B, were obtained using a distinct cell line, mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 (data not shown), implying that this element is recognized by transcription factors common to many cell types. Computational Search for CQE1-binding Proteins—We searched for possible trans-acting factors recognizing the CQE1 sequences by computer programs, and the results indicated that the CQE1 sequence is highly homologous to the binding consensus sequence of the human Ets domain transcription factor Elk-1, a member of TCF subfamily (Fig. 2B). Of the 11-bp Elk-1 binding consensus determined by PCR-mediated affinity selection of binding DNAs (30Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), 10 residues match the CQE1 sequence, and only one substitution (A to G) occurs at the 5′-end of the consensus. This 5′-end substitution (A to G) was also found in the affinity selection (30Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that contact at the 5′-end residue may be weaker than that of other residues in the consensus. Consistent with this view, mutation at this site had no significant effect in our reporter gene assay at this site (Fig. 1B). Since another TCF subfamily transcription factor, Sap-1a (27Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), shows characteristics very similar to Elk-1 (33Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 43Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), we also compared its binding consensus sequence (30Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with CQE1. The 9-bp Sap-1a binding consensus exhibited perfect match with CQE1. In addition, a third member of TCF subfamily, Net (44Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), has been identified. Net differs from Elk-1 and Sap-1a in its transcriptional suppressor activity (35Maira S.M. Wurtz J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Although the binding of all three TCF subfamily proteins to the known mammalian target sequence in the c-fos promoter is SRF-dependent (33Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a Drosophila gene, E74, is known to contain a DNA element with an Ets-binding motif (45Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Cell. 1990; 63: 47-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (E74-EBS in Fig. 2B) specifically recognized by human Elk-1 and/or Sap-1a in the absence of SRF both in vitro (37Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 65-70PubMed Google Scholar, 46Shore P. Bisset L. Lakey J. Waltho J.P. Virden R. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5805-5811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in vivo (32Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 34Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 43Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore compared the sequence of E74-EBS with CQE1 and found that these sequences are nearly identical at the Elk-1/Sap-1a binding region (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that CQE1 is a sequence recognized by the TCF subfamily proteins in the absence of SRF. Sequence-specific Recognition of CQE1 by HeLa Cell Nuclear Factors—To characterize the DNA binding activities of transcription factors acting on CQE1 in HeLa cells, HeLa cell nuclear extract was analyzed by EMSA using synthetic oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 3). The CQE1 probe gave two bands: a broad band with a strong signal (band I) and a thin band with a much weaker signal (band II). Although the binding of labeled CQE1 for the two shift bands was strongly competed by excess unlabeled CQE1 with wild-type sequence, a mutant CQE1 carrying nucleotide substitutions in the GGAA motif, QDM4 (see Fig. 1B), did not compete even at a 300-fold excess, consistent with the results of the reporter assay (Fig. 1B). A mutation in the region 3′ to the GGAA motif, QDM6, also significantly weakened the ability of competition. The slightly weaker competition of QDM4 than QDM6 is also consistent with the reduced activity of reporter in vivo. The recognition by CQE1-binding factor is likely to be more strict for the GGAA motif than for surrounding sequences, in agreement with common characteristics of Ets family transcription factors. These results indicate that the factors giving bands I and II specifically recognize the CQE1 sequence and that these factors may correspond to the same trans-acting factors postulated by the results of reporter gene assay. Since CQE1 shows a strong resemblance to the SRF-independent Elk-1 binding sequence found in the Drosophila E74 gene, E74-EBS (see Fig. 2B), we tested whether the CQE1-binding factors recognize E74-EBS by competition experiments. E74-EBS strongly competed with the CQE1 probe for binding (Fig. 3B), indicating that the factors giving bands I and II recognize both CQE1 and E74-EBS. Results similar to Fig. 3B were obtained using E74-EBS as a labeled probe, and the mobility of bands I and II was the same as that of CQE1 probe (Fig. 3C). Excess unlabeled CQE1 competed strongly with E74-EBS for band I but relatively weakly for band II, suggesting that binding of the protein giving band II is slightly stronger for E74-EBS than for CQE1. These results indicate that binding factors are common between E74-EBS and CQE1 for bands I and II and support the idea that the factors recognizing CQE1 belong to the TCF subfamily because the Drosophila E74-EBS sequence was previously shown to be recognized by Elk-1 and Sap-1a in mammalian cells (32Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 34Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 43Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar). The Major HeLa Cell Nuclear Factors Recognizing CQE1 Are Elk-1 and Sap-1a—To determine whether the CQE1-binding factors identified in EMSA are TCF subfamily proteins, we performed supershift analysis using antibodies against Elk-1, Sap-1a, and Net. With the antibodies against Elk-1 or Sap-1a, CQE1-bound proteins of band I were supershifted to more slowly migrating bands. The shift pattern indicated that the broad band I was doublet of Elk-1 and Sap-1a; Elk-1 migrated slightly more slowly than Sap-1a (Fig. 4A). The slightly slower mobility of Elk-1 relative to Sap-1a in EMSA is consistent with previous observations using E74 probe (34Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Using a mixture of anti-Elk-1 and anti-Sap-1a antibodies, almost all proteins consisting of band I were supershifted, confirming that band I is a doublet of Elk-1 and Sap-1a. Since Elk-1 is known to be regulated by the phosphorylation of its transactivation domain, we examined whether CQE1-bound Elk-1 was phosphorylated, using a monoclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Elk-1 transactivation domain. All proteins in band I were supershifted with this antibody. Since the amino acid sequence of the phosphorylated Elk-1 synthetic polypeptide used for antibody production shows significant identity to that of Sap-1a, the antibody against phosphorylated Elk-1 probably recognized phospho"
https://openalex.org/W1995446147,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cet1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pct1 are the essential RNA triphosphatase components of the mRNA capping apparatus of budding and fission yeast, respectively. Cet1 and Pct1 share a baroque active site architecture and a homodimeric quaternary structure. The active site is located within a topologically closed hydrophilic β-barrel (the triphosphate tunnel) that rests on a globular core domain (the pedestal) composed of elements from both protomers of the homodimer. Earlier studies of the effects of alanine cluster mutations at the crystallographic dimer interface of Cet1 suggested that homodimerization is important for triphosphatase function in vivo, albeit not for catalysis. Here, we studied the effects of 14 single-alanine mutations on Cet1 activity and thereby pinpointed Asp280 as a critical side chain required for dimer formation. We find that disruption of the dimer interface is lethal in vivo and renders Cet1 activity thermolabile at physiological temperatures in vitro. In addition, we identify individual residues within the pedestal domain (Ile470, Leu519, Ile520, Phe523, Leu524, and Ile530) that stabilize Cet1 in vivo and in vitro. In the case of Pct1, we show that dimerization depends on the peptide segment 41VPKIEMNFLN50 located immediately prior to the start of the Pct1 catalytic domain. Deletion of this peptide converts Pct1 into a catalytically active monomer that is defective in vivo in S. pombe and hypersensitive to thermal inactivation in vitro. Our findings suggest an explanation for the conservation of quaternary structure in fungal RNA triphosphatases, whereby the delicate tunnel architecture of the active site is stabilized by the homodimeric pedestal domain.

RNA triphosphatase catalyzes the first step in mRNA cap formation, the cleavage of the β-γ phosphoanhydride bond of 5′-triphosphate RNA to yield a diphosphate end. In the second step of the pathway, the RNA diphosphate is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase to yield GpppRNA (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Although the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe also encodes separate triphosphatase (Pct1; 303 aa) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1; 402 aa) enzymes, they do not interact with each other (6Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S.

The Cet1-Ceg1 interaction stabilizes the intrinsically labile guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 against thermal inactivation at physiological temperatures (9Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the physical tethering of Cet1 to Ceg1 facilitates recruitment of the triphosphatase to the RNA polymerase II elongation complex, via Ceg1 binding to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (10McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 11Cho E. Takagi T.

Cet1 by itself does not interact with the CTD. In contrast, the S. pombe guanylyltransferase Pce1 is inherently thermostable, and its stability is unaffected by the presence of the triphosphatase Pct1 (9Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Also, S. pombe employs a distinctive strategy of targeting capping to polymerase II transcripts, whereby the Pct1 and Pce1 enzymes bind independently to the phosphorylated CTD (8Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the fission yeast has elided on both counts the need for a triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase complex. It is therefore not surprising that Pct1 has no counterpart of the surface domain of Cet1 that mediates binding to the guanylyltransferase (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the fungal triphosphatase components display species-specific differences in their protein-protein interactions, they are nonetheless conserved with respect to their active site architecture, catalytic mechanism, and quaternary structure. The yeast triphosphatases belong to a family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that embraces the RNA triphosphatase components of the capping enzymes of unicellular eukaryotes and certain DNA viruses (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The family is defined by the presence of two conserved glutamate-containing motifs (β1 and β11 in Fig. 1) and the signature property of hydrolyzing NTPs to NDPs in the presence of manganese or cobalt (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 revealed that the enzyme is a homodimer with active sites located within parallel topologically closed tunnels composed of eight β strands (16Lima C. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The “triphosphate tunnel” architecture is supported by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions within the cavity, most of which are required for catalytic activity (17Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,18Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tunnel floor rests on a globular “pedestal” domain. Amino acid sequence comparisons and mutational analyses of the RNA triphosphatases from other fungi (e.g. Candida albicans and S. pombe), microsporidia, protozoa, and Chlorella virus underscore the conservation of the β strands that comprise the triphosphate tunnel (15Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the C. albicans and S. pombe RNA triphosphatases indicate that their active sites and catalytic mechanism adhere closely to that of Cet1 (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pei Y. Lehman K. Tian L. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae and S. pombe RNA triphosphatases are both homodimers (4Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Available evidence indicates that homodimer formation is essential for Cet1 function in vivo but not for catalytic activity. Deletion analysis showed that the C-terminal domain Cet1(276–549) has a monomeric quaternary structure and retains activity in vitro (4Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the monomeric domain by itself cannot support yeast cell growth, even when it is overexpressed at high gene dosage under the control of a strong promoter. Interpretation of the deletion data is complicated by the fact that an N-terminal truncation to position 275 also removes the guanylyltransferase-binding site 247WAQKW251, which is located on the protein surface (4Lehman K.

The in vivo function of Cet1(276–549) is restored when the monomeric triphosphatase is fused to either S. pombe guanylyltransferase (Pce1) or the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme (4Lehman K.

Also, because the S. pombe and mammalian guanylyltransferases are thermostable (unlike Ceg1), the chimeric capping enzymes bypass the need for the Ceg1-stabilization function of the 247WAQKW251 peptide of Cet1 (9Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To focus specifically on the role of homodimerization in Cet1 function in vivo, we previously performed an alanine cluster mutational analysis guided by the Cet1 crystal structure (24Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Double-alanine mutations at vicinal amino acids were introduced into the biologically active protein Cet1(201–549), which contains both the guanylyltransferase-binding and catalytic domains. A total of 42 residues were changed to alanine, 24 of which were constituents of the crystallographic dimer interface. Four of the Ala cluster alleles were lethal in vivo. Three other Ala cluster mutants displayed temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defects, even when the mutant alleles were present in high copy under the control of a strong promoter. Several of the lethal and ts mutations were suppressed by fusion of the Cet1-Ala/Ala protein to the mammalian guanylyltransferase. Moreover, two of the lethal mutant proteins were characterized in vitro and found to be catalytically active monomers (24Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These results indicated that homodimerization of the budding yeast RNA triphosphatase is critical in vivo when Cet1 functions in concert with the endogenous yeast guanylyltransferase. It remains unclear why homodimerization of yeast RNA triphosphatase is important in vivo. If the dimer is critical for the functional interactions of S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase, then it is not obvious why a homodimeric quaternary structure for RNA triphosphatase would be conserved in the fission yeast S. pombe, where the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components do not interact physically. On the other hand, homodimerization may confer added value to the triphosphatase in other ways that are independent of the guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus. Here we conduct a series of experiments to define the individual essential constituents of the Cet1 homodimer interface and probe the role of quaternary structure in triphosphatase function in vivo and in vitro. Guided by the initial results of the Ala cluster mutagenesis, we tested the effects of 14 single-alanine mutations on Cet1 activity in vivo and thereby pinpointed Asp280 as a critical side chain required for dimer formation. We find that disruption of the dimer interface renders Cet1 thermolabile in vitro. We engineered a catalytically active monomeric version of S. pombe Pct1 and show that it is thermolabile in vitro. Introduction of the monomeric triphosphatase into a S. pombe pct1Δ strain confers a dosage-suppressible lethal phenotype in vivo. We propose a model whereby homodimerization of the globular pedestal domain is critical to stabilize the delicate active site tunnel architecture of the fungal RNA triphosphatases. Mutagenesis of S. cerevisiae RNA Triphosphatase—Alanine mutations were introduced into the CET1(201–549) gene by PCR (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were inserted into the yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid pCET1–5′3′, where expression of the inserted gene is under the control of the natural CET1 promoter (26Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. The in vivo activity of the mutated CET1 alleles was tested by plasmid shuffle. Yeast strain YBS20 (trp1 ura3 leu2 cet1::LEU2 p360-Cet1[CEN URA3 CET1]) was transformed with TRP1 plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant alleles of CET1(201–549). Trp+ isolates were selected and then streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Growth was scored after 7 days of incubation at 18°, 25°, 30°, and 37 °C. Lethal mutants were those that failed to form colonies on 5-FOA at any temperature. Individual colonies of the viable CET1 mutants were picked from the FOA plate at permissive temperature and patched to YPD agar. Two isolates of each mutant were tested for growth on YPD agar at 18°, 25°, 30°, and 37 °C. Growth was assessed as follows: +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-type CET1(201–549); ++ denotes slightly reduced colony size; + indicates that only pinpoint colonies were formed. Purification of Recombinant S. cerevisiae Triphosphatase—NdeI/BamHI fragments encoding mutated versions of Cet1(201–549) were excised from the respective pCET1–5′3′ plasmids and inserted into pET16b. Wild-type Cet1(201–549) and the Cet1(201–549)-Ala mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 18 °C by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 20 h in the presence of 2% ethanol (14Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (4Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The 0.2 m imidazole eluate fractions containing Cet1(201–549) were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, then stored at –80 °C. Mutagenesis of S. pombe RNA Triphosphatase—Gene fragments encoding N-terminal-truncated versions of Pct1 were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers that introduced an NdeI site at the codons for amino acids 41 or 51. The antisense primers introduced a BamHI site immediately downstream of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16b. Full-length Pct1 and the NΔ40 and NΔ50 mutants were produced in E. coli as N-terminal His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Aliquots (45 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations of wild-type Cet1(201–549) and the D280A mutant were mixed with BSA (40 μg) and cytochrome c (40 μg) in 0.2 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100). Aliquots (50 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations of wild-type Pct1 and the NΔ40 and NΔ50 mutants were mixed with BSA (50 μg), ovalbumin (50 μg), and cytochrome c (50 μg) in 0.2 ml of buffer G. The mixtures were layered onto 4.8 ml of 15–30% glycerol gradients containing buffer G. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots (20 μl) of odd-numbered fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Assay of Triphosphatase Activity—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2,1mm [γ-32P]ATP, and Cet1 or Pct1 as specified were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 2.5 μl of 5 m formic acid. An aliquot of the mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. The release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was quantitated by scanning the TLC plate with a PhosphorImager. Test of RNA Triphosphatase Function in Vivo in S. pombe—The full-length pct1 + and truncated pct1-NΔ40 and pct1-NΔ50 cDNAs were cloned into the S. pombe expression vectors pREP81X, pREP41X, and pREP3X (LEU2 ars1 +) so as to place them under the control of the nmt1**, nmt1*, and nmt1 promoters, respectively (27Basi G. Schmmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 28Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed into a heterozygous pct1 + /pct1::kanMX diploid (29Pei Y. Schwer B. Saiz J. Fisher R.P. Shuman S. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). The Leu+ diploid transformants were selected and then sporulated on ME plates at room temperature. A loopful of cells was inoculated into 500 μl of sterile water, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 28 °C with 10 μl of β-glucuronidase (Sigma G7770). The spores were plated on EMM(-Leu) agar medium and incubated at 30 °C. Individual colonies were then restreaked onto YES agar and on YES agar containing 200 μg/ml G418. Growth was scored after incubation for 5–7 days at 30° and 37 °C. Structure-based Mutational Analysis of the Cet1 Homodimer Interface—The Cet1 homodimer interface is extensive, with a buried surface area of 1860 Å2 per protomer (16Lima C. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Elements that comprise the dimer interface are strands β2 and β3, helices α1 and α4, the loop immediately preceding α1, the loop between β9 and β10, and the loop between α3 and α4 (see Fig. 1). The molecular contacts of the dimer interface entail multiple hydrophobic interactions and a network of side-chain and main-chain hydrogen bonds. We previously tested the effects of 21 double-alanine mutations of vicinal amino acids on Cet1 function in vivo (24Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Twenty-four of the mutated residues were constituents of the crystallographic dimer interface. The Ala cluster mutations also targeted residues in helices α1 and α4 that compose the hydrophobic core of the pedestal upon which the triphosphate tunnel rests. Four of the Ala cluster alleles were lethal in vivo: D279A-D280A, C330A-V331A, L519A-I520A, and F523A-L524A. Three Ala cluster mutants displayed temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defects, even at high gene dosage: F272A-L273A, I470A-I472A, and I529A-I530A. The cluster mutagenesis approach provided useful information in two respects: (i) it showed that 15 of the amino acids that comprise the crystallographic homodimer interface are not important for Cet1 function in vivo, and (ii) it narrowed down the critical constituents of the homodimer interface to one or both of the side chains of the clusters at which Ala-Ala mutations elicited severe growth defects. Here we set out to identify which individual components of the dimer interface are functionally relevant, by testing the effects of single-alanine mutations at each of the residues of those clusters. As in previous studies, the mutations were introduced into the biologically active Cet1(201–549) protein. The CET1(201–549)-Ala genes were cloned into a CEN TRP1 vector under the control of the natural CET1 promoter and then tested by plasmid shuffle for their ability to complement a cet1Δ strain of S. cerevisiae. Growth of cet1Δ is contingent upon maintenance of a wild-type CET1 allele on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Therefore, the cet1Δ strain is unable to grow on agar medium containing 5-FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid, a drug that selects against the URA3 plasmid) unless it is first transformed with a biologically active RNA triphosphatase gene on the TRP1 plasmid. Trp+ CET1(201–549)-Ala transformants were tested for growth on 5-FOA. The results are summarized in Table I. Triphosphatase mutations were judged to be lethal if they failed to support colony formation on 5-FOA after prolonged incubation at four different temperatures (18°, 25°, 30°, and 37 °C). Two of the single-Ala mutations were lethal by this criterion: D280A and I520A.Table IMutational effects on CetI function in vivoCET1 mutantGrowthCross-dimer contactsIntra-protomer contacts18°C25°C30°C37°CF272A+++++++++++Ile470 Ile529 Ile530L273A++++++++++++Tyr354 Ile358 Ile529Phe272 Ile275D279A++++++++++++D280A----Gln329(N) Arg531 Arg532C330A++++++++++++Val326 Ser328 Cys330Val326V331A+++++++++++Ser327 Ser328Leu415 Leu417I470A++++++--Phe272Ile355 Leu495I472A+++++++++++Phe348 Ile355L519A++++++++++Ile268Cys467 Ile497 Leu502I520A----Val285 Val289 Tyr516 Leu524F523A+++++--Met308 Ile428 Ile497L524A++++++--Val285 Ile428 Ile520I529A++++++++++++Phe272 Leu273 Pro277I530A+++++--Phe272Phe310 Val493 Leu495 Open table in a new tab The other 12 mutants gave rise to 5-FOA-resistant colonies at one or more of the selection temperatures. The viable CET1(201–549)-Ala strains were then tested for growth on rich medium (YPD agar) at 18°, 25°, 30°, and 37 °C. A hierarchy of severity of mutational effects was thereby revealed (Table I). Four of the mutants displayed a tight ts phenotype: I470A and L524A cells grew as well as wild-type yeast at 18° and 25 °C (scored as +++ based on colony size) but failed to grow at 30° and 37 °C (–growth); F523A and I530A cells grew normally at 18 °C but formed small colonies at 25 °C (scored as ++) and no colonies at 30° and 37 °C. Four of the mutants displayed weaker ts phenotypes: the F272A, V331A, and I472A strains grew normally at 18°, 25°, and 30 °C but formed small colonies at 37 °C; L519A cells grew normally at 18°, 25°, and 30 °C but formed only pinpoint colonies at 37 °C. Four of the mutants, L273A, D279A, C330A, and I529A, grew as well as wild-type yeast at all temperatures tested. Three of the residues at which single-alanine substitutions elicited significant growth defects are components of the crystallographic homodimer interface: Asp280, Ile470, and Ile530. The Asp280 side chain is the only one of these that is strictly essential for cell viability. Thus, Asp280 appears to be an important constituent of the homodimer interface. None of the other three amino acids (Ile520, Phe523, and Leu524) at which alanine mutations resulted in significant growth defects are involved in cross-dimer contacts; rather, they are components of the hydrophobic core of the pedestal domains of the individual protomers. Biochemical Characterization of Mutant Enzymes—We produced the 14 Cet1(201–549)-Ala proteins in bacteria as His10-tagged fusions and purified them from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography. Wild-type His10-Cet1(201–549) was purified in parallel. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the ∼44-kDa Cet1(201–549) protein was the predominant species in each enzyme preparation (Fig. 2A). Phosphohydrolase activity was assayed by the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of manganese chloride (7Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extents"
