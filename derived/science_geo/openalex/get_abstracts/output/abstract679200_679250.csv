https://openalex.org/W3194509722,"Genetic perturbations of cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and disease."

Unique proline isomerase Pin1 regulates multiple cancer pathways, but its role in the TME and cancer immunotherapy is unknown. Here, we find that Pin1 is overexpressed both in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and correlates with poor survival in PDAC patients. Targeting Pin1 using clinically available drugs induces complete elimination or sustained remissions of aggressive PDAC by synergizing with anti-PD-1 and gemcitabine in diverse model systems. Mechanistically, Pin1 drives the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by acting on CAFs and induces lysosomal degradation of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and the gemcitabine transporter ENT1 in cancer cells, besides activating multiple cancer pathways. Thus, Pin1 inhibition simultaneously blocks multiple cancer pathways, disrupts the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and upregulates PD-L1 and ENT1, rendering PDAC eradicable by immunochemotherapy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive solid malignancies, with near uniform mortality (Siegel et al., 2021Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Fuchs H.E. Jemal A. Cancer Statistics, 2021.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2021; 71: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), and is projected to be the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths by 2030 (Rahib et al., 2014Rahib L. Smith B.D. Aizenberg R.

PDAC is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and even immunotherapy (Brahmer et al., 2012Brahmer J.R. Tykodi S.S. Chow L.Q. Hwu W.J. Topalian S.L. Hwu P. Drake C.G. Camacho L.H.

Tumor heterogeneity renders tumors resistant to targeted therapies aiming at blocking individual pathways because multiple pathways are often activated simultaneously and/or rapidly upregulated as a compensatory mechanism (Gerlinger et al., 2012Gerlinger M.

The PDAC TME is dominated by dense desmoplasia and immunosuppressive cell populations, which limit cytotoxic T cell response (Balachandran et al., 2019Balachandran V.P. Beatty G.L. Dougan S.K.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a central role in promoting the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by producing extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines, as well as interacting with cancer cells to promote tumor growth and malignancy (Sahai et al., 2020Sahai E. Astsaturov I. Cukierman E. DeNardo D.G. Egeblad M. Evans R.M. Fearon D. Greten F.R. Hingorani S.R. Hunter T. et al.A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts.Nat.

Recent strategies targeting the stroma reduce tumor growth and increase tumor response to chemo- and/or immunotherapy; however, they rarely lead to obvious tumor regression (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang H.

Moreover, some of those approaches even lead to disease acceleration and more aggressive tumors (Özdemir et al., 2014Özdemir B.C. Pentcheva-Hoang T. Carstens J.L. Zheng X. Wu C.C. Simpson T.R.

Cancer. 2020; 20: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), suggesting that targeting the TME might not be sufficient. Targeting immune checkpoints such as the one mediated by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 has improved patient survival in various cancers. However, the response rate is very low in PDAC patients (Brahmer et al., 2012Brahmer J.R. Tykodi S.S. Chow L.Q. Hwu W.J. Topalian S.L. Hwu P. Drake C.G. Camacho L.H. Kauh J.

Importantly, although PD-L1 has been well studied for its engagement with PD-1 on T cells to evade antitumor immunity, recent studies have shown that the presence of PD-L1-expressing cancer cells within tumors is known to be an important predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in patients (Herbst et al., 2014Herbst R.S.

Moreover, upregulating PD-L1 expression in cancer cells using different approaches improves ICB efficacy in experimental models (Herter-Sprie et al., 2016Herter-Sprie G.S. Koyama S. Korideck H.

Dai X. et al.Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via cullin 3-SPOP to control cancer immune surveillance.Nature. 2018; 553: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Since most PDAC tumors are negative for PD-L1 (Tessier-Cloutier et al., 2017Tessier-Cloutier B. Kalloger S.E. Al-Kandari M. Milne K. Gao D. Nelson B.H. Renouf D.J. Sheffield B.S. Schaeffer D.F. Programmed cell death ligand 1 cut-point is associated with reduced disease specific survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.BMC Cancer. 2017; 17: 618Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is critical to understand the mechanisms and signaling pathways behind the regulation of PD-L1 levels to improve ICB response and efficacy. A central common signaling mechanism in cancer is proline-directed phosphorylation regulating numerous oncoproteins and tumor suppressors (Blume-Jensen and Hunter, 2001Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Oncogenic kinase signalling.Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar; Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), many of which are further regulated by a unique proline isomerase, Pin1 (Lu and Hunter, 2014Lu Z. Hunter T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; Zhou and Lu, 2016Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Aberrant Pin1 overactivation promotes tumorigenesis by activating over 60 oncoproteins and inactivating over 30 tumor suppressors in various cancers, including numerous substrates in oncogenic Kras signaling (Lu and Hunter, 2014Lu Z. Hunter T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; Zhou and Lu, 2016Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target.Nat. Rev.

KRAS: The Critical Driver and Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8: a031435Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIN1−/− mice develop normally but are highly resistant to tumorigenesis (Girardini et al., 2011Girardini J.E. Napoli M. Piazza S. Rustighi A. Marotta C. Radaelli E. Capaci V. Jordan L.

Lu K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic polymorphisms that reduce Pin1 expression are also associated with reduced risk for multiple cancers in humans (Li et al., 2013Li Q. Dong Z. Lin Y. Jia X. Li Q. Jiang H. Wang L. Gao Y. The rs2233678 polymorphism in PIN1 promoter region reduced cancer risk: a meta-analysis.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e68148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These data suggest that targeting Pin1 in PDAC might simultaneously block multiple oncogenic signaling pathways without major toxicity (Lu and Hunter, 2014Lu Z. Hunter T. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; Zhou and Lu, 2016Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This notion has been corroborated by the recent unexpected identification of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide (ATRA + ATO) as synergistic Pin1 inhibitors that block multiple cancer-driving pathways, eliminate cancer stem cells, and increase response to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation in various cancers (Kozono et al., 2018Kozono S.

Cancer. 2016; 16: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether Pin1 has any role in the TME and cancer immunotherapy and whether Pin1 inhibitors could render a solid malignancy curable. Here, we report that in PDAC, Pin1 drives the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by acting on CAFs and induces PD-L1 and ENT1 endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in cancer cells by acting on HIP1R, in addition to activating multiple oncogenic pathways. Consequently, targeting Pin1 using Pin1 inhibitors including ATRA + ATO simultaneously blocks multiple cancer pathways, disrupts the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME, and upregulates PD-L1 and ENT1, thereby rendering aggressive PDAC eradicable by synergizing with immunochemotherapy. These findings may have immediate therapeutic impact on PDAC patients as some Pin1 inhibitors are approved drugs. To evaluate the effects of targeting Pin1 on the TME and tumor growth in PDAC, we used two different Pin1 inhibitors (Pin1i-1 and -2) to treat three different PDAC mouse models. Pin1i-1 is a combination of ATRA + ATO (Kozono et al., 2018Kozono S. Lin Y.M. Seo H.S. Pinch B. Lian X. Qiu C. Herbert M.K. Chen C.H. Tan L. Gao Z.J. et al.Arsenic targets Pin1 and cooperates with retinoic acid to inhibit cancer-driving pathways and tumor-initiating cells.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and Pin1i-2 is Sulfopin, a highly Pin1-specific covalent inhibitor that targets the ATO-binding pocket and has no detectable side effect (Dubiella et al., 2021Dubiella C. Pinch B.J. Koikawa K. Zaidman D. Poon E. Manz T.D. Nabet B. He S. Resnick E. Rogel A. et al.Sulfopin is a covalent inhibitor of Pin1 that blocks Myc-driven tumors in vivo.Nat. Chem.

Treatment of overt tumor (>0.5 cm)-bearing PDTX or GDA mice with Pin1i-1 or -2 significantly reduced tumor growth (Figures S1A–S1C and S2B), collagen deposition (Figures 1A and S1D), and CAF activation and proliferation (Figures 1B, S1F, S1G, and S1J). Compared with vehicle controls, Pin1 inhibitors reduced the proliferation of cancer cells (Figure S1E) and resulted in a more differentiated histology (Figures S1D and S1I), as evidenced by reduced vimentin and increased E-cadherin, markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure S1H). Both Pin1 inhibitors also increased tumor-infiltrating CD8α+ T cells, specifically CD8α+Granzyme B+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and decreased immunosuppressive CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), Ly6G+CD11b+ myeloid cells, and F4/80+CD206+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in GDA mice (Figures 1C and S2D–S2G). Thus, Pin1 inhibitors suppress tumor growth and progression and block CAF activation, as well as disrupt the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME in PDAC mouse models.Figure 1Targeting Pin1 disrupts the desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME and renders PDAC tumors curable by immunochemotherapy in GDA miceShow full caption(A–C) Overt tumor-bearing (>0.5 cm) GDA mice were treated with Pin1i-1 or -2 for 4 weeks, followed by examining collagen deposition using Sirius Red staining (A), CAF proliferation using double immunofluorescence (IF) for αSMA and Ki67 (B), and tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations (CD8α+ T cells, FOXP3+ Tregs, and Ly6G+ CD11b+ myeloid cells) using IF (C).(D–G) Tumor-bearing GDA mice were treated with Pin1i, low-dose (10 mg/kg, weekly) GEM + αPD1 (G+P), Pin1i + αPD1, or Pin1i + G+P for up to 120 days and monitored for tumor growth (D), and overall survival using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (E) for up to 365 days, as well as examining macroscopic tumors (F) or microscopic tumors (G) after autopsy (n = 8–16).

Despite decades of studies, the molecular bases for both remain elusive. Here, we show how prestin, the electromotive molecule of outer hair cells (OHCs) that senses both voltage and membrane tension, mediates signal amplification by coupling conformational changes to alterations in membrane surface area. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human prestin bound with chloride or salicylate at a common “anion site” adopt contracted or expanded states, respectively. Prestin is ensconced within a perimeter of well-ordered lipids, through which it induces dramatic deformation in the membrane and couples protein conformational changes to the bulk membrane. Together with computational studies, we illustrate how the anion site is allosterically coupled to changes in the transmembrane domain cross-sectional area and the surrounding membrane.

These studies provide insight into OHC electromotility by providing a structure-based mechanism of the membrane motor prestin. Hearing is the final sensory modality for which there is, at present, no elucidated molecular mechanism. The outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mammalian cochlea are crucial to hearing because they mediate signal amplification via an active mechanical feedback that enhances the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of sound stimuli (Ashmore, 2019Ashmore J.

Loss of OHCs due to excessive noise, ototoxic drugs, or normal aging leads to reduction of sound sensitivity and ability to distinguish sounds (Gummer and Preyer, 1997Gummer A.W. Preyer S.

Driven by changes in membrane potential, OHCs exhibit fast changes in length along the axial direction at acoustic frequencies up to 80 kHz (Ashmore, 1987Ashmore J.F.

Reversible inhibition of voltage-dependent outer hair cell motility and capacitance.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3096-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prestin, a member of solute carrier 26 (SLC26) anion transporter family, is the motor protein responsible for the fast eM of OHCs (Zheng et al., 2000Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Prestin is the motor protein of cochlear outer hair cells.Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and is abundantly expressed in the OHC lateral membrane (Gale and Ashmore, 1997Gale J.E.

Neurosci. 2010; 31: 1595-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Prestin acts directly on the membranes deriving energy from the OHC’s transmembrane potential, which together with its fast kinetics set it apart from other molecular motors, such as cytoskeletal or rotary motors (Dallos and Fakler, 2002Dallos P.

Biological nanomotors with a revolution, linear, or rotation motion mechanism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2016; 80: 161-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The deletion of prestin in mice results in the loss of eM, shortened OHCs, and a reduction of hearing sensitivity of 40–60 dB (Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Mutations in human prestin are associated with deafness (Mutai et al., 2013Mutai H. Suzuki N. Shimizu A. Torii C. Namba K. Morimoto N. Kudoh J. Kaga K. Kosaki K. Matsunaga T.

Rare Dis. 2013; 8: 172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Prestin also amplifies cardiomyocyte motion (Zhang et al., 2021Zhang X.D. Thai P.N. Ren L. Perez Flores M.C. Ledford H.A. Park S.

Intracellular anions, particularly Cl−, are indispensable for the normal function of prestin and regulate the eM of prestin, including shifting the NLC voltage dependence (Oliver et al., 2001Oliver D.

Salicylate, a widely used drug, reversibly inhibits eM and causes hearing loss or tinnitus at high doses (Kakehata and Santos-Sacchi, 1996Kakehata S. Santos-Sacchi J.

Salicylate ototoxicity; a clinical and experimental study.Arch. Otolaryngol. 1965; 82: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The importance of anions to prestin function initially suggested that Cl− acts as an extrinsic voltage sensor (Oliver et al., 2001Oliver D. He D.Z. Klöcker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S.

Intracellular anions as the voltage sensor of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein.Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but more recent evidence suggested that anions, such as Cl−, play an allosteric role (Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2003Rybalchenko V.

Prestin is also sensitive to membrane tension (Iwasa, 1993Iwasa K.H. Effect of stress on the membrane capacitance of the auditory outer hair cell.Biophys.

Here, we carry out single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), molecular dynamics simulations, and electrophysiology to illuminate multiple high-resolution structures of prestin and to provide a structural basis for its electromotive, membrane-sensitive properties, thereby providing the molecular basis for signal amplification in hearing. We expressed full-length human prestin fused with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an affinity tag in HEK293 GnTI− cells (Goehring et al., 2014Goehring A. Lee C.H. Wang K.H.

The NLC was not observed in non-transfected cells (Figures S1A and S1C) and was reversibly inhibited by 10 mM salicylate (Figure 1A), thus demonstrating that this recombinant prestin recapitulates native prestin function.Figure S1Electrophysiology and biochemistry of prestin, related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A-C).

Protoc. 2014; 9: 2574-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and found two peaks, suggestive of two distinct oligomerization states, dependent upon detergent solubilization conditions (Figure S1M). Among the panel of detergents, glycol-diogenin (GDN) resulted in the greatest fraction of the earlier eluting, hypothetically oligomeric state (Figure S1M). We purified the oligomeric form of prestin, in the presence of Cl−, in either GDN micelles (Pres-Cl) or in lipid nanodiscs (Pres-Cl-nanodisc) and employed single-particle cryo-EM to elucidate structures at 2.3 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively (Figures 1, S1N–S1P, and S2; Table S1; Methods S1A). Reconstructions of prestin from both conditions reveal a dimeric architecture with no other oligomeric state found during data processing, indicating that prestin is a dimer. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that prestin in native OHCs can form higher oligomers due to its high level of expression or interactions with cytosolic scaffolds. We hypothesize that the later eluting FSEC peak corresponds to immature, unassembled prestin. The Pres-Cl and Pres-Cl-nanodisc structures are indistinguishable (Cα root-mean-square deviation [RMSD]: 0.2 Å; Figures S3D and S4C), and because of the higher resolution and better quality of the Pres-Cl map (Figure S2), we used Pres-Cl for structural analysis unless specified otherwise.Figure S3Comparison of prestin structures, related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Structural alignment and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) based on the Cα atoms of Pres-Sal and Pres-Cl.Alignment and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) based on all Cα atoms of Pres-Sal (orange) and Pres-Cl (green).(B-C).

Prestin forms a domain-swapped homodimer, with each protomer containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) (residues 76–504), an N-terminal domain (NTD) (residues 1–75), and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist domain (STAS) (residues 505–744; Figures 1B and 1D). The NTD and STAS domains form a dimerized “base” on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, on “top” of which two TMDs separately insert into the membrane (Figures 1C and 1D). The TMD adopts the UraA fold (Lu et al., 2011Lu F. Li S. Jiang Y. Jiang J. Fan H. Lu G. Deng D. Dang S. Zhang X. Wang J. Yan N. Structure and mechanism of the uracil transporter UraA.Nature. 2011; 472: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with a 7+7 inverted helical arrangement that can be divided into a “core” domain and a “gate” domain. Though prestin shares a similar fold to the recently resolved SLC26A9 structures (Chi et al., 2020Chi X. Jin X. Chen Y. Lu X. Tu X. Li X. Zhang Y. Lei J. Huang J.

A Cl− ion is located on the interface between the core and gate domains (Figure 1D).

However, little is known about the factors that regulate proteostasis during stress in stem cells (Chua and Signer, 2020Chua B.A. Signer R.A.J. Hematopoietic stem cell regulation by the proteostasis network.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2020; 27: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A primary response to protein stress in the cytoplasm is activation of the heat shock response (Akerfelt et al., 2010Akerfelt M. Morimoto R.I. Sistonen L. Heat shock factors: integrators of cell stress, development and lifespan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The master regulator of this pathway is heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1), which encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that promotes proteostasis maintenance (Anckar and Sistonen, 2011Anckar J. Sistonen L. Regulation of HSF1 function in the heat stress response: implications in aging and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 1089-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). At steady state, inactive Hsf1 is localized in the cytoplasm, where it binds to chaperones (Neef et al., 2014Neef D.W. Jaeger A.M. Gomez-Pastor R. Willmund F. Frydman J. Thiele D.J.

Under conditions of protein stress, the chaperones dissociate from Hsf1 to bind unfolded/misfolded proteins. This enables Hsf1 to translocate to the nucleus, where it classically induces transcription of heat shock proteins—molecular chaperones that coordinate protein folding, trafficking, and degradation to enhance proteostasis and promote cell survival (Anckar and Sistonen, 2011Anckar J.

We previously discovered that young adult HSCs have lower protein synthesis rates than other hematopoietic cells (Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Low protein synthesis is necessary for adult HSC maintenance because modest increases in protein synthesis disrupt proteostasis and impair self-renewal in vivo (Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020Hidalgo San Jose L.

Here we report that ex vivo culture rapidly induces a massive increase in protein synthesis in mouse and human HSCs that disrupts proteostasis. This protein stress induces accumulation of Hsf1 in the nucleus of cultured HSCs, and deletion of Hsf1 severely impairs their long-term multilineage reconstituting activity. Supplementing cultures with small molecules that enhance Hsf1 activation partially suppresses protein synthesis, rebalances proteostasis, and supports sustained ex vivo HSC maintenance. Finally, we found that Hsf1 is activated in middle-aged HSCs in vivo, where it suppresses protein synthesis and promotes long-term multilineage reconstituting activity. To initiate our studies, we sought to identify a model to study the regulation of proteostasis in HSCs in response to stress. We began by examining the effects of cell culture stress on HSCs. To gain an unbiased view of the cell-intrinsic changes that occur in HSCs in culture, we performed RNA sequencing on CD150+CD48−Lineage−Sca1+ckit+ (CD150+CD48−LSK) HSCs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar; Figures S1A and S1B) that were freshly isolated from young adult (2- to 3-month-old) mice as well as HSCs that were cultured ex vivo for 18 h in medium supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO), 2-mercaptoethanol, and bovine serum albumin (basic HSC medium; Figure 1A). The 18-h time point typically precedes the first HSC division in culture (Flach et al., 2014Flach J. Bakker S.T. Mohrin M. Conroy P.C. Pietras E.M. Reynaud D. Alvarez S. Diolaiti M.E. Ugarte F. Forsberg E.C. et al.Replication stress is a potent driver of functional decline in ageing haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 512: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The transcripts of 2,368 genes were changed by at least 2-fold (Padj < 0.05) between freshly isolated and 18-h-cultured HSCs (Figures 1B, S1C, and S1D). To sort through these transcriptional changes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24108) Google Scholar) for Gene Ontology terms describing biological processes (Table S1). The “Regulation of Cellular Response to Stress” gene set was upregulated significantly in cultured HSCs (Figure 1C), indicating that ex vivo culture induces significant stress in HSCs. Strikingly, several of the most upregulated gene sets in cultured HSCs were related to protein synthesis, including “Ribosome Biogenesis,” “mRNA Processing,” “Amino Acid Metabolic Process,” “Translation Initiation,” “Translation Elongation,” and “Translation Termination” (Figures 1D–1I). These data raised the possibility that regulation of protein synthesis was particularly disrupted in ex-vivo-cultured HSCs. To directly test the effects of ex vivo culture on protein synthesis, we cultured HSCs for 4 or 18 h and quantified protein synthesis based on O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-Puro) incorporation (Hidalgo San Jose and Signer, 2019Hidalgo San Jose L.

Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). After 4 h in culture, HSCs exhibited a 6.7-fold increase in protein synthesis compared with HSCs in vivo (Figure 1J). After 18 h in culture, HSCs synthesized 19.4-fold more protein per hour than HSCs in vivo (Figure 1J). Similarly, human cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) cultured for 18 h exhibited a 5.2-fold increase in protein synthesis compared with uncultured controls (Figure 1K). These data indicate that mouse and human HSCs rapidly and significantly increase protein synthesis in culture. Although HSCs in young adult bone marrow are predominantly quiescent (Cheshier et al., 1999Cheshier S.H. Morrison S.J. Liao X. Weissman I.L.

USA. 1999; 96: 3120-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), elevated protein synthesis in HSCs in culture could not be fully explained by increased cell cycle entry. HSCs in vivo can be driven to undergo rapid self-renewing divisions by treating mice with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (Morrison et al., 1997Morrison S.J. Wright D.E. Weissman I.L. Cyclophosphamide/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor induces hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate prior to mobilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1908-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cycling HSCs in vivo exhibit an ~2-fold increase in protein synthesis compared with steady-state quiescent HSCs (Figure 1J; Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). HSCs cultured ex vivo for 18 h thus produce ~10-fold more protein per hour than dividing HSCs in vivo (Figure 1J). Next we tested whether large increases in protein synthesis in culture were unique to HSCs or could be broadly observed among hematopoietic progenitors. We cultured common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) for 18 h. CMPs and GMPs exhibited an ~2-fold increase in protein synthesis in culture compared with in vivo (Figure 1L). MEPs did not exhibit any significant change in protein synthesis after 18 h in culture (Figure 1L). HSCs, which typically synthesize ~5- to 8-fold less protein per hour than CMPs, GMPs, and MEPs in vivo (Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), exhibited significantly higher protein synthesis than all of these progenitor populations after 18 h in culture (Figure 1L). These data indicate that HSCs exhibit a particularly large increase in protein synthesis in culture. The increase in protein synthesis within ex vivo cultured HSCs is particularly notable because HSCs in vivo require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate (Magee and Signer, 2021Magee J.A. Signer R.A.J.

Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Adult HSCs exhibit lower protein synthesis than other hematopoietic cells in vivo, and modest increases (~30%) in protein synthesis can significantly disrupt proteostasis within HSCs and impair their function (Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020Hidalgo San Jose L. Sunshine M.J. Dillingham C.H. Chua B.A. Kruta M. Hong Y. Hatters D.M. Signer R.A.J.

The rate of protein synthesis in hematopoietic stem cells is limited partly by 4E-BPs.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteostasis is maintained partly through balanced protein synthesis and degradation. Despite a 19.4-fold increase in protein synthesis, cultured HSCs exhibited no significant change in proteasome activity compared with freshly isolated HSCs (Figure 1M). Given this discrepancy between protein synthesis and degradation activity, we used UbG76V-GFP reporter mice (Lindsten et al., 2003Lindsten K. Menéndez-Benito V. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. A transgenic mouse model of the ubiquitin/proteasome system.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to test whether proteostasis becomes unbalanced in cultured HSCs (Figure 1N). UbG76V-GFP mice ubiquitously express GFP that is fused to a constitutively active degradation signal. GFP transcripts can be detected, but no fluorescence is detected because GFP is degraded rapidly by the proteasome. We established previously that increased protein synthesis and/or accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins could overwhelm proteasome capacity and unbalance proteostasis in HSCs in vivo, which is marked by accumulation of GFP (Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020Hidalgo San Jose L. Sunshine M.J. Dillingham C.H. Chua B.A. Kruta M. Hong Y. Hatters D.M. Signer R.A.J. Modest Declines in Proteome Quality Impair Hematopoietic Stem Cell Self-Renewal.Cell Rep. 2020; 30: 69-80.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). UbG76V-GFP HSCs cultured for 18 h exhibited more than 10-fold accumulation of GFP compared with HSCs in vivo (Figure 1O). Thus, ex vivo culture severely increases protein synthesis and unbalances proteostasis in HSCs at a magnitude that cannot be tolerated in vivo. Ex-vivo-cultured HSCs exhibited significant upregulation of the “Response to Heat” gene set compared with fresh HSCs (Figure 2A), suggesting that they may activate the heat shock response. The heat shock response is a central cellular response to protein stress in the cytoplasm (Akerfelt et al., 2010Akerfelt M. Morimoto R.I. Sistonen L. Heat shock factors: integrators of cell stress, development and lifespan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and is controlled by the transcription factor Hsf1 (Anckar and Sistonen, 2011Anckar J. Sistonen L. Regulation of HSF1 function in the heat stress response: implications in aging and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 1089-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). At steady state, inactive Hsf1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interactions with chaperones, including Hsp90 and TRiC (Neef et al., 2014Neef D.W. Jaeger A.M. Gomez-Pastor R. Willmund F. Frydman J. Thiele D.J.

Under conditions of protein stress, the chaperones bind unfolded/misfolded proteins (Figure 2C), enabling Hsf1 to translocate to the nucleus, where it promotes a transcriptional response aimed at restoring proteostasis and promoting cell survival (Anckar and Sistonen, 2011Anckar J. Sistonen L. Regulation of HSF1 function in the heat stress response: implications in aging and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 1089-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar; Mendillo et al., 2012Mendillo M.L. Santagata S. Koeva M. Bell G.W. Hu R. Tamimi R.M. Fraenkel E. Ince T.A. Whitesell L. Lindquist S. HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to support highly malignant human cancers.Cell. 2012; 150: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar; Figure 2C). Hsf1 is highly expressed by young adult HSCs in vivo (Figure 2D), but the protein is largely absent from the nucleus (Figure 2E), suggesting that it is likely inactive as a transcription factor at steady state. In contrast, we observed a significant accumulation of Hsf1 in the nucleus of ex-vivo-cultured young adult mouse HSCs (Figures 2E and 2F) and human cord blood CD34+ HSPCs (Figures 2G and 2H). The accumulation of Hsf1 in the nucleus of cultured HSCs could not be explained by increased gene expression because the abundance of Hsf1 mRNA was similar in fresh and cultured HSCs (Figure 2I). These data suggest that protein stress in culture led to nuclear Hsf1 accumulation in HSCs. We thus tested whether Hsf1 influences ex vivo HSC maintenance. To do this, we conditionally deleted Hsf1 from hematopoietic cells by treating 6-week-old Hsf1fl/fl;Mx1-Cre+ (Hsf1-deficient) or control Hsf1fl/fl mice with polyinosine:polycytidine (pIpC). We confirmed that Hsf1 was deleted from more than 95% of HSCs (data not shown). Seven days after pIpC administration, when HSCs returned to steady state (Essers et al., 2009Essers M.A. Offner S. Blanco-Bose W.E. Waibler Z. Kalinke U. Duchosal M.A. Trumpp A. IFNalpha activates dormant haematopoietic stem cells in vivo.Nature. 2009; 458: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), CD150+CD48−LSK HSCs were sorted from the bone marrow of Hsf1-deficient and control mice into 96-well plates at a density of 10 cells/well and cultured in basic HSC medium for 10 days without any medium change or passaging (Figure 2J). After 10 days in culture, Hsf1-deficient and control HSCs expanded into ~25,000 cells (Figure 2K), and we competitively transplanted the complete cellular contents of each well together with 2 × 105 fresh wild-type congenic bone marrow cells into irradiated mice. Overall, cultured Hsf1-deficient HSCs exhibited severe loss of reconstituting activity compared with controls (Figures 2L–2P). Only 8 of 30 (27%) recipients of cultured Hsf1-deficient HSCs exhibited long-term multilineage reconstitution compared to 23 of 36 (64%) recipients of cultured control HSCs (Figure 2Q). Defects in cultured Hsf1-deficient HSCs do not reflect a requirement for Hsf1 in young adult HSCs in vivo. 2-month-old Hsf1-deficient mice had normal bone marrow cellularity (Figure S2A), and the frequencies of HSCs and progenitors were unchanged compared with controls (Figures S2B–S2F). To test whether Hsf1 is necessary to regulate HSC function in young adult mice, we competitively transplanted 10 freshly isolated Hsf1-deficient"
https://openalex.org/W3194569996,"The study explored the 3D numerical solution of an unsteady Ag-MgO /water hybrid nanofluid flow with mass and energy transmission generated by a wavy rotating disc moving up and down. The nanofluid is generated in the context of Ag-MgO nanomaterials. Magnesium oxide and silver nanoparticles have been heavily reported to have broad-spectrum antibacterial operations among metal oxides and metals. Silver nanoparticles are without a doubt the most commonly used inorganic nanoparticles, with numerous innovations in biomaterial’s detection and antimicrobial operations. However, in current paper, the intention of the analysis is to boost thermal energy transmitting rates for a range of industrial implementations. When compared to a flat surface, energy transition is increased up to 15% due to the wavy swirling surface. The problem has been formulated as a system of PDEs, which included the Navier Stokes and Maxwell equations. Following that, the modeled equations are reduced to a dimensionless system of differential equations. The derived equations are then solved numerically using the Parametric Continuation Method (PCM). The findings are displayed graphically and debated. The geometry of a spinning disc is thought to have a positive impact on velocity and heat energy transfer. The insertion of nanostructured materials (silver and magnesium-oxide) increased the carrier fluid’s thermal properties considerably. It is more effective at dealing with low energy transmission."

Mosaic mutations present in the gonads can affect both the individual and the offspring and subsequent generations. Here, we explore patterns and temporal stability of clonal mosaic mutations in male gonads by sequencing ejaculated sperm. Through 300× whole-genome sequencing of blood and sperm from healthy men, we find each ejaculate carries on average 33.3 ± 12.1 (mean ± SD) clonal mosaic variants, nearly all of which are detected in serial sampling, with the majority absent from sampled somal tissues. Their temporal stability and mutational signature suggest origins during embryonic development from a largely immutable stem cell niche. Clonal mosaicism likely contributes a transmissible, predicted pathogenic exonic variant for 1 in 15 men, representing a life-long threat of transmission for these individuals and a significant burden on human population health."

This method is based on recording electrical potentials produced by the fetal heart from the surface of the maternal abdomen. Unfortunately, in addition to the useful fetal electrocardiographic signal, there are other interference signals in the abdominal recording that need to be filtered. The biggest challenge in designing filtration methods is the suppression of the maternal electrocardiographic signal. This study focuses on the extraction of fetal electrocardiographic signal from abdominal recordings using a combination of independent component analysis, recursive least squares, and ensemble empirical mode decomposition. The method was tested on two databases, the Fetal Electrocardiograms, Direct and Abdominal with Reference Heartbeats Annotations and the PhysioNet Challenge 2013 database. The evaluation was performed by the assessment of the accuracy of fetal QRS complexes detection and the quality of fetal heart rate determination. The effectiveness of the method was measured by means of the statistical parameters as accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F1-score. Using the proposed method, when testing on the Fetal Electrocardiograms, Direct and Abdominal with Reference Heartbeats Annotations database, accuracy higher than 80% was achieved for 11 out of 12 recordings with an average value of accuracy 92.75% [95% confidence interval: 91.19-93.88%], sensitivity 95.09% [95% confidence interval: 93.68-96.03%], positive predictive value 96.36% [95% confidence interval: 95.05-97.17%] and F1-score 95.69% [95% confidence interval: 94.83-96.35%]. When testing on the Physionet Challenge 2013 database, accuracy higher than 80% was achieved for 17 out of 25 recordings with an average value of accuracy 78.24% [95% confidence interval: 73.44-81.85%], sensitivity 81.79% [95% confidence interval: 76.59-85.43%], positive predictive value 87.16% [95% confidence interval: 81.95-90.35%] and F1-score 84.08% [95% confidence interval: 80.75-86.64%]. Moreover, the non-invasive ST segment analysis was carried out on the records from the Fetal Electrocardiograms, Direct and Abdominal with Reference Heartbeats Annotations database and achieved high accuracy in 7 from in total of 12 records (mean values μ < 0.1 and values of ±1.96σ < 0.1)."

We included 9,942 respondents aged 45 and above and retrospectively collected information on childhood adversities. Cognitive function was measured in three dimensions: orientation and calculation, immediate memory, and delayed memory. A structural equation model was employed for analysis.Age (β = -0.155, P<0.001) and mid to late depressive symptoms (β = -0.041, P<0.001) showed direct effects on cognitive decline. Low mid to late life socioeconomic status (SES) showed a direct effect on mid-late cognitive impairment (β = 0.603, P<0.001) and an indirect effect through depression (β = 0.007, P<0.001). Low childhood SES (β = 0.310, P<0.001), lack of friends (β = 0.208, P<0.001), parental mental health problems (β = 0.008, P<0.001), and poor relationship with parents (β = 0.001, P<0.001) had an indirect effect on cognitive impairment.Childhood adversities had negative effects on cognitive function among middle aged and elderly population in China. The findings suggest that early counter measures on childhood adversities may lead to an effective reduction of cognitive impairment."

This study aimed to investigate whether exercise training could attenuate diabetic renal injury via regulating endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. First, C57BL/6 mice were allocated into the control, diabetes, exercise, and diabetes + exercise groups. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Treadmill exercise continued for four weeks. Second, mice was allocated into the control, diabetes, H2S and diabetes + H2S groups. H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was intraperitoneally injected once daily for four weeks. STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited glomerular hypertrophy, tissue fibrosis and increased urine albumin levels, urine protein- and albumin-to-creatinine ratios, which were relieved by exercise training. Diabetic renal injury was associated with apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the enhanced caspase-3 activity, the increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling -positive cells and the reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, all of which were attenuated by exercise training. Exercise training enhanced renal sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in diabetic mice, accompanied by an inhibition of the p53-#ediated pro-apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, exercise training restored the STZ-mediated downregulation of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and the reduced renal H2S production. NaHS treatment restored SIRT1 expression, inhibited the p53-mediated pro-apoptotic pathway and attenuated diabetes-associated apoptosis and renal injury. In high glucose-treated MPC5 podocytes, NaHS treatment inhibited the p53-mediated pro-apoptotic pathway and podocyte apoptosis in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Collectively, exercise training upregulated CBS/CSE expression and enhanced the endogenous H2S production in renal tissues, thereby contributing to the modulation of the SIRT1/p53 apoptosis pathway and improvement of diabetic nephropathy."

We find a requirement for the ring finger protein Rnf43 not in normal development but in neonatal hypoxic injury and remyelination in the adult mammalian CNS. Rnf43, but not the related Znrf3, is potently activated by Wnt signaling in OL progenitor cells (OPCs) and marks activated OPCs in human MS and HIE. Rnf43 is required in an injury-specific context, and it promotes OPC differentiation through negative regulation of Wnt signal strength in OPCs at the level of Fzd1 receptor presentation on the cell surface.

Data were analyzed using an inductive grounded theory approach.25 rural counties in Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire.Study participants included 61 adult TGD community members and 23 HCPs working in the catchment area.Both community members and HCPs spoke of the need for connectedness and linkages among disparate health system components for gender-affirming health care. Participants expressed this priority through calls for systems-level improvements within existing services (e.g., expanded data collection, expanded mental health services, inclusive and affirming health care environments, and TGD staff). They also expressed the need for expanded TGD community outreach and engagement (e.g., incorporation of a patient feedback process, TGD health navigators, and resource mapping).Findings specifically reflect the perspectives of community members and HCPs in the rural New England area. Furthermore, the study sample was predominantly White non-Hispanic.Interventions to achieve accessible gender-affirming health care must address the diverse perspectives and needs of both community members and HCPs."
https://openalex.org/W3191612780,"Drowning is a global public health problem, but accurately estimating drowning risk remains a challenge. Coastal drowning comprises a significant proportion of the drowning burden in Australia and is influenced by a range of behavioural factors (e.g. risk perception, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours) that are poorly understood. These factors, along with those that impact exposure (e.g. coastal visitation and activity participation) all impact on drowning risk. While excellent mortality and morbidity data exists in Australia, a lack of coastal participation data presents challenges to identifying high-risk groups or activities and prioritising prevention efforts. This methods paper describes the development and evolution of an ongoing, annual, nationally representative online survey as an effective tool used to capture valuable data about the Australian population's relationship with the coast. This paper explores how the survey is structured (12-14 sections spanning multiple topics and themes), the different question types used (including open text, 4-digit responses and categorical questions), the sample size (1400-1600 respondents), sampling strategy (using demographic quota sampling which can then be post-weighted to the population if required) and how topics and themes have changed over time to enhance the quality of data collected (i.e., wording changes to enhance participant comprehension or data usability and changing issue-specific 'feature' topics of interest such as campaign evaluation). How the survey is implemented online is described, both practically through to third-party recruitment processes and ethically to maximise anonymity of respondents and ensure data quality. Interim analyses indicate the impact of considering exposure when calculating fatal drowning rates, especially by activity (e.g., crude boating drowning rate 0.12 per 100,000 population vs 0.95 per 100,000 exposed population [relative risk = 8.01; 95% confidence interval: 4.55-14.10]). This study highlights lessons learned in the process of conducting a nationally representative coastal participation survey as well as the strengths and limitations of adopting this approach. Data collected will provide more detailed information on the skills, behaviours, knowledge and attitudes of coastal activity participants. Analyses of this unique dataset will inform research that will underpin development and evaluation of coastal drowning prevention initiatives prioritising those most at risk. It is hoped that the methods detailed within this study may be useful for other countries to develop similar approaches to understanding their own population."

Recent data suggested a causative role of UA in endothelial cells (ECs) dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanism of high UA on thrombogenesis is unknown. We investigate whether high UA induce phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and microparticle (MP) shedding in cultured EC, and contribute to UA-induced hypercoagulable state. In the present study, we demonstrate that UA induces PS exposure and EMP release of EC in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which enhances the procoagulant activity (PCA) of EC and inhibited over 90% by lactadherin in vitro. Furthermore, hyperuricemic rat model was used to evaluate the development of thrombi following by flow stasis in the inferior vena cava (IVC). Hyperuricemia group is more likely to form large and hard thrombi compared with control. Importantly, we found that TMEM16F expression is significantly upregulated in UA-treated EC, which is crucial for UA-induced PS exposure and MP formation. Additionally, UA increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in EC, which might contribute to increased TMEM16F expression. Using confocal microscopy, we also observed disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that depolymerization of actin filaments might be required for TMEM16F activation and followed by PS exposure and membrane blebbing in UA-treated EC. Our results demonstrate a thrombotic role of EC in hyperuricemia through TMEM16F-mediated PS exposure and MPs release."
https://openalex.org/W3196138424,"TRAAK is a mechanosensitive two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channel localized to nodes of Ranvier in myelinated neurons. TRAAK deletion in mice results in mechanical and thermal allodynia, and gain-of-function mutations cause the human neurodevelopmental disorder FHEIG. TRAAK displays basal and stimulus-gated activities typical of K2Ps, but the mechanistic and structural differences between these modes are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that basal and mechanically gated openings are distinguished by their conductance, kinetics, and structure. Basal openings are low conductance, short duration, and due to a conductive channel conformation with the interior cavity exposed to the surrounding membrane. Mechanically gated openings are high conductance, long duration, and due to a channel conformation in which the interior cavity is sealed to the surrounding membrane. Our results explain how dual modes of activity are produced by a single ion channel and provide a basis for the development of state-selective pharmacology with the potential to treat disease."

Martín M.M. Solé-Violán J. Blanquer J. Labarta L. Díaz C. Borreguero-León J.M. Orbe J. Rodríguez J.A. Jiménez A. Páramo J.A.

Originally described as the first natural collagenase inhibitor (4Woolley D.E. Roberts D.R. Evanson J.M. Inhibition of human collagenase activity by a small molecular weight serum protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it was revealed that TIMP-1 is identical to erythroid-potentiating activity (5Docherty A.J. Lyons A. Smith B.J.

Subsequent studies revealed further effects of TIMP-1 on cells of the hematopoietic system, including B lymphoma cells (6Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wolff L. Wang J. Fukushima P. Mansoor A.

Interestingly, many of the observed TIMP-1-mediated effects were shown to be independent of its antiproteolytic activity (6Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wolff L. Wang J. Fukushima P. Mansoor A.

Several years later, it was discovered that C-terminal domain–mediated interaction of TIMP-1 with the tetraspanin CD63 (11Jung K.-K. Liu X.-W. Chirco R. Fridman R. Kim H.-R.C.

TIMP1 triggers neutrophil extracellular trap formation in pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2021; 81: 3568-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence, the multifunctionality of TIMP-1 was attributed to the existence of two physically distinct domains, the N-terminal domain mediating antiproteolytic activity as well as the C-terminal domain mediating signaling activity via CD63 (17Grünwald B. Schoeps B. Krüger A. Recognizing the molecular multifunctionality and interactome of TIMP-1.Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29: 6-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an abstract for a symposium, without provision of experimental data (18Moreira J.M. Høeberg M. Ulrik Lademann U. Viuff B. Jensen L.V. Stenvang J. Nygård S.B. Ørum-Madsen M.S. Vistesen M.V.

Identification and characterization of a new TIMP-1 binding protein [abstract].Cancer Res. 2015; 75 (Abstract nr P5-07-08)Google Scholar), it was suggested that invariant chain (CD74) may be a possible interaction partner of TIMP-1. CD74 is, like TIMP-1, associated with inflammatory diseases (19Farr L. Ghosh S. Moonah S. Role of MIF cytokine/CD74 receptor pathway in protecting against injury and promoting repair.Front. Immunol. 2020; 11: 1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is discussed as a therapeutic target in cancer (20Stein R. Mattes M.J. Cardillo T.M. Hansen H.J. Chang C.-H. Burton J.

Surviving the storm: Dealing with COVID-19.Cell. Immunol. 2020; 354: 104153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). CD74 plays an essential role in many biological processes (23Schröder B. The multifaceted roles of the invariant chain CD74--more than just a chaperone.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), including antigen presentation (24Stockinger B. Pessara U. Lin R.H. Habicht J. Grez M. Koch N.

Flavell R.A. Requirement for invariant chain in B cell maturation and function.Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Homotrimers of CD74 bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complexes to assist their assembly and subcellular localization (23Schröder B.

Cresswell P. Formation of a nine-subunit complex by HLA class II glycoproteins and the invariant chain.Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, MHC-free CD74 can also be found on the surface of immune cells (23Schröder B. The multifaceted roles of the invariant chain CD74--more than just a chaperone.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Koch N. Koch S. Hämmerling G.J. Ia invariant chain detected on lymphocyte surfaces by monoclonal antibody.Nature. 1982; 299: 644-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where it serves as the receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (28Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. MIF signal transduction initiated by binding to CD74.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Functionally, the MIF–CD74 interaction was shown to induce intracellular zeta chain–associated protein kinase-70 (ZAP-70) signaling in B lymphoma cells (29Klasen C. Ohl K. Sternkopf M. Shachar I. Schmitz C. Heussen N. Hobeika E. Levit-Zerdoun E. Tenbrock K. Reth M. Bernhagen J. El Bounkari O. MIF promotes B cell chemotaxis through the receptors CXCR4 and CD74 and ZAP-70 signaling.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 5273-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified CD74 as a functionally active receptor for TIMP-1, mediating cytokinic signaling activity of TIMP-1. Furthermore, we identified the antiproteolytic N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 to be a functional cytokinic interaction site as well. To investigate a possible TIMP-1–CD74-interaction, we overexpressed CD74 in the human LX-2 cell line, which resulted in highly increased RNA (Fig. 1A), total protein (Fig. 1B), as well as surface protein (Fig. 1C) levels of CD74. Physical interaction between TIMP-1 and CD74 could be demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation using the crude lysate of CD74-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, colocalization of fluorescently labeled TIMP-1 with CD74 was observed (Fig. 1E). Altogether, these data show that TIMP-1 binds to CD74. To shed light on possible interaction sites involved in TIMP-1–CD74 binding, we performed in silico molecular docking using the Haddock algorithm (30van Zundert G.C.P. Rodrigues J.P.G.L.M. Trellet M. Schmitz C. Kastritis P.L. Karaca E. Melquiond A.S.J. van Dijk M. de Vries S.J. Bonvin A.M.J.J. The HADDOCK2.2 web server: User-friendly integrative modeling of biomolecular complexes.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), which predicts the most likely conformation of two interacting molecules (Fig. 2A). For this, we used the full-length crystal structure of TIMP-1 (PDB ID: 1uea) (31Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Mechanism of inhibition of the human matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 by TIMP-1.Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and the trimerized extracellular domain of CD74 (PDB ID: 1iie) (32Jasanoff A. Wagner G. Wiley D.C. Structure of a trimeric domain of the MHC class II-associated chaperonin and targeting protein Ii.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6812-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of 10,000 randomly assigned interactions between TIMP-1 and CD74, the 200 energetically most favorable interactions were further refined by semiflexible annealing. The structures of these refined TIMP-1–CD74 complexes were compared and complexes with similar orientation were clustered. Of the resulting 22 clusters, the three, in respect to energetic considerations, best-ranked clusters (clusters 2, 8, and 13 (Table S1)) were further analyzed. To gain more insight in the binding sites that are involved in TIMP-1–CD74 interaction, we visualized a representative complex structure for each cluster (complex 2, complex 8, and complex 13) (Fig. 2B) and used the SpotOn algorithm, which identifies and classifies interfacial residues of protein–protein interactions (33Melo R. Fieldhouse R. Melo A. Correia J.D.G. Cordeiro M.N.D.S. Gümüş Z.H. Costa J. Bonvin A.M.J.J. Moreira I.S. A machine learning approach for hot-spot detection at protein-protein interfaces.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17: 1215Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Moreira I.S. Koukos P.I. Melo R. Almeida J.G. Preto A.J. Schaarschmidt J. Trellet M. Gümüş Z.H. Costa J. Bonvin A.M.J.J. SpotOn: High accuracy identification of protein-protein interface hot-spots.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 8007Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that, in complexes 8 and 13, TIMP-1 would interact with CD74 mainly via its N-terminal domain (Fig. 2B), including the wedge-shaped ridge at the N terminus of TIMP-1 (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A). This interaction was predicted to involve all three monomers of the CD74 homotrimer (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1B). In contrast, complex 2 suggested binding to CD74 only via the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 (Fig. 2, B and C and Fig. S1A). Interestingly, some of the suggested residues on CD74 that participate in the interaction with TIMP-1 (highlighted in Fig. S1B) were previously also predicted to be involved in binding of the MIF to CD74 (35Meza-Romero R. Benedek G. Leng L. Bucala R. Vandenbark A.A. Predicted structure of MIF/CD74 and RTL1000/CD74 complexes.Metab. Brain Dis. 2016; 31: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The in silico analysis suggested two possible binding orientations of TIMP-1 to CD74. First, binding to CD74 would be mediated via the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 (complex 8 and complex 13). Second, the interaction with CD74 would be mediated via the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 (complex 2). To experimentally validate one of the proposed binding mechanisms, we deleted the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 and used the purified N-terminal domain (N-TIMP-1) for in vitro studies. Confocal microscopy revealed that N-TIMP-1, similar to full-length TIMP-1 (Fig. 1B), colocalized with CD74 (Fig. 3A). This experimental approach demonstrates that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 is sufficient to bind to CD74, supporting the binding mechanism suggested by complexes 8 and 13. As a proof of concept, we aimed to investigate whether the identified TIMP-1–CD74 interaction also occurs in cells with natural expression of CD74. Analysis of published RNA-Seq data derived from the human protein atlas (36Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson Å. Kampf C. Sjöstedt E. Asplund A. Olsson I. Edlund K. Lundberg E. Navani S. Szigyarto C.A.-K. et al.Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) revealed that cells in the immune cell compartment, particularly B cells, highly expressed CD74 (Fig. S2). Therefore, we used the Namalwa human B lymphoma cell line, which highly expressed CD74 (Fig. S3A), for further studies on TIMP-1–CD74 interactions. Dot blot binding assays using cell lysates of Namalwa cells revealed, in comparison with the negative control BSA, markedly increased binding of CD74 to immobilized recombinant TIMP-1 to a similar extent as the positive control recombinant MIF (Fig. 3B). This increase was totally abolished when TIMP-1-coated dots were incubated with lysates from CD74 knockdown cells (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3, B and C). Furthermore, colocalization of fluorescently labeled TIMP-1 and CD74 in intact Namalwa cells was observed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C). Importantly, N-TIMP-1 was sufficient to bind to Namalwa-derived CD74 (Fig. 3D). Next, we examined whether the identified TIMP-1–CD74 interaction is functional. For this, we analyzed phosphorylation of ZAP-70, a known downstream effector of CD74 signaling in B lymphoma cells upon binding of MIF (29Klasen C. Ohl K. Sternkopf M. Shachar I. Schmitz C. Heussen N. Hobeika E. Levit-Zerdoun E. Tenbrock K. Reth M. Bernhagen J. El Bounkari O. MIF promotes B cell chemotaxis through the receptors CXCR4 and CD74 and ZAP-70 signaling.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 5273-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Namalwa cells with recombinant TIMP-1 triggered ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Importantly, TIMP-1-mediated ZAP-70 phosphorylation was dependent on CD74 because shRNAi-mediated knockdown of CD74 (Fig. 4B) completely abolished this effect (Fig. 4C). Of note, GAPDH and total ZAP-70 levels were not affected by TIMP-1 stimulation (Fig. S4). To further analyze the relevance of the above-identified interfacial residues of TIMP-1–CD74 interaction, we stimulated Namalwa cells with N-TIMP-1 and observed that the N-terminal domain was sufficient to trigger ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). The abovementioned complexes 8 and 13, which were identified to reflect the most probable binding mechanism, predicted a TIMP-1-binding region on CD74 that is similar to the previously published binding region of MIF on CD74 (35Meza-Romero R. Benedek G. Leng L. Bucala R. Vandenbark A.A. Predicted structure of MIF/CD74 and RTL1000/CD74 complexes.Metab. Brain Dis. 2016; 31: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because MIF–CD74 interaction can be blocked with the synthetic CD74-binding peptide C36L1 occupying this binding region on CD74 (37Figueiredo C.R. Azevedo R.A. Mousdell S. Resende-Lara P.T. Ireland L. Santos A. Girola N. Cunha R.L.O.R. Schmid M.C. Polonelli L. Travassos L.R. Mielgo A. Blockade of MIF-CD74 signalling on macrophages and dendritic cells restores the antitumour immune response against metastatic melanoma.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we used C36L1 to test for the plausibility of the in silico–revealed TIMP-1-interaction regions on CD74. Indeed, preincubation of cells with this peptide abolished TIMP-1–CD74-mediated ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 4E), indicating that the known cytokine-binding site on CD74 is involved in TIMP-1–CD74 interaction. Of note, we could exclude effects of the peptide on cell viability during the time frame of the experiment (Fig. S5). In this study, we identified CD74 as the functional receptor of TIMP-1. Interaction of TIMP-1 with CD74 was observed in lysates derived from cells of different origins, namely CD74-overexpressing hepatic stellate cells as well as Namalwa B lymphoma cells with natural expression of CD74. This finding was further supported by confocal microscopy revealing that fluorescently labeled exogenous TIMP-1 binds to the receptor CD74. The observation that not all TIMP-1 molecules colocalized with CD74 in cells points at additional TIMP-1-binding proteins. Indeed, several cell surface proteins are known to bind TIMP-1, including CD63 (11Jung K.-K. Liu X.-W. Chirco R. Fridman R. Kim H.-R.C. Identification of CD63 as a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 interacting cell surface protein.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3934-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), LRP-1 (38Thevenard J.

Rep. 2017; 7: 5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and ADAM10 (40Rapti M. Atkinson S.J. Lee M.H. Trim A. Moss M. Murphy G. The isolated N-terminal domains of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 are insufficient for ADAM10 inhibition.Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further molecular analyses on the identified interaction between TIMP-1 and CD74 led to the observation that TIMP-1 interacts with CD74 via its N-terminal domain because N-TIMP-1 alone was sufficient to bind to CD74 as well as trigger ZAP-70 activation. Still, molecular docking analyses indicated that some amino acids located in the C-terminal domain facing the wedge-shaped ridge of TIMP-1 (41Murphy G. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 233Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) possibly participate in the interaction with CD74 as well. Therefore, it is possible that these residues can be involved in modulation of the TIMP-1–CD74 interaction. Such contribution of amino acids of the C-terminal domain to the binding of TIMP-1 to other known N-terminal interaction partners has already been described in the context of its antiproteolytic activity because residues in the C-terminal domain are not decisive for, but involved in, fine-tuning of TIMP-1–metalloproteinase interactions (42Raeeszadeh-Sarmazdeh M. Greene K.A. Sankaran B. Downey G.P. Radisky D.C. Radisky E.S.

TIMP-1 is a multifunctional protein with versatile impact on cellular processes. Its functions result from its two-domain structure harboring metalloproteinase inhibitory as well as cytokine activities (17Grünwald B. Schoeps B. Krüger A. Recognizing the molecular multifunctionality and interactome of TIMP-1.Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29: 6-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). So far, the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 was almost entirely recognized to be responsible for the antiproteolytic function (10Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O’Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. The N-terminal domain of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases retains metalloproteinase inhibitory activity.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), while it emerged that the C-terminal domain is the mediator of its cytokinic activity (11Jung K.-K. Liu X.-W. Chirco R. Fridman R. Kim H.-R.C.

Rep. 2020; 10: 2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This appreciation now has to be revised as we here demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 binds to CD74 and triggers ZAP-70 activation in Namalwa B lymphoma cells. Thus, the multifunctionality of TIMP-1 expands beyond functional separation of two distinct domains because the N-terminal domain harbors both metalloproteinase inhibitory and cytokinic functions. CD74 is, like TIMP-1, highly expressed in inflammatory conditions (19Farr L. Ghosh S. Moonah S. Role of MIF cytokine/CD74 receptor pathway in protecting against injury and promoting repair.Front. Immunol. 2020; 11: 1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be involved in a multitude of biological processes (23Schröder B. The multifaceted roles of the invariant chain CD74--more than just a chaperone.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), including antigen presentation (24Stockinger B. Pessara U. Lin R.H. Habicht J. Grez M. Koch N.

So far, the only known ligand of CD74 was the proinflammatory cytokine MIF, and MIF–CD74 interaction was shown to induce ZAP-70 signaling in B lymphoma cells (29Klasen C. Ohl K. Sternkopf M.

The activity of multinational corporations (MNCs) has become a primary driver of globalisation, shaping these relationships through vast networks of firms and their subsidiaries. Extensive empirical research has suggested that globalisation is not a singular process, and that variation in the intensity of international economic interactions can be captured by ‘multiple globalisations’, however how this differs across industry sectors has remained unclear. This paper analyses how sectoral variation in the ‘structural architecture’ of international economic relations can be understood using a combination of social network analysis (SNA) measures based on firm-subsidiary ownership linkages. Applying an approach that combines network-level measures (Density, Clustering, Degree, Assortativity) in ways yet to be explored in the spatial networks literature, a typology of four idealised international network structures is presented to allow for comparison between sectors. All sectoral networks were found to be disassortative, indicating that international networks based on intraorganisational ties are characterised by a core-periphery structure, with professional services sectors such as Banks and Insurance being the most hierarchically differentiated. Retail sector networks, including Food &amp; Staples Retailing, are the least clustered while the two most clustered networks—Materials and Capital Goods—have also the highest average degree, evidence of their extensive globalisations. Our findings suggest that the multiple globalisations characterising international economic interactions can be better understood through the ‘structural architecture’ of sectoral variation, which result from the advantages conferred by cross-border activity within each."
https://openalex.org/W3188003881,"Transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) is highly concentrated in the aqueous humor of primary open-angle glaucoma patients. TGF-β2 causes fibrosis of outflow tissues, such as the trabecular meshwork (TM), and increases intraocular pressure by increasing resistance to aqueous humor outflow. Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was investigated in fibrosis in various tissues, revealing that HDAC inhibitors suppress tissue fibrosis. However, the effect of HDAC inhibitors on fibrosis in the eye was not determined. Here, we investigated the effect of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an HDAC inhibitor, on TGF-β2-induced increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow. We found that SAHA suppressed TGF-β2-induced outflow resistance in perfused porcine eyes. Moreover, SAHA cotreatment suppressed TGF-β2-induced ocular hypertension in rabbits. The permeability of monkey TM (MTM) and Schlemm's canal (MSC) cell monolayers was decreased by TGF-β2 treatment. SAHA inhibited the effects of TGF-β2 on the permeability of these cells. TGF-β2 also increased the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen type I or IV) in MTM, MSC, and human TM (HTM) cells, while SAHA inhibited TGF-β2-induced extracellular matrix protein expression in these cells. SAHA also inhibited TGF-β2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, but did not inhibit Smad2/3 phosphorylation, the canonical pathway of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, SAHA induced the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog, a PI3K/Akt signaling factor, as well as bone morphogenetic protein 7, an endogenous antagonist of TGF-β. These results imply that SAHA prevents TGF-β2-induced increases in outflow resistance and regulates the non-Smad pathway of TGF-β signaling in TM and MSC cells."

Epigenetics in Pregnancy (EPIPREG) is a population-based sample with the aim to study associations between DNA-methylation in pregnancy and cardiometabolic traits in South Asian and European pregnant women and their offspring. This cohort profile paper aims to present our sample with genetic and epigenetic data and invite researchers with similar cohorts to collaborative projects, such as replication of ours or their results and meta-analysis. In EPIPREG we have quantified epigenome-wide DNA methylation in maternal peripheral blood leukocytes in gestational week 28±1 in Europeans (n = 312) and South Asians (n = 168) that participated in the population-based cohort STORK Groruddalen, in Norway. DNA methylation was measured with Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850k sites), with technical validation of four CpG sites using bisulphite pyrosequencing in a subset (n = 30). The sample is well characterized with few missing data on e.g. genotype, universal screening for gestational diabetes, objectively measured physical activity, bioelectrical impedance, anthropometrics, biochemical measurements, and a biobank with maternal serum and plasma, urine, placenta tissue. In the offspring, we have repeated ultrasounds during pregnancy, cord blood, and anthropometrics up to 4 years of age. We have quantified DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes in nearly all eligible women from the STORK Groruddalen study, to minimize the risk of selection bias. Genetic principal components distinctly separated Europeans and South Asian women, which fully corresponded with the self-reported ethnicity. Technical validation of 4 CpG sites from the methylation bead chip showed good agreement with bisulfite pyrosequencing. We plan to study associations between DNA methylation and cardiometabolic traits and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3191078942,"The study of prions and the discovery of candidate therapeutics for prion disease have been facilitated by the ability of prions to replicate in cultured cells. Paradigms in which prion proteins from different species are expressed in cells with low or no expression of endogenous prion protein (PrP) have expanded the range of prion strains that can be propagated. In these systems, cells stably expressing a PrP of interest are typically generated via coexpression of a selectable marker and treatment with an antibiotic. Here, we report the unexpected discovery that the aminoglycoside G418 (Geneticin) interferes with the ability of stably transfected cultured cells to become infected with prions. In G418-resistant lines of N2a or CAD5 cells, the presence of G418 reduced levels of protease-resistant PrP following challenge with the RML or 22L strains of mouse prions. G418 also interfered with the infection of cells expressing hamster PrP with the 263K strain of hamster prions. Interestingly, G418 had minimal to no effect on protease-resistant PrP levels in cells with established prion infection, arguing that G418 selectively interferes with de novo prion infection. As G418 treatment had no discernible effect on cellular PrP levels or its localization, this suggests that G418 may specifically target prion assemblies or processes involved in the earliest stages of prion infection."
https://openalex.org/W3188293179,"Based on the type-II fuzzy logic, this paper proposes a robust adaptive fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for multisensor faults in the variable structure hypersonic vehicles with parameter uncertainties. Type-II fuzzy method approximates the original models while eliminating the parameter uncertainties. Hence the sensor faults are detected and isolated by the multiple output residuals and thresholds considering nonlinear approximation errors and disturbance. Based on the fuzzy adaptive augmented observer, the faults and disturbance are all estimated accurately by an improved proportional-differential part. Then a variable structure FTC scheme repairs the faults by the estimation, the fast-varying disturbance is considered in FTC scheme and is compensated by the control parameters designed based on its derivative function, thereby enhancing the output robust tracking accuracy of the variable structure hypersonic vehicles. The Lyapunov theory proves the system robust stability, semi-physical simulation verifies the validity of the proposed method and the superiority compared with the traditional method."
https://openalex.org/W3191084366,"Given a trained deep graph convolution network (GCN), how can we effectively compress it into a compact network without significant loss of accuracy? Compressing a trained deep GCN into a compact GCN is of great importance for implementing the model to environments such as mobile or embedded systems, which have limited computing resources. However, previous works for compressing deep GCNs do not consider the multi-hop aggregation of the deep GCNs, though it is the main purpose for their multiple GCN layers. In this work, we propose MustaD (Multi-staged knowledge Distillation), a novel approach for compressing deep GCNs to single-layered GCNs through multi-staged knowledge distillation (KD). MustaD distills the knowledge of 1) the aggregation from multiple GCN layers as well as 2) task prediction while preserving the multi-hop feature aggregation of deep GCNs by a single effective layer. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that MustaD provides the state-of-the-art performance compared to other KD based methods. Specifically, MustaD presents up to 4.21%p improvement of accuracy compared to the second-best KD models."

Glaucoma is the ocular complication of diabetic illness. In addition to this, retinopathy, maculopathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, extra-ocular muscle palsy, iridocyclitis, and rubeosis iridis were other complications. This study aims to determine the impact of diabetes on visual impairment and blindness among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.This hospital-based cross-sectional study includes 401 samples of diabetic patients in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 2017 to January 2019. The multinomial logistic regression model was employed to identify significant differences among the factor variables.The magnitude of blindness was 32.17%, and the burden of severe visual impairment was 12.46%. Of the total patients, 120(29.9%) were have diabetic retinopathy of whom, 113(94.2%) were blind either in the right, left, or both eyes and 3 (2.5%) had severe visual impairment. One hundred twenty-six (31.42%) patients developed diabetic maculopathy of whom, 117 (92.85%) were blind either in the right or left eye, and one (0.8%) had severe visual impairment. From the whole diabetic patients, the magnitude of glaucoma was 186(46.38%), and from the patients who developed glaucoma was blind visual impairment 127(68.27%) either in the right or left eye. Thirty-eight (20.34%) had severe visual impairment. Glaucoma was significantly associated with severe visual impairment and blindness (p<0.001). Glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, maculopathy, and type of diabetes are factors for visual impairment.We found that visual impairment in the category of severe and blindness are frequent in Ethiopian diabetic patients. Glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, maculopathy are the main predictive factors that determine the occurrence of blindness."
https://openalex.org/W3193089943,"SETD2 is an important methyltransferase that methylates crucial substrates such as histone H3, tubulin, and STAT1 and also physically interacts with transcription and splicing regulators such as Pol II and various hnRNPs. Of note, SETD2 has a functionally uncharacterized extended N-terminal region, the removal of which leads to its stabilization. How this region regulates SETD2 half-life is unclear. Here we show that SETD2 consists of multiple long disordered regions across its length that cumulatively destabilize the protein by facilitating its proteasomal degradation. SETD2 disordered regions can reduce the half-life of the yeast homolog Set2 in mammalian cells as well as in yeast, demonstrating the importance of intrinsic structural features in regulating protein half-life. In addition to the shortened half-life, by performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay we found that SETD2 forms liquid droplets in vivo, another property associated with proteins that contain disordered regions. The phase-separation behavior of SETD2 is exacerbated upon the removal of its N-terminal segment and results in activator-independent histone H3K36 methylation. Our findings reveal that disordered region-facilitated proteolysis is an important mechanism governing SETD2 function."

https://openalex.org/W3194565579,"Introduction Adolescence is the time of puberty in which a substantial changes in physical, mental, and emotional are observed; Nutritional requirements significantly rise as a result. Even though improving adolescent girls’ nutritional status helps to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, many studies in Ethiopia focus on determining the nutritional status of under-five and pregnant women and even they don’t show disparities between urban and rural adolescent girls. Thus, this study was aimed at comparing the rural and urban prevalence’s of stunting and thinness and their associated factors among adolescent girls attending school in Debark district, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Method A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 792 adolescent girls from February 25 th to March 21 st 2020. A multi-stage sampling followed by simple random sampling technique was used. Data were collected through a face-to-face interviewer-based questionnaire. Different anthropometric measurements were taken. The collected data were entered to Epi-data and exported into SPSS for analyses. Variables with p-values &lt; 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were exported to multivariable logistic regression model to control confounders and identify the factor. The strength of association and statistical significance was declared using the adjusted odds ratios with its corresponding 95% CI, and p-value ≤ 0.05 respectively. Results A total of 757 adolescent girls with a response rate of 95.6% were participated in the study. The overall prevalence of stunting and thinness were 20.1% and 10.3%, respectively. Stunting among rural adolescent girls was 24.2%; whereas it was 16% among urban residents. Likewise, thinness among rural adolescent girls was 8.5%; whereas it was 12.1% among urban dwellers. No latrine [AOR: 1.95 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.43)], lowest media exposure [AOR: 5.14 (95% CI: 1.16, 22.74)], lower wealth class [AOR:2.58 (95% CI: 1.310, 5.091)], and middle wealth class[AOR: 2.37 (95% CI: 1.230, 4.554)] have risen the likelihood of stunting in rural setting while early adolescent age [AOR:3.17 (95% CI:1.445,6.95)] significantly associated with stunting in urban setting. Food insecurity [AOR: 1.95 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.78)] was associated with stunting in overall adolescent girls. Middle adolescent age groups in rural area have more than three times to experience thinness [AOR: 3.67 (95% CI: 1. 21, 11.149)]. Whereas urban resident girls fall in early adolescent age group developed thinness were eight times [AOR: 8.39 (95% CI: 2.48–28.30)]. Conclusion Stunting was higher among rural adolescent girls as compared to urban. However, thinness was higher among urban dwellers. Lower wealth class, food insecurity, lowest media exposure, and age were significantly associated with stunting and thinness. Hence, increasing latrine coverage, boosting the economic status of the community, and increasing media exposure for adolescent girls should get due attention."
https://openalex.org/W3195417582,"Proper physiological function of mammalian airways requires the differentiation of basal stem cells into secretory or multiciliated cells, among others. In addition, the self-renewal ability of these basal stem cells is crucial for developing a quick response to toxic agents in order to re-establish the epithelial barrier function of the airways. Although these epithelial missions are vital, little is known about those mechanism controlling airway epithelial regeneration in health and disease. p53 has been recently proposed as the guardian of homeostasis, promoting differentiation programs, and antagonizing a de-differentiation program. Here, we exploit mouse and human tracheal epithelial cell culture models to study the role of MDM2-p53 signaling in self-renewal and differentiation in the airway epithelium. We show that p53 protein regulation by MDM2 is crucial for basal stem cell differentiation and to keep proper cell proliferation. Therefore, we suggest that MDM2/p53 interaction modulation is a potential target to control regeneration of the mammalian airway epithelia without massively affecting the epithelium integrity and differentiation potential."
https://openalex.org/W3157825400,"Drought is a natural hazard that affects crops by inducing water stress. Water stress, induced by drought accounts for more loss in crop yield than all the other causes combined. With the increasing frequency and intensity of droughts worldwide, it is essential to develop drought-resistant crops to ensure food security. In this paper, we model multiple drought signaling pathways in Arabidopsis using Bayesian networks to identify potential regulators of drought-responsive reporter genes. Genetically intervening at these regulators can help develop drought-resistant crops. We create the Bayesian network model from the biological literature and determine its parameters from publicly available data. We conduct inference on this model using a stochastic simulation technique known as likelihood weighting to determine the best regulators of drought-responsive reporter genes. Our analysis reveals that activating MYC2 or inhibiting ATAF1 are the best single node intervention strategies to regulate the drought-responsive reporter genes. Additionally, we observe simultaneously activating MYC2 and inhibiting ATAF1 is a better strategy. The Bayesian network model indicated that MYC2 and ATAF1 are possible regulators of the drought response. Validation experiments showed that ATAF1 negatively regulated the drought response. Thus intervening at ATAF1 has the potential to create drought-resistant crops."

The pRNFL thicknesses were compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors affecting pRNFL thickness in subjects with and without HTN.The mean pRNFL thicknesses were 93.9±8.8, 88.7±6.8, 86.4±8.1, and 82.5±9.6 μm in group 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and differed significantly (P<0.001). On multivariate linear regression analyses, age (β = -0.181, P = 0.044), axial length (β = -1.491, P<0.001), and HTN (β = -4.876, P = 0.044) significantly affected pRNFL thickness. Additionally, age and axial length affected the pRNFL thickness in subjects with HTN (age, β = -0.254, P = 0.020; axial length, β = -1.608, P<0.001) much more than in subjects without HTN (age, β = -0.028, P = 0.712; axial length, β = -1.324, P<0.001).High myopia and HTN affected pRNFL reduction and a combination of the 2 diseases exacerbated pRNFL damage.

A total of 589 participants were chosen by systematic sampling technique. Data was collected by utilizing Amharic version interviewer-administered structured and semi-structured questioners. Depression and anxiety were assessed by using hospital anxiety and depression scale. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to recognize variables related to both depression and anxiety. Association was described by using ""adjusted odds ratio"" (AOR) along with 95% full Confidence interval (CI). Finally, P-values < 0.05 in adjusted analysis were taken as a cut off for significant association.Out of 556 participants included in the study, 30.9%, 33.1% had depression and anxiety respectively. Being divorced/widowed (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI, 1.18-4.99), using two and above number of antiepileptic medications (AOR = 1.77,95% CI,1.02-3.09), very frequent seizure frequency (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI,1.30-5.51), current substance use (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI, 1.03-3.22), perceived stigma (AOR = 5.67,95% CI,3.14-8.18), and hazardous alcohol use (AOR = 2.84, 95% CI,1.32-6.09) were statistically associated with depression.

https://openalex.org/W3193278314,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kirs) are important drug targets, with antagonists for the Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and pancreatic Kir6.2/SUR1 channels being potential drug candidates for treating hypertension, depression, and diabetes, respectively. However, few peptide toxins acting on Kirs are identified and their interacting mechanisms remain largely elusive yet. Herein, we showed that the centipede toxin SsTx-4 potently inhibited the Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and Kir6.2/SUR1 channels with nanomolar to submicromolar affinities and intensively studied the molecular bases for toxin-channel interactions using patch-clamp analysis and site-directed mutations. Other Kirs including Kir2.1 to 2.4, Kir4.2, and Kir7.1 were resistant to SsTx-4 treatment. Moreover, SsTx-4 inhibited the inward and outward currents of Kirs with different potencies, possibly caused by a K+ ""knock-off"" effect, suggesting the toxin functions as an out pore blocker physically occluding the K+-conducting pathway. This conclusion was further supported by a mutation analysis showing that M137 located in the outer vestibule of the Kir6.2/ΔC26 channel was the key residue mediating interaction with SsTx-4. On the other hand, the molecular determinants within SsTx-4 for binding these Kir channels only partially overlapped, with K13 and F44 being the common key residues. Most importantly, K11A, P15A, and Y16A mutant toxins showed improved affinity and/or selectivity toward Kir6.2, while R12A mutant toxin had increased affinity for Kir4.1. To our knowledge, SsTx-4 is the first characterized peptide toxin with Kir4.1 inhibitory activity. This study provides useful insights for engineering a Kir6.2/SUR1 channel-specific antagonist based on the SsTx-4 template molecule and may be useful in developing new antidiabetic drugs."

No significant difference was detected between in vivo- and in vitro cultures of the same nematode species. The LD 50 of the in vitro -cultured S . yirgalemense , was 7.33 nematodes per larva. Mortality by infection was established by dissecting L . vanillana cadavers and confirming the presence of nematodes, which was &gt; 90% for all treatments. Within in vitro cultures, both S . yirgalemense and S . jeffreyense were able to produce a new cohort of infective juveniles from L . vanillana larvae. Pupae, however, were found to be considerably less susceptible to EPN infection. This is the first study on the use of EPNs to control L . vanillana .

https://openalex.org/W3191282290,"Phosphorylation (activation) and dephosphorylation (deactivation) of the slit diaphragm proteins NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are critical for maintaining the kidney epithelial podocyte actin cytoskeleton and, therefore, proper glomerular filtration. However, the mechanisms underlying these events remain largely unknown. Here we show that NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are novel receptor proteins for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and can be phosphorylated independently of the mesenchymal epithelial transition receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion through engagement of their extracellular domains by HGF. Furthermore, we demonstrate SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2-dependent dephosphorylation of these proteins. To establish HGF as a ligand, purified baculovirus-expressed NEPHRIN and NEPH1 recombinant proteins were used in surface plasma resonance binding experiments. We report high-affinity interactions of NEPHRIN and NEPH1 with HGF, although NEPHRIN binding was 20-fold higher than that of NEPH1. In addition, using molecular modeling we constructed peptides that were used to map specific HGF-binding regions in the extracellular domains of NEPHRIN and NEPH1. Finally, using an in vitro model of cultured podocytes and an ex vivo model of Drosophila nephrocytes, as well as chemically induced injury models, we demonstrated that HGF-induced phosphorylation of NEPHRIN and NEPH1 is centrally involved in podocyte repair. Taken together, this is the first study demonstrating a receptor-based function for NEPHRIN and NEPH1. This has important biological and clinical implications for the repair of injured podocytes and the maintenance of podocyte integrity."

Promoting specific GPCR signaling events with biased agonists or allosteric modulators is a potentially innovative way to treat numerous conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes as well as neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders (28Kenakin T. The potential for selective pharmacological therapies through biased receptor signaling.BMC Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2012; 13: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence, this notion has been introduced into various drug discovery programs through theoretical predictions based on known signaling components of cells and from studies in knockout animals (reviewed in (29Kenakin T. Functional selectivity and biased receptor signaling.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar)). However, there are numerous instances where it is still not yet possible to predict what type of signaling bias represents a superior therapeutic approach. In these cases, empirical testing of exemplar molecules in animal models is a way forward. Such tools are currently unavailable in the context of the urotensinergic system. Pepducins are lipidated cell-penetrating peptides composed of a lipid moiety attached to a peptide corresponding to an amino acid segment from one of the cytoplasmic loops of a GPCR of interest (reviewed in (30Chaturvedi M.

Sci. 2011; 1226: 34-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Following establishment of an equilibrium between the inner and outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer, pepducins interact with their cognate GPCR leading to stabilization of a restricted subset of its inactive and active conformational states (32Carlson K.

Koukos G. Tchernychev B. Jacques S.L. Covic L. Kuliopulos A. Pharmacology, biodistribution, and efficacy of GPCR-based pepducins in disease models.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 683: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the design and pharmacological characterization of two pepducins derived from the second (hUT-Pep2) and third ([Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3) intracellular loops of hUT. Our results demonstrate that both hUT-derived pepducins, while noncytotoxic, mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IP1 accumulation. Using BRET-based biosensors, we observed that [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 induced Gq, Gi, G13, β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2 activation, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation while UT-Pep2 only activated Gi, G13, β-arrestin-2 and EGFR transactivation. Interestingly, while only [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 was able to induce proliferation in HEK 293-hUT cells, both pepducins were able to cause proliferation of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. Further, while both hUT-derived pepducins were unable to induce rat aortic ring contraction on their own, they could modulate hUII- and URP-mediated contraction to different extents. These new molecular tools represent unique UT-targeted ligands that can be used to interrogate the involvement of specific pathways in hUT-associated diseases and to develop pharmacological agents with fewer side effects and a unique and more precise action for the treatment of various pathologies. Pepducins are composed of a synthetic peptide, mimicking an intracellular GPCR loop, to which a hydrophobic moiety, most commonly the fully saturated C16 fatty acid palmitate, is conjugated at their N-termini (39O'Callaghan K. Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Turning receptors on and off with intracellular pepducins: New insights into G-protein-coupled receptor drug development.J. Biol.

Prediction of the three-dimensional structure for the rat urotensin II receptor, and comparison of the antagonist binding sites and binding selectivity between human and rat receptors from atomistic simulations.ChemMedChem. 2010; 5: 1594-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Brancaccio D.

An investigation into the origin of the biased agonism associated with the urotensin II receptor activation.J. Pept. Sci. 2015; 21: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), pepducins derived from the sequence of hUT intracellular loops 2 and 3 (Table 1) were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis. hUT-Pep2 is identical to the ICL2 sequence found in hUT. The second pepducin ([Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3) comprises the hUT ICL3 sequence; however, the first two N-terminal amino acids were replaced by the corresponding residues from rat UT ICL3 (-Arg-Arg-in hUT and -Trp-Leu- in rUT). This modification was necessary since the pepducin derived from hUT ICL3, comprising seven positively charged residues, was highly cytotoxic from 10−7 M, which prevented further use (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, hUT-Pep2 and [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3, up to 10−5 M, did not significantly affect HEK 293 cell viability (Fig. 1A). However, at 10−4 M, both derivatives were as cytotoxic as unmodified hUT-Pep3 at 10−7 M. Since these derivatives translocate to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, we tested the possibility that they promoted LDH release into the culture media. As shown in Figure 1B, none of these compounds, tested at the highest concentration (10−5 M) that did not lead to cell death, triggered LDH release. Altogether, our results demonstrated that both pepducins did not reduce cell viability at the concentrations used. Similar results were obtained in a second stably transfected CHO-hUT cell line (data not shown).Table 1Amino acid sequences and analytical data of compounds hUII, URP, and hUT-derived pepducinsCpd nameSequenceMWaMolecular weight calculated on a CEM Liberty Blue peptide synthesizer software. calcMSbMALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis (m/z). foundhUIIH-Glu-Thr-Pro-Asp-[Cys-Phe-Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys]-Val-OH1387.61388.1URPH-Ala-[Cys-Phe-Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys]-Val-OH1016.41016.4hUT-Pep2Palm-Arg-Pro-Leu-Asp-Thr-Val-Gln-Arg-Pro-Lys-Gly-Tyr-NH21666.01667.1[Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3Palm-Trp-Leu-Ser-Gln-Arg-Ala-Ser-Phe-Lys-Arg-Ala-Arg-Arg-NH21899.31899.9Abbreviation: Palm, palmitoyl.Values represent the observed m/z of the monoisotope [M + H]+ ions.a Molecular weight calculated on a CEM Liberty Blue peptide synthesizer software.b MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis (m/z).

Conformational analysis of hUT-Pep2 and [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 was performed using solution NMR in DPC micelle suspensions, a solvent system commonly used in NMR and CD studies to mimic the zwitterionic membrane environment (40Saviello M.R. Malfi S. Campiglia P. Cavalli A. Grieco P. Novellino E. Carotenuto A. New insight into the mechanism of action of the temporin antimicrobial peptides.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Figures of the NOESY spectra of hUT-Pep2 and [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 are shown in the supporting information (Figs. S1 and S2). hUT-Pep2 yielded well-resolved NMR spectra and measured NMR parameters indicated a folded structure (Tables S1 and S2). In particular, medium-range Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs, Table S2) between Hα(i) and HN(i+2) pointed to β-turn structures confirmed by other diagnostic parameters, such as amide temperature coefficients and 3JHN-HA coupling constants. The palmitate moiety turned out to be mostly unstructured, as could be inferred by the degeneracy of the proton chemical shifts of almost all the methylene groups. However, the amide bond connecting palmitate and peptide is in trans configuration as suggested by the intense NOE contact between the Cα protons of the palmitate and NH of Arg1. Actually, 135 NOEs (Table S2) were used in the structure calculation of hUT-Pep2, which corresponds to 11.2 NOEs per residue, a ratio similar to what is found in structured protein (41Doreleijers J.F. Rullmann J.A. Kaptein R. Quality assessment of NMR structures: A statistical survey.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Among those, 22 medium range NOEs in line with folded (β-turn) peptides were observed. Restrained MD calculations provided the well-defined structures shown in Figure 2A. Starting from the N-terminus, two type I β-turns along residues 1–4 and 3–6 and three distorted (type IV) β-turns along residues 4–7, 5–8, and 6–9 can be observed in the simulated structures of hUT-Pep2. Interestingly, the obtained structure can be easily overlapped with the corresponding ICL2 segment of a hUT model recently generated (Fig. 2B) (15Brancaccio D. Merlino F. Limatola A. Yousif A.M. Gomez-Monterrey I. Campiglia P. Novellino E. Grieco P. Carotenuto A. An investigation into the origin of the biased agonism associated with the urotensin II receptor activation.J. Pept. Sci. 2015; 21: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). hUT-Pep2 therefore preserves the conformational propensities of the corresponding ICL2 segment when embedded in the wild-type receptor. Unfortunately, NMR spectra of [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3, despite complete assignment of all the proton resonances (Table S3), showed many broad and overlapping signals particularly in the amide proton region that prevented measure of many NMR parameters (3JHN-HA coupling constants and most of the NOEs), and therefore NMR-based calculation of its 3D structure. However, retrievable NMR parameters from the spectra (a few NOEs, up-field shifts of the Hα resonances, and amide temperature coefficients, Tables S3 and S4) suggest a high tendency of [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 to fold into a helix. Using circular dichroism (CD) analyses, we were able to observe that [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3, under any condition tested, was able to assume folded structural motifs (Fig. 2C). In 0.1 mg mL−1 SDS solution (red), it appeared to assume a β-sheet conformation (lower peak at 216 nm), while in TFE solutions it appeared to fold as an α-helix (dark green, TFE 80%, lower peaks at 205 and 216 nm). In 0.5 mg mL−1 DPC solution, it appeared to assume a less structured α-helix conformation, which correlates with our NMR data, while in water a nonstructured shape (random coil) was adopted. Worth noting, a pepducin derived from the ICL3 of PAR1 studied in DPC solutions also showed a stable helical conformation (42Zhang P. Leger A.J. Baleja J.D. Rana R. Corlin T. Nguyen N. Koukos G. Bohm A. Covic L. Kuliopulos A. Allosteric activation of a G protein-coupled receptor with cell-penetrating receptor mimetics.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15785-15798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that both pepducins likely adopt conformations closely related to those found within the wild-type receptor. hUT-mediated production of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate metabolite inositol monophosphate (IP1) was quantified in CHO-hUT cells using the IP-One terbium immunoassay. In agreement with previously reported data (43Brule C. Perzo N. Joubert J.E. Sainsily X. Leduc R. Castel H. Prezeau L. Biased signaling regulates the pleiotropic effects of the urotensin II receptor to modulate its cellular behaviors.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 5148-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we observed that hUII induced a time-dependent increase in IP1 that reached a plateau after 40 min (Fig. 3A). Concentration–response curves, constructed after 40 min incubation, revealed that hUT-Pep2 and [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 induced IP1 production in CHO cells stably expressing hUT (Fig. 3B) but not untransfected CHO-K1 cells after a similar period of incubation (Fig. S3). Compared with hUII (pEC50 = 12.54 ± 0.06; Emax = 97 ± 1), hUT-Pep2 and [Trp1, Leu2]hUT-Pep3 appeared to be less potent (pEC50 < 6)"
https://openalex.org/W3191872122,"Impaired dark adaptation (DA), a defect in the ability to adjust to dimly lit settings, is a universal hallmark of aging. However, the mechanisms responsible for impaired DA are poorly understood. Vitamin A byproducts, such as vitamin A dimers, are small molecules that form in the retina during the vitamin A cycle. We show that later in life, in the human eye, these byproducts reach levels commensurate with those of vitamin A. In mice, selectively inhibiting the formation of these byproducts, with the investigational drug C20D3-vitamin A, results in faster DA. In contrast, acutely increasing these ocular byproducts through exogenous delivery leads to slower DA, with otherwise preserved retinal function and morphology. Our findings reveal that vitamin A cycle byproducts alone are sufficient to cause delays in DA and suggest that they may contribute to universal age-related DA impairment. Our data further indicate that the age-related decline in DA may be tractable to pharmacological intervention by C20D3-vitamin A."

Literature suggests a possible higher incidence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is, however, no consensus on this purported risk nor a well-defined mechanism. This study investigates how collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a validated animal model of RA, impacts infectious burden in a well-established model of PJI. Methods Control mice were compared against CIA mice. Whole blood samples were collected to quantify systemic IgG levels via ELISA. Ex vivo respiratory burst function was measured via dihydrorhodamine assay. Ex vivo Staphylococcus aureus Xen36 burden was measured directly via colony forming unit (CFU) counts and crystal violet assay to assess biofilm formation. In vivo , surgical placement of a titanium implant through the knee joint and inoculation with S . aureus Xen36 was performed. Bacterial burden was then quantified by longitudinal bioluminescent imaging. Results Mice with CIA demonstrated significantly higher levels of systemic IgG compared with control mice (p = 0.003). Ex vivo , there was no significant difference in respiratory burst function (p = 0.89) or S . aureus bacterial burden as measured by CFU counts (p = 0.91) and crystal violet assay (p = 0.96). In vivo , no significant difference in bacterial bioluminescence between groups was found at all postoperative time points. CFU counts of both the implant and the peri-implant tissue were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.82 and 0.80, respectively). Conclusion This study demonstrated no significant difference in S . aureus infectious burden between mice with CIA and control mice. These results suggest that untreated, active RA may not represent a significant intrinsic risk factor for PJI, however further mechanistic translational and clinical studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3194610062,"Studies focused on comprehensive assessment of self-perceived competency of community pharmacists to manage minor ailments are scanty despite that self-perceived competency is a valid determinant of task performance. The objectives of the study were to assess community pharmacists' self-perceived competency to manage fourteen common minor ailments in Qatar, and identify its significant predictors. A cross-sectional assessment of 307 community pharmacists was conducted with a pre-tested 20-item questionnaire. Self-perceived competency was assessed with nine elements on a scale of 1-10 (Maximum obtainable score: Each minor ailment = 90; each element = 140). Mann-Whitney U and bivariate logistic regression were used for data analyses. The response rate was 91.9% (282/307). The majority of the respondents were males (68.1%; 192/282), within the age range of 31-40 years (55.3%; 156/282). The minor ailments with the highest median competency score were constipation (76), and cold/catarrh (75) while travel sickness (69), and ringworm (69) had the lowest. The two condition-specific competency elements with the highest median score were recommendation of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines (115), and provision of instructions to guide its use (115). Ability to differentiate minor ailments from other medical conditions had the lowest median competency score (109). The significant predictors self-perceived competency were female gender (OR = 2.39, 95%CI: 1.34-4.25, p = 0.003), and working for chain pharmacies (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.30-4.96, p = 0.006). Overall, Community pharmacists' self-perceived competency was adequate for majority of the common minor ailments, and it was highest for constipation and cold/catarrh, and specifically for the recommendation of OTC medicines and provision of instructions to guide its use. However, diagnostic ability to differentiate minor ailments from other medical conditions with similar features had the lowest median competency score. Female gender and working in chain pharmacies were the significant predictors of self-perceived competency to manage minor ailments."
https://openalex.org/W3192332449,"Cell adhesion is tightly controlled in multicellular organisms, for example, through proteolytic ectodomain shedding of the adhesion-mediating cell surface transmembrane proteins. In the brain, shedding of cell adhesion proteins is required for nervous system development and function, but the shedding of only a few adhesion proteins has been studied in detail in the mammalian brain. One such adhesion protein is the transmembrane protein endoglycan (PODXL2), which belongs to the CD34-family of highly glycosylated sialomucins. Here, we demonstrate that endoglycan is broadly expressed in the developing mouse brains and is proteolytically shed in vitro in mouse neurons and in vivo in mouse brains. Endoglycan shedding in primary neurons was mediated by the transmembrane protease a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), but not by its homolog ADAM17. Functionally, endoglycan deficiency reduced the branching of neurites extending from primary neurons in vitro, whereas deletion of ADAM10 had the opposite effect and increased neurite branching. Taken together, our study discovers a function for endoglycan in neurite branching, establishes endoglycan as an ADAM10 substrate and suggests that ADAM10 cleavage of endoglycan may contribute to neurite branching."
https://openalex.org/W3193736257,"This study proposes a methodical approach to model desired speed distributions under different road-weather and traffic conditions followed by identification of road-weather conditions with potentially higher safety risks in rural divided highways located in extremely cold regions. Desired speed distributions encompassing unique combinations of adverse road-weather and traffic conditions are modelled as normal distributions characterized by their means and standard deviations formulated based on two principal statistical theorems and techniques i.e., Central Limit Theorem and Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimation. Combination of the precipitation conditions, road surface conditions, time of the day, temperature, traffic flow and the heavy vehicle percentage at the time of travel were considered in defining the combinations of road-weather and traffic conditions. The findings reveal that simultaneous occurrence of particular precipitation and pavement conditions significantly affect the characteristics of the desired speed distribution and potentially expose drivers to elevated safety risks. Jurisdictions experiencing extreme road-weather conditions may adapt the proposed methodology to assess speed behaviour under different road-weather conditions to establishing and deploying weather-responsive traffic management strategies such as variable speed limit to regulate speeding and improve traffic safety in winter."
https://openalex.org/W3194145551,"The recent advances in gene chip technology have led to the identification of multiple metabolism-related genes that are closely associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, none of these genes could accurately diagnose or predict CRC. The prognosis of CRC has been made by previous prognostic models constructed by using multiple genes, however, the predictive function of multi-gene prognostic models using metabolic genes for the CRC prognosis remains unexplored. In this study, we used the TCGA-CRC cohort as the test dataset and the GSE39582 cohort as the experimental dataset. Firstly, we constructed a prognostic model using metabolic genes from the TCGA-CRC cohort, which were also associated with CRC prognosis. We analyzed the advantages of the prognostic model in the prognosis of CRC and its regulatory mechanism of the genes associated with the model. Secondly, the outcome of the TCGA-CRC cohort analysis was validated using the GSE39582 cohort. We found that the prognostic model can be employed as an independent prognostic risk factor for estimating the CRC survival rate. Besides, compared with traditional clinical pathology, it can precisely predict CRC prognosis as well. The high-risk group of the prognostic model showed a substantially lower survival rate as compared to the low-risk group. In addition, gene enrichment analysis of metabolic genes showed that genes in the prognostic model are enriched in metabolism and cancer-related pathways, which may explain its underlying mechanism. Our study identified a novel metabolic profile containing 11 genes for prognostic prediction of CRC. The prognostic model may unravel the imbalanced metabolic microenvironment, and it might promote the development of biomarkers for predicting treatment response and streamlining metabolic therapy in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3195799064,"Recent observational studies suggest increased aortic aneurysm or dissection (AAD) risk following fluoroquinolone (FQ) exposure but acknowledge potential for residual bias from unreported patient characteristics. The objective of our study is to evaluate the potential association between FQ, other common antibiotics and febrile illness with risk of AAD using a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study design.Retrospective database analysis-SCCS.Primary and Secondary Care.51,898 patients across 3 US claims databases (IBM® MarketScan® commercial and Medicare databases, Optum Clinformatics).FQ or other common antibiotics or febrile illness.AAD.We studied patients with exposures and AAD between 2012 and 2017 in 3 databases. Risk windows were defined as exposure period plus 30 days. Diagnostic analyses included p-value calibration to account for residual error using negative control exposures (NCE), and pre-exposure outcome analyses to evaluate exposure-outcome timing. The measure of association was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing exposed and unexposed time.Most NCEs produced effect estimates greater than the hypothetical null, indicating positive residual error; calibrated p (Cp) values were therefore used. The IRR following FQ exposure ranged from 1.13 (95% CI: 1.04-1.22 -Cp: 0.503) to 1.63 (95% CI: 1.45-1.84 -Cp: 0.329). An AAD event peak was identified 60 days before first FQ exposure, with IRR increasing between the 60- to 30- and 29- to 1-day pre-exposure periods. It is uncertain how much this pre-exposure AAD event peak reflects confounding versus increased antibiotic use after a surgical correction of AADs.This study does not confirm prior studies. Using Cp values to account for residual error, the observed FQ-AAD association cannot be interpreted as significant. Additionally, an AAD event surge in the 60 days before FQ exposure is consistent with confounding by indication, or increased use of antibiotics post-surgery.NCT03479736."
https://openalex.org/W3191629495,"The tendency to form first impressions from facial appearance emerges early in development. One route through which these impressions may be learned is parent-child interaction. In Study 1, 24 parent-child dyads (children aged 5-6 years, 50% male, 83% White British) were given four computer generated faces and asked to talk about each of the characters shown. Study 2 (children aged 5-6 years, 50% male, 92% White British) followed a similar procedure using images of real faces. Across both studies, around 13% of conversation related to the perceived traits of the individuals depicted. Furthermore, parents actively reinforced their children's face-trait mappings, agreeing with the opinions they voiced on approximately 40% of occasions across both studies. Interestingly, although parents often encouraged face-trait mappings in their children, their responses to questionnaire items suggested they typically did not approve of judging others based on their appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3194160179,"The aim of the present research was to assess age-related differences in how children and adults interpret and visually process emotionally ambiguous neutral faces. Children and adults provided neutral child faces with valence and arousal ratings while eye movements were recorded. Consistent with previous research, children and adults both interpreted the neutral faces as negatively valenced. Both age groups showed fewer fixations to the eye region when they rated the faces as positive. However, adults fixated more on the eye region when they rated the faces as negative whereas children fixated more on the eye region when they rated the faces as neutral. This finding may suggest that children strategically allocate attentional resources to the eye region when processing emotionally ambiguous faces to gather critical affective information. These findings have implications for the utilization of neutral faces as an experimental control condition and serve as the foundation for future research on the development of mechanisms that underlie the interpretation of emotionally ambiguous faces."
https://openalex.org/W3195768689,"The re-emergence of virulent strains of the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) leads to significant economic losses of poultry industry in Pakistan during last few years. This disease causes the infection of bursa, which leads to major immune losses. A total number of 30 samples from five IBD outbreaks during the period of 2019–20 were collected from different areas of Faisalabad district, Pakistan and assayed by targeting the IBD virus VP2 region through RT-PCR. Among all the outbreaks, almost 80% of poultry birds were found positive for the IBDV. The bursa tissues were collected from the infected birds and histopathological examination of samples revealed severe lymphocytic depletion, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and necrosis of the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Positive samples were subjected to re-isolation and molecular characterization of IBDV. The Pakistan IBDV genes were subjected to DNA sequencing to determine the virus nucleotide sequences. The sequences of 100 Serotype-I IBDVs showing nearest homology were compared and identified with the study sequence. The construction of the phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences was accomplished by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA-6 with reference strains. The VP2 segment reassortment of IBDVs carrying segment A were identified as one important type of circulating strains in Pakistan. The findings indicated the molecular features of the Pakistan IBDV strains playing a role in the evolution of new strains of the virus, which will contribute to the vaccine selection and effective prevention of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3187559491,"Limited data are available regarding the influence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of non-totally occluded lesions (non-CTO) on the coronary flow of non-target vessels. We sought to investigate the short-term impact of the non-left anterior descending artery (non-LAD) PCI on the coronary flow physiology of LAD using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TDE).We consecutively studied 50 patients who underwent successful PCI of non-LAD and non-CTO lesions and a coronary flow velocity assessment of LAD at rest and maximal hyperemia before and at 2 days after the procedure by TDE. Coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to resting diastolic peak velocity (hDPV/bDPV). We evaluated the changes in LAD coronary flow characteristics after PCI of non-LAD and explored the determinants of the change in LAD-CFVR. The median fractional flow reserve (FFR) of the culprit lesion and the LAD quantitative flow ratio (QFR) were 0.67 and 0.88, respectively. After non-LAD PCI, LAD-CFVR was decreased in 33 patients (66.0%). LAD-CFVR significantly decreased (pre-PCI: 2.41, post-PCI: 2.03, p = 0.001) due to a significant decrease in LAD-hDPV (P = 0.007). The prevalence of impaired LAD-CFVR (≤2.0) significantly increased (pre: 30%, post: 48%, P = 0.027). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that pre-PCI LAD-CFVR was independent predictor of the change in LAD-CFVR after PCI.LAD-CFVR significantly decreased after successful non-LAD PCI due to the postprocedural reduction of coronary flow assessed by LAD-hDPV."
https://openalex.org/W3189646077,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis with broad social and economic consequences. We conducted four surveys between April and August 2020 using the graph-based open-ended survey (GOS) framework, and investigated the most pressing concerns and issues for the general public in Japan. The GOS framework is a hybrid of the two traditional survey frameworks that allows respondents to post their opinions in a free-format style, which can subsequently serve as one of the choice items for other respondents, just as in a multiple-choice survey. As a result, this framework generates an opinion graph that relates opinions and respondents. We can also construct annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution. By clustering the annotated opinion graphs, we revealed the characteristic evolution of the response patterns as well as the interconnectedness and multi-faceted nature of opinions. Substantively, our notable finding is that ""social pressure,"" not ""infection risk,"" was one of the major concerns of our respondents. Social pressure refers to criticism and discrimination that they anticipate receiving from others should they contract COVID-19. It is possible that the collectivist nature of Japanese culture coupled with the government's policy of relying on personal responsibility to combat COVID-19 explains some of the above findings, as the latter has led to the emergence of vigilantes. The presence of mutual surveillance can contribute to growing skepticism toward others as well as fear of ostracism, which may have negative consequences at both the societal and individual levels."
https://openalex.org/W3190042972,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Hyperlipidemia is one of the important modifiable risk factors for CVDs. Raising public awareness of CVD risks is an important step in reducing CVD burdens. In this study, we aimed to assess public awareness and knowledge of cholesterol and its management in a multiethnic Asian population.We recruited 1000 participants from three major ethnic groups for this nationwide population-based survey. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographics, knowledge of cholesterol and cholesterol-lowering medications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with good knowledge on cholesterol and its management.Of the participants, 65% thought that high cholesterol produces symptoms and that lifestyle modification would be as effective as medication at lowering cholesterol. Nearly 70% believed that long term statin could lead to kidney or liver damage, and 56% thought that statin was associated with higher risk of cancer. A third saw herbal medicine or supplements as healthier and safer. About 45% believed that statin therapy should not be taken long term and that one could stop taking cholesterol medication when cholesterol is under control. Malays were more likely to have poor knowledge (adjusted OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.98; P = 0.039) compared to Chinese. Participants with intermediate education were more likely to have good knowledge of cholesterol and its management (adjusted OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.11-2.51; P = 0.013) compared to those with primary education.Public knowledge and awareness of high cholesterol and its management remains poor in Asian multi-ethnic population. Understanding gaps in public knowledge can inform the implementation of health promotion programs to effectively raise awareness of cholesterol and its management."
https://openalex.org/W3193822935,"Background Chloroquine was promoted as a COVID-19 therapeutic early in the pandemic. Most countries have since discontinued the use of chloroquine due to lack of evidence of any benefit and the risk of severe adverse events. The primary aim of this study was to examine if administering chloroquine during COVID-19 imposed an increased risk of ischemic heart injury or heart failure. Methods Medical records, laboratory findings, and electrocardiograms of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with 500 mg chloroquine phosphate daily and controls not treated with chloroquine were reviewed retrospectively. Controls were matched in age and severity of disease. Results We included 20 patients receiving chloroquine (500 mg twice daily) for an average of five days, and 40 controls. The groups were comparable regarding demographics and biochemical analyses including C-reactive protein, thrombocytes, and creatinine. There were no statistically significant differences in cardiac biomarkers or in electrocardiograms. Median troponin T was 10,8 ng/L in the study group and 17.9 ng/L in the control group, whereas median NT-proBNP was 399 ng/L in patients receiving chloroquine and 349 ng/L in the controls. Conclusions We found no increased risk of ischemic heart injury or heart failure as a result of administering chloroquine. However, the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 outside of clinical trials is not recommended, considering the lack of evidence of its effectiveness, as well as the elevated risk of fatal arrythmias."
