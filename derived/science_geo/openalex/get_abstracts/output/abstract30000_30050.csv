https://openalex.org/W2079487514,"A low molecular weight serine protease inhibitor (TAP) was purified from extracts of the soft tick, Ornithodoros moubata. The peptide is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor, specific for factor Xa (Ki = 0.588 +/- 0.054 nM). The inhibitor also acts as an anticoagulant in several human plasma clotting assays in vitro. Its amino acid sequence (60 residues) has limited homology to the Kunitz-type inhibitors. However, unlike other inhibitors of this class, TAP inhibits only factor Xa. It had no effect at a 300-fold molar excess on factor VIIa, kallikrein, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, urokinase, plasmin, tissue plasminogen activator, elastase, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. TAP's specificity and size suggest that it may have therapeutic value as an anticoagulant."

https://openalex.org/W1828402659,"The rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis is catalyzed by the microsomal cytochrome P-450 cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (7 alpha-hydroxylase). The expression of this enzyme is subject to feedback regulation by sterols and is thought to be coordinately regulated with enzymes in the cholesterol supply pathways, including the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and synthase. Here we report the purification of rat 7 alpha-hydroxylase and the determination of a partial amino acid sequence. Oligonucleotides derived from peptide sequence were used to clone a full-length cDNA encoding 7 alpha-hydroxylase. DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed a 7 alpha-hydroxylase protein of 503 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 56,890 which represents a novel family of cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Transfection of a 7 alpha-hydroxylase cDNA into simian COS cells resulted in the synthesis of a functional enzyme whose activity was stimulated in vitro by the addition of rat microsomal cytochrome P-450 reductase protein. RNA blot hybridization experiments indicated that the mRNA for 7 alpha-hydroxylase is found only in the liver. The levels of this mRNA increased when bile acids were depleted by dietary cholestyramine and decreased when bile acids were consumed. Dietary cholesterol led to an increase in 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels. The enzymatic activity of 7 alpha-hydroxylase paralleled the observed changes in mRNA levels. These results suggest that bile acids and sterols are able to alter the transcription of the 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene and that this control explains the previously observed feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081532018,"The three-dimensional structures of an antibody to a peptide and its complex with the peptide antigen have been determined at 2.8 Å resolution. The antigen is a synthetic 19-amino acid peptide homolog of the C helix of myohemerythrin (Mhr). The unliganded Fab′ crystals are orthorhombic with two molecules per asymmetric unit, whereas the complex crystals are hexagonal with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The Fab′ and the Fab′-peptide complex structures have been solved independently by molecular replacement methods and have crystallographic R factors of 0.197 and 0.215, respectively, with no water molecules included. The amino-terminal portion of the peptide sequence (NH2-Glu-Val-Val-Pro-His-Lys-Lys) is clearly interpretable in the electron density map of the Fab′-peptide complex and adopts a well-defined type II β-turn in the concave antigen binding pocket. This same peptide amino acid sequence in native Mhr is α-helical. The peptide conformation when bound to the Fab′ is inconsistent with binding of the Fab′ to native Mhr, and suggests that binding can only occur to conformationally altered forms of the native Mhr or to apo-Mhr. Immunological mapping previously identified this sequence as the peptide epitope, and its fine specificity correlates well with the structural analysis. The binding pocket includes a large percentage of hydrophobic residues. The buried surfaces of the peptide and the antibody are complementary in shape and cover 460 Å2 and 540 Å2, respectively. These two structures now enable a comparison of a specific monoclonal Fab′ both in its free and antigen complexed state. While no major changes in the antibody were observed when peptide was bound, there were some small but significant side chain and main chain rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2092508688,"Advances in low-level risk detection threaten to engulf us with information. Regulators typically respond to each newly highlighted risk, whether painstakingly uncovered through scientific investigation or divulged with fanfare by the media, on an ad hoc basis. This response makes it hard to relate disparate risks to the overall risk level and impedes intelligent risk reduction, which must consider the costs and benefits involved. Efficient risk management requires decisions not only about what to regulate and how stringently, but also about the appropriate division of labor among the agents influencing risks. These agents include individuals, whose potential contributions too often are overlooked, corporations, and government."
https://openalex.org/W2005111741,"Female green turtles exhibit strong nest-site fidelity as adults, but whether the nesting beach is the natal site is not known. Under the natal homing hypothesis, females return to their natal beach to nest, whereas under the social facilitation model, virgin females follow experienced breeders to nesting beaches and after a ""favorable"" nesting experience, fix on that site for future nestings. Differences shown in mitochondrial DNA genotype frequency among green turtle colonies in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean are consistent with natal homing expectations and indicate that social facilitation to nonnatal sites is rare."
https://openalex.org/W1628693640,"We have studied the rat malic enzyme gene as a model for thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine (T3)) regulation of transcription. Our previous studies showed that transcription of this gene is controlled by T3 in vivo. In this study, we used COS-7 cells in culture to determine the location of a T3 response element (TRE) within this gene. Cotransfection of the rat T3 alpha-receptor cDNA with a reporter gene linked to 5'-deletion mutants of the malic enzyme gene 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of a TRE between positions -315 and -248. Using T3 receptors synthesized in vitro from their cDNAs, we have identified, through the use of gel shift assays and footprinting, a single DNA-binding site (positions -281 to -261) for the receptor within the rat malic enzyme gene TRE. The site was capable of binding either the rat alpha- or human beta-receptor with similar affinities. Competition binding studies indicated that the apparent affinity of receptor binding to the malic enzyme gene was similar to that of the rat alpha-myosin heavy chain gene TRE (positions -151 to -122) and was significantly greater than that of the rat growth hormone TRE (positions -192 to -163). These results indicate that both the alpha- and beta-forms of the nuclear T3 receptor are capable of binding directly to the malic enzyme gene 5'-flanking region at a site which functions as a hormone-inducible cis-regulatory element. In conjunction with our previous finding that T3 induces or activates essential transcription factors which bind to the promoter, it appears that the regulation of transcription of the malic enzyme gene by thyroid hormone involves at least two regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2010403667,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity and the phosphorylation of the γ isozyme of PLC (PLC-γ) in vitro and in living cells. The role of PLC-γ in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway was addressed by examining the effect of overexpression of PLC-γ on cellular responses to PDGF. Overexpression of PLC-γ correlated with PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ and with PDGF-induced breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). However, neither bradykinin- nor lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphoinositide metabolism was enhanced in the transfected cells, suggesting that the G protein-coupled phosphoinositide responses to these ligands are mediated by other PLC isozymes. The enhanced PDGF-induced generation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) did not enhance intracellular calcium signaling or influence PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. Thus, enzymes other than PLC-γ may limit PDGF-induced calcium signaling and DNA synthesis. Alternatively, PDGF-induced calcium signaling and DNA synthesis may use biochemical pathways other than phosphoinositide metabolism for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1564319411,"The N-linked oligosaccharide structures on the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 derived from chronically infected lymphoblastoid (H9) cells have been investigated by enzymatic microsequencing after release from protein by hydrazinolysis, labeling with NaB3H4, and chromatography on adsorbent columns of Phaseolus vulgaris erythrophytohemagglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin (Mr 120,000) and on Bio-Gel P-4. A substantially greater diversity of oligosaccharide structures was detected than among those released by hydrazinolysis from recombinant gp120 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and investigated by similar procedures (Mizuochi, T., Spellman, M.W., Larkin, M., Solomon, J., Basa, L.J., and Feizi, T. (1988) Biochem J. 254, 599-603) and among those released by endoglycosidases from virus-derived gp120 isolated from infected H9 cells after metabolic labeling with D-[2-3H]mannose or D-[6-3H]glucosamine (Geyer, H., Holschbach, L., Hunsmann, G., and Schneider, J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11760-11767). In this study, 16% of the oligosaccharides were identified as complex-type bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary sialo-oligosaccharides with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues. Such structures were lacking on recombinant gp120 and could not be detected on the metabolically labeled, virus-derived glycoprotein. As in the earlier investigations, complex-type chains lacking bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues, hybrid-type chains, and a series of high mannose-type structures with 5-9 mannose residues were identified. In addition, an array of complex-type chains having one or more outer chains with beta-galactosyl residues were detected in this study, but with additional substitutions that require further investigation. The number of potential N-glycosylation sites on gp120 is on the order of 20, but the oligosaccharide structures are far more numerous. Thus, the salient conclusion from this and earlier investigations is that alternative structures occur on at least some of the glycosylation sites and that numerous glycosylation variants of this glycoprotein are produced even within a single cell line. Since the glycosylation is the product of host cell glycosyltransferases, an even greater number of glycosylation variants of gp120 are predicted to arise from the heterogeneous cell populations harboring the virus in in vivo infection."
https://openalex.org/W1497069076,"cDNA clones corresponding to rat ceruloplasmin were isolated from newborn rat lung and liver cDNA libraries and the nucleotide sequence was obtained. The derived amino acid sequence of rat ceruloplasmin is 93% homologous to the corresponding human sequence and contains a 19-amino acid leader peptide plus 1040 amino acids of mature protein. Southern blot analysis indicates that the ceruloplasmin gene exists as a single copy in the rat haploid genome. Using these cDNA clones in RNA blot analysis, a single 3.7-kilobase ceruloplasmin-specific transcript is detected in fetal rat liver and lung by day 15 of gestation. During fetal development the abundance of this transcript increases selectively in these two tissues and at birth is 60% of that found in the adult liver. Postnatally the temporal pattern of ceruloplasmin gene expression in lung and liver differs. Within the first 3 weeks postpartum ceruloplasmin mRNA content decreases in lung to undetectable levels, while that in the liver reaches adult levels. Primer extension reveals a single identical start site of ceruloplasmin gene transcription in lung and liver and biosynthetic studies indicate that each tissue synthesizes a ceruloplasmin protein which is qualitatively similar to that synthesized by adult liver. Ceruloplasmin mRNA is also detected in human fetal lung explant and a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line suggesting that a similar pattern of expression occurs in the developing human lung. These data indicate that lung is the predominant extrahepatic site of ceruloplasmin gene expression during fetal development and suggest that this protein may play a previously unappreciated role in lung development or pulmonary antioxidant defense."
https://openalex.org/W1581563423,"The oxidative reductive depolymerization (ORD) of hyaluronate has been investigated. A solution of hyaluronate (Mr 4.07 x 10(5] in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was incubated in the presence of Fe2+ for 24 h at 37 degrees C under an oxygen atmosphere to yield depolymerized hyaluronate (ORD fragments; an average Mr of 2,600). The ORD fragments contain 21 and 24% less hexosamine and uronic acid, respectively, but no olefinic linkage. They were exhaustively digested with chondroitinase AC-II. The resulting oligosaccharides and monosaccharides were separated by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, and their structures were determined by proton and carbon-13 NMR, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and chromatographic techniques combined with chemical modifications. The following structures derived from the reducing ends of the ORD fragments were identified: 4,5-unsaturated GlcA(beta 1----3)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminic acid (where GlcA- represents glucuronosyl-) (21%), 4,5-unsaturated GlcA(beta 1----3)GlcNAc(beta 1----3)-D-arabo-pentauronic acid (24%), and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (51%). The following structures derived from the nonreducing ends were identified: L-threo-tetro-dialdosyl-(1----3)GlcNAc (a tentative structure, 8%), N-acetylhyalobiuronic acid (20%), and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (45%). The results indicate that the ORD reaction of hyaluronate proceeds essentially by random destruction of unit monosaccharides due to oxygen-derived free radicals, followed by secondary hydrolytic cleavage of the resulting unstable glycosidic substituents."
https://openalex.org/W1592169576,"In rat liver there are two types of serine:pyruvate aminotransferase (SPT) whose natures are indistinguishable but whose subcellular localization are different. One is a mitochondrial enzyme (SPTm) and the other a peroxisomal enzyme (SPTp). We compared, in this study, the structure of mRNAs encoding SPTm and SPTp by comparison of the sizes after removal of poly(A) tail by ribonuclease H and by means of RNA blot analysis and S1 nuclease protection assay. No differences were detected between these two mRNAs other than that about 100 nucleotides of the 5'-terminal sequence of SPTm mRNA are lacking in SPTp mRNA, and the length of the poly(A) tail is different. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA showed that the SPT gene is single. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping analyses, using a DNA fragment of a genomic clone, revealed that the SPTm and SPTp mRNAs are transcribed from different initiation sites, about 70 nucleotides apart, in the same exon, exon 1. Ribonuclease protection assay performed with RNA hybridization probe corresponding to 5'-terminal portion of SPTm mRNA also showed that the 5'-terminal sequence of SPTp mRNA is about 70 nucleotides shorter than that of hormone-responsive SPTm mRNA. These results indicate that the different organelle distribution of SPTm and SPTp, the products of the same SPT gene, arises from transcription from different initiation sites, conferring N-terminal extension peptide, the mitochondrial targeting signal, only on the translation product of SPTm mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1581575889,"We have investigated the effect of tumor promoting phorbol esters on the antiproliferative actions of several antitumor agents. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) caused a significant (9-fold) increase in cellular sensitivity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CP). TPA also sensitized HeLa cells to melphalan (2.5-fold) but had no effect on the antiproliferative activity of bleomycin, doxorubicin, vincristine, or mitomycin C. The sensitization of HeLa cells by TPA was concentration-dependent up to 1 nM and paralleled the activation of protein kinase C by TPA measured in vitro. The maximum stimulation of protein kinase C (6-fold) was observed with 10 nM TPA. 4 alpha-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate neither activated protein kinase C nor sensitized HeLa cells to CP. 4-O-Methyl-TPA, which does not affect cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells, also sensitized these cells to CP by 6-fold and activated protein kinase C by 3-fold. Inhibitors of protein kinase C, such as palmitoylcarnitine and sphingosine, antagonized PDBu-induced sensitization of HeLa cells to CP. The maximum sensitization of HeLa cells to CP required prolonged pretreatment (greater than or equal to 24 h) with phorbol esters but could not be explained by down-regulation of protein kinase C. For example, 4-O-methyl-TPA caused no down-regulation of protein kinase C. Moreover, TPA caused substantial down-regulation of protein kinase C (1% of control) in A-253 cells but failed to sensitize A-253 cells to CP. TPA (100 nM), however, activated protein kinase C in A-253 cells by 5.5-fold. Therefore, activation of protein kinase C by TPA appears to be necessary but not sufficient for cellular sensitization to CP. The sensitization of HeLa cells by TPA was associated with a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular platinum content. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) blocked sensitization of HeLa cells to CP as well as the increase in platinum content caused by a 24-h pretreatment with PDBu."
https://openalex.org/W1491529911,"The heterogeneity of the protein kinase C (PKC) gene family strongly suggests that different isoforms may have distinct functions in mediating signal transduction. However, there is very little direct evidence for this. PKC has been implicated in arachidonate (AA) release in many cell types. We sought to investigate whether bradykinin- and phorbol ester-stimulated AA release in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was correlated with differential activation of PKC isoforms. Using phorbol esters to (i) activate the enzyme and (ii) to down-regulate it, we report that differential activation (translocation) of PKC alpha is associated with AA release in MDCK cells and that specific down-regulation of PKC alpha is associated with a loss of AA release in response to stimulation with dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol ester. We also demonstrate that bradykinin-stimulated AA release was associated with differential activation of PKC alpha and was inhibited in PKC alpha down-regulated cells. Thus, we conclude that the PKC alpha isoform is likely to be responsible for mediating AA release in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1585169250,"Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) catalyzes the sulfation of proteins at tyrosine residues. We have analyzed the substrate specificity of TPST from bovine adrenal medulla with a novel assay, using synthetic peptides as substrates. The peptides were modeled after the known, or putative, tyrosine sulfation sites of the cholecystokinin precursor, chromogranin B (secretogranin I) and vitronectin, as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of alpha-tubulin and pp60src. Varying the sequence of these peptides, we found that (i) the apparent Km of peptides with multiple tyrosine sulfation sites decreased exponentially with the number of sites; (ii) acidic amino acids were the major determinant for tyrosine sulfation, acidic amino acids adjacent to the tyrosine being more important than distant ones; (iii) a carboxyl terminally located tyrosine residue may be sulfated. Moreover, TPST catalyzed the sulfation of a peptide corresponding to the tyrosine autophosphorylation site of pp60v-src (Tyr-416) but not of a peptide corresponding to the non-autophosphorylation site of pp60c-src (Tyr-527). These results experimentally define structural determinants for the substrate specificity of TPST and show that this enzyme and certain autophosphorylating tyrosine kinases have overlapping substrate specificities in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1548772669,"Complete replacement of the nucleotide on the exchangeable binding site of purified calf brain tubulin by the non-hydrolyzable GTP-analogue guanylyl-(beta,gamma-methylene)diphosphonate (GMPPCP) has been achieved by treatment of tubulin-GDP with phosphodiesterase-free alkaline phosphatase. GMPPCP binds to tubulin with a low affinity relative to GTP or GDP. Binding of the analogue is linked to magnesium ion concentration and, like the binding of other guanine nucleotides, is promoted by high concentrations of glycerol. The complex of pure tubulin and GMPPCP readily assembles at 37 degrees C into microtubules or curled ribbons of protofilaments, depending on buffer composition. Assemblies are cold-reversible at 0-2 degrees C, and multiple reversible assemblies can be observed during repeated heating/cooling cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1557042258,"Nuclear extracts of cultured human cells contain multiple proteins that recognize specific sequence elements within the transcriptional control region of the human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Here we report the purification of host expression factor 1T (HEF-1T), a DNA-binding protein from human T-lymphocytes that binds to each of the three 21-base pair repeat enhancer elements in the proviral long terminal repeats of HTLV-I and the related virus, HTLV-II. HEF-1T is composed of two polypeptides of 41 and 59 kDa. We show that HEF-1T is distinct from a second protein, present in non-lymphoid cells, that binds to overlapping sites in and near the 21-base pair repeats. This second protein is composed of a single 47-kDa polypeptide and appears to be identical to the previously described transcription factor AP-2. A third protein, also distinct from HEF-1T, binds within the first repeat. The present results suggest that there may be multiple modes of HTLV-I promoter recognition involving distinct sets of cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1515015683,"The structures of the N-linked oligosaccharides of miraculin, which is a taste modifying glycoprotein isolated from miracle fruits, berries of Richadella dulcifica, are reported. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides were released from the protein by glycopeptidase (almond) digestion. The reducing ends of the oligosaccharide chains thus obtained were aminated with a fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine, and the mixture of pyridylamino derivatives of the oligosaccharides was separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an ODS-silica column. More than five kinds of oligosaccharide fractions were separated by the one chromatographic run. The structure of each oligosaccharide thus isolated was analyzed by a combination of sequential exoglycosidase digestion and another kind of HPLC with an amidesilica column. Furthermore, high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) measurements were carried out. It was found that 1) five oligosaccharides obtained are a series of compounds with xylose-containing common structural core, Xyl beta 1----2 (Man alpha 1----6) Man beta 1----4-GlcNAc beta 1----4 (Fuca1----3)GlcNAc, 2) a variety of oligosaccharide structures are significant for two glycosylation sites, Asn-42 and Asn-186, and 3) two new oligosaccharides, B and D, with unusual structures containing monoantennary complex-type were characterized.

https://openalex.org/W1564030940,"Heparin preparations isolated from pig intestinal mucosa and from bovine lung were fractionated with regard to affinity for antithrombin. The resulting fractions, with high (HA) or low (LA) affinity for the proteinase inhibitor, were analyzed by 13C NMR or by identification of di- and tetrasaccharides obtained through deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid. Structural differences between corresponding HA and LA fractions were essentially restricted to minor constituents, in particular 3-O-sulfated glucosamine units that occurred (1 or 2 residues/chain) in all HA preparations but were scarce or absent in LA heparin. The HA fractions also consistently showed higher contents of nonsulfated iduronic acid and, to a lesser extent, N-acetylated glucosamine units than the LA fractions. The two tetrasaccharide sequences, -IdoA-GlcNAc(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3- and -IdoA-GlcNAc(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- , recently implicated as part of the acceptor site for glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfate groups (Kusche, M., Backstrom, G., Riesenfeld, J., Petitou, M., Choay, J., and Lindahl, U. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15474-15484), were identified in mucosal LA heparin; it was calculated that the preparation contained approximately one potential acceptor site/polysaccharide chain. Yet this material did not yield any labeled HA components on incubation with adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phospho-[35S]sulfate in the presence of glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase, solubilized from a mouse mastocytoma microsomal fraction. The failure to incorporate any 3-O-sulfate groups could conceivably be explained by the occurrence of a D-glucuronic rather than L-iduronic acid unit linked at the reducing ends of the above tetrasaccharide sequences. Alternatively, 3-O-sulfation may be restricted by other, as yet unidentified, inhibitory structural elements that are preferentially expressed in polysaccharide sequences selected for the generation of LA heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1572832798,"Steroid 21-hydroxylase (21-OHase) is specifically expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex, where it is required for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. In this study, we have investigated the regulatory elements in the 21-OHase promoter region which contribute to the expression of this gene in Y1 adrenocortical cells. Eight potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region of the 21-OHase gene were identified by DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift experiments. Some of these footprints were produced by nuclear extracts from many cell lines, whereas other interactions were seen only when using nuclear extracts from Y1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. Mutation of most of the elements markedly decreased the expression of a 21-OHase gene transfected into Y1 cells, thus documenting their functional importance for expression. Moreover, oligonucleotides containing the sequences of two related elements at -65 and -210, which share the heptamer AGGTCAG, increased the activity of a heterologous promoter in a Y1 cell-specific manner. Collectively, these results demonstrate that expression of 21-OHase in Y1 adrenocortical cells requires interactions among multiple cis-acting elements and regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1483040062,"The carboxyl-terminal Mr = 5982 peptide of diphtheria toxin was prepared by specific cleavage of the toxin with hydroxylamine and purified by fast performance liquid chromatography. The identity of the peptide was established by a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, reactivity with specific monoclonal antibodies, and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The Mr = 5982 peptide was shown to protect highly toxin-sensitive Vero cells from the lethal action of diphtheria toxin. This protection was shown to be due to inhibition of the initial step in the cytotoxic process, the binding of toxin to its receptor. These results strongly suggest that the Mr = 5982 carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues 482-535) is, or contains, the receptor-binding domain of diphtheria toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1523193009,"Synthesis of accurately initiated transcripts has been reconstituted with RNA polymerase II and a set of five transcription factors purified from rat liver. In addition to three previously identified factors alpha, beta gamma, and delta (Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7356-7360), transcription in the reconstituted liver system requires two novel factors designated tau and epsilon. These five transcription factors comprise two functional classes: (i) promoter recognition factors (tau and epsilon), which interact with template DNA to facilitate formation of a stable initial complex that is subsequently recognized and bound by RNA polymerase II, and (ii) RNA chain initiation factors (alpha, beta gamma, and delta), which do not participate in formation of the initial complex, but which are essential for transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1641282019,"We have designed an in vitro expression system for human apolipoprotein (apo) B. A full-length human apoB minigene was constructed from cDNA and genomic apoB clones and inserted into a vector where its expression was directed by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The apoB minigene was expressed in a rat hepatoma cell line, McA-RH7777. Human apoB100, which is the ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor, was secreted in low density lipoprotein or very low density lipoprotein particles, depending on the composition of the medium. A protein with the mobility of apoB48, a structurally related protein involved in cholesterol metabolism, was also produced from the human apoB minigene. This in vitro expression system for human apoB will enable investigators to identify which domains of this protein are involved in processes such as lipoprotein assembly and secretion. This system should also allow investigators to identify definitively the domain in apoB that enables the protein to bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1711952097,"We have studied the roles of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu) depletion and dihydrofolate (H2PteGlu) accumulation in the inhibition of de novo thymidylate synthesis by methotrexate (MTX) in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Using both a high pressure liquid chromatography system and a modification of the 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate radioenzymatic binding assay, we determined that the 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu pool is 50-60% depleted in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells following exposure to 1 micron MTX for up to 21 h. Similar alterations in the 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu pools were obtained when human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells and normal human myeloid precursor cells were incubated with 1 micron MTX. The H2PteGlu pools within the MCF-7 cells increased significantly after 15 min of 1 micron MTX exposure, reaching maximal levels by 60 min. Thymidylate synthesis, as measured by labeled deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, decreased to less than 20% of control activity within 30 min of 1 micron MTX exposure. The inhibition of thymidylate synthesis coincided temporally with the rapid intracellular accumulation of H2PteGlu, a known inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway was associated in a log-linear fashion with the intracellular level of dihydrofolate. These studies provide further evidence that depletion of the thymidylate synthase substrate 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu is inadequate to account completely for diminished thymidylate synthesis resulting from MTX treatment. Our findings suggest that acute inhibition of de novo thymidylate synthesis is a multifactorial process consisting of partial substrate depletion and direct enzymatic inhibition by H2PteGlu polyglutamates."
https://openalex.org/W1599361264,"We have isolated previously cDNAs encoding two related human lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, h-lamp-1 and h-lamp-2 (Fukuda, M., Viitala, J., Matteson, J., and Carlsson, S.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18920-18928). In the present study, we have determined the chromosomal localization of genes for h-lamp-1 and h-lamp-2. By using the method of in situ hybridization, we have localized the gene for h-lamp-1 to chromosome 13q34 and its related gene to chromosome 12p133. The hybridization of h-lamp-1 cDNA to chromosome 12p133 was observed even when probes representing different portions of h-lamp-1 cDNA were used. On ther other hand, the gene for h-lamp-2 were localized to Xq24-25 but no cross-hybridization to chromosome 12p133 was observed even though h-lamp-1 and h-lamp-2 are highly related. These results clearly indicate that human lamp-1 and lamp-2 are coded by separate genes on different chromosomes. The present results support our hypothesis that lamp-1 and lamp-2 diverged early in evolution and they have distinct functions which emerged as soon as eukaryotic cells acquired lysosomes as subcellular compartments."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 204, 2718-2725). In the present studies, we have explored some structural aspects of the mitochondrial rhodanese system. By sequential extraction of lysed mitochondria with phosphate buffer and phosphate buffer containing 20 mM cholate, we have shown that 30% of the rhodanese activity of bovine liver is membrane-bound. Resolution of cholate extracts on Sephadex G-100 indicates that part of the bound rhodanese is complexed with other mitochondrial proteins. Tests with the complex show that it forms iron-sulfur centers when incubated with the rhodanese sulfur-donor substrate thiosulfate, iron ions, and a reducing agent. Experiments on the rhodanese activity of rat liver mitochondria give similar results. Taken together, the findings indicate that liver rhodanese is in part bound to the mitochondrial membrane as a component of a multiprotein complex that forms iron-sulfur centers. The findings are consistent with the role we propose for rhodanese in the modulation of mitochondrial respiratory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1517445962,"We prepared a highly specific polyclonal antibody against leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase using a recombinant human enzyme. Using this antibody, we quantified LTA4 hydrolase protein content in the cytosols of guinea pig tissues. The enzyme protein content correlated well with the enzyme activity with a correlation coefficient of 0.87. However, the enzyme activity per mg of the enzyme in the cytosols was low, particularly in the liver and adrenal gland, compared with the specific activity of the purified enzyme. These observations suggest the presence of inhibitory substances and/or inactive enzymes in the cytosols of these tissues. To determine the cellular localization of LTA4 hydrolase in tissues other than blood cells, we carried out immunohistochemical examinations of guinea pig tissues. We identified epithelial cells in the tracheobronchial system and gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle cells in the bronchi and aorta, vascular endothelial cells, and the intestinal plexus as novel cellular sources of the enzyme in the parenchyme of the tissue. Thus, LTA4 hydrolase was widely distributed in various types of parenchymal cells in the tissues, and this observation warrants further investigations on the biological activities of LTB4 in these cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1567424663,"A methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (Pro-3 MtxRIII), resistant due to a low-level amplified, altered target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), has been characterized on the molecular level. The cDNA and coding regions of all six DHFR exons were amplified in vitro using Taq polymerase and directly sequenced. Analysis of the Pro-3 MtxRIII DHFR cDNA demonstrated a C----T base transition at nucleotide 67 that results in the substitution of phenylalanine for leucine at residue 22 and the loss of a BsaI site in the Pro-3 MtxRIII cDNA. This mutation results in a decreased binding of methotrexate to the altered enzyme. Molecular modeling of Leu22----Phe supports the concept of the importance of Leu22 in the active site of the enzyme and indicates that replacement with phenylalanine will decrease the binding of methotrexate."
https://openalex.org/W1481609832,"Zymosterol (5 alpha-cholesta-8(9),24-dien-3 beta-ol) comprised a negligible fraction of the mass of sterol in cultured human fibroblasts but was well labeled biosynthetically with radioactive acetate. Treatment of cells with triparanol, a potent inhibitor of sterol delta 24-reductase, led to a marked increase in labeled zymosterol while its mass rose to 1 mol% of total sterol. All of this sterol could be chased into cholesterol. Furthermore, cell homogenates converted exogenous radiolabeled zymosterol to cholesterol. Three lines of evidence suggested that biosynthetically labeled zymosterol was associated with the plasma membrane. 1) About 80% of radiolabeled zymosterol was oxidized by the impermeant enzyme, cholesterol oxidase, in glutaraldehyde-fixed intact cells. 2) Sucrose density gradient analysis of homogenates showed that the equilibrium buoyant density profile of newly synthesized zymosterol was identical with that of the plasma membrane. 3) Newly synthesized zymosterol was transferred as readily from fixed intact fibroblasts to exogenous acceptors as was cholesterol. Given that cholesterol is synthesized within the cell, it is unclear why most of the zymosterol is in the plasma membrane. The pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis may compel zymosterol to flux through the plasma membrane. Alternatively, plasma membrane zymosterol may represent a separate pool, in equilibrium with the zymosterol in the intracellular biosynthetic pool."
https://openalex.org/W1513015563,"The peroxisomal acyl/alkyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate reductase (EC 1.1.1.101) was solubilized and purified 5500-fold from guinea pig liver. The enzyme could be solubilized by detergents only at high ionic strengths in presence of the cosubstrate NADPH. Peroxisomes, isolated from liver by a Nycodenz step density gradient centrifugation, were first treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 to remove the soluble and a large fraction of the membrane-bound proteins. The enzyme was solubilized from the resulting residue by 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, 0.3 mM NADPH, and 2 mM dithiothreitol in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM) at pH 7.5. The enzyme was further purified after precipitating it by dialyzing out the KCl and then resolubilized with 0.8% octyl glucoside in 1 M KCl (plus NADPH and dithiothreitol). The second solubilized enzyme was purified to homogeneity (370-fold from peroxisomes) by gel filtration in a Sepharose CL-6B column followed by affinity chromatography on an NADPH-agarose gel matrix. NADPH-agarose was prepared by reacting periodate-oxidized NADP+ to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose and then reducing the immobilized NADP+ with NaBH4. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme showed a single homogeneous band with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 75,000 by size exclusion chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the purified protein showed that hydrophobic amino acid comprised 27% of the molecule. The Km value of the purified enzyme for hexadecyldihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was 21 microM, and the Vmax value in the presence of 0.07 mM NADPH was 67 mumol/min/mg. The turnover number (Kcat), after correcting for the isotope effect of the cosubstrate NADP3H, was calculated to be 6,000 mol/min/mol of enzyme, assuming the enzyme has a molecular weight of 60,000. The purified enzyme also used palmitoyldihydroxyactone phosphate as a substrate (Km = 15.4 microM, and Vmax = 75 mumol/min/mg). Palmitoyl-DHAP competitively inhibited the reduction of hexadecyl-DHAP, indicating that the same enzyme catalyzes the reduction of both acyl-DHAP and alkyl-DHAP. NADH can substitute for NADPH, but the Km of the enzyme for NADH (1.7 mM) is much higher than that for NADPH (20 microM). The purified enzyme is competitively (against NADPH) inhibited by NADP+ and palmitoyl-CoA. The enzyme is stable on storage at 4 degrees C in the presence of NADPH and dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1913376535,"We have used fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate the effect of phospholipid on the structure and molecular stability of human apolipoprotein A-IV (apo-A-IV). Binding of apo-A-IV to egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles was rapid and did not cause release of encapsulated 6-carboxyfluorescein. Fluorometric titration established that apo-A-IV bound to the vesicles with an association constant of 1.36 x 10(6) liters/mol and a binding maximum of 2 molecules per vesicle. Binding of apo-A-IV to the vesicle surface caused a progressive increase in alpha helicity from 43% at baseline to 83% at saturation; denaturation studies showed that the free energy of stabilization of binding was 6.31 kcal/mol. Fluorescence quenching studies revealed that binding of apo-A-IV to the vesicles was associated with a dramatic decrease in the fractional exposure of tyrosine to iodide, and a decrease in the efficiency of intramolecular tyrosine-tryptophan energy transfer. These findings suggest that the binding of apo-A-IV to the vesicle surface may involve a relaxation of the globular protein conformation in which the tyrosine containing alpha-helical domains surrounding the tryptophan unfold and reorient their hydrophobic faces toward the phospholipid monolayer, with a consequent induction of additional alpha-helical structure. However, our data also suggest that apo-A-IV does not penetrate deeply into the region of the phospholipid fatty acyl chains, but rather sits higher in the monolayer, intercalated between the charged phospholipid head groups. This characteristic may determine the labile interaction of apo-A-IV with high density lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1591964692,"We have used a homologous transfection system employing cell lines derived from Xenopus hepatocytes and fibroblasts and cloned Xenopus estrogen receptor to identify a DNA sequence essential for efficient transcription of the powerful estrogen-regulated Xenopus laevis vitellogenin B1 promoter. Although deletion of the CAAT box, the conserved nematode box, and several other sequences had little effect on vitellogenin promoter activity, deletion or mutation of a short sequence related to the NF1 transcription activator reduced estrogen-dependent transcription 10-20-fold in both cell lines. The activity of the vitellogenin activator (VA) element, which is located at positions -48 to -41, is strongly position dependent. Insertion of even five copies of the VA element at -445 does not restore activity to a VA deletion, while insertion of a single VA element at -62 largely restores promoter activity. The VA element is not liver-specific, since VA deletions, mutations, and insertions elicited similar effects on vitellogenin promoter activity in the cell lines derived from hepatocytes and fibroblasts. Gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from the Xenopus hepatocyte cell line demonstrate the presence of a protein which binds with high affinity and specificity to the VA sequence. The NF1 consensus sequence, but not a functional AP1 consensus sequence, which actually exhibits higher homology to the VA element than the NF1 sequence, competes for binding to the VA element. In transfections using simplified promoters in which single copies of the VA region or NF1 sequence are linked to a TATA box, the VA region, which does not contain a palindrome, is 2.4-fold more active than the consensus NF1 palindrome. The VA-binding protein therefore appears to be related to, but not identical to, the NF1 transcription activator."
https://openalex.org/W1533319237,"Sixteen monophosphoryl Lipid A (MLA) homologs obtained from the lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella minnesota Re595 were separated by preparative thin layer chromatography into eight fractions. The components of these fractions were analyzed directly (or as structural analogs) and characterized by mass spectrometry. Molecular weights were determined by negative and positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and component structures were assigned following a study of fragmentation and metastable ion kinetic energy spectrometry. One fraction (TLC-8) contained a single heptaacyl MLA of Mr = 1,954, a structure previously elucidated (Qureshi, N., Mascagni, P., Ribi, E., and Takayama, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5271-5278). The remaining seven fractions contained 15 additional MLAs with decreasing acylation. Two of these components have been previously reported in S. minnesota and Salmonella typhimurium. Three of the eight TLC fractions (TLC-8, -7, -6) were found to be biologically active toward human platelets inducing their aggregation and secretion of serotonin. All tested fractions induced varying degrees of phosphorylation of a platelet protein of Mr = 47,000 (P47) reflecting protein kinase C activation (Grabarek, J., Her, G. R., Reinhold, V.

https://openalex.org/W1947424026,"Formation of bile acids from sitosterol in bile-fistulated female Wistar rats was studied with use of 4-14C-labeled sitosterol and sitosterol labeled with 3H in specific positions. The major part (about 75%) of the 14C radioactivity recovered as bile acids in bile after intravenous administration of [4-14C]sitosterol was found to be considerably more polar than cholic acid, and only trace amounts of radioactivity had chromatographic properties similar to those of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. It was shown that polar metabolites were formed by intermediate oxidation of the 3 beta-hydroxyl group (loss of 3H from 3 alpha-3H-labeled sitosterol) and that the most polar fraction did not contain a hydroxyl group at C7 (retention of 3H in 7 alpha,7 beta-3H2-labeled sitosterol). Furthermore, the polar metabolites had lost at least the terminal 6 or 7 carbon atoms of the side chain (loss of 3H from 22,23-3H2- and 24,28-3H2-labeled sitosterol). Experiments with 3H-labeled 7 alpha-hydroxysitosterol and 4-14C-labeled 26-hydroxysitosterol showed that none of these compounds was an efficient precursor to the polar metabolites. By analysis of purified most polar products of [4-14C] sitosterol by radio-gas chromatography and the same products of 7 alpha,7 beta-[2H2]sitosterol by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, two major metabolites could be identified as C21 bile acids. One metabolite had three hydroxyl groups (3 alpha, 15, and unknown), and one had two hydroxyl groups (3 alpha, 15) and one keto group. Considerably less C21 bile acids were formed from [4-14C]sitosterol in male than in female Wistar rats. The C21 bile acids formed in male rats did not contain a 15-hydroxyl group. Conversion of a [4-14C]sitosterol into C21 bile acids did also occur in adrenalectomized and ovariectomized rats, indicating that endocrine tissues are not involved. Experiments with isolated perfused liver gave direct evidence that the overall conversion of sitosterol into C21 bile acids occurs in this organ. Intravenously injected 7 alpha,7 beta-3H-labeled campesterol gave a product pattern identical to that of 4-14C-labeled sitosterol. Possible mechanisms for hepatic conversion of sitosterol and campesterol into C21 bile acids are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1571533974,"Serum vitamin A homeostasis was studied in rats with nonfiltering kidneys prepared by ligation of renal arteries. Within 1-2 h of acute renal failure, the serum retinol level increased by 11-73% and was maintained for at least 4 h. More than 90% of the increase in serum retinol was associated with retinol in the retinol binding protein-transthyretin (RBP-TTR) complex. The activities of acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase and retinyl-palmitate hydrolase were not altered by short-term acute renal failure. Oral administration of 3H-labeled retinol 3 h before surgery resulted in 350% more tritium in the serum retinol-RBP-TTR complex of rats with acute renal failure as compared to sham-operated rats; this increase represented the fraction of retinol in RBP-TTR contributed by hepatic retinol from newly absorbed 3H-labeled retinol. Total retinol in the retinol-RBP-TTR complex was increased by only 60%. We conclude that short-term acute renal failure causes rapid upregulation of serum retinol-RBP-TTR; the extent of the increase depends on the magnitude of hepatic vitamin A stores, particularly the retinol pools. We hypothesize that kidney modulates the regulation of hepatic release of retinol-RBP from the pool of newly acquired retinol.— Gerlach, T. H.; Zile, M. H.

https://openalex.org/W1493644014,"Protein synthesis was investigated in isolated mitochondria under conditions which either inhibited electron transport or uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation. In a medium containing an exogenous source of ATP and oligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase complex, incorporation of [35S]methionine into proteins is stimulated in the presence of inhibitors of the electron transport chain; substituting uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation for the latter leads, in contrast, to a decrease in the rate of incorporation of the labeled amino acid into mitochondrial translation products. Studies on the metabolic stability of mitochondrial translation products revealed that polypeptides made in isolated mitochondria are as indicated by the absence of degradation during a 50 min period. Under conditions which reduce or dissipate the membrane potential, 50-60% of the newly made polypeptides (pulse) are degraded within 50 min. The kinetics of the degradation process for individual mitochondrial gene products reveal that the largest proportion of polypeptides degraded to an acid-soluble form during the chase period are abnormal proteins, likely the result of premature chain termination. Emerging as a common denominator in these studies is a role for a transmembrane potential across the inner membrane in the production of mature stable mitochondrial gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1530031281,"The disulfide structure of mouse lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 has been determined by reverse-phase isolation and sequence analysis of the cysteine-containing tryptic fragments of the reduced and non-reduced deglycosylated protein. Half-cystines were distinguished (a) by their localization within tryptic or chymotryptic peptides that formed reverse-phase peaks unique to the reduced digests and (b) by their 3H-carboxymethylation only after reduction of the protein. The disulfide arrangement of the cysteines was assigned after isolation of disulfide-linked peptide pairs. Each pair chromatographed as a peak present in the nonreduced (but not the corresponding reduced) tryptic digest. NH2-terminal sequencing as well as reduction, alkylation, and rechromatography of the disulfide-linked fragments led to the following assignment of disulfide bonds: Cys11 and Cys50, Cys125 and Cys161, Cys198 and Cys235, and Cys303 and Cys340. This structure creates four 36-38-residue loops that are symmetrically placed within the two halves of the protein's intraluminal domain. The loops formed by the Cys11-Cys50 and Cys198-Cys235 bridges are homologous, and the Cys125-Cys161 and Cys303-cys340 loops form a second set of homologous domains. The conservation of cysteine residues among lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 suggests that this disulfide arrangement is common to both members of this family of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1567260262,"In a previous electron microscopic study of early fibrin polymers processed by freeze drying and rotatory shadowing, a large proportion of loosely constructed, frequently branching linear molecular chains was observed; their structural organization was inconsistent with a half-staggered double-stranded model for fibrin polymerization. These conflicting results prompted us to investigate the structure of early fibrin polymers prepared according to a large variety of methods currently used for electron microscopy of macromolecules. By use of a systematic random sampling procedure, fibrin polymers were photographically recorded. They were classified according to their morphological form, and the frequency of occurrence of each configuration was determined. Half-staggered double-stranded forms accounted for less than 1% of all types encountered. Interpretation of the structural organization manifested in the diverse polymer forms observed necessitated the construction of a new interlocked single-strand model for fibrin polymerization. The fibrin polymerization process combines simultaneous propagation of linear growth, branching, and lateral interlocking (leading to lateral association), resulting in the rapid formation of a fibrin network. The structural pattern developing during growth of fibrin polymers appears to be determined principally by the enzymatic mechanism and not solely by the intrinsic molecular structure of fibrinogen. The validity of the interlocked single-strand model was tested by selective fibrinopeptide-B-releasing experiments. Under such activation conditions, the polymer forms predicted according to this and the half-staggered double-strand models should differ; the structures observed were indeed consistent with the interlocked single-strand hypothesis. The compatibility of existing data with this model is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517421291,"This article deals with the elucidation of the steroid-binding site of human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). 17 beta-Bromoacetoxydihydrotesterone (BA-DHT) reacted with highly purified SHBG in a time-dependent and irreversible fashion. The interaction could be totally inhibited by the simultaneous addition of an excess of dihydrotesterone. At the completion of the reaction, the molar ratio of BA-DHT to SHBG was approximately unity. SHBG was affinity labeled with [14C]BA-DHT and submitted to acid hydrolysis. The released amino acids were evaluated on high performance liquid chromatography, and virtually all of the 14C was identified as 3-[14C]carboxymethylhistidine. Furthermore, [14C]BA-DHT-labeled SHBG was digested with trypsin, followed by isolation of the released tryptic peptides by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The 14C was localized to a single tryptic peptide. It contained 2' histidyl residues, corresponding to residues 235 and 251 in the known amino acid sequence of SHBG. Although most of the 3-[14C]carboxymethylhistidine, or its phenylthiohydantoin derivative, was trapped on the filter of the amino acid sequenator, sufficient radioactivity emerged to identify histidyl residue 235 as the labeled amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W2120924611,"Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA):cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) catalyzes the intracellular fatty acid esterification of cholesterol and is thought to play a key role in lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis. Herein we describe the purification and characterization of a novel pentacyclic triterpene ester from rabbit liver that has ACAT inhibitory activity. The inhibitor was purified by a combination of silicic acid chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography. The compound inhibited both rabbit and rat liver microsomal ACAT activity with an IC50 = 20 microM. The lipid did not inhibit fatty acid incorporation into triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, or phospholipids nor did it inhibit plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. However, rat liver microsomal acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase activity was inhibited by the terpene ester. Kinetic data are consistent with a mechanism in which ACAT is inhibited by the compound in an irreversible manner. The subcellular fractionation pattern of both ACAT activity and the ACAT inhibitor were similar in rabbit liver (both were approximately equally distributed in membranes that pelleted at 10,000 X g and 100,000 X g). A lipid with similar properties to the rabbit liver inhibitor was found in many other rabbit tissues, including adrenal and spleen, as well as in human liver. Rat liver did not contain this lipid. Structural analysis by NMR, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography indicated that the rabbit liver inhibitor was a fatty acid ester (mostly stearate) of a pentacyclic triterpene acid. The carbon skeleton of the triterpene moiety is a new member of the olean-12-ene triterpene family. Both the negatively charged carboxylic acid group of the triterpene moiety and the esterified fatty acid group were necessary for the ACAT-inhibitory activity of the triterpene ester. Lastly, we present preliminary data which, together with the structural homology of the rabbit triterpene with known plant compounds, suggest the hypothesis that the triterpene moiety of the rabbit ACAT inhibitor arises from dietary absorption of a plant triterpene."

(1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 964-971). To study the relationship between the molecular structure of Lipid A and its ability to activate human platelets, we used Lipid A homologs derived from Salmonella minnesota Re595 lipopolysaccharide. Preparations of Lipid A are heterogeneous in regard to the degree of substitution of fatty acids which result in multiple homologs. These were separated by thin-layer chromatography and characterized by fast atom bombardment spectroscopy and related techniques (Johnson R. S., Her, G.-R., Grabarek, J., Hawiger, J., and Reinhold, V. N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8108-8116). The homologs of monophosphoryl Lipid A (MLA) present in fractions TLC-8 (heptaacyl MLA ion, m/z 1953), TLC-7 (three hexaacyl species with predominant MLA ion m/z 1715), and TLC-6 (four pentaacyl homologs with predominant MLA ion, m/z 1505) induced secretion of [14C]serotonin and aggregation of platelets. Lipid A homologs in fractions TLC-5 (three tetraacyl MLA ions, m/z 1323, 1307, and 1279), TLC-4 (one major triacyl MLA ion, m/z 1097), TLC-3 (tetraacyl MLA ion, m/z 1278), TLC-2 (a diphosphoryl hexaacyl Lipid A ion, m/z 1795, and several ions of low abundance), and TLC-1 (two ions, m/z 1097 and 666) were not active in regard to human platelet aggregation and [14C]serotonin secretion. The most active homolog was heptaacyl MLA ion, m/z 1953, present in TLC-8, while homologs present in TLC-7 and TLC-6 were 5 and 10 times less active, respectively. Rapid phosphorylation of a human platelet protein of Mr 40,000-47,000 (P47), a substrate for protein kinase C activation, preceded secretion of serotonin when platelets were triggered by the most active heptaacyl MLA ion, m/z 1953. These events were time-dependent, with half-maximal response of phosphorylation of P47 at 30 s and [14C]serotonin secretion at 45 s. A marked difference in the degree of phosphorylation of P47 was observed with heptaacyl MLA homolog present in TLC-8 inducing complete phosphorylation (97%), whereas less acylated Lipid A homologs present in TLC-1 caused marginal phosphorylation (20%). These results indicate that the degree of acylation of monophosphoryl Lipid A determines its functional properties toward human platelets in regard to secretion of [14C]serotonin, aggregation, and activation of protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Male, young adult, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either control or suspended groups. Rats deprived of hind limb-to-ground contact forces had a 42% decrease in soleus muscle mass compared with the control group. Medial collateral ligament (MCL) length and cross-sectional area were measured, and each FMT complex was tension tested to failure. All failed at their tibia-MCL insertion. The ultimate load in the FMT and the peak Kirchhoff stress in the MCL (occurring immediately before insertion site failure) were significantly reduced in the suspended group. The suspended MCLs were 9.7% larger in area and 5.7% shorter in length than the controls under the same preload (0.25 N). We found no significant differences between the control and suspended MCLs in Green strain, stretch, or deformation immediately before insertion site failure, nor did we find a significant difference in the MCL tangent modulus. This study indicates that even acute periods of limb unweighting can structurally compromise bone-ligament insertions. Further, this study implies that the adaptations responsible for this structural compromise must involve acute changes in the intrinsic zone (or zones) of the bone-ligament insertion."

The authors also tested whether doses of GABA or IVM and volatile anesthetics were additive in their effects on C. elegans. Halothane (2.1%) did not shift the ED50 of IVM, but was antagonistic to GABA. Enflurane (4%) was antagonistic to both IVM and GABA. However, ED50s of halothane and enflurane were unchanged in the presence of IVM (35 nM) or GABA (150 mM).

https://openalex.org/W1606465866,Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 is rapidly inactivated by N-bromoacetyl-D-leucylglycine in a reaction which follows first-order kinetics at pH 8 and 37 degrees C. The concentration dependence of inactivation revealed saturation kinetics with an apparent Ki of 10 mM and kappa inact of 0.4 min-1 at saturating inhibitor concentration. Enzyme can be protected from inactivation by either the substrate Leu5-enkephalin or the competitive inhibitors Phe-Gly or Phe-Ala. Inactivation of enzyme by N-bromo-[14C]acetyl-D-leucylglycine proceeds with the incorporation of a stoichiometric amount of labeled inhibitor. Tryptic digestion of the radioactively labeled enzyme followed by high performance liquid chromatography allowed the isolation of a modified peptide with the sequence T-D-V-H-S-P-G-N-F-R in which histidine (His704) is the modified residue. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a mutant form of the enzyme in which histidine 704 was converted to a glutamine residue. This mutant enzyme retained less than 0.1% of the activity of the native enzyme. These results demonstrate that His704 is at the active site of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and suggest a catalytic role for this residue.

https://openalex.org/W1555423199,"Ribophorin I is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein characteristic of the rough portions of the endoplasmic reticulum where it is thought to play a role in the cotranslational insertion of nascent polypeptides. A rat ribophorin I cDNA was used to isolate four overlapping genomic clones from a rat EMBL3 genomic library. Restriction mapping, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing showed that these clones, spanning approximately 21 kilobases of chromosomal DNA, include the entire ribophorin I gene, as well as 15 kilobases (kb) of upstream sequences. Southern blotting analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-Chinese hamster cell hybrids demonstrated that the ribophorin I gene is located on mouse chromosome six. The ribophorin I gene contains 10 exons, seven of which encode the luminal domain of the polypeptide. Exon 8 encodes the trans-membrane domain and small portions of the flanking luminal and cytoplasmic domains. Exons 9 and 10 encode the remainder of the cytoplasmic domain, and the latter includes the 3'-untranslated portion of the mRNA. Six closely spaced transcription start sites located 3 to 24 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon were identified by primer extension analysis and S1 mapping. The sequence of a 1.3-kb region upstream of the cap sites was determined and found to contain three GC-rich potential Sp1-binding sites beginning at -14, -24, and -91 base pairs (bp), two octamer-like sequences at -233 and -1248 bp, and a CAAT-like box at -41 bp.

This paper describes the use and value of the application. Investigators benefit by a yearly self-assessment of the research progress and future plans. The noncompeting continuation application is part of the important communication and interaction that should exist between the investigator and NIH staff. NIH staff members use the application to determine important scientific advances that have resulted from supported grants. Many planning activities and required reports are based on information contained in these applications. NIH staff performs scientific and budgetary review to ensure that research progress is satisfactory and that all budgetary and certification issues are in order. Detailed guidance is provided to help the grantee prepare the application. A separate significance section is suggested as a means to document key findings and their importance.
