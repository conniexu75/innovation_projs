https://openalex.org/W2120572492,"MYC contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted MYC transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to RNA polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, we identify BET bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of JQ1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for BET bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc."

https://openalex.org/W1999580244,"Hamish Scott and colleagues report that germline mutations in GATA2 segregate with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in four pedigrees. The resulting alterations occur in a conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain of GATA2. We report the discovery of GATA2 as a new myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML) predisposition gene. We found the same, previously unidentified heterozygous c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) missense mutation in the GATA2 transcription factor gene segregating with the multigenerational transmission of MDS-AML in three families and a GATA2 c.1063_1065delACA (p.Thr355del) mutation at an adjacent codon in a fourth MDS family. The resulting alterations reside within the second zinc finger of GATA2, which mediates DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions. We show differential effects of the mutations on the transactivation of target genes, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and global gene expression. Identification of such predisposing genes to familial forms of MDS and AML is critical for more effective diagnosis and prognosis, counseling, selection of related bone marrow transplant donors and development of therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2087613795,"PPARγ is the functioning receptor for the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetes drugs including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These drugs are full classical agonists for this nuclear receptor, but recent data have shown that many PPARγ-based drugs have a separate biochemical activity, blocking the obesity-linked phosphorylation of PPARγ by Cdk5. Here we describe novel synthetic compounds that have a unique mode of binding to PPARγ, completely lack classical transcriptional agonism and block the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes and in insulin-resistant mice. Moreover, one such compound, SR1664, has potent antidiabetic activity while not causing the fluid retention and weight gain that are serious side effects of many of the PPARγ drugs. Unlike TZDs, SR1664 also does not interfere with bone formation in culture. These data illustrate that new classes of antidiabetes drugs can be developed by specifically targeting the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARγ."
https://openalex.org/W2111661868,"Sahar Mansour and colleagues report alterations in the transcription factor GATA2 in eight pedigrees with Emberger disorder, which is characterized by primary lymphedema and predispositon to acute myeloid leukemia. Most of the heterozygous variants lead to frameshift mutations and premature termination of GATA2. We report an allelic series of eight mutations in GATA2 underlying Emberger syndrome, an autosomal dominant primary lymphedema associated with a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. GATA2 is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in gene regulation during vascular development and hematopoietic differentiation. Our findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of GATA2 underlies primary lymphedema and predisposes to acute myeloid leukemia in this syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2171746679,"The Mollusca are one of the most successful animal phyla — ubiquitous, varied in body plan and with a long fossil record. Their interrelationships have been a matter of debate, but phylogenomic methods are beginning to resolve the issue. A new study answers some questions about the base of the molluscan tree, showing that, contrary to the traditional view, bivalves and gastropods are members of sister taxa. This finding also raises the possibility that centralization of neural and sensory organs in the head region, and the development of protective shells, may have occurred on several occasions in the evolutionary history of the molluscs. Evolutionary relationships among the eight major lineages of Mollusca have remained unresolved despite their diversity and importance. Previous investigations of molluscan phylogeny, based primarily on nuclear ribosomal gene sequences1,2,3 or morphological data4, have been unsuccessful at elucidating these relationships. Recently, phylogenomic studies using dozens to hundreds of genes have greatly improved our understanding of deep animal relationships5. However, limited genomic resources spanning molluscan diversity has prevented use of a phylogenomic approach. Here we use transcriptome and genome data from all major lineages (except Monoplacophora) and recover a well-supported topology for Mollusca. Our results strongly support the Aculifera hypothesis placing Polyplacophora (chitons) in a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora (worm-like molluscs). Additionally, within Conchifera, a sister-taxon relationship between Gastropoda and Bivalvia is supported. This grouping has received little consideration and contains most (>95%) molluscan species. Thus we propose the node-based name Pleistomollusca. In light of these results, we examined the evolution of morphological characters and found support for advanced cephalization and shells as possibly having multiple origins within Mollusca."
https://openalex.org/W2039616075,"Interleukin 7 (IL-7) and its receptor, formed by IL-7Rα (encoded by IL7R) and γc, are essential for normal T-cell development and homeostasis. Here we show that IL7R is an oncogene mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We find that 9% of individuals with T-ALL have somatic gain-of-function IL7R exon 6 mutations. In most cases, these IL7R mutations introduce an unpaired cysteine in the extracellular juxtamembrane-transmembrane region and promote de novo formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between mutant IL-7Rα subunits, thereby driving constitutive signaling via JAK1 and independently of IL-7, γc or JAK3. IL7R mutations induce a gene expression profile partially resembling that provoked by IL-7 and are enriched in the T-ALL subgroup comprising TLX3 rearranged and HOXA deregulated cases. Notably, IL7R mutations promote cell transformation and tumor formation. Overall, our findings indicate that IL7R mutational activation is involved in human T-cell leukemogenesis, paving the way for therapeutic targeting of IL-7R-mediated signaling in T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2158389792,"Post-translational modification of proteins by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates many cellular pathways that are critical for genome stability, including DNA repair, chromatin structure, mitosis and apoptosis. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is composed of repeating ADP-ribose units linked via a unique glycosidic ribose-ribose bond, and is synthesized from NAD by PAR polymerases. PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) is the only protein capable of specific hydrolysis of the ribose-ribose bonds present in PAR chains; its deficiency leads to cell death. Here we show that filamentous fungi and a number of bacteria possess a divergent form of PARG that has all the main characteristics of the human PARG enzyme. We present the first PARG crystal structure (derived from the bacterium Thermomonospora curvata), which reveals that the PARG catalytic domain is a distant member of the ubiquitous ADP-ribose-binding macrodomain family. High-resolution structures of T. curvata PARG in complexes with ADP-ribose and the PARG inhibitor ADP-HPD, complemented by biochemical studies, allow us to propose a model for PAR binding and catalysis by PARG. The insights into the PARG structure and catalytic mechanism should greatly improve our understanding of how PARG activity controls reversible protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and potentially of how the defects in this regulation are linked to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2034820020,"Matthew Meyerson and colleagues report the whole-genome sequencing of primary colorectal tumors and matched adjacent non-tumor tissue from nine individuals with colorectal cancer. They identify a recurrent VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusion in 3% of colorectal cancers. Prior studies have identified recurrent oncogenic mutations in colorectal adenocarcinoma1 and have surveyed exons of protein-coding genes for mutations in 11 affected individuals2,3. Here we report whole-genome sequencing from nine individuals with colorectal cancer, including primary colorectal tumors and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues, at an average of 30.7× and 31.9× coverage, respectively. We identify an average of 75 somatic rearrangements per tumor, including complex networks of translocations between pairs of chromosomes. Eleven rearrangements encode predicted in-frame fusion proteins, including a fusion of VTI1A and TCF7L2 found in 3 out of 97 colorectal cancers. Although TCF7L2 encodes TCF4, which cooperates with β-catenin4 in colorectal carcinogenesis5,6, the fusion lacks the TCF4 β-catenin–binding domain. We found a colorectal carcinoma cell line harboring the fusion gene to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for anchorage-independent growth using RNA interference-mediated knockdown. This study shows previously unidentified levels of genomic rearrangements in colorectal carcinoma that can lead to essential gene fusions and other oncogenic events."
https://openalex.org/W1998770186,"Andrea Ventura and colleagues report germline hemizygous deletions in the miR-17~92 cluster in individuals with features overlapping Feingold syndrome. Mice with targeted deletions in miR17~92 also display growth and skeletal defects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in animals and plants. Studies in a variety of model organisms show that miRNAs modulate developmental processes. To our knowledge, the only hereditary condition known to be caused by a miRNA is a form of adult-onset non-syndromic deafness1, and no miRNA mutation has yet been found to be responsible for any developmental defect in humans. Here we report the identification of germline hemizygous deletions of MIR17HG, encoding the miR-17∼92 polycistronic miRNA cluster, in individuals with microcephaly, short stature and digital abnormalities. We demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of miR-17∼92 is responsible for these developmental abnormalities by showing that mice harboring targeted deletion of the miR-17∼92 cluster phenocopy several key features of the affected humans. These findings identify a regulatory function for miR-17∼92 in growth and skeletal development and represent the first example of an miRNA gene responsible for a syndromic developmental defect in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2133230812,"Here we show that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) phosphorylates the spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) on its Thr48 and Ser61 residues and greatly enhances its nuclear migration in mice, whereas mutation of either residue to alanine substantially reduces its nuclear translocation and activity. We also show that p38 MAPK activity is markedly reduced in the livers of obese mice compared with lean mice. Further, we show that activation of p38 MAPK by expression of constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6Glu) greatly enhances nuclear translocation of Xbp1s, reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress and establishes euglycemia in severely obese and diabetic mice. Hence, our results define a crucial role for phosphorylation on Thr48 and Ser61 of Xbp1s in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in obesity, and they suggest that p38 MAPK activation in the livers of obese mice could lead to a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2044729426,"We report the involvement of an evolutionarily conserved set of mycobacterial genes, the esx-3 region, in evasion of bacterial killing by innate immunity. Whereas high-dose intravenous infections of mice with the rapidly growing mycobacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis bearing an intact esx-3 locus were rapidly lethal, infection with an M. smegmatis Δesx-3 mutant (here designated as the IKE strain) was controlled and cleared by a MyD88-dependent bactericidal immune response. Introduction of the orthologous Mycobacterium tuberculosis esx-3 genes into the IKE strain resulted in a strain, designated IKEPLUS, that remained susceptible to innate immune killing and was highly attenuated in mice but had a marked ability to stimulate bactericidal immunity against challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Analysis of these adaptive immune responses indicated that the highly protective bactericidal immunity elicited by IKEPLUS was dependent on CD4(+) memory T cells and involved a distinct shift in the pattern of cytokine responses by CD4(+) cells. Our results establish a role for the esx-3 locus in promoting mycobacterial virulence and also identify the IKE strain as a potentially powerful candidate vaccine vector for eliciting protective immunity to M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2000430854,"This study identifies a subset of microRNAs whose expression is differentially regulated by visual experience and finds that inhibition of one of the miRNAs, miR-132, in the mouse visual cortex impairs ocular dominance plasticity. Using quantitative analyses, we identified microRNAs (miRNAs) that were abundantly expressed in visual cortex and that responded to dark rearing and/or monocular deprivation. The most substantially altered miRNA, miR-132, was rapidly upregulated after eye opening and was delayed by dark rearing. In vivo inhibition of miR-132 in mice prevented ocular dominance plasticity in identified neurons following monocular deprivation and affected the maturation of dendritic spines, demonstrating its critical role in the plasticity of visual cortex circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2011194295,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate the existence of a mechanism in the human lateral occipital (LO) cortex that supports recognition of real-world visual scenes through parallel analysis of within-scene objects. Neural activity was recorded while subjects viewed four categories of scenes and eight categories of 'signature' objects strongly associated with the scenes in three experiments. Multivoxel patterns evoked by scenes in the LO cortex were well predicted by the average of the patterns elicited by their signature objects. By contrast, there was no relationship between scene and object patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), even though this region responds strongly to scenes and is believed to be crucial for scene identification. By combining information about multiple objects within a scene, the LO cortex may support an object-based channel for scene recognition that complements the processing of global scene properties in the PPA."
https://openalex.org/W2034104365,"Homeobox proteins Engrailed-1 (En1) and Engrailed-2 (En2) are transcription factors that direct midbrain cell specification during development. Here, the authors show that exogenous En1 and En2 protect against dopaminergic cell death in several rodent models of Parkinson's disease. Mice heterozygous for the homeobox gene Engrailed-1 (En1) display progressive loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. We report that exogenous Engrailed-1 and Engrailed-2 (collectively Engrailed) protect mDA neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a mitochondrial complex I toxin used to model Parkinson's disease in animals. Engrailed enhances the translation of nuclearly encoded mRNAs for two key complex I subunits, Ndufs1 and Ndufs3, and increases complex I activity. Accordingly, in vivo protection against MPTP by Engrailed is antagonized by Ndufs1 small interfering RNA. An association between Engrailed and complex I is further confirmed by the reduced expression of Ndufs1 and Ndufs3 in the substantia nigra pars compacta of En1 heterozygous mice. Engrailed also confers in vivo protection against 6-hydroxydopamine and α-synuclein-A30P. Finally, the unilateral infusion of Engrailed into the midbrain increases striatal dopamine content, resulting in contralateral amphetamine-induced turning. Therefore, Engrailed is both a survival factor for adult mDA neurons and a regulator of their physiological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1973643970,"miR-132 is a CREB-induced microRNA that is involved in dendritic spine plasticity. We found that visual experience regulated histone post-translational modifications at a CRE locus that is important for miR-212 and miR-132 cluster transcription, and regulated miR-132 expression in the visual cortex of juvenile mice. Monocular deprivation reduced miR-132 expression in the cortex contralateral to the deprived eye. Counteracting this miR-132 reduction with an infusion of chemically modified miR-132 mimic oligonucleotides completely blocked ocular dominance plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2086534524,"The ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) or ELAVL1 is implicated in a variety of biological processes as well as being linked with a number of diseases, including cancer. Despite a great deal of prior investigation into HuR, there is still much to learn about its function. We take an important step in this direction by conducting cross-linking and immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing experiments followed by an extensive computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong conservation of structure and sequence composition. Despite the fact that HuR sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR in regulating splicing. HuR sites in 3'-UTRs overlap extensively with predicted microRNA target sites, suggesting interplay between the functions of HuR and microRNAs. Network analysis showed that identified targets containing HuR binding sites in the 3' UTR are highly interconnected."
https://openalex.org/W2151147744,"Dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons mature from a filopodia-like precursor into a mushroom-shape with an enlarged post-synaptic density (PSD) and serve as the primary post-synaptic location of the excitatory neurotransmission that underlies learning and memory. Using myosin II regulatory mutants, inhibitors, and knockdowns, we show that non-muscle myosin IIB (MIIB) activity determines where spines form and whether they persist as filopodia-like spine precursors or mature into a mushroom-shape. MIIB also determines PSD size, morphology, and placement in the spine. Local inactivation of MIIB leads to the formation of filopodia-like spine protrusions from the dendritic shaft. However, di-phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain on residues Thr18 and Ser19 by Rho kinase is required for spine maturation. Inhibition of MIIB activity or a mono-phosphomimetic mutant of RLC similarly prevented maturation even in the presence of NMDA receptor activation. Expression of an actin cross-linking, non-contractile mutant, MIIB R709C, showed that maturation into a mushroom-shape requires contractile activity. Loss of MIIB also leads to an elongated PSD morphology that is no longer restricted to the spine tip; whereas increased MIIB activity, specifically through RLC-T18, S19 di-phosphorylation, increases PSD area. These observations support a model whereby myosin II inactivation forms filopodia-like protrusions that only mature once NMDA receptor activation increases RLC di-phosphorylation to stimulate MIIB contractility, resulting in mushroom-shaped spines with an enlarged PSD."

Extensive interaction between the helix bundle domain and the anticodon binding domain, resulting in structural rigidity in the presence of tRNA, has been detected. Based on the predicted model, six residues along the communication paths have been examined by mutations (single and double) and shown to mediate a coordinated coupling between anticodon recognition and activation of amino acid at the active site.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 3The abbreviations used are: aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseMDmolecular dynamicsCysAMPcysteinyl-adenylateCysRScysteinyl tRNA synthetaseDCCMdynamic cross-correlation mapDRdirect readoutIRindirect path. are an important class of enzymes involved in the processing of genetic information. These enzymes catalyze the attachment of amino acids to the 3′ end of their cognate tRNAs with the primary responsibility of synthesizing correctly matched aminoacyl-tRNAs that are used in decoding of genetic information. High resolution crystal structural analysis of representative members of each aaRS family has separated these enzymes into two classes (I and II) with unrelated active-site motifs (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes share the conserved HIGH and KMSKS motifs in a Rossmann-fold active site made up of alternating α helices and β sheets, whereas class II enzymes share three degenerate motifs in an active site made up of anti-parallel β sheets (2Webster T. Tsai H. Kula M. Mackie G.A. Schimmel P. Science. 1984; 226: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Both classes of enzymes have a second and less conserved domain responsible for the selection and binding of cognate tRNA. The two-domain structure accommodates the L-shaped tRNA by docking the acceptor stem and anticodon triplet into the active site and the anticodon binding domain, respectively (3Schimmel P. Giegé R. Moras D. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8763-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For the great majority of aaRS enzymes, mutations that disturb recognition of the anticodon triplet cause a severe loss of the catalytic efficiency of aminoacylation at the active site even though the two sites are physically separated by ∼70 Å in space (4Alexander R.W. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16359-16365Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This long-distance signaling suggests the existence of an allosteric mechanism of molecular communication that transmits the signal of anticodon recognition to the active site (5Del Sol A. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Amoros D. Nussinov R. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R92Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol.

However, the pathways within each aaRS-tRNA complex responsible for the communication are not well understood despite the available detailed structural information. aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase molecular dynamics cysteinyl-adenylate cysteinyl tRNA synthetase dynamic cross-correlation map direct readout indirect path. Elucidating the pathways of communication from the anticodon binding domain to the active site to achieve the specificity of aminoacylation is challenging for several reasons. First, molecular communication involves the trajectories between two points of contacts that are adjacent to each other or are separated by a distance. These trajectories are not readily deducible by crystal structures, which capture only snapshots in the dynamic process of synthetase-tRNA interaction. Second, a specific synthetase-tRNA complex proceeds through multiple stages of induced fit and mutual adaptation of both binding partners to give rise to the productive structure so that the basis for communication is not necessarily apparent from examining an existing structure. Third, discrimination among tRNAs by synthetases involves both “direct” and “indirect” readout. Direct readout refers to enzyme contacts with base-specific functional groups, whereas indirect readout refers to contacts with tRNA sugar-phosphate groups in sequence-dependent specific conformations. Operation of indirect readout mechanism is often proximal to the sites of direct mechanism, and both are further mediated by induced-fit rearrangements. Although the synergism arising from both direct and indirect mechanisms likely elevates the efficiency and specificity of communication, it also complicates the deciphering of the communication pathways. Amalgamation of graph theoretical techniques with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine cross-correlation among residues during the dynamics of tRNA-aaRS interactions can provide a powerful approach to elucidate biologically relevant pathways of allosteric communication. We have developed a robust yet simple methodology with these techniques to probe allosteric pathways of communication in several class I aaRSs. For example, we constructed unweighted graphs for methionyl and tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase on the basis of the non-covalent connectivity of side chains and residue cross-correlation information from MD simulations, which was used to determine correlated fluctuations and the extent of connectivity. Special attention was paid to the conserved residues to elucidate biological relevance. A similar approach has been developed by Luthey-Schulten and co-workers (9Sethi A. Eargle J. Black A.A. Luthey-Schulten Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6620-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) by weighing the network on the basis of cross-correlation values and by including the interaction with tRNA in the construction of graphs, resulting in insights into the paths of communication in glutamyl and leucyl tRNA synthetases. Several other concepts have also been explored to elucidate communication pathways within proteins. For instance, the pathways of signal transmission have been investigated using an integration of network theory and concepts of mutual information theory (10Chennubhotla C. Bahar I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: 1716-1726PubMed Google Scholar). Other techniques to study allosteric communication involve analysis of elastic network models in combination with structural perturbation methods (10Chennubhotla C. Bahar I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: 1716-1726PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zheng W. Brooks B.R. Thirumalai D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2289-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as well as exploitation of the concepts of linear response theory (12Atilgan C. Atilgan A.R. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Kong and Karplus (13Kong Y. Karplus M. Proteins. 2009; 74: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have proposed a methodology based on the tertiary coupling of interactions to shed light on the residues important for signaling in PDZ domain and rhodopsin, whereas other groups have investigated evolutionary data and related statistical coupling analysis to identify paths of communication (14Tang S. Liao J.C. Dunn A.R. Altman R.B. Spudich J.A. Schmidt J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R.

Most of these techniques, either alone or in combination, have provided valuable information on the residues that perform communication. In this work we investigated the MD simulation trajectory involving communication between the anticodon binding region and the aminoacylation site in CysRS, the smallest monomeric enzyme of the class I family (17Hou Y.M. Shiba K. Mottes C. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical studies of the model enzyme, Escherichia coli CysRS, have shown that mutations in the tRNA anticodon severely decrease the catalytic efficiency at the active site (18Komatsoulis G.A. Abelson J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7435-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Zhang C.M. Liu C. Slater S. Hou Y.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Liu C. Gamper H. Shtivelband S. Hauenstein S. Perona J.J. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating the existence of communication. A unique feature of CysRS is the strong emphasis on the use of both direct and indirect readout of tRNA to achieve the specificity of aminoacylation (21Hauenstein S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The small size of the enzyme offers an excellent model for the exploration of how the two readout mechanisms are integrated to establish communication. We have evaluated the dynamic correlation of residues involved in the two readout mechanisms with those involved in the aminoacylation activity in the active site. From this analysis we have proposed key residues that are crucial for communication and have subsequently determined the significance of a subset of these residues by biochemical analysis. Importantly, the identified residues required for the signaling of communication from the anticodon-binding site to the active site are not proximal to each other in the available structures of CysRS, indicating that the computation analysis showing their correlation provides an important complementary approach to understand the specificity of tRNA-aaRS interaction for aminoacylation. The modeled structures of CysRS-CysAMP and CysRS-tRNACys-CysAMP complexes were equilibrated by performing a long time simulation of ∼20 ns, and the equilibrated modeled structures were obtained for both of them. Using these two equilibrated modeled and ligand-unbound crystal structures of E. coli CysRS as starting structures, three separate MD simulations were performed at 300 K by using the AMBER 9 (22Case D.A.

The solvation box was 10 Å from the farthest atom along any axis, which resulted in 24,720, 24,709, and 28,134 water molecules, respectively, for the structures A, B, and C. The simulations were performed under NPT (isothermal-isobaric ensemble, i.e., constant temperature and constant pressure ensemble) conditions. van der Waals cut-off was set at 10 Å, whereas the pressure and temperature relaxations were set at 0.5 ps−1. The first 500 ps of simulations were considered as the equilibration phase, and the coordinate sets (snapshots) from the remaining 9.5 ns were used for analysis. A time step of 2 fs was used with the integration algorithm, and the structures were stored at every 1 ps. The dynamical nature of protein-tRNA network is evaluated using cross-correlation maps. Correlated displacements of protein residue/atom during the simulation can be described by Amadei et al. (26Amadei A. Linssen. A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), Cij=〈(ri-〈ri〉)(rj-〈rj〉)〉(〈rI2〉-〈rj〉2)(〈rj2〉-〈rj〉2)(Eq. 1) where i and j may correspond to any two atoms, residues, or domains. ri and rj are position vectors of i and j, and the angle brackets denote an ensemble average. Interatomic cross-correlation fluctuations between any two pairs of atoms (or residues) can be calculated using this expression and can be represented graphically by the dynamic cross-correlation map (DCCM). The value of Cij can vary from −1 (completely anti-correlated motion) to +1 (completely correlated motion). Protein structure networks are constructed based on the number of non-covalent interacting atoms between two residues. The details of the construction of such a network on the basis of interaction strength (Imin) and the implications of such network have been given earlier (27Kannan N. Vishveshwara S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Brinda K.V. Vishveshwara S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 4159-4170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The utilities of protein structure networks in the following MD trajectories have been discussed earlier (29Ghosh A. Brinda K.V. Vishveshwara S. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2523-2535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Ghosh A. Vishveshwara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15711-15716Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The shortest path between selected pairs of nodes in the network is found by using Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. The method of identification of the shortest path of non-covalently connected residues between specified region of the protein structure networks from MD snapshots has been described previously (30Ghosh A. Vishveshwara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15711-15716Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This involves identification of dynamically cross-correlated residues between end members from DCCM at two levels (highly correlated (Cij = 0.5–1.0) and weakly correlated (Cij = 0.3–0.5)). The distant correlated residues are connected spatially by non-covalent interactions in space by using protein structure networks. The shortest non-covalently connected path between the selected two residues was identified from the network analysis of the MD snapshots obtained from simulation trajectories. Protein structure networks contain k clique (a subgraph of k nodes, where each node is connected to each other) or community (two k cliques sharing k–1 vertices) that are densely interconnected nodes in the network. The network parameters, cliques, communities, and hubs were evaluated from all the snapshots of the MD simulations in all three structures and are based on the algorithm proposed by Palla et al. (31Palla G. Derényi I. Farkas I. Vicsek T. Nature. 2005; 435: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (4055) Google Scholar). They were considered dynamically stable if present in more than 50% of the simulation snapshots. These dynamically stable quantities represent the major conformational populations in the MD ensemble. The two-dimensional graphic representations of dynamically stable cliques and communities were drawn using CFinder (32Adamcsek B. Palla G. Farkas I.J. Derényi I. Vicsek T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and the schematic three-dimensional representations were drawn with VMD (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38428) Google Scholar). The transcript of E. coli tRNACys was made by in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase based on the template sequence constructed from overlapping oligonucleotides (20Liu C. Gamper H. Shtivelband S. Hauenstein S. Perona J.J. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The tRNA after denaturation by heat and annealing in the presence of 10 mm Mg+2 exhibited a plateau level of aminoacylation of ∼20%. The enzyme E. coli CysRS with a C-terminal His tag was purified from E. coli BL21 DE3 by using a Talon resin, and the concentration was corrected by active site titration. Aminoacylation of tRNACys by E. coli CysRS was performed as described previously (20Liu C. Gamper H. Shtivelband S. Hauenstein S. Perona J.J. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Steady state analysis was performed with 2 nm WT enzyme and up to 50 nm concentrations of mutant enzymes using tRNACys substrate in the range of 5-fold below and above the respective Km value of each enzyme. Aliquots of an aminoacylation reaction that allowed linear synthesis of Cys-tRNACys were collected by acid precipitation on filter pads, washed, dried, and analyzed by scintillation counting analysis. The aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by all aaRS enzymes takes place in two steps in which the first involves the activation of the cognate amino acid with ATP to generate an enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate (aaAMP), and the second involves the transfer of the aaAMP intermediate to the 2′ or 3′-OH group of the terminal ribose to form the aminoacyl tRNA. Based on the cysteine-bound E. coli CysRS crystal structure (24Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we extended cysteine to CysAMP using the MetAMP-bound methionyl tRNA synthetase crystal structure as a template (34Crepin T. Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Sampson P.B. Vaughan M.D. Honek J.F. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The AMP conformation in the modeled CysAMP structure is similar to the AMP conformation of MetAMP in methionyl tRNA synthetase. The CysAMP bound-CysRS structure was obtained by aligning CysAMP and MetAMP molecules using ALIGN (35Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Based on the CysAMP-docked E. coli CysRS crystal structure and the binary structure of the enzyme bound to tRNACys (21Hauenstein S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we built a ternary complex model consisting of the enzyme, CysAMP, and tRNACys. However, the docking of CysAMP in the active site of the binary CysRS-tRNA complex resulted in steric conflict of the base A76 with AMP. As a result, we modified the acceptor stem conformation using the crystal structure of the class I ternary complex of E. coli glutaminyl RS-tRNA-ATP as a template (36Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1991; 352: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The conformation of the last four nucleotides of E. coli tRNACys, U73-C74-C75-A76, was changed to a conformation similar to the conformation of the last four nucleotides in the corresponding positions of E. coli tRNAGln using the Insight II software developed by Accelrys (San Diego, CA). The modeled structure was energy-minimized using steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms to obtain a model of the ternary complex of E. coli CysRS-tRNACys-CysAMP. The modeled structure was simulated for an extended time (∼20 ns) to obtain the equilibrated structure (Fig. 1). The communication paths between tRNA recognition sites and the activated amino acid binding region (active site region) in E. coli CysRS were identified by analyzing the network parameters. We compared the dynamic cross-correlation of residues between these sites using molecular dynamics of three structures: the crystal structure of ligand-free CysRS (24Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (A), the equilibrated modeled structure of the CysAMP-bound CysRS (B), and the equilibrated modeled structure of the ternary complex of both CysAMP- and tRNACys-bound CysRS (C). The network analysis included both direct and indirect readout contact of tRNA recognition and direct contact with CysAMP, the latter of which serves as the end point in path calculation. The results are presented below. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 10 ns in aqueous medium on the three forms of CysRS described above. In the ligand-free enzyme, the Cα root mean square deviation values fluctuate significantly with a mean value of 3.4 ± 0.6 Å starting at around 2 ns, whereas in the enzyme complex with CysAMP and in the complex with both CysAMP and tRNACys, the Cα root mean square deviation values remained relatively stable at 2.1 ± 0.3 Å throughout the entire time course (Fig. 2). This comparison showed that the ligand-free enzyme exhibited more dynamics relative to the ligand-bound enzyme. Simulation analysis of CysRS in complex with CysAMP and in complex with CysAMP and tRNACys was performed to identify the dynamically stable interactions between CysAMP and the enzyme active site (details given in supplemental Table S1). The cysteinyl moiety of the ligand binds at the base of the active site in a conformation capable of making interactions with amino acids in both halves of the Rossmann fold (Fig. 3). This conformation is similar to the conformation of amino acid ligands bound to other class I aaRS enzymes. The α-NH3+ group of CysAMP donates hydrogen bonds to both the main chain of Gly-29 and the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-68 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table S1). The catalytically important zinc ion is coordinated by the thiol group of the cysteine substrate as well as by the side chains of Cys-28, Cys-209, His-234 and Glu-238. The side chains of Thr-31 and His-40 form hydrogen bonds with phosphate oxygen of CysAMP. The ribose 2′-OH group of CysAMP is stabilized by hydrogen bonds provided by the backbone and the side chain of Gly-227 and Asp-229, respectively. The adenine base is stabilized by the backbone of Val-260. Analysis of the dynamically stable interactions of CysRS in complex with CysAMP and tRNACys revealed that the anticodon loop spanning U32 to A38 makes contact only with the mixed α/β domain of CysRS (Fig. 4a). Nucleotides G34 and C35 are recognized by amino acids in a helix-loop-helix motif of the domain involving residues 423–443 of the enzyme. G34 forms three stable hydrogen bonds with Arg-423, Arg-427, and Asp-436. The other two bases of the anticodon C35 and A36 interact directly through stable hydrogen bonds with Arg-439 and Asp-451, respectively. The interactions with anticodon bases are stable and retained throughout the simulation. This analysis suggested that residues Arg-423 and Arg-427 are directly involved in tRNA recognition and are part of the network of direct readout communication path 1 (DR1). A helical bundle domain conserved in all subclass Ia aaRSs interacts with the anticodon stem and D stem. The anticodon stem is stabilized by a stable hydrogen-bonding interaction with phosphates at U39, C40, and C41 (Fig. 4b). In addition, the base oxygen of G24 in the D stem interacts directly with Gln-311, suggesting a second communication path for direct readout (DR2). Less conserved residues Arg-364, Arg-318, and Asn-367 of the helix bundle domain interact with the phosphate oxygen of U39-C40, C40, and C41, respectively, forming indirect readout IR1 (Fig. 4b and supplemental Table S2). In the tertiary core region, G15 is stacked on A14, allowing the 3′-phosphate of A14 to form hydrogen bond with Asn-351 in an indirect readout IR2 (Fig. 4c). Residues around the catalytic region that contact the 5′-end of the tRNA are involved in the indirect readout IR3, whereas those that contact the backbone of the terminal acceptor stem backbone are involved in the indirect readout IR4. These two indirect readout pathways may help to re-orient the tRNA CCA end away from the ATP site and to position it for catalysis. Allosteric signals within aaRSs arise from coupled motion between the residues in the active site domain and those in the tRNA binding domain, indicating long-range communication. The magnitude of coupled motion existing in the CysRS-tRNA crystal complex (21Hauenstein S. Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was computed as correlation coefficients from the MD trajectories. The DCCM for CysRS in complex with CysAMP and tRNACys is shown in Fig. 5. The local cross-correlations are shown along the diagonal, whereas positive and negative correlation motions are shown as above and below the diagonal, respectively. A significant amount of off diagonal correlations was observed due to positive correlation of distant residues separated in space. For example, the square boxes between the markings 22 and 131 and between 208 and 254 in the x and y axes exhibit positive correlation between two halves of the Rossmann-fold domain. In addition to intra-domain residue correlation, there are many inter-domain correlated residues, such as the strong positive correlation between Phe-44 from the Rossmann-fold domain and Gln-287 from the stem contact fold domain. Notably, in the ligand-free and CysAMP-bound CysRS, the anticodon binding domain residues are found to exhibit strong anti-correlation with the residues of the Rossmann-fold domain, the stem contact-fold domain, or the helix bundle domain (supplemental Fig. S1). However, binding of tRNA on the CysRS surface has reduced the anti-correlation of the residues in the anticodon binding domain with the rest of the protein, resulting in the ordering and stabilization of the anticodon binding domain from the structure observed in the absence of the tRNA (24Newberry K.J. Hou Y.M. Perona J.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2778-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The correlated motions of specific protein residues in the CysRS-tRNA complex provided the basis to propose cooperative networks among these residues by analysis of the dynamic cross-correlation map (Fig. 5). This analysis shows that the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-29 makes a hydrogen bond with the α-NH3 group of the cysteinyl group of CysAMP in a stable interaction throughout the simulation period, whereas residues Arg-423 and Arg-427 make direct contact with the anticodon bases of the tRNA, suggesting a pathway of communication from the direct readout of the anticodon bases to stabilize the aminoacyl moiety at the active site (supplemental Table S2). Hence, Gly-29 from the activation site and Arg-423 and Arg-427 from the anticodon region were selected to define the end points within which the shortest correlation paths were explored. Similarly, we used residue Asn-351 as the end point to explore the indirect readout paths. All of these paths were identified with strong correlations (Cij = 0.5–1.0) and are shown in Table 1. The correlated residues involved in each path from Arg-423/Arg-427 to Gly-29 and from Asn-351 to Gly-29 are marked with grey and light grey colored boxes (Fig. 5).TABLE 1Network of correlated residues identified from DCCM for the modeled structure of CysRS-tRNACys-CysAMP complex (system C)PathStrongGly-29 to Arg-423Gly-29–Phe-44–Phe-402–Arg-459–Arg-423Gly-29 to Arg-427Gly-29–Phe-44–Phe-402–Arg-459–Arg-427Cys-28 to Asn-351Cys-28–His-224–Met-225–Tyr-298–Asn-351 Open table in a new tab The cross-correlated residues important for long-range communication from the anticodon binding domain to the active site were incorporated into protein structure network analysis to better define the communication paths.

Recently, several MbtH-like proteins have been shown to be required for the adenylation of amino acid in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. We now investigated the role of MbtH-like proteins in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and simocyclinone D8 and of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18, involved in the biosynthesis of clorobiocin, simocyclinone D8, and vancomycin, respectively, required the presence of MbtH-like proteins in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming heterotetrameric complexes. In contrast, NovH, involved in novobiocin biosynthesis, showed activity in the absence of MbtH-like proteins. Comparison of the active centers of CloH and NovH showed only one amino acid to be different, i.e. Leu-383 versus Met-383. Mutation of this amino acid in CloH (L383M) indeed led to MbtH-independent adenylating activity. All investigated tyrosine-adenylating enzymes exhibited remarkable promiscuity for MbtH-like proteins from different pathways and organisms. YbdZ, the MbtH-like protein from the expression host Escherichia coli, was found to bind to adenylating enzymes during expression and to influence their biochemical properties markedly. Therefore, the use of ybdZ-deficient expression hosts is important in biochemical studies of adenylating enzymes.

Therefore, the use of ybdZ-deficient expression hosts is important in biochemical studies of adenylating enzymes. The adenylation of amino acids is a key step in the biosynthesis of many antibiotics (e.g. vancomycin and daptomycin), immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine A), siderophores (e.g. enterobactin and mycobactin), and other bioactive molecules (1Strieker M. Tanovi A. Marahiel M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The activated amino acids can be assembled to peptides by non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), 2The abbreviations used are: NRPSnon-ribosomal peptide synthasePCPpeptidyl carrier protein. leading, for example, to the backbone of vancomycin or can serve as precursors of non-peptidic antibiotics such as novobiocin, clorobiocin, and simocyclinone D8 (Fig. 1). Approximately half of the biosynthetic gene clusters for non-ribosomally formed peptides, as well as the gene clusters for clorobiocin and simocyclinone D8, contain so-called mbtH-like genes. These small genes are named after mbtH contained in the gene cluster for the siderophore mycobactin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which codes for a 71-amino acid protein. The function of mbtH-like genes has remained enigmatic for many years. The first proof that these genes are essential for secondary metabolite production was provided by a gene inactivation and complementation study by our group in clorobiocin biosynthesis (2Wolpert M. Gust B. Kammerer B. Heide L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and by a similar study in the biosynthesis of coelichelin and calcium-dependent antibiotics (3Lautru S. Oves-Costales D. Pernodet J.L. Challis G.L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vivo investigations were complicated by the fact that many bacterial genomes contain several mbtH-like genes that can functionally replace each other. The importance of a specific mbtH-like gene for the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite can be assessed only after all other mbtH-like genes in the genome have been inactivated (2Wolpert M. Gust B. Kammerer B. Heide L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Lautru S. Oves-Costales D. Pernodet J.L. Challis G.L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in vivo studies could not define the precise physiological function of the mbtH-like genes, e.g. in catalysis, regulation, transport, or protein-protein interactions. The three-dimensional structures of two MbtH-like proteins have been experimentally determined (4Buchko G.W. Kim C.Y. Terwilliger T.C. Myler P.J. Tuberculosis. 2010; 90: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Drake E.J. Cao J. Qu J. Shah M.B. Straubinger R.M. Gulick A.M. J. Biol.

The first biochemical evidence for the function of MbtH-like proteins in non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis has been recently provided in two rapid reports by Felnagle et al. (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (7Zhang W. Heemstra Jr., J.R. Walsh C.T. Imker H.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9946-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additional data were presented as part of a study on glidobactin biosynthesis (8Imker H.J. Krahn D. Clerc J. Kaiser M. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These reports showed that MbtH-like proteins interact with adenylating enzymes that are part of NRPSs. In vitro, the adenylating activity of these enzymes was strongly stimulated by the addition of MbtH-like proteins. Of the five adenylation domains that activate the different amino acids required for capreomycin biosynthesis, three were dependent on the presence of the MbtH-like protein CmnN, whereas the two others were not. The reason for this difference is unknown (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The heterologous expression of adenylating enzymes in Escherichia coli was found to be difficult or even impossible unless the respective MbtH-like protein was coexpressed simultaneously (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Zhang W. Heemstra Jr., J.R. Walsh C.T. Imker H.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9946-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Imker H.J. Krahn D. Clerc J. Kaiser M. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From these data, Imker et al. (8Imker H.J. Krahn D. Clerc J. Kaiser M. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) concluded that MbtH-like proteins act as activators, chaperones, or both in the NRPS assembly line. MbtH-like proteins form complexes with the adenylating enzymes, but the stoichiometry of these complexes has remained unclear. After purification of such complexes, the molar ratio of adenylating enzyme to MbtH-like protein was reported as 1:0.42 by Felnagle et al. (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and as 1:1.7 by Imker et al. (8Imker H.J. Krahn D. Clerc J. Kaiser M. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If the adenylating enzyme CmnO and the MbtH-like protein CmnN were purified separately, a mixture of both in a 1:1 molar ratio showed only low activity. 10-Fold higher activity was observed when the MbtH-like protein was added in a 16–32-fold molar excess (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, the composition of the complex of MbtH-like proteins with adenylating enzymes is still obscure. As pointed out in a recent review on the occurrence and functions of MbtH proteins (9Baltz, R. H. (2011) J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol., DOI: 10.1007/s10295-011-1022-8.Google Scholar), the requirement of many adenylating enzymes for MbtH-like proteins implies that the correct use of mbtH-like genes is a crucial factor for the success of combinatorial biosynthesis experiments. Our group is working extensively on the combinatorial biosynthesis of new aminocoumarin antibiotics (10Heide L. Biotechnol. Adv. 2009; 27: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Alt S. Burkard N. Kulik A. Grond S. Heide L. Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 304-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to investigate the role of mbtH-like genes in the formation of these antibiotics. The biosynthesis of aminocoumarins involves the adenylation of l-tyrosine, followed by its attachment to a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain and its β-hydroxylation by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (Fig. 2A) (12Heide L. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2009; 26: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The same reaction sequence is part of the biosynthesis of vancomycin and related glycopeptide antibiotics (14Recktenwald J. Shawky R. Puk O. Pfennig F. Keller U. Wohlleben W. Pelzer S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis, however, the resulting β-hydroxytyrosine is not transferred by a condensation domain to a peptide backbone. Rather, in the biosynthesis of vancomycin and the related balhimycin, β-hydroxytyrosine is liberated from the PCP domain by a thioesterase and subsequently activated by another specific adenylation domain of the vancomycin or balhimycin NRPS (Fig. 2A) (15Mulyani S. Egel E. Kittel C. Turkanovic S. Wohlleben W. Süssmuth R.D. van Pée K.H. ChemBioChem. 2010; 11: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In aminocoumarin biosynthesis, β-hydroxytyrosine is oxidized and cyclized to 4,7-dihydroxy-3-aminocoumarin, which is liberated from the PCP domain and subsequently connected to an acyl moiety via an amide bond (Fig. 2A). In contrast to non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis, formation of this amide bond does not involve the intermediary attachment of the acyl moiety to a PCP domain (12Heide L. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2009; 26: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Steffensky M. Li S.M. Heide L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21754-21760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic gene clusters of vancomycin, clorobiocin, and simocyclinone contain the mbtH-like genes orf1van, cloY, and simY, respectively. In the vancomycin cluster, the gene orf1van is located 14 kb upstream from the genes coding for the enzymes for tyrosine adenylation (i.e. Pcza361.18), β-hydroxylation, and thioester cleavage (Fig. 2B). In the simocyclinone and clorobiocin clusters, the mbtH-like genes simY and cloY are located directly adjacent to the genes responsible for tyrosine adenylation and β-hydroxylation, i.e. to simH/simI and cloH/cloI, albeit on different sides (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, the novobiocin cluster does not contain an mbtH-like gene, despite an otherwise exactly identical organization of the genes for aminocoumarin biosynthesis (Fig. 2B). In vivo studies have suggested that the formation of the aminocoumarin moiety of clorobiocin requires an intact mbtH-like gene, but the identical reaction sequence in novobiocin biosynthesis does not (2Wolpert M. Gust B. Kammerer B. Heide L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the facts that the tyrosine-adenylating enzyme NovH has the same size (600 amino acids) as CloH and that both proteins share 83% identity in their amino acid sequences (supplemental Fig. S1), this difference in the requirement for MbtH-like proteins is puzzling. We decided to express the tyrosine-adenylating enzymes NovH, CloH, SimH, and Pzca361.18 as well as the cognate MbtH-like proteins and to biochemically investigate these enzymes and the complexes formed by them. Tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate (3.38 TBq/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. l-Tyrosine was purchased from Merck. The genes novH, cloH, simH, cloY, and simY were amplified from cosmids containing the respective clusters (17Steffensky M. Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.X. Li S.M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Pojer F. Li S.M. Heide L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3901-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Galm U.

The gene cdaX was amplified from chromosomal DNA of Streptomyces coelicolor M512. Primers novH_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGT TCA ACA CAC GTG CGA AC-3′), novH_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG TCA CTC CTC CAG GGT CGC TA-3′), cloH_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGT TAA ACA CGG GTC TGA ACA A-3′), cloH_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG TCA CTC CCC GAG GGT CG-3′), simH_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CCA TGC CAT CCG GCA-3′), simH_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG TCA CTT CAC GGC CGT TGT GG-3′), cloY_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CGA CGA ACC CGT TCG A-3′), cloY_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG CTA CTC GCC ACC CAT CGC-3′), simY_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CCA ACC CGT TTG ACG A-3′), simY_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG TCA GCT GGG GTC CGT CG-3′), cdaX_f_NdeI (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGA CCA ATC CGT TCG AAG ACG-3′), and cdaX_r_XhoI (5′-GCC CTC GAG TCA GTT GCC GGT GCT CAT CG-3′) were used to amplify novH, cloH, simH, cloY, simY, and cdaX. The introduced NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of each primer are highlighted in boldface. The amplified products were purified by gel electrophoresis, digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes, and ligated into pET28a for expression as N-terminally His6-tagged fusion proteins. The nucleotide sequences of pcza361.18 and orf1van were optimized for expression in E. coli and synthesized commercially by Mr. Gene GmbH (Regensburg, Germany). The two genes were excised from their vectors with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into vector pET28a using the same restriction sites. For coexpression of CloH and CloY, both genes were ligated in the dual expression vector pETDuet1 (Novagen). The cloH gene was amplified with primers introducing a thrombin restriction site at the N terminus: cloH_f_BamHI (5′-CGG GAT CCC CTG GTC CCG CGT GGT TCC TTA AAC ACG GGT CTG AAC AAG GC-3′) and cloH_r_NotI (5′-A TAA GAA TGC GGC CGC TCA CTC CCC GAG GGT CG-3′). Restriction sites of each primer are highlighted in boldface, and the thrombin cleavage site is underlined. cloY was amplified with the same primers as described above and ligated via the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI, resulting in an untagged protein. The correct DNA sequences of the entire genes were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids pBB28 (simY), pBB32 (cdaX), and pBB34 (orf1van) and pBB37 (cloY) were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) cells. pBB25 (simH), pBB26 (cloH), pBB35 (cloH and cloY), pBB43 (pcza361.18), and pBB44 (novH) were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells either carrying or not a ybdZ deletion and carrying pSU20_sfp, a plasmid containing the gene for the Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Bacillus subtilis for expression of the holoenzymes (20Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔybdZ mutant was generated in BL21(DE3)/pIJ790 using Red/ET-mediated recombination (21Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). An apramycin resistance cassette (acc(3)IV) was amplified from plasmid pIJ773 (21Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR were as follows: ybdZ_f (5′-CCT CTG GCA ACC ACT TTT CCA TGA CAG GAG TTG AAT ATG TGT AGG CTG GAG CTG CTT C-3′) and ybdZ_r (5′-TGC CGG GCT GTG CGG CGA CCA AAG GTA AAT GCT GGC TCA ATT CCG GGG ATC CGT CGA CC-3′). The italic letters represent 39 nucleotides homologous to the regions up- and downstream of ybdZ, allowing Red/ET-mediated recombination. The amplicon was electroporated into a BL21(DE3)/pIJ790 strain after induction of the λ RED recombination system by arabinose. Strains containing the ybdZ::acc(3)IV mutation were selected on LB-apramycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, leading to loss of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pIJ790. The genotype of the resulting mutants was confirmed by PCR with chromosomal DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of CloH was carried out by PCR amplification of the template cloH_pGEMT using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with primer cloH_L383M_f (5′-CCC GAC TTG ACC GCG CAG aTG TTC GTG GCC AAC CCG T-3′) and the reverse complement. The base change is indicated by the lowercase letter. The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 18 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 6 min. The template DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C before transformation. The correct DNA sequence of the entire gene was confirmed by sequencing, and the DNA fragment was cloned in pET28a via NdeI and XhoI. 35 ml of an overnight culture in LB medium (50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol) of cells harboring the respective expression plasmid was used to inoculate 1 liter of Terrific broth (50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol). The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, cooled to 20 °C, induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and allowed to grow for an additional 14 h at 20 °C. The cells from each culture were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 4800 × g) and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) per 10 g of cells. 1% Tween 20 and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme were added, resuspended cells were broken by a Branson Sonifier, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (45 min at 35,000 × g). The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a linear gradient of 0–60% 250 mm imidazole (in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) over 60 min for elution. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and further purified with a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol; concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Mr cutoff of 10,000; Millipore); and stored at −80 °C. Concentrations of the purified proteins were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficients. The N-terminal His tags of the MbtH-like proteins were removed by incubation with 0.4 units of thrombin (Sigma)/mg of MbtH protein for 8 h at 4 °C before gel filtration. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes were used without further modifications. The MbtH-like proteins were obtained in the following amounts per liter of culture: CloY, 6.9 mg; SimY, 27 mg; CdaX, 23.8 mg; and Orf1van, 30.2 mg. From the ΔybdZ expression hosts, the tyrosine-adenylating enzymes were obtained in the following amounts: NovH, 38.6 mg; CloH, 2.83 mg; SimH, 9.4 mg; and Pcza361.18, 10.3 mg. From the ybdZ+ expression hosts, the yields were as follows: NovH, 64 mg; CloH, 11.3 mg; and Pcza361.18, 21.6 mg. The protein yield for the coexpression of CloH and CloY was 4.8 mg/liter of culture using the ΔybdZ expression host. The CloH mutant protein L383M yielded 1.46 mg/100 ml of culture. ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays (100 μl) contained 95 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 mm l-tyrosine, the respective tyrosine-activating enzyme (1 μm), the respective MbtH-like protein (1.2 μm) (unless other amounts are indicated), and 1 mm [32P]pyrophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were initiated by the addition of the tyrosine-activating enzyme, allowed to proceed for 5 min at 30 °C, and then quenched with 500 μl of a suspension of activated charcoal (1.6%, w/v) in quenching buffer (4.5% (w/v) tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 3.5% perchloric acid in water). The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with quenching buffer, resuspended in 0.5 ml of water, and added to 9 ml of scintillation liquid. Radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. The data reported are the means of two independent reactions. Activity is expressed in katals (22Dybkaer R. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For investigation of enzyme kinetics, nonlinear regression was performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. Analytical gel filtration was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a 24-ml bed resin and a buffer system of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. A standard curve plotting the log of molecular mass standards versus the calculated Kav was generated using the following protein standards: ribonuclease A, chymotrypsinogen, ovalbumin, albumin, aldolase, catalase, and ferritin (GE Healthcare). This standard curve was used to calculate the observed molecular mass of SimH and SimH-SimY complexes. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes NovH, CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18 as well as the MbtH-like proteins CloY, SimY, and Orf1van were expressed in E. coli as N-terminally His-tagged proteins and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, followed by gel chromatography. The MbtH-like proteins were subjected to thrombin cleavage to remove the His tag before gel chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The genome of E. coli contains an mbtH-like gene, ybdZ, in the gene cluster for the siderophore enterobactin. Felnagle et al. (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown that purified YbdZ can activate adenylating enzymes of different NRPSs, albeit with low efficiency. To exclude the possibility that YbdZ would copurify with the expressed adenylating enzymes and interfere with subsequent investigations, we deleted the ybdZ gene from the E. coli expression host utilizing the same Red/ET-mediated recombination strategy as described in a previous study of our group (11Alt S. Burkard N. Kulik A. Grond S. Heide L. Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 304-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of the adenylating enzymes were carried out using both the unmodified and ΔybdZ expression hosts. Notably, the yields of the adenylating enzymes from the ΔybdZ expression strain were two to four times lower than those from the unmodified strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using the ΔybdZ strain, most of the expressed CloH was insoluble, leading to a low yield of soluble protein (2.8 mg/liter of culture). This is in accordance with previously reported difficulties in expressing adenylating enzymes without the corresponding MbtH-like proteins (6Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Zhang W. Heemstra Jr., J.R. Walsh C.T. Imker H.J.

Supplemental Fig. S2 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the adenylating enzymes purified from the ΔybdZ strain and of the purified MbtH-like proteins. We also purified the MbtH-like protein CdaX encoded in the gene cluster for the calcium-dependent antibiotic of S. coelicolor. Our previous in vivo studies showed that cdaX can functionally replace cloY in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin moiety of clorobiocin (2Wolpert M. Gust B. Kammerer B. Heide L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The gene products of the MbtH-like proteins Orf1van (AAL90876.1), CloY (AAN65223), SimY (AAG34186), and CdaX (CAB38589) comprise 70, 71, 69, and 71 amino acids, respectively. As shown in a phylogenetic analysis of MbtH-like proteins by Zhang et al. (7Zhang W. Heemstra Jr., J.R. Walsh C.T. Imker H.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9946-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), CdaX and CloY are situated in close proximity in one branch of the phylogenetic tree, and Orf1van and SimY in another branch. The sequence identity among these proteins is ∼60%. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes Pcza361.18 (CAA11773) and CloH (AAN65224) comprise 580 and 600 amino acids, respectively, and show 43% identity to each other. In contrast, the gene product of simH (AAL15600) comprises 997 amino acids. Like Pcza361.18 and CloH, SimH contains an adenylation domain and a PCP domain, and these domains show 56% sequence identity to CloH. However, SimH carries an additional 400 amino acids at its N terminus. This domain shows moderate similarity to the condensation domains of NRPSs, but no function can be assigned to it in simocyclinone biosynthesis. As mentioned above, NovH (AAF67501) is exactly the same size as CloH, and these two proteins share 83% sequence identity (supplemental Fig. S1). The purified proteins were investigated for their tyrosine-adenylating activity using the well established pyrophosphate exchange assay, following the procedure described in a previous study on NovH (13Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). When assayed alone, CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18 showed a very low activity (Fig. 3). Upon addition of the respective MbtH-like protein, however, adenylating activity was readily detectable. A control with MbtH-like proteins alone showed no activity. The results depicted in Fig. 3 were obtained with proteins expressed in the ΔybdZ E. coli strain. If CloH and Pcza361.18 were expressed in an E. coli strain with intact ybdZ, the results were markedly different: in this case, the tyrosine-adenylating activity of CloH and Pcza361.18 alone could be clearly detected, amounting to 20–30% of the activity measured after the addition of the respective MbtH-like protein. This suggested that YbdZ of E. coli had been copurified with the heterologously expressed adenylating enzymes. In contrast, SimH purified from strains with the ybdZ gene intact did not show more activity than the protein purified from a ΔybdZ strain. In clear contrast to CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18, NovH purified from the ΔybdZ strain showed activity in the absence of an MbtH-like protein (Fig. 3). This MbtH-independent activity is in agreement with our previous in vivo study showing that biosynthesis of novobiocin, but not of clorobiocin, can be readily observed in strains that completely lack mbtH-like genes (2Wolpert M. Gust B. Kammerer B. Heide L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the activity of NovH was only moderate and was stimulated markedly upon the addition of CloY (Fig. 3). In view of the fact that the novobiocin cluster does not contain an mbtH-like gene, this result was unexpected. We determined the Km and kcat values for the adenylation of tyrosine catalyzed either by NovH alone or by a mixture of NovH and CloY using the pyrophosphate exchange assay. The Km value for l-tyrosine was nearly identical in both cases, but the addition of CloY clearly increased the observed turnover number (Table 1). We noticed, however, that the observed Km (275 μm) was more than five times lower than the Km of 1390 μm determined for the same enzyme in an earlier study by Chen and Walsh (13Chen H. Walsh C.T.

In this study, we demonstrate that Pten-depleted cells suffer from mitotic stress and that nuclear function of Pten, but not its phosphatase activity, is required to reverse this stress phenotype. Further, depletion of Pten results in elevated expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of the cell cycle. We show that overexpression of Plk1 correlates with genetic inactivation of Pten during prostate neoplasia formation. Significantly, we find that elevated Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival and that reintroduction of wild-type Pten into Pten-null prostate cancer cells reduces the survival dependence on Plk1. We further show that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. These findings identify a role of Plk1 in facilitating loss of Pten-induced prostate cancer formation, which suggests that Plk1 might be a promising target for prostate cancer patients with inactivating Pten mutations.

In principle, cancer arises from an accumulation of genetic mutations. Cancer cells are characterized by a common set of properties including sustenance of proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance of cell death, gain of replicative immortality, induction of angiogenesis, and activation of invasion and metastasis (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar). In addition, the stress phenotypes associated with cancers are proposed as new hallmarks, such as DNA damage/replication stress, proteotoxic stress, mitotic stress, metabolic stress, and oxidative stress (2Luo J. Solimini N.L. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2009; 136: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). However, how cancer cells adapt to these stresses is largely unknown. The tumor suppressor Pten 2The abbreviations used are: Ptenphosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10Plk1Polo-like kinase 1DMSOdimethyl sulfoxideAPCanaphase-promoting complex/cyclosomeCrecauses recombination.

The present study reports that Plk1 facilitates loss of Pten-induced prostate cancer formation. We show that depletion of Pten leads to elevated expression of Plk1. Overexpressed Plk1 adapts Pten-depleted cells to the mitotic stress. Significantly, Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells, suggesting a strategy for prostate cancer therapy. Prostate-specific Pten deletion mice (Ptenfl/fl; probasin-Cre) were generated as described previously (18Haverkamp J.M. Charbonneau B. Crist S.A. Meyerholz D.K. Cohen M.B. Snyder P.W. Svensson R.U. Henry M.D. Wang H.H. Ratliff T.L. Prostate. 2011; 71: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DU145 control or Pten-depleted cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) and inoculated into the flank of athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories). 1 week later, animals were randomized into treatment and control groups of five mice each. BI 2536 was dissolved in 0.1 n HCl, diluted with 0.9% NaCl, and injected into the tail vein twice weekly for 3 weeks. Tumor volumes, estimated using the formula: V = L × W2/2 (V, mm3; L, mm; W, mm), were measured every other day with digital calipers. A two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test was used to assess the difference between the effects of treatment on two cell lines. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistically significant differences from the mean in the xenograft study. Detailed information for these procedures is described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. To understand loss of Pten-induced transformation, we used DU145 cells, a prostate cancer cell line with wild-type (WT) Pten, to generate Pten-depleted cells by RNAi (supplemental Fig. S1). Significantly higher percentages of chromosome misalignment and lagging chromosomes in Pten-depleted cells were observed when compared with DU145 control cells (Fig. 1A). As a consequence of the higher chromosomal instability, Pten-depleted cells show a higher percentage of aneuploidy in interphase and a higher percentage of cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes in metaphase (Fig. 1, B and C). These data suggest that Pten is essential for accurate chromosome distribution during mitosis, and thus its depletion might result in mitotic stress. To test this hypothesis, we treated DU145 control and Pten-depleted cells with mitotic poisons and compared the responses. FACS analysis showed that more G2/M populations accumulated upon treatment by either nocodazole (inhibiting microtubule polymerization) or taxol (inhibiting microtubule depolymerization) in Pten-depleted cells than in Pten WT cells (Fig. 1, D, left panel, and E, left panel). We further compared mitotic indices in these two isogenic cell lines. In agreement with the FACS profiles, Pten-depleted cells showed a higher mitotic index than Pten WT cells (Fig. 1, D, right panel, and E, right panel), confirming the mitotic stress associated with Pten-depleted cells. To dissect the mechanism for Pten loss-induced mitotic stress, we reintroduced Pten WT, Pten-K13E,K289E (nucleus-excluded mutant), or Pten-C124S (phosphatase-inactive mutant) into PC-3 cells (Pten-null) and examined their effects on this stress phenotype. When GFP-Pten-WT was introduced into PC-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S6A), we found that PC-3 cells expressing GFP-Pten-WT became less sensitive to mitotic perturbation than control PC-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), confirming that mitotic stress is caused by Pten depletion. Reintroduction of Pten-C124S but not Pten-K13E,K289E into PC-3 cells reversed the stress phenotype (supplemental Fig. S2, C–F), suggesting that this mitotic stress depends on Pten nuclear function but not its phosphatase activity. However, how these cells adapt to the stress is unknown. Plk1, a critical mitotic player, is essential for checkpoint recovery and adaptation (12van Vugt M.A. Brás A. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Syljuåsen R.G. Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10253-10257Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, Plk1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and linked to higher tumor grade (15Weichert W. Schmidt M. Gekeler V. Denkert C. Stephan C. Jung K. Loening S. Dietel M. Kristiansen G. Prostate. 2004; 60: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of mitotic stress adaptation after loss of Pten, we first compared the Plk1 expression levels in prostate tissue from Pten+/+, Pten+/−, or Pten−/− mice, which mimic human prostate cancer progression. As shown in Fig. 2A, increasing Plk1 expression in prostate epithelial cells is associated with a gradual loss of Pten and is accompanied by prostate luminal cell over-proliferation. These data suggest a possible role of high Plk1 expression in facilitating prostate tumor formation induced by loss of Pten. Loss of Pten leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate downstream targets including Akt kinase (6Majumder P.K. Sellers W.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7465-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a positive correlation between Plk1 elevation and Akt activation is expected if Plk1 plays a critical role in Pten loss-induced prostate cancer progression. Accordingly, we analyzed the levels of Plk1 and the states of Akt in a human prostate cancer tissue array that included samples from normal prostate, prostate hyperplasia, and prostate malignant tumor. As indicated in Fig. 2B, among 20 prostate hyperplasia tissue samples examined, nine cases exhibited high Plk1 levels, seven cases with activation of Akt (detected by phospho-Ser-473 Akt staining), and in six of these cases, Plk1 overexpression correlated with activation of Akt. Furthermore, among 50 prostate malignant tumor samples, 24 cases exhibited Plk1 overexpression, 20 cases with activation of Akt, and in 16 of these cases, Plk1 overexpression correlated with activation of Akt. Pten protein level was also examined in this human prostate cancer array. We observed that two among 20 hyperplasia samples and six among 50 malignant samples show Pten-negative staining, and these samples are correlated with Plk1 overexpression (Fig. 2B, panels j and k). 18 among 20 hyperplasia samples and 44 among 50 malignant samples show Pten-positive staining (Fig. 2B, panels h and i), which is consistent with previous studies that complete loss of Pten is not a high frequent event for human prostate cancer (20Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 21Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2008; 133: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Overall, we observed a positive correlation between Plk1 elevation and inactivation of Pten during human prostate cancer progression. In addition, we noticed that in these human prostate hyperplasia samples, Plk1 expression in stromal cells is higher than in epithelial cells, which is different from Plk1 overexpression in Pten−/+ mouse prostate epithelial cells. The reason for this difference is that knockout of Pten is limited in mouse prostate epithelial cells by probasin-driven Cre recombination. In addition, it was reported that inactivation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts accelerated the initiation and progression of epithelial tumors (22Trimboli A.J. Cantemir-Stone C.Z. Li F. Wallace J.A.

Whether the elevated Plk1 in human prostate stroma is involved in this process needs further experimentation. To evaluate the significance of Plk1 in Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells, we inhibited Plk1 activity by using BI 2536, a specific Plk1 inhibitor under clinical trial (23Schöffski P. Blay J.Y.

FACS analysis and mitotic index measurements suggested that Pten-depleted cells responded to inhibition of Plk1 more rapidly than Pten WT cells (Fig. 3A). Significantly, Plk1 inhibition produced a more severe apoptosis response in Pten-depleted cells than in Pten WT cells, as indicated by a higher level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a marker for apoptosis (Fig. 3B, left panel). Plk1 protein levels increased in both cell lines upon treatment with 20 mm BI 2536, which is due to enrichment of mitotic cells by inhibition of Plk1. Interestingly, Plk1 protein level was elevated after Pten depletion even without BI 2536 treatment (Fig. 3B, left panel, compare lane 1 and lane 4), which is consistent with the observation in the prostate tissue array study (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of Plk1 preferentially decreased the viability of Pten-depleted cells, but not Pten WT cells (Fig. 3B, right panel). Moreover, a similar result was observed in two additional Pten-depleted DU145 cell lines generated by Pten RNAi targeting different sites (supplemental Fig. S3). To rule out the possibility of off-target effect of BI 2536, we also inhibited Plk1 by RNAi. We found that knockdown of Plk1 had a more pronounced effect on Pten-depleted cells than Pten WT cells because Plk1 knockdown led to a higher mitotic index and a lower cell survival rate in the Pten-depleted cells (supplemental Fig. S4). These data suggest that Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival. To extend these observations to a more relevant process for prostate cancer progression, we generated a Pten-depleted line of RWPE-1 (supplemental Fig. S5), a non-transformed prostate cell line. Plk1 expression is elevated after Pten depletion (supplemental Fig. S5), and Pten-depleted RWPE-1 cells were hypersensitive to inhibition of Plk1 (Fig. 3, C and D), confirming the role of Plk1 in counteracting mitotic stress induced by loss of Pten. Consistent with recent study by Song et al. (26Song M.S. Carracedo A. Salmena L. Song S.J. Egia A. Malumbres M. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2011; 144: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we also observed that restoration of Pten in Pten-null cells attenuates the dependence on Plk1 (supplemental Fig. S6, A–C), and this restoration depends on Pten nuclear function but not its phosphatase activity (supplemental Fig. S6, D and E). To gain more insight for the role of Plk1 during prostate cancer progression, we asked whether Plk1 functions similarly in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells that represent an early stage of prostate cancer formation. Toward this end, we reintroduced Pten into LNCap cells, which contain androgen receptors and respond to androgen treatment. As shown in supplemental Fig. S7, reintroduction of GFP-Pten in LNCap cells also attenuates the sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition, suggesting a role of Plk1 in adapting to mitotic stress in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. To further evaluate the significance of Plk1 on tumorigenic properties of Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells, we performed a soft agar assay to compare the inhibitory effect of Plk1 inhibition on anchorage-independent growth of Pten-depleted cells and Pten WT cells. As shown in Fig. 3E, Plk1 inhibition had a more pronounced effect in reducing colony numbers in Pten-depleted cells than in Pten WT cells, suggesting that Pten-depleted cells rely more on Plk1 than Pten WT cells for anchorage-independent growth. Given that results based on cell-based assay do not necessarily reflect the consequence in vivo, we used Pten-depleted and Pten WT DU145 cells to compare the dependence of Plk1 on tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. We found that Pten-depleted DU145 cells without BI 2536 treatment showed the most aggressive tumor growth (Fig. 3F), indicating that loss of Pten up-regulates the tumorigenic competence. A 3-week treatment of BI 2536 (25 mg/kg) completely suppressed the growth of tumors derived from Pten-depleted DU145 cells but had no significant inhibitory effect on the growth of tumors derived from WT DU145 cells (Fig. 3F). These in vivo data suggest that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells. Most phenotypes associated with loss of Pten can be explained by the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway (4Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J.

Pten is reported to maintain centromere integrity by direct interaction with CENP-C, a key centromeric protein (27Shen W.H. Balajee A.S. Wang J. Wu H. Eng C. Pandolfi P.P. Yin Y. Cell. 2007; 128: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Consistent with the function of Pten during mitosis, we demonstrated that Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells suffer with mitotic stress and that this stress phenotype is dependent on Pten nuclear function but not its phosphatase activity. We found that Plk1 expression is elevated in these cells and that Plk1 is required to adapt to the mitotic stress for cell survival. Significantly, we further showed that Plk1 plays a critical role in maintaining the tumorigenic competence of Pten-depleted prostate cancer cells. These observations identify a role of Plk1 in facilitating loss of Pten-induced prostate cancer formation and provide a mechanism explaining how cancer cells overcome oncogenesis-associated cellular stress. Inhibition of Plk1 preferentially suppresses tumor growth of Pten-depleted cells in a mouse xenograft model (Fig. 3F), suggesting that Plk1 might be a promising target for prostate cancer patients with genetic inactivation of Pten. A major concern for applying a Plk1 inhibitor such as BI 2536 for cancer treatment is the potential toxicity to normal tissues within its effective concentration. Our data indicate that Pten status plays an important role in determining the sensitivity of cells for inhibition of Plk1 because we found that 5 nm BI 2536 treatment efficiently inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells without Pten (Fig. 3B, right panel) but did not affect normal prostate cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that inhibition of Plk1 can specifically kill Pten-null cancer cells within a reasonable therapeutic window. During the preparation of this manuscript, Song et al. (26Song M.S. Carracedo A. Salmena L. Song S.J. Egia A. Malumbres M. Pandolfi P.P.

Plk1 degradation is triggered by APC-Cdh1 in the late mitosis, so this study provides a mechanistic explanation for how loss of Pten results in overexpression of Plk1. However, why Pten-depleted cells are hypersensitive to Plk1 inhibition is not clear. We demonstrate that Pten depletion leads to mitotic stress and that Plk1 plays an essential role in adapting to this mitotic stress. Consistent with the study by Song et al. (26Song M.S. Carracedo A.

https://openalex.org/W2083951271,"The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway plays critical roles in virtually all aspects of cell biology. Enzymes of the ubiquitin pathway add (ligases) or remove (deubiquitinases) ubiquitin tags to or from their target proteins in a selective fashion. USP2a is a member of a subfamily of deubiquitinases, called ubiquitin-specific cysteine proteases (USPs). Although USP2a has been reported to be a bona fide oncogene that regulates the stability of MDM2, MDMX, and FAS, it is likely that there are other unidentified substrates for USP2a. In this study, we show that USP2a mediates mitotic progression by regulating the stability of Aurora-A. Through cell-based screening of a USP siRNA library, we discovered that knockdown of USP2a reduced the protein levels of Aurora-A. USP2a interacts with Aurora-A directly in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Aurora-A is a substrate for USP2a in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides a novel mechanism for the role of USP2a in mediating the stability of Aurora-A."

Several naphthoquinones (plumbagin, naphthazarin, juglone, menadione, diosquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone), plus p-hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone were evaluated for their ability to cause a reduction of nitric oxide (NO) production, when RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Dexamethasone was used as positive control. Among the tested compounds, diosquinone was the only one that caused a NO reduction with statistical importance and without cytotoxicity: an IC(25) of 1.09±0.24 µM was found, with 38.25±6.50% (p<0.001) NO reduction at 1.5 µM. In order to elucidate if this NO decrease resulted from the interference of diosquinone with cellular defence mechanisms against LPS or to its conversion into peroxynitrite, by reaction with superoxide radical formed by naphthoquinones redox cycling, 3-nitrotyrosine and superoxide determination was also performed. None of these parameters showed significant changes relative to control. Furthermore, diosquinone caused a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore, according to the results obtained, diosquinone, studied for its anti-inflammatory potential for the first time herein, has beneficial effects in inflammation control. This study enlightens the mechanisms of action of naphthoquinones in inflammatory models, by checking for the first time the contribution of oxidative stress generated by naphthoquinones to NO reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1969506932,"The endoderm-inducing effect of the mesoderm-derived supportive cell line M15 on embryonic stem (ES) cells is partly mediated through the extracellular matrix, of which laminin α5 is a crucial component. Mouse ES or induced pluripotent stem cells cultured on a synthesized basement membrane (sBM) substratum, using an HEK293 cell line (rLN10-293 cell) stably expressing laminin-511, could differentiate into definitive endoderm and subsequently into pancreatic lineages. In this study, we investigated the differentiation on sBM of mouse and human ES cells into hepatic lineages. The results indicated that the BM components played an important role in supporting the regional-specific differentiation of ES cells into hepatic endoderm. We show here that knockdown of integrin β1 (Itgb1) in ES cells reduced their differentiation into hepatic lineages and that this is mediated through Akt signaling activation. Moreover, under optimal conditions, human ES cells differentiated to express mature hepatocyte markers and secreted high levels of albumin. This novel procedure for inducing hepatic differentiation will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling lineage-specific fates during gut regionalization. It could also represent an attractive approach to providing a surrogate cell source, not only for regenerative medicine, but also for pharmaceutical and toxicologic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2054780422,"Successful integration of various simultaneously perceived perceptual signals is crucial for social behavior. Recent findings indicate that this multisensory integration (MSI) can be modulated by attention. Theories of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) suggest that MSI is affected in this population while it remains unclear to what extent this is related to impairments in attentional capacity. In the present study Event-related potentials (ERPs) following emotionally congruent and incongruent face-voice pairs were measured in 23 high-functioning, adult ASD individuals and 24 age- and IQ-matched controls. MSI was studied while the attention of the participants was manipulated. ERPs were measured at typical auditory and visual processing peaks, namely, P2 and N170. While controls showed MSI during divided attention and easy selective attention tasks, individuals with ASD showed MSI during easy selective attention tasks only. It was concluded that individuals with ASD are able to process multisensory emotional stimuli, but this is differently modulated by attention mechanisms in these participants, especially those associated with divided attention. This atypical interaction between attention and MSI is also relevant to treatment strategies, with training of multisensory attentional control possibly being more beneficial than conventional sensory integration therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1991655436,"The superficial zone (SZ) of articular cartilage is critical in maintaining tissue function and homeostasis and represents the site of the earliest changes in osteoarthritis (OA). The expression of chromatin protein HMGB2 is restricted to the SZ, which contains cells expressing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers. Age-related loss of HMGB2 and gene deletion are associated with reduced SZ cellularity and early onset OA. This study addressed HMGB2 expression patterns in MSC and its role during differentiation. HMGB2 was detected at higher levels in human MSC as compared with human articular chondrocytes, and its expression declined during chondrogenic differentiation of MSC. Lentiviral HMGB2 transduction of MSC suppressed chondrogenesis as reflected by an inhibition of Col2a1 and Col10a1 expression. Conversely, in bone marrow MSC from Hmgb2(-/-) mice, Col10a1 was more strongly expressed than in wild-type MSC. This is consistent with in vivo results from mouse growth plates showing that Hmgb2 is expressed in proliferating and prehypertrophic zones but not in hypertrophic cartilage where Col10a1 is strongly expressed. Osteogenesis was also accelerated in Hmgb2(-/-) MSC. The expression of Runx2, which plays a major role in late stage chondrocyte differentiation, was enhanced in Hmgb2(-/-) MSC, and HMGB2 negatively regulated the stimulatory effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on the Runx2 proximal promoter. These results demonstrate that HMGB2 expression is inversely correlated with the differentiation status of MSC and that HMGB2 suppresses chondrogenic differentiation. The age-related loss of HMGB2 in articular cartilage may represent a mechanism responsible for the decline in adult cartilage stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2071034043,"Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) belongs to the TGFβ-superfamily. Previously, we had demonstrated that BMP10 is a key regulator for ventricular chamber formation, growth, and maturation. Ablation of BMP10 leads to hypoplastic ventricular wall formation, and elevated levels of BMP10 are associated with abnormal ventricular trabeculation/compaction and wall maturation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BMP10 regulates ventricle wall growth and maturation is still largely unknown. In this study, we sought to identify the specific transcriptional network that is potentially mediated by BMP10. We analyzed and compared the gene expression profiles between α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC)-BMP10 transgenic hearts and nontransgenic littermate controls using Affymetrix mouse exon arrays. T-box 20 (Tbx20), a cardiac transcription factor, was significantly up-regulated in αMHC-BMP10 transgenic hearts, which was validated by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Ablation of BMP10 reduced Tbx20 expression specifically in the BMP10-expressing region of the developing ventricle. In vitro promoter analysis demonstrated that BMP10 was able to induce Tbx20 promoter activity through a conserved Smad binding site in the Tbx20 promoter proximal region. Furthermore, overexpression of Tbx20 in myocardium led to dilated cardiomyopathy that exhibited ventricular hypertrabeculation and an abnormal muscular septum, which phenocopied genetically modified mice with elevated BMP10 levels. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the BMP10-Tbx20 signaling cascade is important for ventricular wall development and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2092362354,"Although the p53 tumor suppressor is relatively well characterized, much less is known about the functions of other members of the p53 family, p73 and p63. Here, we present evidence that in specific pathological conditions caused by exposure of normal cells to bile acids in acidic conditions, p73 protein plays the predominant role in the DNA damage response. These pathological conditions frequently occur during gastric reflux in the human esophagus and are associated with progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We found that despite strong DNA damage induced by bile acid exposure, only p73 (but not p53 and p63) is selectively activated in a c-Abl kinase-dependent manner. The activated p73 protein induces DNA damage repair. Using a human DNA repair PCR array, we identified multiple DNA repair genes affected by p73. Two glycosylases involved in base excision repair, SMUG1 and MUTYH, were characterized and found to be transcriptionally regulated by p73 in DNA damage conditions. Using a surgical procedure in mice, which recapitulates bile acid exposure, we found that p73 deficiency is associated with increased DNA damage. These findings were further investigated with organotypic and traditional cell cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2093549472,"The white spotted tussock moth, Orgyia thyellina, is a typical insect that exhibits seasonal polyphenisms in morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, including a life-history tradeoff known as oogenesis-flight syndrome. However, the developmental processes and molecular mechanisms that mediate developmental plasticity, including life-history tradeoff, remain largely unknown. To analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in reproductive polyphenism, including the diapause induction, we first cloned and characterized the diapause hormone-pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (DH-PBAN) cDNA encoding the five Phe-X-Pro-Arg-Leu-NH2 (FXPRLa) neuropeptides: DH, PBAN, and α-, β-, and γ-SGNPs (subesophageal ganglion neuropeptides). This gene is expressed in neurosecretory cells within the subesophageal ganglion whose axonal projections reach the neurohemal organ, the corpus cardiacum, suggesting that the DH neuroendocrine system is conserved in Lepidoptera. By injection of chemically synthetic DH and anti-FXPRLa antibody into female pupae, we revealed that not only does the Orgyia DH induce embryonic diapause, but also that this neuropeptide induces seasonal polyphenism, participating in the hypertrophy of follicles and ovaries. In addition, the other four FXPRLa also induced embryonic diapause in O. thyellina, but not in Bombyx mori. This is the first study showing that a neuropeptide has a pleiotropic effect in seasonal reproductive polyphenism to accomplish seasonal adaptation. We also show that a novel factor (i.e., the DH neuropeptide) acts as an important inducer of seasonal polyphenism underlying a life-history tradeoff. Furthermore, we speculate that there must be evolutionary conservation and diversification in the neuroendocrine systems of two lepidopteran genera, Orgyia and Bombyx, in order to facilitate the evolution of coregulated life-history traits and tradeoffs."

Using our in vitro model for human schwannoma, we found that schwannoma cells display enhanced proliferation because of the overexpression/activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor and ErbB2/3, increased cell-matrix adhesion because of the overexpression of integrins, and decreased apoptosis. Mechanisms underlying schwannomas basal proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion are not understood. Here, we investigated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), which is expressed and released from central nervous system tumours and strongly overexpressed in schwannoma at the mRNA level. IGFBP-1 acts via β1-integrin and focal-adhesion-kinase (FAK), which are strongly overexpressed and basally activated in schwannoma. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown, small inhibitors and recombinant IGFBP-1, we demonstrate that schwannoma cells, in contrast to Schwann cells, release IGFBP-1 that activates the Src/FAK pathway, via integrin β1, potentiating schwannoma's proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion. We show that FAK localizes to the nucleus and Src triggers IGFBP-1 production. Further, we observed downregulation of the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog in schwannoma cells leading to increased activity of anti-apoptotic AKT. Thus, IGFBP-1/integrin β1/Src/FAK pathway has a crucial role in merlin-related tumourigenesis and therefore represents an important therapeutic target in the treatment of merlin-deficient tumours."

PA1b belongs to the inhibitory cystine knot family or knottin family.

Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques on Sf9 PA1b-sensitive lepidopteran insect cells, we discovered that PA1b reversibly blocked ramp membrane currents in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.52 μm). PA1b had the same effect as bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump (V-type H+-ATPase), and the PA1b-sensitive current depended on the internal proton concentration. Biochemical assays on purified V-ATPase from the lepidopteran model Manduca sexta showed that PA1b inhibited the V1V0-type H+-ATPase holoenzyme activity (IC50 ∼ 70 nm) by interacting with the membrane-bound V0 part of the V-ATPase. V-ATPase is a complex protein that has been studied increasingly because of its numerous physiological roles. In the midgut of insects, V-ATPase activity is essential for energizing nutrient absorption, and the results reported in this work explain the entomotoxic properties of PA1b. Targeting V-ATPase is a promising means of combating insect pests, and PA1b represents the first peptidic V-ATPase inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W1988797182,"Smooth muscle relaxation in response to NO signaling is due, in part, to a Ca(2+)-independent activation of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase by protein kinase G Iα (PKGIα). MLC phosphatase is a trimeric complex of a 20-kDa subunit, a 38-kDa catalytic subunit, and a 110-133-kDa myosin-targeting subunit (MYPT1). Alternative mRNA splicing produces four MYPT1 isoforms, differing by the presence or absence of a central insert and leucine zipper (LZ). The LZ domain of MYPT1 has been shown to be important for PKGIα-mediated activation of MLC phosphatase activity, and changes in LZ+ MYPT1 isoform expression result in changes in the sensitivity of smooth muscle to NO-mediated relaxation. Furthermore, PKGIα has been demonstrated to phosphorylate Ser-694 of MYPT1, but phosphorylation at this site does not always accompany cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. This study was designed to determine whether MYPT1 isoforms are differentially phosphorylated by PKGIα. The results demonstrate that purified LZ+ MYPT1 fragments are rapidly phosphorylated by PKGIα at Ser-667 and Ser-694, whereas fragments lacking the LZ domain are poor PKGIα substrates. Mutation of Ser-667 and Ser-694 to Ala and/or Asp showed that Ser-667 phosphorylation is more rapid than Ser-694 phosphorylation, suggesting that Ser-667 may play an important role in the activation of MLC phosphatase. These results demonstrate that MYPT1 isoform expression is important for determining the heterogeneous response of vascular beds to NO and NO-based vasodilators, thereby playing a central role in the regulation of vascular tone in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2060590475,"Mutations in the GDAP1 gene are responsible of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth CMT4A, ARCMT2K, and CMT2K variants. GDAP1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that has been related to the fission pathway of the mitochondrial network dynamics. As mitochondrial dynamics is a conserved process, we reasoned that expressing GDAP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains defective for genes involved in mitochondrial fission or fusion could increase our knowledge of GDAP1 function. We discovered a consistent relation between Fis1p and the cell cycle because fis1Δ cells showed G(2)/M delay during cell cycle progression. The fis1Δ phenotype, which includes cell cycle delay, was fully rescued by GDAP1. By contrast, clinical missense mutations rescued the fis1Δ phenotype except for the cell cycle delay. In addition, both Fis1p and human GDAP1 interacted with β-tubulins Tub2p and TUBB, respectively. A defect in the fis1 gene may induce abnormal location of mitochondria during budding mitosis, causing the cell cycle delay at G(2)/M due to its anomalous interaction with microtubules from the mitotic spindle. In the case of neurons harboring defects in GDAP1, the interaction between mitochondria and the microtubule cytoskeleton would be altered, which might affect mitochondrial axonal transport and movement within the cell and may explain the pathophysiology of the GDAP1-related Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."
https://openalex.org/W2080505184,"Physical inactivity is considered as one of the potential risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, while endurance exercise training could enhance fat oxidation that is associated with insulin sensitivity improvement in obesity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as an energy sensor plays pivotal roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and its activation could improve glucose uptake, promote mitochondrial biogenesis and increase glycolysis. Recent research has even suggested that AMPK activation contributed to endurance enhancement without exercise. Here we report that the natural product arctigenin from the traditional herb Arctium lappa L. (Compositae) strongly increased AMPK phosphorylation and subsequently up-regulated its downstream pathway in both H9C2 and C2C12 cells. It was discovered that arctigenin phosphorylated AMPK via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) and serine/threonine kinase 11(LKB1)-dependent pathways. Mice treadmill based in vivo assay further indicated that administration of arctigenin improved efficiently mice endurance as reflected by the increased fatigue time and distance, and potently enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) related genes expression in muscle tissues. Our results thus suggested that arctigenin might be used as a potential lead compound for the discovery of the agents with mimic exercise training effects to treat metabolic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1971583533,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz) has multiple substrate proteins, including G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1 (Git1), membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain-containing 1 (Magi1), and GTPase-activating protein for Rho GTPase (p190RhoGAP). We have identified a dephosphorylation site at Tyr-1105 of p190RhoGAP; however, the structural determinants employed for substrate recognition of Ptprz have not been fully defined. In the present study, we revealed that Ptprz selectively dephosphorylates Git1 at Tyr-554, and Magi1 at Tyr-373 and Tyr-858 by in vitro and cell-based assays. Of note, the dephosphorylation of the Magi1 Tyr-858 site required PDZ domain-mediated interaction between Magi1 and Ptprz in the cellular context. Alignment of the primary sequences surrounding the target phosphotyrosine residue in these three substrates showed considerable similarity, suggesting a consensus motif for recognition by Ptprz. We then estimated the contribution of surrounding individual amino acid side chains to the catalytic efficiency by using fluorescent peptides based on the Git1 Tyr-554 sequence in vitro. The typical substrate motif for the catalytic domain of Ptprz was deduced to be Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Xaa-Ile/Val-Tyr(P)-Xaa (Xaa is not an acidic residue). Intriguingly, a G854D substitution of the Magi1 Tyr-858 site matching better to the motif sequence turned this site to be susceptible to dephosphorylation by Ptprz independent of the PDZ domain-mediated interaction in cells. Furthermore, we found by database screening that the substrate motif is present in several proteins, including paxillin at Tyr-118, its major phosphorylation site. Expectedly, we verified that Ptprz efficiently dephosphorylates paxillin at this site in cells. Our study thus provides key insights into the molecular basis for the substrate recognition of Ptprz."

Here we investigated activation-induced trafficking of Gαs and XLαs, using immunofluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. In transfected cells, XLαs remained localized to the plasma membrane, whereas Gαs redistributed to the cytosol after activation by GTPase-inhibiting mutations, cholera toxin treatment, or G protein-coupled receptor agonists (isoproterenol or parathyroid hormone (PTH)(1-34)). Cholera toxin treatment or agonist (isoproterenol or pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-27) stimulation of PC12 cells expressing Gαs and XLαs endogenously led to an increased abundance of Gαs, but not XLαs, in the soluble fraction. Mutational analyses revealed two conserved cysteines and the highly charged domain as being critically involved in the plasma membrane anchoring of XLαs. The cAMP response induced by M-PTH(1-14), a parathyroid hormone analog, terminated quickly in HEK293 cells stably expressing the type 1 PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor, whereas the response remained maximal for at least 6 min in cells that co-expressed the PTH receptor and XLαs. Although isoproterenol-induced cAMP response was not prolonged by XLαs expression, a GTPase-deficient XLαs mutant found in certain tumors and patients with fibrous dysplasia of bone and McCune-Albright syndrome generated more basal cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells and caused more severe impairment of osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells than the cognate Gαs mutant (gsp oncogene). Thus, activated XLαs and Gαs traffic differently, and this may form the basis for the differences in their cellular actions."

If mosquitoes learn about specific host attributes associated with pathogen infection, it may help to explain the heterogeneity of biting and disease patterns observed in the field. Sugar-feeding is a requirement for survival in both male and female mosquitoes. It provides a starting point for learning research in mosquitoes that avoids the confounding factors associated with the observer being a potential blood-host and has the capability to address certain areas of close-range mosquito learning behavior that have not previously been described. This study was designed to investigate the ability of the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say to associate odor with a sugar-meal with emphasis on important experimental considerations of mosquito age (1.2 d old and 3–5 d old), sex (male and female), source (laboratory and wild), and the time between conditioning and testing (<5 min, 1 hr, 2.5 hr, 5 hr, 10 hr, and 24 hr). Mosquitoes were individually conditioned to an odor across these different experimental conditions. Details of the conditioning protocol are presented as well as the use of binary logistic regression to analyze the complex dataset generated from this experimental design. The results suggest that each of the experimental factors may be important in different ways. Both the source of the mosquitoes and sex of the mosquitoes had significant effects on conditioned responses. The largest effect on conditioning was observed in the lack of positive response following conditioning for females aged 3–5 d derived from a long established colony. Overall, this study provides a method for conditioning experiments involving individual mosquitoes at close range and provides for future discussion of the relevance and broader questions that can be asked of olfactory conditioning in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W1977306904,"Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) is a muscle-enriched transcription factor required to activate vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) expression in muscle. IRF2BP2 is found in the nucleus of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. During the process of skeletal muscle differentiation, some IRF2BP2 becomes relocated to the cytoplasm, although the functional significance of this relocation and the mechanisms that control nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 are not yet known.Here, by fusing IRF2BP2 to green fluorescent protein and testing a series of deletion and site-directed mutagenesis constructs, we mapped the nuclear localization signal (NLS) to an evolutionarily conserved sequence (354)ARKRKPSP(361) in IRF2BP2. This sequence corresponds to a classical nuclear localization motif bearing positively charged arginine and lysine residues. Substitution of arginine and lysine with negatively charged aspartic acid residues blocked nuclear localization. However, these residues were not sufficient because nuclear targeting of IRF2BP2 also required phosphorylation of serine 360 (S360). Many large-scale phosphopeptide proteomic studies had reported previously that serine 360 of IRF2BP2 is phosphorylated in numerous human cell types. Alanine substitution at this site abolished IRF2BP2 nuclear localization in C(2)C(12) myoblasts and CV1 cells. In contrast, substituting serine 360 with aspartic acid forced nuclear retention and prevented cytoplasmic redistribution in differentiated C(2)C(12) muscle cells. As for the effects of these mutations on VEGFA promoter activity, the S360A mutation interfered with VEGFA activation, as expected. Surprisingly, the S360D mutation also interfered with VEGFA activation, suggesting that this mutation, while enforcing nuclear entry, may disrupt an essential activation function of IRF2BP2.Nuclear localization of IRF2BP2 depends on phosphorylation near a conserved NLS. Changes in phosphorylation status likely control nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 during muscle differentiation."

For the stable transfectant, cells were transfected with the HA-RCAN1 plasmid by the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen) and selected in G418-containing growth medium. Cells were transfected with the expression vectors by the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoblot analysis, total cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 3% nonfat dried milk) for 30 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST buffer containing the appropriate antibodies.

PC12 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors by the LipofectAmine2000 method (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and was normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase-expressing vector (pCMV5.LacZ) and the Galacto-Star system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA preparation, reverse transcription, and PCR were performed as described previously (24Lee E.J. Lee J.Y. Seo S.R. Chung K.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The primers were as follows: β-actin, 5′-CATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCTAG-3′ (reverse); c-fos, 5′-TGGGTGAAACCCTACGCTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCTTTCCCTTCGGATTCT-3′ (reverse).

Statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. Differences between two means with p < 0.05 were considered as significant. To investigate whether RCAN1 affected the cAMP-activated CREB phosphorylation in neuronal PC12 cells, we ectopically expressed HA-tagged RCAN1 in neuronal PC12 cells and treated the cells with forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator (Fig. 1A). We observed that RCAN1 increased the forskolin-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Ser-133) (Fig. 1A). This increased phosphorylation of CREB was caused by the augmentation of intracellular cAMP levels because the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8CPT-cAMP increased the phosphorylation of CREB to the same extent as forskolin (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the ability of RCAN1 to increase the phosphorylation of CREB was specifically targeted to the Ser-133 residue on CREB, we expressed a mutant CREB in which the Ser-133 residue of CREB was replaced by Ala (S133A). As shown in Fig. 1C, we did not detect any significant increase in the phosphorylation of the mutant CREB (S133A) by RCAN1, indicating that the increased phosphorylation of CREB by RCAN1 was specifically targeted at the Ser-133 residue of CREB. Because cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA and releases the active catalytic subunit from PKA, we examined whether the ability of RCAN1 to increase cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB may also occur in PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. As shown in Fig. 1D, coexpression of RCAN1 with the catalytic subunit of PKA caused the enhanced phosphorylation of the Ser-133 residue of CREB. To further demonstrate that the ability of RCAN1 to increase cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB occurs through PKA-dependent intracellular signaling mechanism, PC12 cells were preincubated with H-89, a pharmacological inhibitor of PKA (Fig. 1E). Consistently, inhibition of PKA with H-89 prevented the RCAN1-enhanced phosphorylation of CREB by forskolin. To investigate the physiological relevance of RCAN1 on cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, PC12 cells were transfected with pRS-RCAN1 shRNA expression vectors to knock down the endogenous RCAN1. A Western blot analysis showed that the expression of endogenous RCAN1 was significantly decreased by the transfection of pRS-RCAN1 expression vectors (Fig. 1F). The knockdown of endogenous RCAN1 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of CREB in response to the forskolin, indicating that RCAN1 acts as a positive regulator of CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results indicate that RCAN1 enhances the cAMP and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. Phosphorylation of CREB has been shown in many cellular systems to activate the CRE-driven gene transcription (6Sands W.A. Palmer T.M. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To determine whether RCAN1 exerted an enhanced effect on CRE-driven gene transcription, PC12 cells were transfected with the CRE-reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression of RCAN1 resulted in increased CRE gene transcription induced by forskolin in a dose-dependent manner. The enhanced CRE-driven gene transcription by RCAN1 was abrogated by the expression of the inactive CREB mutant (S133A), indicating that the ability of RCAN1 to enhance CRE-driven gene expression was mediated by CREB activation (Fig. 2B). Because the activation of PKA is involved in the phosphorylation of CREB and subsequent CRE-driven gene expression, we assessed the ability of RCAN1 to enhance the PKA-dependent CRE-reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 2C, coexpression of RCAN1 with the catalytic subunit of PKA enhanced the PKA-dependent CRE-luciferase activity. Furthermore, this increased CRE-driven gene transcription was suppressed by either inactive CREB (S133A) or dominant negative A-CREB, which selectively inhibits the DNA-binding activity of wild-type CREB (25Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These results verify that the ability of RCAN1 to increase CRE-driven gene transcription is mediated by CREB transcriptional activation. Collectively, these results indicate that RCAN1 enhanced cAMP- and PKA-dependent CRE-driven gene transcription through CREB activation. To further examine the role of RCAN1 in the regulation of CREB activity, we established a RCAN1 stable clone that had a mild increase in expression (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the phosphorylation of CREB in response to forskolin was significantly increased in the stable RCAN1-overexpressing cells, which was similar to the levels from the transient transfection. Furthermore, the increased basal level of CREB phosphorylation was observed in stable RCAN1-overexpressing cells compared with control cells, thus increasing the physiological relevance of these findings. PACAP38 is an important neuropeptide that was initially isolated from ovine hypothalamus extracts on the basis of its potent ability to activate adenylate cyclase in rat anterior pituitary cells (26Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 27Ravni A. Bourgault S. Lebon A. Chan P. Galas L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Gonzalez B. Eiden L.E. Vaudry D. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because PACAP38 is one of the external ligands that increase in the concentration of intracellular cAMP, we determined if the phosphorylation of CREB by PACAP38 was enhanced in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1. As shown in Fig. 3C, the PACAP38-stimulated CREB phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1 when compared with control cells, indicating that RCAN1 regulates the activation of CREB by extracellular neurotrophin. These results support the notion that the expression of RCAN1 enhances the phosphorylation of CREB. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin has been reported to exert either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the regulation of CREB activity in several experimental conditions (28Kingsbury T.J. Bambrick L.L. Roby C.D. Krueger B.K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because RCAN1 was identified as an inhibitor of calcineurin, we investigated the involvement of calcineurin in the RCAN1-mediated CREB activation pathway. To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying the enhancement of CREB phosphorylation by RCAN1, we first examined if the inhibition of calcineurin contributed to the phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4A, a significant accumulation of CREB phosphorylation was observed by the presence of well known calcineurin inhibitors, such as FK506 and cyclosporin A, implying that calcineurin may serve as a negative modulator for CREB activation. To determine whether RCAN1 altered calcineurin signaling in our experimental conditions, PC12 cells were transfected with a calcineurin-responsive reporter construct from the IL-2 gene (31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 32Lee M. Park J. Mol. Cells. 2006; 22: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous report (13Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), expression of the catalytically active subunit of calcineurin (CnA) stimulated IL-2 gene transcription (Fig. 4B). Coexpression of RCAN1 with CnA resulted in a significant decrease of calcineurin-dependent IL-2 gene transcription, indicating that RCAN1 inhibited calcineurin activity (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the ability of RCAN1 to activate CREB was due to the inhibition of calcineurin activity, we examined if the expression of CnA reversed CREB activation in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1 (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4C, the phosphorylation of CREB in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1 in the presence or absence of forskolin was significantly suppressed by the expression of CnA, suggesting that the inhibition of calcineurin by RCAN1 may contribute to the increased phosphorylation of CREB. To provide further evidence that the ability of RCAN1 to enhance CREB activation depended on the calcineurin inhibition, we analyzed forskolin-induced CRE-reporter activity (Fig. 4D). The coexpression of CnA with RCAN1 resulted in the suppression of RCAN1, which enhanced CRE-luciferase activity in response to forskolin (Fig. 4D). To further assess that the ability of RCAN1 to enhance CREB activation depended on the calcineurin, we utilized siRNAs targeting to the calcineurin. Efficient knockdown of endogenous calcineurin was observed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4E). As shown in Fig. 4E, RCAN1 could not enhance the phosphorylation of CREB by forskolin in calcineurin knockdown cells, suggesting that calcineurin was required for the enhancement of CREB activity by RCAN1 (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these results suggest that the inhibition of calcineurin signaling by RCAN1 enhances CREB activation and CRE-mediated gene transcription. We next investigated if the ability of RCAN1 to increase CREB activity contributed to the endogenous CRE-target gene expression. We examined the transcription of c-fos, which is known to have a CRE promoter site and is induced by forskolin (25Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression of c-fos mRNA was induced by forskolin. Furthermore, the induction of c-fos mRNA by forskolin was significantly enhanced in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1, suggesting that RCAN1 induced the endogenous CRE-target gene expression in response to forskolin (Fig. 5A). To verify if the enhanced expression of c-fos mRNA by RCAN1 was correlated with a physical binding of CREB to the c-fos promoter in vivo, we performed a ChIP assay. The immunoprecipitated chromatins with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies were amplified by PCR using c-fos promoter-specific primers covering the CRE site from −58 bp to −51 bp. As shown in Fig. 5B, the extent of CRE bound with phospho-CREB was significantly enhanced in cells stably overexpressing RCAN1 compared with that of control cells. Furthermore, the binding of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a coactivator protein that is known to be recruited upon binding of CREB on CRE element, was also increased in RCAN1-overexpressing cells. These results suggest that RCAN1 enhances CREB binding on the c-fos promoter in vivo. To determine whether the ability of RCAN1 to enhance expression of c-fos mRNA in response to forskolin was related to the inhibition of calcineurin activity, we examined if the coexpression of CnA with RCAN1 reversed the increased c-fos expression by RCAN1. As shown in Fig. 5C, the coexpression of CnA with RCAN1 suppressed the RCAN1-mediated increased expression of c-fos mRNA, suggesting that the increased expression of c-fos mRNA depended on the inhibition of calcineurin activation by RCAN1. Taken together, these results suggest that RCAN1 induces the expression of the endogenous CRE-containing c-fos gene through calcineurin-inhibitory mechanism (Fig. 6). In this study, we have reported the first evidence that RCAN1 expression increase the phosphorylation of CREB in response to the cAMP-dependent intracellular pathway. We have also suggested that the ability of RCAN1 to increase the phosphorylation of CREB may result from an inhibition of a calcineurin-dependent intracellular signaling mechanism. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcineurin may control the phosphorylation state of CREB (Bito et al. (29Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), Hagiwara et al. (33Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, and King et al. (34King M.M. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Chan K.F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8080-8083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). For example, in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, the inactivation of calcineurin results in CREB phosphorylation for extended durations and robust CRE-dependent transcription following stronger stimulations (29Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated CREB is quickly dephosphorylated by a calcineurin-mediated disinhibition of PP1 following mild synaptic stimulation (18Groth R.D. Dunbar R.L. Mermelstein P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 34King M.M. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Chan K.F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8080-8083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, we observed that inhibition of calcineurin with well known calcineurin inhibitors, such as FK506 and CsA, exhibited a significant accumulation of CREB phosphorylation. It was unclear whether the effect of RCAN1 in the activation of CREB was direct, indirect, or a combination of the two. However, it is likely that the effects of RCAN1 are mediated by the inhibition of calcineurin because transfection studies have demonstrated that the expression of CnA suppress RCAN1-induced CREB and CRE target gene activation. Consistently, expression of CnA abrogated the ability of RCAN1 to trigger the induction of endogenous c-fos mRNA expression, which contains a CRE promoter. The increased basal level of CREB phosphorylation in the cells stably overexpressing RCAN1 increased the physiological relevance of this study in DS pathogenesis. Consistent with our observation, disturbance of CREB activity in overexpression mutants of Nebula, the Drosophila homolog of human RCAN1, have been reported (35Chang K.T. Shi Y.J. Min K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15794-15799Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated levels of phosphorylated CREB have been reported in fetal DS brains (36Yuan Q. Harley C.W. Darby-King A. Neve R.L. McLean J.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4760-4765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of our observations, we speculate that induction of a prolonged activation of CREB by RCAN1 in DS pathogenesis may influence the abnormal regulation of a wide range of CREB-dependent target gene expressions, which is implicated in the development of the nervous system, in the process of learning and memory, and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. There is a growing interest in the ability of RCAN1 to contribute to the phenotypes related with DS and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis through its association with calcineurin. Decreased calcineurin activity by overexpression of RCAN1 has been proposed to result in increased hyperphosphorylation of tau, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (14Harris C.D. Ermak G. Davies K.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Hoeffer C.A. Dey A. Sachan N. Wong H. Patterson R.J. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Klann E. Rothermel B.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13161-13172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because calcineurin activity regulates the rate of inactivation of critical effector such as CREB, it seems likely that overexpression of RCAN1, as observed in DS and AD, may enhance CREB signaling by blocking calcineurin activity. The RCAN1 gene is located on the DSCR of human chromosome 21. It has been speculated that a number of genes in the DSCR locus contribute to the characteristics of DS individuals. Recently, overexpression of the dual-specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene, which maps to the region of the DSCR, has been shown to lead to the neurodevelopmental delay and cognitive defects (38Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C. Martí E. Visa J. Guimerà J. Oset M. González J.R. Flórez J. Fillat C. Estivill X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 39Branchi I. Bichler Z. Minghetti L. Delabar J.M. Malchiodi-Albedi F. Gonzalez M.C. Chettouh Z. Nicolini A. Chabert C. Smith D.J. Rubin E.M. Migliore-Samour D. Alleva E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been reported that DYRK1A is involved in the neuronal differentiation through the phosphorylation of CREB (40Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that RCAN1 might cooperate with other genes on the DSCR in generating pathogenic features associated with DS. Our studies suggest that RCAN1 is an important component of the CREB regulatory circuit and acts by placing a constraint on calcineurin activity. Consistent with this notion, the RCAN1 knockout mice exhibited significant defects in spatial learning and memory, reduced associative cued memory, and impaired late-phase long-term potentiation (l-LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity dependent on PKA (37Hoeffer C.A. Dey A. Sachan N. Wong H. Patterson R.J. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Klann E. Rothermel B.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13161-13172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This report suggests that RCAN1 provides a restriction on calcineurin activity during memory formation. These defects were similarly observed in mice with inducible overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin (41Mansuy I.M. Mayford M. Jacob B. Kandel E.R. Bach M.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 42Mansuy I.M. Winder D.G. Moallem T.M. Osman M. Mayford M. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, perturbation of CREB regulatory circuit by an increased dosage of RCAN1 may be sufficient to disrupt optimal neuronal function. To enhance our findings that RCAN1 regulates CREB function in DS pathogenesis, identification of direct endogenous CREB target genes may have important insight into the causes and treatments of DS pathogenesis. This work was carried out in the facilities of the Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology at Kangwon National University."
https://openalex.org/W2083417217,"Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium is one of the most important bacterial zoonotic diseases. The bacterium persists in pigs resulting in asymptomatic 'carrier pigs', generating a major source for Salmonella contamination of pork. Until now, very little is known concerning the mechanisms used by Salmonella Typhimurium during persistence in pigs. Using in vivo expression technology (IVET), a promoter-trap method based on ΔpurA attenuation of the parent strain, we identified 37 Salmonella Typhimurium genes that were expressed 3 weeks post oral inoculation in the tonsils, ileum and ileocaecal lymph nodes of pigs. Several genes were expressed in all three analyzed organs, while other genes were only expressed in one or two organs. Subsequently, the identified IVET transformants were pooled and reintroduced in pigs to detect tissue-specific gene expression patterns. We found that efp and rpoZ were specifically expressed in the ileocaecal lymph nodes during Salmonella peristence in pigs. Furthermore, we compared the persistence ability of substitution mutants for the IVET-identified genes sifB and STM4067 to that of the wild type in a mixed infection model. The ΔSTM4067::kanR was significantly attenuated in the ileum contents, caecum and caecum contents and faeces of pigs 3 weeks post inoculation, while deletion of the SPI-2 effector gene sifB did not affect Salmonella Typhimurium persistence. Although our list of identified genes is not exhaustive, we found that efp and rpoZ were specifically expressed in the ileocaecal lymph nodes of pigs and we identified STM4067 as a factor involved in Salmonella persistence in pigs. To our knowledge, our study is the first to identify Salmonella Typhimurium genes expressed during persistence in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W1976553601,"In vitro generation of functional neurons from embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem cells offers exciting opportunities for dissecting gene function, disease modelling, and therapeutic drug screening. To realize the potential of stem cells in these biomedical applications, a complete understanding of the cell models of interest is required. While rapid advances have been made in developing the technologies for directed induction of defined neuronal subtypes, most published works focus on the molecular characterization of the derived neural cultures. To characterize the functional properties of these neural cultures, we utilized an ES cell model that gave rise to neurons expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and conducted targeted whole-cell electrophysiological recordings from ES cell-derived neurons. Current-clamp recordings revealed that most neurons could fire single overshooting action potentials; in some cases multiple action potentials could be evoked by depolarization, or occurred spontaneously. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that neurons exhibited neuronal-like currents, including an outward current typical of a delayed rectifier potassium conductance and a fast-activating, fast-inactivating inward current, typical of a sodium conductance. Taken together, these results indicate that ES cell-derived GFP(+) neurons in culture display functional neuronal properties even at early stages of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1994315665,"Bacteria can coordinate several multicellular behaviors in response to environmental changes. Among these, swarming and biofilm formation have attracted significant attention for their correlation with bacterial pathogenicity. However, little is known about when and where the signaling occurs to trigger either swarming or biofilm formation. We have previously identified an RssAB two-component system involved in the regulation of swarming motility and biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. Here we monitored the RssAB signaling status within single cells by tracing the location of the translational fusion protein EGFP-RssB following development of swarming or biofilm formation. RssAB signaling is specifically activated before surface migration in swarming development and during the early stage of biofilm formation. The activation results in the release of RssB from its cognate inner membrane sensor kinase, RssA, to the cytoplasm where the downstream gene promoters are located. Such dynamic localization of RssB requires phosphorylation of this regulator. By revealing the temporal activation of RssAB signaling following development of surface multicellular behavior, our findings contribute to an improved understanding of how bacteria coordinate their lifestyle on a surface."
