https://openalex.org/W1966969776,"Starting with multipotent progenitors, hematopoietic lineages are specified by lineage-restricted transcription factors. The transcription factors that determine the decision between lymphoid and myeloid cell fates, and the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unknown. Here, we report that enforced expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in differentiated B cells leads to their rapid and efficient reprogramming into macrophages. C/EBPs induce these changes by inhibiting the B cell commitment transcription factor Pax5, leading to the downregulation of its target CD19, and synergizing with endogenous PU.1, an ETS family factor, leading to the upregulation of its target Mac-1 and other myeloid markers. The two processes can be uncoupled, since, in PU.1-deficient pre-B cells, C/EBPs induce CD19 downregulation but not Mac-1 activation. Our observations indicate that C/EBPalpha and beta remodel the transcription network of B cells into that of macrophages through a series of parallel and sequential changes that require endogenous PU.1."
https://openalex.org/W2062901635,"Although a great deal is known biochemically about peroxiredoxins (Prxs), little is known about their real physiological function. We show here that two cytosolic yeast Prxs, cPrxI and II, which display diversity in structure and apparent molecular weights (MW), can act alternatively as peroxidases and molecular chaperones. The peroxidase function predominates in the lower MW forms, whereas the chaperone function predominates in the higher MW complexes. Oxidative stress and heat shock exposure of yeasts causes the protein structures of cPrxI and II to shift from low MW species to high MW complexes. This triggers a peroxidase-to-chaperone functional switch. These in vivo changes are primarily guided by the active peroxidase site residue, Cys47, which serves as an efficient “H2O2-sensor” in the cells. The chaperone function of these proteins enhances yeast resistance to heat shock."

https://openalex.org/W2029026643,"Peptide bond formation and peptide release are catalyzed in the active site of the large subunit of the ribosome where universally conserved nucleotides surround the CCA ends of the peptidyl- and aminoacyl-tRNA substrates. Here, we describe the use of an affinity-tagging system for the purification of mutant ribosomes and analysis of four universally conserved nucleotides in the innermost layer of the active site: A2451, U2506, U2585, and A2602. While pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the peptidyl transferase activity of the mutant ribosomes reveals substantially reduced rates of peptide bond formation using the minimal substrate puromycin, their rates of peptide bond formation are unaffected when the substrates are intact aminoacyl-tRNAs. These mutant ribosomes do, however, display substantial defects in peptide release. These results reveal a view of the catalytic center in which an inner shell of conserved nucleotides is pivotal for peptide release, while an outer shell is responsible for promoting peptide bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W1988183869,"The adaptive immune system functions through the combined action of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. Specifically, class I major histocompatibility complex antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells is limited to proteosome-generated peptides from intracellular pathogens while the class II (MHCII) endocytic pathway presents only proteolytic peptides from extracellular pathogens to CD4+ T cells. Carbohydrates have been thought to stimulate immune responses independently of T cells; however, zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) from the capsules of some bacteria can activate CD4+ T cells. Here we show that ZPSs are processed to low molecular weight carbohydrates by a nitric oxide-mediated mechanism and presented to T cells through the MHCII endocytic pathway. Furthermore, these carbohydrates bind to MHCII inside APCs for presentation to T cells. Our observations begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which some carbohydrates induce important immunologic responses through T cell activation, suggesting a fundamental shift in the MHCII presentation paradigm."

https://openalex.org/W2077575227,"Focal adhesions are specialized attachment and signaling centers that form at sites of cell-matrix contacts. We employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based method called SILAC to identify and quantify proteins interacting in an attachment-dependent manner with focal adhesion proteins. Subsequent confocal microscopy revealed a previously undescribed structure, which we have termed a spreading initiation center (SIC), existing only in early stages of cell spreading. SICs contain focal adhesion markers, appear to be surrounded by an actin sheath, and, surprisingly, contain numerous RNA binding proteins, ribosomal RNA, and perhaps other RNAs. Interfering with the function of FUS/TLS, hnRNP K, and hnRNP E1 results in increased spreading. Spreading initiation centers are ribonucleoprotein complexes distinct from focal adhesions and demonstrate a role for RNA and RNA binding proteins in the initiation of cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2056761299,"Fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 is a long chain fatty acid transporter present at the plasma membrane, as well as in intracellular pools of skeletal muscle. In this study, we assessed the unexpected presence of FAT/CD36 in both subsarcolemmal and intermyofibril fractions of highly purified mitochondria. Functional assessments demonstrated that the mitochondria could bind 14C-labeled palmitate, but could only oxidize it in the presence of carnitine. However, the addition of sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, a known inhibitor of FAT/CD36, resulted in an 87 and 85% reduction of palmitate oxidation in subsarcolemmal and intermyofibril fractions, respectively. Further studies revealed that maximal carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI) activity in vitro was inhibited by succinimidyl oleate (42 and 48% reduction). Interestingly, CPTI immunoprecipitated with FAT/CD36, indicating a physical pairing. Tissue differences in mitochondrial FAT/CD36 protein follow the same pattern as the capacity for fatty acid oxidation (heart » red muscle > white muscle). Additionally, chronic stimulation of hindlimb muscles (7 days) increased FAT/CD36 expression and also resulted in a concomitant increase in mitochondrial FAT/CD36 content (46 and 47% increase). Interestingly, with acute electrical stimulation of hindlimb muscles (30 min), FAT/CD36 expression was not altered, but there was an increase in the mitochondrial content of FAT/CD36 compared with the non-stimulated control limb (35 and 37% increase). Together, these data suggest a role for FAT/CD36 in mitochondrial long chain fatty acid uptake and demonstrate system flexibility to match FAT/CD36 mitochondrial content with an increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation, possibly involving translocation of FAT/CD36 to the mitochondria.

Circulating long chain fatty acids (LCFA) 1The abbreviations used are: LCFA, long chain fatty acids; CPT, carnitine-palmitoyl transferase; FAT, fatty acid translocase; SSO, sulfo-N-succimidyl oleate; SSP, sulfo-N-succimidyl palmitate; SS, subsarcolemmal; IMF, intermyofibrillar. are an important source of energy for tissues such as skeletal muscle and the heart. After entering the myocyte, LCFAs are esterified or are transported into the mitochondria for oxidation and subsequent energy production. Traditionally, only the carnitine-palmitoyl transferase (CPT) system is thought to be involved in the movement of LCFAs across the mitochondrial membranes, as CPTI catalyzes the trans-esterification of fatty acyl CoA to acylcarnitine. The acylcarnitine can then be translocated to the inner mitochondrial membrane by carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase, and finally acylcarnitine is regenerated to acyl CoA by the latent CPTII in the mitochondrial matrix (1Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, recent studies (2Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E541-E544PubMed Google Scholar, 3Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Wong D. Hollidge-Horvat M.G. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R894-R902PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dean D. Daugaard J.R. Young M.E. Saha A. Vavvas D. Asp S. Kiens B. Kim K.H. Witters L. Richter E.A. Ruderman N. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the regulation of CPTI cannot fully explain changes in mitochondrial fatty acid uptake, particularly when the muscle energy demand is increased. Malonyl CoA, thought to be the principal regulator of CPTI (5Sidossis L.S. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E733-E738PubMed Google Scholar, 6Coyle E.F. Jeukendrup A.E. Wagenmakers A.J. Saris W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E268-E275PubMed Google Scholar), is not responsible for increases in fatty acid oxidation during low to moderate aerobic exercise (2Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E541-E544PubMed Google Scholar, 3Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Wong D. Hollidge-Horvat M.G. Spriet L.L. Am. J.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or decreases in fatty acid oxidation during higher intensity exercise (3Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Wong D. Hollidge-Horvat M.G. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R894-R902PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, other potential regulators have been demonstrated to have a minimal effect upon CPTI activity as well (7Starritt E.C. Howlett R.A. Heigenhauser G.J. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E462-E468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bezaire V. Heigenhauser G.J. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E85-E91Google Scholar). Hence, other fatty acid-binding proteins may be involved in facilitating the movement of LCFAs into the mitochondria. Fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 has been implicated in multiple biological processes and is known to bind a remarkably diverse collection of ligands, including thrombospondin-1, retinal photoreceptor outer segments, anionic phospholipids, apoptotic cells, and LCFAs (9Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Additionally, FAT/CD36 exists in an intracellular pool in both skeletal and cardiac muscle and is translocated to the plasma membrane to assist with LCFA uptake (10Luiken J.J. Schaap F.G. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. van der Vusse G.J. Bonen A. Glatz J.F. Lipids. 1999; 34: S169-S175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus FAT/CD36 could possibly play a role in long chain fatty acid transport in mitochondria, but it is not known if FAT/CD36 is present at the mitochondrial membrane. However, protein expression of FAT/CD36 correlates with oxidative potential of muscle tissue, being highly expressed in heart and muscles rich in oxidative fibers, whereas lower expression occurs in muscles that are predominantly glycolytic (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. Van Der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A powerful tool in the functional assessment of FAT/CD36 has been sulfo-N-succinimidyl esters of long chain fatty acids. Sulfo-N-succimidyl oleate (SSO) and sulfo-N-succimidyl oleate palmitate (SSP) specifically bind to the 88-kDa protein FAT/CD36 and arrest the LCFA transport into adipocytes (13Harmon C.M. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), heart (14Luiken J.J. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and skeletal muscle (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Luiken J.J. Dyck D.J. Han X.X. Tandon N.N. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E491-E495Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Coort S.L. Willems J. Coumans W.A. van der Vusse G.J. Bonen A. Glatz J.F. Luiken J.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Neither SSO nor SSP affects cellular handling of LCFAs, with the relative contribution of oxidation and esterification remaining constant, whereas glucose and octanoate uptake are also unaffected (14Luiken J.J. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tanaka T. Kawamura K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence, SSO and SSP are excellent substrates with which to examine the functional role of FAT/CD36 in lipid metabolism. Previous studies examining FAT/CD36 have demonstrated that, similar to GLUT4, there is an intracellular/endosomal pool of FAT/CD36 that can be mobilized to the plasma membrane upon stimulation by muscle contraction (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) or insulin (15Luiken J.J. Dyck D.J. Han X.X. Tandon N.N. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E491-E495Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It appeared that the quantity of FAT/CD36 translocated to the plasma membrane scaled with energetic demands during muscle contraction (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated the important role that FAT/CD36 plays in lipid transport at the plasma membrane, although the full extent of its cellular contribution remains unknown. Nevertheless, given the multifunctionality of this protein, its demonstrated intracellular presence, and its known involvement in LCFA transport in skeletal muscle, it is conceivable that FAT/CD36 may be involved in the transfer of LCFAs into the mitochondria. Translocation of proteins to the mitochondria has recently been documented. Mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytosol often follow a general insertion mechanism that has been studied in detail (18Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Kunkele K.P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, translocase of outer membrane proteins recognizes the majority of precursor proteins destined for internalization into the mitochondria (18Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Kunkele K.P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which are translocated across the mitochondrial membranes through the general insertion pore. However, it has been demonstrated recently that the voltage-dependent anion-channel (also called porin) can be targeted directly to the outer membrane without being internalized (20Schleiff E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This alternate pathway could allow for a more rapid insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, protein translocation to and from the mitochondria during the process of apoptosis also demonstrates the membrane fluidity of both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (21Borutaite V. Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation of FAT/CD36 from other cellular locations to the mitochondria is perhaps feasible and could facilitate in up-regulating mitochondrial uptake of LCFAs in response to increased oxidative demand in muscle tissue. It is important to note that there are two distinct populations of mitochondria in skeletal muscle, the subsarcolemmal (SS) and the intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondria. A recent study demonstrated no differences in CPTI maximal activity or its regulation in SS and IMF mitochondria (8Bezaire V. Heigenhauser G.J. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E85-E91Google Scholar). However, in IMF mitochondria, relative to SS mitochondria, state III respiration is elevated, and IMF mitochondria are more sensitive to inhibition with rotenone (22Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C383-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, IMF mitochondria have a greater protein import (23Takahashi M. Hood D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27285-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and synthesis (24Connor M.K. Bezborodova O. Escobar C.P. Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and seem to respond earlier to endurance training (25Chilibeck P.D. Syrotuik D.G. Bell G.J. Int. J. Sports Med. 2002; 23: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SS mitochondria seem to have a higher density of both UCP3 (26Jimenez M. Yvon C. Lehr L. Leger B. Keller P. Russell A. Kuhne F. Flandin P. Giacobino J.P. Muzzin P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2878-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and cardiolipin (22Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C383-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the presence of FAT/CD36 in both the SS and IMF skeletal muscle mitochondria and investigated whether this protein has a functional role in LCFA uptake by these organelles. We hypothesized that the IMF mitochondria will have a higher expression of FAT/CD36 protein and a greater capacity for palmitate oxidation, compared with SS mitochondria. Female Sprague-Dawley rats 12–15 weeks old were used in these experiments. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (21 ± 2 °C) with a light/dark cycle of 12 h each. Water and standard rat chow were available ad libitum. All experimental interventions were formally approved by the Animal Care Committee, University of Guelph. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (6 mg/100 g of body weight) prior to all experimental procedures. To obtain an isolated mitochondrial fraction, differential centrifugation was used (22Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C383-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, minced muscles were diluted 10-fold in Buffer 1 (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized using a polytron at the precise low setting of 3 (Kinematica, Switzerland) for 2 × 15 s. The SS mitochondria were isolated from the myofibrils by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The SS mitochondria were pelleted from the supernatant at 9000 × g (10 min). The pellet was washed twice in Buffer 2 (Buffer 1 containing 1 mm ATP), spun at 9000 × g (for 10 min), and resuspended in a final volume of 100 μl. The myofibrillar pellet containing the IMF mitochondria was rehomogenized using the polytron and spun again at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was diluted 10-fold in Buffer 2 and treated with protease (P5380, 0.025 ml/g tissue, Sigma) for exactly 5 min. Addition of 15 ml of ice cold Buffer 2 arrested the protease, and the samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in a 10-fold dilution of Buffer 2 and spun at 800 × g (10 min). The supernatant was spun at 9000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed twice in Buffer 2, re-spun at 9000 × g, and resuspended in a final volume of 150 μl. These separations yield viable SS and IMF mitochondria that can be used for functional in vitro studies. For Western blotting, samples were purified further by using a Percoll gradient. Samples were spun at 20,000 × g for 2 h, and the mitochondrial layer was removed. The Percoll was removed from the sample by further spinning at 21,000 × g for 5 h. At this point, the mitochondria were no longer viable, but were useful for Western blotting. Viable mitochondria were pre-incubated in a 20-ml vial with a rubber cap containing 1.0 ml of modified Krebs buffer (MKB: 115 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 15 min (gassed with 5% CO2:95% O2 and constant shaking). For palmitate oxidation studies, the buffer was supplemented with 5.0 mm ATP, 1.0 mm NAD+, 0.5 mm dl-carnitine, 0.1 mm coenzyme A, 25 μm cytochrome c, and 0.5 mm malate. The radiolabel [14C]palmitate (0.5 μCi, 185 nm palmitate) was used in all experiments. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a 6:1 palmitate:BSA complex, proceeded at 37 °C for 60 min (unless otherwise noted), and was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 3 m perchloric acid administered by syringe through the rubber cap. For palmitate binding studies, mitochondria were washed 3× with MKB, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the radioactivity was determined. Palmitate oxidation was determined as described previously (27Veerkamp J.H. Van Moerkerk H.T. Glatz J.F. Van Hinsbergh V.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Glatz J.F. Jacobs A.E. Veerkamp J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), ensuring that both the CO2 and the acid-soluble products were measured. To ascertain whether FAT/CD36 in SS and IMF mitochondria was increased with perturbations known to increase the capacity for fatty acid oxidation, muscles were chronically (7 days) or acutely (30 min) stimulated electrically as described previously in work from our laboratory (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 29Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic Stimulation—In anesthetized rats, stainless steel electrodes were sutured to underlying muscles on either side of the peroneal nerve. These electrodes were passed subcutaneously from the thigh of the stimulated limb to the back of the neck, where they were attached to an external miniature electronic stimulator. The contralateral limb was sham-operated to act as a control. Animals were allowed 7 days to recover from surgery before stimulating pulses (12 Hz, 50-μs duration) were initiated. The peroneal nerve, which innervates the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles, was stimulated for 24 h/day for 7 days. Twenty-four hours after terminating stimulation, the contracting muscles and the contralateral resting muscle were removed for mitochondrial isolation. Acute Stimulation—While under anesthesia, a small incision was made in one hind limb, and stimulating electrodes were placed on the exposed sciatic nerve. The contralateral muscles in the same animal served as resting controls in all experiments. Muscle contraction consisted of stimulating the sciatic nerve in one hind limb (10 V, 100 Hz, 100-ms trains, 20 tetani/min for 30 min). Immediately after stimulation, the contracting muscles and the contralateral resting muscle were removed for mitochondrial isolation. CPT I (EC 2.3.1.21) activity measurements were carried out with the sensitive forward radioisotope assay, as described previously (30McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Starritt et al. (7Starritt E.C. Howlett R.A. Heigenhauser G.J. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E462-E468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this assay measures the amount of labeled palmitoyl-l-carnitine formed when both palmitoyl-CoA and radiolabeled [3H]l-carnitine were added to the medium surrounding the intact mitochondria. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of mitochondrial suspension and was stopped 6 min later by the addition of 60 μl of ice-cold 1 m HCl. Palmitoyl-[3H]carnitine formed during the reaction was extracted with 400 μl of water-saturated butanol in a process involving three washes with distilled water and subsequent centrifugations (1000 × g for 5 min) to separate the butanol phase. Radioactivity was measured in 100 μl of the butanol layer and 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture. All assays were performed in duplicate at 37 °C. Samples for immunoprecipitation were prepared using the Catch & Release immunoprecipitation system as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated samples and purified, isolated mitochondria fractions were analyzed for total protein (BCA protein assay), and 100 μg of denatured proteins from each sample were separated by electrophoresis on a SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The monoclonal antibody MO25 was used to detect FAT/CD36 (31Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricart M. Montgomery R.R. Aster R.H. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J.

Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Commercially available antibodies were used to detect cytochrome c oxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Na+/K+ATPase α1 (Upstate Biotechnology), and SERCA1 ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.). An internal control of previously extracted rat muscle was used in each gel to normalize for variation in signal observed across the membranes. Blots were quantitated using chemiluminescence and the ChemiGenius2 bio-imaging system (Syn-Gene, Cambridge, UK). All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using an analysis of variance, with a least squares Fisher test for post hoc comparison. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Western blotting performed on purified mitochondrial extract demonstrated the presence of FAT/CD36 (88 kDa) and the cytochrome c oxidase IV subunit (22 kDa) (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In contrast, the plasma membrane protein Na+K+ATPase α-1, the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein Ca2+-ATPase and the transferrin receptor, an endosomal marker, were not detectable (Fig. 1, C–E, respectively). These results indicate that the isolation procedure successfully yielded highly purified SS and IMF mitochondria without contamination from other sources. Examination of the presence of FAT/CD36 in the mitochondria of various muscle tissues demonstrated that the quantity of this protein corresponded to differences in the oxidative capacity of these three types of muscle tissues (Fig. 2). The SS and IMF FAT/CD36 in each tissue did not differ (p = 0.11), but FAT/CD36 protein was lower in red (52.5 and 50.7% lower, SS and IMF) and white (67.2 and 68.3% lower, SS and IMF) gastrocnemius when compared with the heart (p < 0.05). Additionally, FAT/CD36 protein was lower in white gastrocnemius (30.9 and 36.4% lower, SS and IMF) when compared with red gastrocnemius (p < 0.05). Fatty Acid Binding—In the absence of carnitine, the mitochondria are unable to transport the LCFAs into the matrix; hence, further metabolism can not occur. Therefore, by omitting carnitine from the incubating medium, we were able to determine whether the mitochondria could bind LCFAs and its sulfo-N-succinimidyl esters, SSO and SSP. The mitochondria were capable of binding both 14C-labeled palmitate and 14C-labeled SSP in a similar manner. The quantity of mitochondria present directly impacted upon the quantity of the substrate bound (Fig. 3). Under optimal conditions (data not shown), binding of [14C]palmitate remained stable between 15 and 60 min (Fig. 3C), while no CO2 was produced (Fig. 3C), indicating that the palmitate could be bound but not oxidized by the mitochondria. Palmitate binding was inhibited by the addition of SSO to the medium (Fig. 3D, 77.0 and 76.9% inhibition in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). Furthermore, binding of 14C-SSP to the mitochondria could be competitively inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled SSO (Fig. 3E, 96.7 and 96.9% inhibition in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05) in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously in studies of FAT/CD36 in the plasma membrane (11Bonen A.

Fatty Acid Oxidation—Mitochondria incubated with palmitate only oxidized the fatty acid in the presence of carnitine (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05), similarly to previous studies (27Veerkamp J.H. Van Moerkerk H.T. Glatz J.F. Van Hinsbergh V.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of SSO, a known inhibitor of FAT/CD36, palmitate oxidation was also dramatically reduced (Fig. 4B, 87.2 and 85.9% inhibition in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.001). Importantly, mitochondrial function was not affected by the addition of SSO to the medium, as pyruvate oxidation and octanoate oxidation were similar in control and SSO-treated mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively). However, maximal CPTI activity in vitro was inhibited by the presence of SSO (Fig. 4E, 42.1 and 47.5% inhibition in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). Mitochondrial extracts immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 1207 for FAT/CD36 revealed the presence of CPTI (Fig. 5), but not cytochrome c oxidase. To determine whether mitochondrial FAT/CD36 was altered when the capacity for fatty acid oxidation was increased, two different models were used: (i) chronic muscle stimulation designed to increase FAT/CD36 expression and capacity for fatty acid oxidation, and (ii) acute electrical stimulation to increase oxidation of fatty acids while the expression of FAT/CD36 remained unaltered. Chronic Stimulation—Chronic electrical stimulation for 7 days resulted in an up-regulation in the total amount of FAT/CD36 present in the total homogenate and in the plasma membrane fraction of skeletal muscle (data not shown), as has been demonstrated previously (29Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, an increase in the amount of FAT/CD36 protein in the mitochondrial fraction was also observed in the mitochondria obtained from chronically stimulated muscles when compared with the mitochondrial fraction of the contralateral control muscles (Fig. 6A, 46.2 and 46.9% increase in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). Concomitantly, mitochondrial palmitate oxidation was increased in the chronically stimulated muscles compared with the control muscles (Fig. 6B, 32.2 and 36.4% increase in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). Interestingly, in both limbs, SSO reduced fatty acid oxidation to the same rate (Fig. 6B, p < 0.05). Acute Stimulation—In accord with previous observations (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), acute electrical stimulation for 30 min did not increase the expression of FAT/CD36 (data not shown), but the amount of FAT/CD36 at the plasma membrane fraction was increased (data not shown), indicating that FAT/CD36 was translocated within the cell. Interestingly, the present data demonstrate that acute stimulation also increases the amount of FAT/CD36 protein in the mitochondrial fraction, compared with the mitochondrial fraction of the contralateral control muscles (Fig. 7A, 34.5 and 37.0% increase in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). This finding suggested that the FAT/CD36 protein was translocated to the mitochondria. Palmitate oxidation was increased in isolated mitochondria from acutely stimulated muscles, compared with control muscles (Fig. 7B, 32.2 and 34.5% increase in SS and IMF, respectively; p < 0.05). Additionally, SSO reduced both stimulated and control mitochondrial oxidation to a similar level (Fig. 7B, p < 0.05). In the present studies, we investigated the presence of FAT/CD36 and its functional significance in both the SS and IMF fractions of skeletal muscle mitochondria. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the parameters we investigated, there were no differences between the SS and IMF mitochondria. However, we have demonstrated for the first time a potential role for FAT/CD36 in mitochondrial uptake of long chain fatty acids. The results from this study revealed that palmitate binding and palmitate oxidation by the mitochondria can be significantly suppressed by SSO, a specific inhibitor of FAT/CD36. This inhibitor alters only the mitochondrial uptake and oxidation of LCFAs, as demonstrated by the normal octanoate and pyruvate oxidation in the presence of SSO. Interestingly, the quantity of FAT/CD36 protein present in the mitochondria followed similar trends to oxidative capacity of the tissue (ie: heart » red muscle > white muscle). Finally, we have demonstrated that in muscle tissues, when the rates of fatty acid oxidation were increased, there were concomitant increases in mitochondrial FAT/CD36, induced either by increased expression of FAT/CD36 (chronic stimulation model), or by the apparent translocation of FAT/CD36 to the mitochondrial membrane (acute stimulation model). These studies are the first to demonstrate that FAT/CD36 may play a role in LCFA transfer across the mitochondrial membrane, likely in conjunction with CPTI. Previous studies have demonstrated that although CPTI plays a pivotal role in the movement of LCFA into the mitochondria, its regulation cannot fully explain the increases seen in fatty acid oxidation during rapid increases in oxidative demand, such as those that occur during exercise (2Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Spriet L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E541-E544PubMed Google Scholar, 3Odland L.M. Heigenhauser G.J. Wong D. Hollidge-Horvat M.G. Spriet L.L. Am. J.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not completely surprising that another protein could be involved in regulating LCFA oxidation. Traditionally, the carnitine palmitoyl transferase system was thought to be the only access point for LCFA entrance into the mitochondria. Our studies support this hypothesis, as the removal of carnitine from the reagent mixture prevents palmitate oxidation. However, our studies also demonstrate that FAT/CD36 is actively involved in LCFA transport into the mitochondria. Previous studies using SSO have demonstrated its specificity for FAT/CD36 (14Luiken J.J. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tanaka T. Kawamura K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, this reactive ester was used in characterizing and identifying the FAT/CD36 protein (13Harmon C.M. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although addition of SSO to the reagent mixture dramatically inhibits palmitate oxidation, it has no effect upon either pyruvate oxidation or octanoate oxidation. This is an important observation, as neither pyruvate nor octanoate require fatty acid transporters to facilitate their entry into the mitochondria. Hence, normal pyruvate and octanoate oxidation in the presence of SSO indicate that mitochondrial function has remained intact. Unexpectedly, the treatment of intact mitochondria with SSO did result in a 42% inhibition of the maximal activity of CPTI in vitro. The manifestation of this effect upon palmitate oxidation is difficult to interpret, as it is unlikely that CPTI is acting at full capacity under normal physiological conditions. Interestingly, using isolated mitochondria from rat heart, CPTI seemed not to be rate-limiting, as CPTI activity could be blocked by ∼50% without affecting β-oxidation (33Eaton S. Bartlett K. Quant P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the 42–47% inhibition of CPTI in the presence of SSO would still allow for maximal β-oxidation. Therefore, the 86–87% reduction of β-oxidation in the presence of SSO would be due to FAT/CD36. However, it is important to remember that cardiac tissue contains a mixture of the muscle and the liver isoforms of CPTI; therefore, isolated mitochondria from skeletal muscle may not respond identically. Regardless, it is important to consider these results when establishing the role of FAT/CD36 in LCFA transfer into the mitochondria. It is possible that the actions of FAT/CD36 and CPTI are synchronized, such that the inhibition of FAT/CD36 by SSO has a deleterious effect upon the maximal capacity of CPTI. Indeed, by using immunoprecipitation, we have demonstrated a physical link between FAT/CD36 and CPTI, thus suggesting that the inhibitory action of SSO is conceivably achieved through FAT/CD36. Given the above observations, we have hypothesized the following model as a working interaction between FAT/CD36 and CPTI for transferring LCFAs into the mitochondria (Fig. 8). In this model, FAT/CD36 acts as an LCFA acceptor (possibly in an inverse manner to its action at the plasma membrane), receiving LCFAs from cytosolic-binding proteins and handing them off to the long chain acyl CoA synthetase. The acyl CoA synthetase then activates the LCFA, which CPTI can then accept. Acyl CoA synthetase and CPTI have previously been demonstrated to be immunoreactive proteins (34Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Tandler B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), further supporting this hypothesis. Importantly, this model could allow for another key regulatory step in fatty acid oxidation, which could give a significant flux control coefficient in the regulation of β-oxidation. Interestingly, both Western blotting and in vitro assessment of mitochondrial oxidation demonstrated system flexibility in FAT/CD36 on the mitochondria. Chronic electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in the amount of protein in the mitochondrial fraction, as well as increased palmitate oxidation under identical conditions. Chronic electrical stimulation also resulted in an increase in the amount of FAT/CD36 protein in the plasma membrane fractions and in the total homogenate, as has been demonstrated previously (29Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in response to a chronic increase in the oxidative demand of muscles, FAT/CD36 protein expression is increased, and the additional protein is located both at the plasma membrane and at the mitochondria. Conversely, after 30 min of acute electrical stimulation, the total amount of FAT/CD36 protein was not increased; however, in the mitochondria, there was a significant increase in FAT/CD36. This result parallels the increase that has been demonstrated under identical conditions in the plasma membrane fraction (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that it is possible to translocate FAT/CD36 to the mitochondria. This translocation could potentially occur from previously identified intracellular pools of FAT/CD36 (11Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Luiken J.J. Dyck D.J. Han X.X. Tandon N.N. Arumugam Y. Glatz J.F. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E491-E495Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), or possibly FAT/CD36 is trafficked directly from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria. This is a novel hypothesis, which provides new avenues for further understanding the role of LCFAs and the mitochondria in cellular energy homeostasis. Translocation of FAT/CD36 to the plasma membrane and the mitochondria in a coordinated fashion during times of increased energy demands could perhaps be responsible for the rapid up-regulation of lipid metabolism previously observed during exercise (35Spriet L.L. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. 2002; 34: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of FAT/CD36 in the mitochondria remains to be determined. It is possible that it acts in concert with CPTI in transporting LCFAs across the mitochondrial membrane. Little is known about the mechanics of LCFA transport by FAT/CD36, even at the plasma membrane. It is possible that FAT/CD36 acts as an acceptor or docking protein, either handing LCFAs off to other proteins (36Febbraio M. Guy E. Coburn C. Knapp F.F.J. Beets A.L. Abumrad N.A. Silverstein R.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Glatz J.F. Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or simply assisting their movement through lipophobic environments. Conversely, it is possible that FAT/CD36 acts as a carrier protein, delivering cytosolic LCFAs to the mitochondria for further processing. Indeed, recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that other fatty acid-binding proteins besides FABPc may be involved in the trafficking of fatty acids in the cytosol (38Binas B. Han X.X. Erol E. Luiken J.J. Glatz J.F. Dyck D.J. Motazavi R. Adihetty P.J. Hood D.A. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E481-E489PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the role of FAT/CD36 in the mitochondria will increase our comprehension of cellular handling of LCFAs and their effect upon lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, it is important to ascertain whether impairments in fatty acid oxidation in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle are associated with disturbances in FAT/CD36 at the mitochondrial membrane.

The ATP binding cassette protein, multidrug resistance protein (MRP1/ABCC1), transports conjugated organic anions (e.g. leukotriene C4) and also co-transports certain unmodified xenobiotics (e.g. vincristine) with glutathione (GSH). MRP1 also confers resistance to arsenic in association with GSH; however, the mechanism and the species of arsenic transported are unknown. Using membrane vesicles prepared from the MRP1-overexpressing lung cancer cell line, H69AR, we found that MRP1 transports arsenite (AsIII) only in the presence of GSH but does not transport arsenate (AsV) (with or without GSH). The non-reducing GSH analogs l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-aminobutyryl glycine and S-methyl GSH did not support AsIII transport, indicating that the free thiol group of GSH is required. GSH-dependent transport of AsIII was 2-fold higher at pH 6.5-7 than at a more basic pH, consistent with the formation and transport of the acid-stable arsenic triglutathione (As(GS)3). Immunoblot analysis of H69AR vesicles revealed the unexpected membrane association of GSH S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1). Membrane vesicles from an MRP1-transfected HeLa cell line lacking membrane-associated GSTP1-1 did not transport AsIII even in the presence of GSH but did transport synthetic As(GS)3. The addition of exogenous GSTP1-1 to HeLa-MRP1 vesicles resulted in GSH-dependent AsIII transport. The apparent Km of As(GS)3 for MRP1 was 0.32 μm, suggesting a remarkably high relative affinity. As(GS)3 transport by MRP1 was osmotically sensitive and was inhibited by several conjugated organic anions (MRP1 substrates) as well as the metalloid antimonite (Ki 2.8 μm). As(GS)3 transport experiments using MRP1 mutants with substrate specificities differing from wild-type MRP1 suggested a commonality in the substrate binding pockets of As(GS)3 and leukotriene C4. Finally, human MRP2 also transported As(GS)3. In conclusion, MRP1 transports inorganic arsenic as a tri-GSH conjugate, and GSTP1-1 may have a synergistic role in this process.

In addition to its ability to confer resistance in tumor cells, MRP1 is expressed constitutively in many non-malignant tissues, with relatively high levels found in testes and lung (1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar, 2Flens M.J. Zaman G.J. van der Valk P.

MRP1 is a primary active transporter of GSSG and GSH as well as glucuronate, GSH, and sulfate-conjugated organic anions of physiological and toxicological relevance (3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Google Scholar). Endogenous substrates of MRP1 include the cysteinyl leukotriene LTC4, an important mediator of inflammatory response, and the conjugated steroids E217βG, estrone 3-sulfate, and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (4Loe D.W.

MRP1 and the related MRP2 (gene symbol ABCC2) have also been shown to transport various xenobiotics and are key components of the so-called Phase III elimination pathways of drug metabolism (9Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Toxicology. 2001; 167: 3-23Google Scholar). Several studies show that MRP1 and MRP2 can act synergistically with the phase II conjugating glutathione S-transferases (GST) to confer resistance to the toxicities of some electrophilic drugs and carcinogens (9Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Toxicology. 2001; 167: 3-23Google Scholar, 10Smitherman P.K. Townsend A.J. Kute T.E. Morrow C.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 260-267Google Scholar, 11Depeille P. Cuq P. Mary S. Passagne I. Evrard A. Cupissol D. Vian L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 897-905Google Scholar). However, several substrates of MRP1 and MRP2, including most of the natural product drugs to which they confer resistance, are not conjugated to any significant extent in vivo, but their transport is stimulated by GSH. Current evidence suggests that at least some of these drugs are co-transported with GSH across the plasma membrane (12Renes J. de Vries E.G. Nienhuis E.F. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 681-688Google Scholar, 13Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136Google Scholar). The metalloid arsenic is an established multi-target human carcinogen and a major concern as a environmental pollutant (14Gomez-Caminero A. Howe P. Hughes M.F. Kenyon E. Lewis D.R. Moore M. Ng J. Aitio A. Becking G. Ng J. Environmental Health Criteria 224: Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds. 2nd Ed. International Program on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization, Geneva2001Google Scholar). In addition, arsenic-containing compounds (e.g. As2O3) are used in the treatment of several diseases including neoplasia and protozoal infections (15Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev.

Chen S.J. Chen Z. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 3354-3360Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms responsible for arsenic transport has both toxicological and pharmacological relevance. The ubiquitous nature of inorganic arsenic in the environment has led to the evolution of arsenic adaptation mechanisms in species ranging from bacteria to humans (17Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Google Scholar). In bacteria, yeast, and protozoa, pathways of metalloid resistance have been extensively characterized, and it has been determined that arsenic is detoxified either by extrusion from cells or by sequestration within intra-cellular organelles as thiol conjugates (18Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar, 19Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammalian cell models, MRP1 has been shown to confer resistance to arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV) in a GSH-dependent manner (21Cole S.P. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M.

Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Johnson D.R. Klaassen C.D. Waalkes M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 302-309Google Scholar). However, arsenic transport by MRP1 has never been demonstrated directly, and the mechanism by which efflux occurs and the chemical nature of the transported species are still undefined. Exposure of cells expressing MRP1 to inorganic arsenic has been shown to result in the efflux of GSH and arsenic into the tissue culture media (23Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7690-7694Google Scholar). Arsenic-GSH conjugates have never been successfully isolated and identified in such systems, and this is possibly due to their unstable nature. Alternatively, as proposed by Salerno et al. (25Salerno M. Petroutsa M. Garnier-Suillerot A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 135-145Google Scholar), MRP1 could efflux arsenic in non-covalent association with free GSH. Convincing in vivo evidence indicates that MRP2 transports GSH-conjugated arsenic species into bile (26Kala S.V. Neely M.W. Kala G. Prater C.I. Atwood D.W. Rice J.S. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33404-33408Google Scholar, 27Gyurasics A. Varga F. Gregus Z. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 465-468Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificities of MRP1 and MRP2 are not identical, they are very similar. Thus, MRP1 could transport arsenic in a GSH-conjugated form. The major route of arsenic excretion is urinary (60-80% of total arsenic ingested), and very recently arsenic-GSH conjugates have been isolated from the urine of mice lacking the gene for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, an enzyme responsible for GSH and GSH conjugate catabolism (28Kala S.V. Kala G. Prater C.I. Sartorelli A.C. Lieberman M.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 243-249Google Scholar). Thus, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase is implicated in the processing of arsenic-GSH conjugates at the kidney (28Kala S.V. Kala G. Prater C.I. Sartorelli A.C. Lieberman M.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 243-249Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the form of arsenic transported by MRP1 using membrane vesicles prepared from the MRP1 overexpressing H69AR and transfected HeLa cell lines. We found that MRP1 transports AsIII but only in the presence of GSH, and this transport is not supported by GSH analogs that lack a free thiol group. Unexpectedly, we found that the normally cytosolic- or nuclear-localized GSTP1-1 is associated with the membrane vesicle fraction of the H69AR cell line. We present evidence that the formation of As(GS)3 is necessary for AsIII efflux by MRP1 and that vesicle-associated GSTP1-1 is critical for this complex formation. Finally, the transport of As(GS)3 by MRP1 is extensively characterized. Materials—Carrier-free 73AsV was purchased from Los Alamos Meson Production Facility (Los Alamos, NM). ATP, AMP, GSH, GSSG, S-methyl GSH, sucrose, HEPES, KCl, MgCl2, purified GSTP1-1, and poly l-lysine were from Sigma-Aldrich. Creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, glutathione reductase (from yeast), NADPH, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete, mini EDTA free) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Ophthalmic acid (l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-aminobutyryl glycine) was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Antibodies and Cell Lines—The murine MRP1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) QCRL-1 and QCRL-3 have been described previously (29Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792Google Scholar, 30Hipfner D.R. Mao Q. Qiu W. Leslie E.M. Gao M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15420-15426Google Scholar). The rat MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody MRPr1 was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody, MRP-1, was raised to a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to a region in the NH2-proximal nucleotide binding domain of MRP1 (position 765-779), which includes the highly conserved “C” signature motif (30Hipfner D.R. Mao Q. Qiu W. Leslie E.M. Gao M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15420-15426Google Scholar). This antibody cross-reacts with MRP2. The rabbit GSTP1-1-specific polyclonal antibody was from Calbiochem, and the murine GSTP1-1-specific mAb 353-10 was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Derivation and culture of the MRP1 and vector control-transfected HeLa cell lines and the human small cell lung cancer cell line H69 and its MRP1-overexpressing variant H69AR have been described previously (1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar, 31Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G.

The SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemical Synthesis of 73AsIII and 73As(GS)3—73AsIII was prepared from 73AsV with metabisulfite-thiosulfate reagent as previously described (32Reay P.F. Asher C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 557-560Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of a reducing solution (0.1 mm NaAsO2, 66 mm Na2S2O5, 27 mm Na2S2O3, and 82 mm H2SO4) was added to 40 μl of carrier-free 73AsV (30 μCi) and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The formation of 73AsIII was monitored by TLC on SigmaCell type 100 cellulose plates (Sigma) developed with an isopropanol:acetic acid: water (10:1:5) solvent system (33Styblo M. Thomas D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 971-977Google Scholar). 73As(GS)3 was prepared as described previously by Delnomdedieu et al. (34Delnomdedieu M. Basti M.M. Otvos J.D. Thomas D.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 90: 139-155Google Scholar) with modifications. 73AsIII (final concentration 2.5 μm) and GSH (final concentration 75 mm) were mixed under an argon atmosphere in HEPES/KCl buffer at a pH of ∼3 and incubated at 4 °C for >1 h. Formation of 73As(GS)3 was monitored by TLC as described above for 73AsV reduction, and all 73AsIII was consumed and converted to 73As(GS)3. Relative mobility (RF) values were determined for starting materials and products and were consistent with previously published values (33Styblo M. Thomas D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 971-977Google Scholar). MRP1 and MRP2 Expression Vectors and Transfections in HEK293T Cells—The construction and expression of wild-type MRP1 (WTMRP1), wild-type MRP2 (WT-MRP2), and the MRP1 mutants K332L, D336K, K319D, and K347D in HEK293T cells have been described previously (31Ito K.

Membrane Vesicle Preparation and Immunoblotting—Plasma membrane vesicles from H69, H69AR, HeLa vector, HeLa-MRP1, and transfected HEK293T cells were prepared as described, with modifications (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets. Cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation (a 5-min equilibration at 200 p.s.i.) and then released to atmospheric pressure, and EDTA was added to 1 mm. The suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was layered onto 10 ml of a 35% (w/w) sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, cushion. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, the interface was removed and placed in a 25 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, solution and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The membranes were washed with Tris sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and then resuspended by vigorous syringing with a 27-gauge needle. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots of membrane vesicles were stored at -80 °C. Relative levels of MRP1 protein in membrane vesicles (1 and/or 2 μg of protein) were determined by immunoblot analysis as described previously, with the human MRP1-specific mAb QCRL-1 (29Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792Google Scholar). Relative levels of GSTP1-1 protein in membrane vesicles (5 μg of protein) were determined by immunoblot analysis as for MRP1, with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for human GSTP1-1 at a dilution of 1:1000. Comparison of MRP1 and MRP2 protein expression levels was done using the polyclonal rabbit antibody MRP-1 at a dilution of 1:1000 as described previously (30Hipfner D.R. Mao Q. Qiu W. Leslie E.M. Gao M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15420-15426Google Scholar). Where appropriate, relative levels of MRP1 and MRP2 expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Equal loading of all protein was confirmed by Amido Black staining of the membranes. 73AsIII and 73As(GS)3Transport Studies—73As transport assays were carried out by a rapid filtration method as previously described (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein per time point) were incubated at 37 °C at a final volume of 60 μl (single time point) or 300 μl (5 time points). Unless otherwise noted, the transport assay buffer used was HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), KCl (100 mm) and contained ATP or AMP (4 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), creatine phosphate (10 mm), creatine kinase (100 μg/ml), glutathione reductase (5 μg/ml), NADPH (0.35 mm), with and without GSH (3 mm) and 73AsIII (30 nCi, 100 nm) or 73As(GS)3 (30 nCi, 100 nm). Conditions for synthesis of 73As(GS)3 resulted in the presence of 3 mm GSH in all transport reactions. At the indicated time points, 60 μl of transport reaction mix was removed and placed in 800 μl of HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), KCl (100 mm) buffer, filtered through glass fiber filters (type A/E; Pall Life Sciences, East Hills, NY), and washed twice, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP and reported as ATP-dependent73AsIII or 73As(GS)3 transport. The effects of potential modulators of 73As(GS)3 or 73AsIII transport (MRP1-specific mAbs QCRL-1 and QCRL-3 (10 μg/ml), ophthalmic acid (1, 3, or 5 mm), S-methyl GSH (1, 3, or 5 mm), pH change (pH 6.5, 7, 7.5, or 8), sucrose (250-1000 mm), E217βG (25 μm), LTC4 (1 μm), GSSG (0.5 mm), AsV (1 or 10 μm), CdCl2 (1 or 10 μm), potassium antimony tartrate (SbIII) (1 or 10 μm)) were measured at a single time point of 3 min. The effect of exogenous purified GSTP1-1 (0.4 ng or 79 microunits/60-μl reaction) on 73AsIII uptake in the presence of GSH by HeLa-MRP1 vesicles was measured as above. Before use, the purified GSTP1-1 was dialyzed to remove dithiothreitol and EDTA (potential arsenic chelators) using a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis unit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Kinetic parameters were determined by measuring the initial rate of 73As(GS)3 uptake at 7 different substrate concentrations (50-2500 nm) at a single time point of 1 min. The mode of As(GS)3 transport inhibition by SbIII was examined by determining kinetic parameters in the presence and absence of 5 μm of this metalloid. Confocal Microscopy—Triple staining experiments for nuclei, MRP1 (as a plasma membrane marker), and GSTP1-1 were done using the H69AR and HeLa-MRP1 cell lines. H69AR and HeLa-MRP1 cells were seeded at 2 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells/well, respectively, in a 6-well plate on coverslips pretreated with poly l-lysine (Mr 70,000-150,000). Thirty-six hours later the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 min, washed 3 times in blocking solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) over 15 min, and then incubated with the GSTP1-1-specific murine mAb 353-10 (1:50 dilution in blocking solution) and the MRP1-specific rat mAb MRPr1 (1:500 dilution) overnight. After washing with blocking solution 3 times over 1 h, highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added (1:500 dilution) with RNase A (10 μg/ml) and incubated in the dark for 30 min. Cells were washed with blocking solution changed 4 times over 1 h. Nuclei were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and coverslips were placed on slides with ProLong antifade mounting media (Molecular Probes). A Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× oil (numerical aperture = 1.4) objective lens was used to obtain the fluorescence images. The Hoechst 33342, Alexa 488, and Alexa 594 images were acquired consecutively using, respectively, the 364-, 488 (Ar-ion lasers)-, and 543-nm (HeNe laser) laser lines for excitation and the 385-nm long pass, 505-550-nm band pass, and 560-nm long pass filters for emission. The pinhole was adjusted so that the theoretical Z-resolution was ∼0.7 μm. Negative control experiments with Alexa Fluor 488- and/or 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) in the absence of primary antibodies were also performed. Negative control experiments in the presence of both secondary antibodies and individual primary antibodies were also conducted to ensure no cross-reactivity between antibodies. Uptake of AsIII (plus GSH) and As(GS)3by MRP1-enriched Membrane Vesicles—To determine whether AsIII was a substrate for MRP1, ATP-dependent uptake into membrane vesicles prepared from the human small cell lung cancer cell line H69 and its MRP1-overexpressing variant, H69AR, was determined. A time course of AsIII uptake by the H69 and H69AR membrane vesicles is shown in Fig. 1A. ATP-dependent uptake of AsIII by the MRP1-enriched H69AR vesicles was extremely low and similar to uptake observed with AMP or with the non-MRP1-containing H69 vesicles. However, in the presence of GSH (3 mm), ATP-dependent uptake of AsIII by the H69AR but not the H69 vesicles was observed. Uptake was maximal at 3 min, at which time it reached a level of 2.6 pmol mg-1. Similar experiments with AsV were also conducted, and no ATP-dependent transport was observed in the presence or absence of GSH (data not shown). Incubation of AsIII with GSH (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in the spontaneous formation of As(GS)3 as detected by TLC (73AsIII RF = 0.6; 73AsIII plus GSH RF = 0.01). Uptake of As(GS)3 by the H69 and H69AR membrane vesicles was also measured (Fig. 1A). Uptake of As(GS)3 by H69AR membrane vesicles was linear for 3 min, at which time it reached a level of 4.7 pmol mg-1 and then began to plateau. The maximum activity for As(GS)3 uptake was almost 2-fold greater than the maximum activity observed with AsIII (plus GSH). Results for the H69 vesicles were similar to that of the AsIII time course (not shown). Inhibition of As(GS)3Transport by the MRP1-specific mAb QCRL-3—Several MRP1-specific mAbs have been shown previously to inhibit transport of conjugated and unconjugated MRP1 substrates including LTC4, E217βG, aflatoxin B1-GS, vincristine, and NNAL-O-glucuronide (plus GSH) (4Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Google Scholar, 5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Google Scholar, 13Loe D.W.

When the mAb QCRL-3 (which recognizes a conformational-dependent epitope) was tested for its ability to inhibit ATP-dependent uptake of As(GS)3 by H69AR membrane vesicles, complete inhibition was observed at a concentration of 10 μg ml-1 (Fig. 1B). mAb QCRL-1, which recognizes a linear epitope in part of the linker region of MRP1 and does not inhibit transport of other MRP1 substrates (39Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314Google Scholar), had no effect on As(GS)3 transport. These results further confirm the MRP1 specificity of ATP-dependent transport of As(GS)3. Ophthalmic Acid and S-Methyl GSH Do Not Support MRP1-mediated AsIII Transport—In previous studies, it has been shown that ophthalmic acid (l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-aminobutyryl-glycine) and S-methyl GSH can substitute for GSH and support the transport of several GSH-dependent MRP1 substrates (8Qian Y.M. Song W.C. Cui H. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6404-6411Google Scholar, 13Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136Google Scholar, 38Leslie E.M. Ito K.

Ther. 2003; 304: 643-653Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the thiol group of GSH is not required for transport of these substrates and rules out the possibility that formation of a GSH conjugate is critical for transport to occur. In contrast with other MRP1 substrates, neither ophthalmic acid (Fig. 2A) nor S-methyl GSH (Fig. 2B) supported the uptake of AsIII into H69AR membrane vesicles, demonstrating that the free thiol group of GSH is required for AsIII transport by MRP1. GSH-dependent AsIII Uptake Is pH-dependent—The stability and formation rate of As(GS)3 are known to be greater at acidic pH (25Salerno M. Petroutsa M. Garnier-Suillerot A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 135-145Google Scholar, 34Delnomdedieu M. Basti M.M. Otvos J.D. Thomas D.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 90: 139-155Google Scholar), whereas MRP1 transport of LTC4 has been shown to be relatively insensitive to changes in pH; specifically, LTC4 transport was unchanged between pH 6.5 and 7.5 and modestly increased above pH 8 (41Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Google Scholar). To determine if transport of AsIII (plus GSH) is influenced by pH, transport was measured over a pH range of 6.5-8. Transport of AsIII (plus GSH) was similar at acidic (pH 6.5) and neutral pH (∼6 pmol mg-1 3 min-1), whereas uptake by vesicles at more basic pH (pH 7.5 and 8) was reduced by 50% (∼2.8 pmol mg-1 3 min-1) (Fig. 3). The increased AsIII transport activity observed at neutral and acidic pH is consistent with the enhanced formation and stability of As(GS)3 at acidic pH and supports the conclusion that this GSH conjugate is being formed before transport. GSTP1-1 Is Associated with the Plasma Membrane of H69 and H69AR Cell Lines—During optimization of AsIII (plus GSH) uptake assay, TLC analysis indicated that under the transport assay conditions used, As(GS)3 was formed from free AsIII and GSH. However, further experimentation showed that conjugate formation did not occur in the absence of membrane vesicles (data not shown). This suggested that the membrane vesicles contained a component that catalyzed the formation of As(GS)3. Immunoblot analysis revealed the pres"
https://openalex.org/W2004133845,"Optical and electronic phenomena in solids arise from the behaviour of electrons and holes (unoccupied states in a filled electron sea). Electron–hole symmetry can often be invoked as a simplifying description, which states that electrons with energy above the Fermi sea behave the same as holes below the Fermi energy. In semiconductors, however, electron–hole symmetry is generally absent, because the energy-band structure of the conduction band differs from the valence band1. Here we report on measurements of the discrete, quantized-energy spectrum of electrons and holes in a semiconducting carbon nanotube2. By applying a voltage to a gate electrode, an individual nanotube is filled controllably with a precise number of either electrons or holes, starting from one. The discrete excitation spectrum for a nanotube with N holes is strikingly similar to the corresponding spectrum for N electrons. This observation of near-perfect electron–hole symmetry3 demonstrates that a semiconducting nanotube can be free of charged impurities, even in the limit of few electrons or holes. We furthermore find an anomalously small Zeeman spin splitting and an excitation spectrum indicating strong electron–electron interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2004228136,"The flavoenzyme Ero1p produces disulfide bonds for oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Disulfides generated de novo within Ero1p are transferred to protein disulfide isomerase and then to substrate proteins by dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Despite this key role of Ero1p, little is known about the mechanism by which this enzyme catalyzes thiol oxidation. Here, we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of Ero1p, which reveals the molecular details of the catalytic center, the role of a CXXCXXC motif, and the spatial relationship between functionally significant cysteines and the bound cofactor. Remarkably, the Ero1p active site closely resembles that of the versatile thiol oxidase module of Erv2p, a protein with no sequence homology to Ero1p. Furthermore, both Ero1p and Erv2p display essential dicysteine motifs on mobile polypeptide segments, suggesting that shuttling electrons to a rigid active site using a flexible strand is a fundamental feature of disulfide-generating flavoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2069954052,"A question of long-standing interest to philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists is how the brain selects which signals enter consciousness1,2. Binocular rivalry and attention both involve selection of visual stimuli, but affect perception quite differently. During binocular rivalry, awareness alternates between two different stimuli presented to the two eyes. In contrast, attending to one of two different stimuli impairs discrimination of the ignored stimulus, but without causing it to disappear from consciousness. Here we show that despite this difference, attention and rivalry rely on shared object-based selection mechanisms. We cued attention to one of two superimposed transparent surfaces and then deleted the image of one surface from each eye, resulting in rivalry. Observers usually reported seeing only the cued surface. They were also less accurate in judging unpredictable changes in the features of the uncued surface. Our design ensured that selection of the cued surface could not have resulted from spatial, ocular or feature-based mechanisms. Rather, attention was drawn to one surface, and this caused the other surface to be perceptually suppressed during rivalry. These results raise the question of how object representations compete during these two forms of perceptual selection, even as the features of those objects change unpredictably over time."
https://openalex.org/W2131761459,"The checkpoint mediator protein Claspin is essential for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts containing aphidicolin-induced DNA replication blocks. We show that, during this checkpoint response, Claspin becomes phosphorylated on threonine 906 (T906), which creates a docking site for Plx1, the Xenopus Polo-like kinase. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation of Claspin on a nearby serine (S934) by Plx1. After a prolonged interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg extracts typically undergo adaptation and enter into mitosis despite the presence of incompletely replicated DNA. In this process, Claspin dissociates from chromatin, and Chk1 undergoes inactivation. By contrast, aphidicolin-treated extracts containing mutants of Claspin with alanine substitutions at positions 906 or 934 (T906A or S934A) are unable to undergo adaptation. Under such adaptation-defective conditions, Claspin accumulates on chromatin at high levels, and Chk1 does not decrease in activity. These results indicate that the Plx1-dependent inactivation of Claspin results in termination of a DNA replication checkpoint response."
https://openalex.org/W1965483278,"14-3-3 proteins regulate the cell division cycle and play a pivotal role in blocking cell cycle advancement after activation of the DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints. Here we describe a global proteomics analysis to identify proteins that bind to 14-3-3s during interphase and mitosis. 14-3-3-binding proteins were purified from extracts of interphase and mitotic HeLa cells using specific peptide elution from 14-3-3ζ affinity columns. Proteins that specifically bound and eluted from the affinity columns were identified by microcapillary high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Several known and novel 14-3-3-interacting proteins were identified in this screen. Identified proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, protein synthesis, nucleic acid binding, chromatin structure, protein folding, proteolysis, nucleolar function, and nuclear transport as well as several other cellular processes. In some cases 14-3-3 binding was cell cycle-dependent, whereas in other cases the binding was shown to be cell cycle-independent. This study adds to the growing list of human 14-3-3-binding proteins and implicates a role for 14-3-3 proteins in a plethora of essential biological processes. 14-3-3 proteins regulate the cell division cycle and play a pivotal role in blocking cell cycle advancement after activation of the DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints.

In some cases 14-3-3 binding was cell cycle-dependent, whereas in other cases the binding was shown to be cell cycle-independent. This study adds to the growing list of human 14-3-3-binding proteins and implicates a role for 14-3-3 proteins in a plethora of essential biological processes. 14-3-3 proteins belong to a highly conserved multigene family of small acidic proteins (1Aitken A.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Google Scholar, 5Siles-Lucas Mdel M. Gottstein B. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 575-581Google Scholar). In mammals there are seven 14-3-3 isoforms, designated with Greek letters (β, ϵ, γ, η, σ, τ, ζ). In most cases 14-3-3s bind to target proteins when the targets are phosphorylated; two canonical 14-3-3 binding motifs have been identified as RSXpSXP and RX(Y/F)XpSXP, where pS represents phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (6Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Google Scholar, 7Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binding can alter the enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, dephosphorylation, and proteolysis of individual target proteins (4Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Google Scholar, 8van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 936-946Google Scholar, 9Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins bind to and regulate several key cell cycle regulators, including Wee1, Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C. In each case, 14-3-3s bind the regulators during interphase but not during mitosis. Entry into mitosis requires the activation of the Cdk1 protein kinase, and 14-3-3s control Cdk1 activity indirectly by regulating the activity of both the kinases and phosphatases that control Cdk1. First, 14-3-3 binds to the C terminus of Wee1 during interphase to stabilize its kinase activity (10Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 581-589Google Scholar). Second, 14-3-3 binds to Cdc25C in the cytosol during interphase to prevent Cdc25C from accumulating in the cell nucleus (11Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. Decaprio J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Google Scholar, 12Graves P.R. Lovly C.M. Uy G.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1839-1851Google Scholar, 13Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.

During late G2, loss of 14-3-3 binding allows Cdc25C to accumulate in the nucleus. 14-3-3 binding to Cdc25B also appears to contribute to the nuclear exclusion of Cdc25B (15Davezac N. Baldin V. Gabrielli B. Forrest A. Theis-Febvre N. Yashida M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2179-2185Google Scholar). Last, 14-3-3s bind to Cdc25A during interphase to prevent Cdc25A from activating Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes. 1Chen, M.-S., Ryan, C. E., and Piwnica-Worms, H. (2003) Mol. Cell. Biol.23, 7488–7497. 1Chen, M.-S., Ryan, C. E., and Piwnica-Worms, H. (2003) Mol. Cell. Biol.23, 7488–7497. 14-3-3 proteins also play a pivotal role in blocking cell cycle advancement after checkpoint activation. Checkpoints are signaling pathways that monitor the integrity and replication status of the genetic material before cells commit to either replicate (in S-phase) or segregate (in mitosis) their DNA (17Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Google Scholar). Once activated, checkpoints ultimately interface with cyclin-Cdk complexes to block cell cycle advancement or induce cell death. 14-3-3 proteins are essential for both the DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints in human, Xenopus laevis, and fission yeast cells (13Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Google Scholar, 18Kumagai A. Yakowec P.S. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 345-354Google Scholar, 19Chan T.A.

Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.F. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Google Scholar). In addition to regulating Cdc25C as described above, the fission yeast 14-3-3 protein Rad24 also binds to the Chk1 protein kinase, an essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint (23Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar, 24Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Google Scholar). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to Chk1 is induced by DNA damage, but the functional consequences of this interaction are not known (25Chen L. Liu T.H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Google Scholar). A recent report indicates that human Chk1 may also bind 14-3-3 proteins (26Jiang K. Pereira E. Maxfield M. Russell B. Goudelock D.M. Sanchez Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25207-25225Google Scholar). Last, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is an essential component of the G1 DNA damage checkpoint (27Kastan M.B. Onyekwere B. Sidransky D. Vogelstien B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar) and also plays a role in maintaining the G2 DNA damage checkpoint (19Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Google Scholar, 28Paules R.S. Levedakou E.N. Wilson S.J. Innes C.L. Rhodes N. Tlsty T.D. Galloway D.A. Donehower L.A. Tainsky M.A. Kaufman W.K.

In epithelial cells, 14-3-3σ is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to DNA damage. Cells lacking 14-3-3σ can still arrest in G2 but are unable to maintain this cell cycle arrest and ultimately die. In these 14-3-3σ-deficient cells, Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes, which normally undergo continual nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, are now allowed to accumulate in the nucleus, ultimately leading to bypass of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. The tumor suppressor protein p53 also binds to 14-3-3 proteins. In this case, dephosphorylation of p53 at serine 376 generates a functional binding motif at phosphoserine 378; an intact 14-3-3-binding site is required for ATM-dependent p53 activation and effective cell cycle arrest (31Stavridi E.S. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7030-7033Google Scholar). To identify novel cell cycle regulatory functions of 14-3-3, we carried out a global proteomics analysis to identify proteins that bind to 14-3-3s during interphase and mitosis. 14-3-3-interacting proteins were purified from extracts of both interphase and mitotic HeLa cells using specific peptide elution from 14-3-3ζ affinity columns. The eluted proteins were identified by microcapillary HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Cdk, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis protein 2; HDAC; histone deacetylase; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Cdk, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis protein 2; HDAC; histone deacetylase; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase. tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS). Proteins that were identified are involved in multiple biological processes and include both cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent interactors. Materials—The R18/11 peptide, RDLSWLDLEAN, was synthesized by Dr. M. Berne (Tufts University) and HPLC-purified by Dr. J. Gorka (Biomolecules Midwest). Precast SDS-PAGE gels used for MS analysis were from Bio-Rad, and the colloidal Coomassie protein stain was from Invitrogen. Vivaspin and Centricon centrifugal concentrators were from Vivascience and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher and were reagent grade. Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies against 14-3-3 (K19), glutathione S-transferase (GST), Cdc25B, Cdc25C, PCTAIRE 2, PCTAIRE 3, TSC2 (tuberin), nucleolin (C23), nucleophosmin, Chk1, histone deacetylase 4, and Wee1 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against human Cdc25A were from Neomarkers, and antibodies against EMK/Par1B have been described (32Hurov J.B. Stappenbeck T.S. Zmasek C.M. Ranganath S.H. White L.S. Russell J.H. Chan A.C. Murphy K.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3853-3861Google Scholar). Cdc25C was detected with ascites generated from a monoclonal Cdc25C antibody (13Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Google Scholar). C-TAK1 was detected with ascites generated using a monoclonal antibody produced with bacterially purified His-tagged human C-TAK1 (hPar-1a). For Western blotting, antibodies were dissolved in 5% milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20), and membranes were washed 3 times in TBST after application of both primary and secondary antibody. Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse (Jackson Laboratories), goat anti-rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or donkey anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) secondary antibodies and visualized using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of total cell lysate using either anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma), anti-Myc (9E10)-agarose (Santa Cruz), or anti-TSC2 antibody bound to protein A beads (Pierce). 14-3-3 Far Western Analysis—For 14-3-3 Far Western analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as for a Western blot. Proteins bound to the membrane were denatured by incubating for at least 1 h in denaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine-HCl, 6.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20) and then renatured by incubating for at least 1 h in renaturation buffer (denaturation buffer without guanidine-HCl or DTT). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in TBST, rinsed in TBST, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 0.1 μg/ml GST-14-3-3ζ and -σ and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where the R18/11 peptide was used to check binding specificity, the GST-14-3-3 protein mixture was preincubated with 0.1 mm peptide for 1 h before use. Membranes were washed 3 times in TBST, then incubated for 1 h with anti-GST primary antibody in 5% milk, TBST. Bound primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using ECL reagent as for Western blotting. 14-3-3 Affinity Chromatography—All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Mitotic and interphase HeLa cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 15 min in a hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm DTT, plus Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) followed by Dounce homogenization. The lysate (lysate containing 150 mg of total protein was used for each affinity column) was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and a 0–80% ammonium sulfate fraction was prepared. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm microcystin-LR, plus protease inhibitors, then dialyzed for 2 h against 2 × 2 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and 4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The sample was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and incubated end over end with a 5-ml GST column for 1 h to remove any GST-binding proteins. The precleared sample was then incubated end over end with either 5 ml of GST-14-3-3 beads or 5 ml of GST control beads for 2 h. The beads were transferred to a disposable column holder (Bio-Rad), and the flow-through was collected. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of low salt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT), then with 10 volumes of high salt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) until no further protein was eluted. 14-3-3-binding proteins were specifically eluted from the column with 25 ml of 0.5 mm R18/11 peptide dissolved in high salt buffer followed by 5 ml of high salt buffer (the peptide elution buffer was left on the column for 15 min before elution). The first 20 × 2-ml fractions from each column were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed using Vivaspin and then Centricon 10,000 concentrators. Concentrated fractions (35 μl of a total of 50 μl for each column) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized using colloidal Coomassie stain. One μl of each preparation was used for Far Western analysis. Peptide Identification by Mass Spectrometry and Bioinformatics Analysis—Bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and pooled into 10 samples from each gel lane according to staining intensity and apparent molecular mass. The protein and Far Western patterns shown are representative of three separate purifications, with MS/MS analysis carried out once. After in-gel trypsinization, peptide sequences were determined by microcapillary reversed-phase chromatography coupled to a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP+ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer as in Xu et al. (33Catalano C.M. Lane W.S. Sherrier D.J. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 519-531Google Scholar). To improve data analysis, the resulting MS/MS spectra were preprocessed with in-house custom software that recombined identical spectra (CombIon), determined precursor charge state without a high resolution scan (ZSA), and increased the accuracy of the precursor assignment (CorrectIon). Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by data base correlation with the algorithm SEQUEST followed by manual examination of the MS/MS spectra. This large scale evaluation was aided by creating a working superset of peptide sequences with two programs written in-house. The first, ScoreFinal, uses a neural network to synthesize a single normalized score (Sf 0.0–1.0) from the five SEQUEST scores (Sp, RSp, Ions, XCorr, DeltaCn) as well as peptide length, precursor charge state, and data base size. The second, SigCalc, independently calculates the probability (P) that MS/MS product ions observed would match the peptide's predicted fragment ions as a random event. The working set were those sequences that met the criteria Sf ≥ 0.5, p ≥ 10–6 or the sum of Sf ≥ 0.85 for two or more spectra identifying the same protein. From this set final identifications were always confirmed by rigorous manual validation of the MS/MS spectra. Expression of Recombinant GST and GST-14-3-3 and Preparation of GST-14-3-3 and Control GST Affinity Columns—BL21 cells were transformed with plasmids encoding GST or GST-tagged 14-3-3ζ. Cultures were grown in a Bioflo 5000 fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific) at 37 °C with TB medium (12 g/l bactotryptone, 24 g/l yeast extract, 0.4% (v/v) glycerol, 72 nm K2HPO4 and 17 mm KH2PO4 (Terrific Broth)) containing 0.2% glucose and under 30% O2, to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After growing for an additional 4 h, cells were pelleted by continuous centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in bacterial cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1.25% N-lauryl sarcosine supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors (4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine). After rocking at 4 °C for 20 min, cells were lysed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min), and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Proteins were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads and washed once with bacterial lysis buffer, twice with 10 volumes of 50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m LiCl, and 3 times with 10 volumes of 50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in the same buffer, and protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer without glutathione plus 1 mm benzamidine and 4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The levels of GST fusion proteins were estimated by comparison to a bovine serum albumin standard after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purified GST or GST-14-3-3 was covalently coupled to activated CH-Sepharose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.5 mg of protein was bound per 1 ml of swollen beads. GST and 14-3-3 columns were washed extensively and equilibrated in low salt buffer immediately before use. GST-14-3-3 Pull-down Experiments—HeLa cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm microcystin-LR, plus protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The lysate was preincubated with glutathione-agarose without any GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. Meanwhile, bacterial cell lysate expressing GST-14-3-3ζ was incubated with glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 0.5 m LiCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by HeLa cell lysis buffer, then incubated with 1–2 mg of precleared HeLa cell extract for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in HeLa cell lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. To prepare non-nocodazole-treated mitotic cells, asynchronously growing cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, then released from the block by switching to complete growth medium containing 24 μm each of thymidine and deoxycytidine. After 8 h thymidine was added to the medium to a final concentration of 2 mm, and cells were cultured for an additional 16 h to synchronize them at the G1-S border. Cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in complete growth medium for a further 7–10 h, when mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. For interphase samples, asynchronously growing cells were harvested at 60–90% confluence. To obtain nocodazole-synchronized mitotic cells, 100 ng/ml nocodazole was added to the growth medium of asynchronously growing cells, and cells were harvested by shake-off after 10–12 h. Cell cycle phase was determined by flow cytometry by using a BD Biosciences FACScan. Cells were stained with 30 μg/ml propidium iodide for DNA content and for phospho-histone H3 content to identify mitotic cells as described (34Xu B. Kim S.-T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Google Scholar). FACS data were analyzed using CELLQUEST software. Transient transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dephosphorylation of 14-3-3-binding Proteins in Vitro—Purified 14-3-3-binding proteins (0.1 μl of a total of 50 μl of each column eluate) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs), in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding status were analyzed by Far Western blot. Distinct Spectrum of 14-3-3-interacting Proteins in Interphase and Mitosis—Far Western analysis was employed to visualize the profile of 14-3-3-binding proteins in mitotic and interphase cells. FACS analysis demonstrated that asynchronously growing populations of HeLa cells consist of ∼3% mitotic cells and 97% G1-S- or G2-phase cells (data not shown). Therefore, asynchronous populations of HeLa cells served as the source of interphase cells. Mitotic cells were obtained in two ways. Cells were synchronized in S-phase, released from the S-phase block, and then collected when they entered mitosis. Alternatively, HeLa cells were incubated in nocodazole to enrich for mitotic cells. Profiles of 14-3-3-binding proteins obtained using both methods were compared. As seen in Fig. 1, the overall profiles of 14-3-3-binding proteins were similar between the two populations of mitotic cells. However, interphase and mitotic cells exhibited distinct 14-3-3 binding profiles. The interactions between 14-3-3s and their target proteins were shown to be specific because 14-3-3 binding was specifically competed with an 11-amino acid peptide derived from the R18 peptide (Fig. 1, panel C). R18 is a hydrophobic peptide that binds to the amphipathic target binding groove of the 14-3-3 dimer (35Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.-C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Google Scholar, 36Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Google Scholar). Although it is not itself phosphorylated, R18 can displace phosphorylated target proteins from the 14-3-3 binding groove. Further evidence for specificity comes from the observation that 14-3-3 binding to target proteins was abolished by protein phosphatase treatment (see Fig. 2B, lanes 11 and 14). These results demonstrated that there are cell cycle-specific differences in 14-3-3 binding partners that can be detected by Far Western analysis and that nocodazole can be used to synchronize mitotic HeLa cells for large scale purification of 14-3-3 binding partners.Fig. 2Purification and identification of 14-3-3-interacting proteins from interphase and mitotic HeLa cells.A, outline of the large scale purification procedure. Protein yields at each step are indicated. B, 14-3-3 Far Western analysis of samples at various steps in the purification procedure. Shown are interphase (I) and mitotic (M) lysates before fractionation (lanes 1 and 2), flow-through (FT) fractions from the 14-3-3 (lanes 3 and 4) and GST (lanes 5 and 6) columns, salt wash of the 14-3-3 column (lanes 7 and 8), eluate from the 14-3-3 column (lanes 9 and 12), eluate from the 14-3-3 column incubated for 10 min at 37 °C without (lanes 10 and 13) or with (lanes 11 and 14) calf intestinal phosphatase. Eluate from the GST column is shown in lanes 15 and 16. C, colloidal Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of mitotic (lanes 1 and 3) and interphase (lanes 2 and 4) eluates from the 14-3-3 affinity column (lanes 1 and 2) and GST control column (lanes 3 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purification of 14-3-3-binding proteins from Interphase and Mitotic Cells—Next, a purification scheme was developed to isolate sufficient quantities of 14-3-3-binding proteins for identification by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). For large scale protein purification, HeLa cells were harvested from asynchronously growing cell cultures or from cells that had been synchronized in mitosis with nocodazole. FACS analysis of propidium iodide- and phospho-histone H3-stained cells (34Xu B. Kim S.-T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Google Scholar) was used to confirm cell cycle phases; the asynchronous population used for purification contained 97% interphase cells, whereas the nocodazole-treated population contained at least 90% mitotic cells (data not shown). Cells were snap-frozen and then thawed in lysis buffer for protein purification. Proteins were precipitated from the cell lysate with 80% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in buffer, and passed over a GST column to remove GST-binding proteins. Samples were then applied to either a GST control column or a GST-14-3-3ζ column. The 14-3-3 binding activity passed through the GST control column (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), but a large portion was retained on the GST-14-3-3ζ affinity column (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The presence of endogenous 14-3-3s in the HeLa cell lysate or dephosphorylation of target proteins may have prevented some 14-3-3-binding proteins binding to the 14-3-3 column (lanes 3 and 4). The 14-3-3-binding proteins remained bound to the 14-3-3 column during the high salt wash (lanes 7 and 8) and were eluted by the 14-3-3 binding R18/11 peptide (lanes 9 and 12). In contrast, few proteins were eluted from the GST control column by the peptide (lanes 15 and 16). Binding of proteins to GST-14-3-3 was phosphorylation-dependent, because phosphatase treatment eliminated binding (lanes 11 and 14). Protein yields at various stages of the purification are shown in Fig. 2A. Proteins eluted from each of the columns were concentrated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized with colloidal Coomassie stain (Fig. 2C). Differences were readily apparent between the mitotic (lane 1) and interphase (lane 2) column eluates. The eluted protein pools should contain proteins that bind to 14-3-3s directly but may also include proteins that bind to the column due to their association with 14-3-3 binding proteins. Proteins were excised from the gel and pooled according to the apparent molecular mass and abundance of each band. The apparent molecular mass of many, but not all of the excised bands corresponded to bands that were observed in 14-3-3 Far Western blots (not shown). Proteins were extracted from the gel and trypsinized, and peptides were identified by microcapillary HPLC tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Identification of Interphase and Mitotic 14-3-3-binding Proteins—In total, 209 proteins were identified in the mitotic 14-3-3-binding pool, and 184 were identified from the interphase pool (Table I and Supplemental Table I). Of these, 89 were identified in both the interphase and mitotic samples. Identified 14-3-3-interacting proteins included proteins involved in cell signaling, metabolic pathways, protein synthesis, antioxidant and stress responses, cytoskeletal dynamics, RNA binding, DNA binding and chromatin structure, vesicle trafficking, protein folding, ubiquitination and proteolysis, nucleolar function, nuclear transport, transcription, and cell cycle regulation. Many peptides obtained corresponded to proteins that are present in the databases only as EST sequences, with unknown function. Uncharacterized proteins have been listed by provisional name and accession number only. Such proteins were assigned a functional group in Table I if a function could be inferred from sequence homology with characterized proteins, from homology with functional protein domains, or from the circumstances under which EST sequences were isolated.Table ISelected 14-3-3 interactorsFunctionMitosisInterphaseCell divisionNuMAaA 14-3-3 interactor, also published by Pozuelo Rubio et al.

https://openalex.org/W2065458269,"The widespread β-thymosin/WH2 actin binding domain has versatile regulatory properties in actin dynamics and motility. β-thymosins (isolated WH2 domain) maintain monomeric actin in a “sequestered” nonpolymerizable form. In contrast, when repeated in tandem or inserted in modular proteins, the β-thymosin/WH2 domain promotes actin assembly at filament barbed ends, like profilin. The structural basis for these opposite functions is addressed using ciboulot, a three β-thymosin repeat protein. Only the first repeat binds actin and possesses the function of ciboulot. The region that shows the strongest interaction with actin is an amphipathic N-terminal α helix, present in all β-thymosin/WH2 domains, which recognizes the ATP bound actin structure and uses the shear motion of actin linked to ATP hydrolysis to control polymerization. Crystallographic (1H, 15N), NMR, and mutagenetic data reveal that the weaker interaction of the C-terminal region of β-thymosin/WH2 domain with actin accounts for the switch in function from inhibition to promotion of actin assembly."

An isomer of ouabain (EO) circulates in mammalians at subnanomolar concentrations, and increased levels are associated with cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. We present here a study of cardiac and renal hypertrophy induced by ouabain infused into rats for prolonged periods and relate this effect to the recently described ouabain-induced activation of the Src-EGFr-ERK signaling pathway. Ouabain infusion into rats (15 μg/kg/day for 18 weeks) doubled plasma ouabain levels from 0.3 to 0.7 nm and increased blood pressure by 20 mm Hg (p < 0.001), cardiac left ventricle (+11%, p < 0.05), and kidney weight (+9%, p < 0.01). These effects in vivo are associated with a significant enrichment of α1, β1, γa Na-K ATPase subunits together with Src and EGFr in isolated renal caveolae membranes and activation of ERK1/2. In caveolae, direct Na-K ATPase/Src interactions can be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. The interaction is amplified by ouabain, at a high affinity binding site, detectable in caveolae but not in total rat renal membranes. The high affinity site for ouabain is associated with Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of rat α1 Na-K ATPase. The antihypertensive compound, PST 2238, antagonized all ouabain-induced effects at 10 μg/kg/day in vivo or 10-10-10-8min vitro. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the in vivo pro-hypertrophic and hypertensinogenic activity of ouabain, or by analogy those of EO in humans.

They also explain the pharmacological basis for PST 2238 treatment. Until recently, the main, if not unique, function ascribed to the integral membrane protein Na-K ATPase is the maintenance and regulation of the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane in all tissues (1Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ouabain and other steroidal cardenolides (2Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) or bufadienolides (3Bagrov A.Y. Dmitrieva R.I. Fedorova O. Kazakov G. Roukoyatkina N. Shpen V. Am. J. Hypertension. 1996; 9: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are considered to be the specific inhibitors of the Na-K ATPase activity. However, in recent years, several studies have indicated that Na-K ATPase can also act as a signal transducer in response to the interaction with its natural ligand ouabain (4Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This finding originates mainly from studies carried out on cultured rat cardiomyocytes or renal tubular cells based on effects on cell growth and hypertrophy of ouabain in the micromolar range. At these rather high concentrations, which, however, do not seem to affect the bulk intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations (5Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been shown that even subnanomolar ouabain concentrations stimulate growth of cultured rat tubular cells, via activation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway and, surprisingly, in view of the fact that these rat cells contain only the α1 isoform of Na-K ATPase, ouabain inhibits a component of active 86Rb uptake with a high affinity (9Dmitrieva R.I.

Mezzetti A. Am. J. Hypertension. 2001; 14: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hypertensinogenic activity of low ouabain concentrations might also be ascribed to a specific vasotonic effect as demonstrated in rodent vessels (17Blaustein M.P. Juhaszova M.

However, a direct demonstration that the ouabain/Na-K ATPase signaling effects are also relevant to the cardiovascular effects of EO in vivo is still lacking and the following questions have to be elucidated, at least in the experimental rat model. 1) Do in vivo variations of rat plasma ouabain, within the subnanomolar concentrations range, produce cardiac and renal hypertrophy and activate an ERK-dependent transduction pathway mediated by the interaction of α1 Na-K ATPase with signaling proteins in defined membrane microdomains, such as caveolae? 2) Is it possible to reproduce in vitro the in vivo signaling effects by demonstrating that subnanomolar concentrations of ouabain trigger interactions among Na-K ATPase, Src, and EGFr? The new ouabain-antagonist, PST 2238 (19Quadri L. Bianchi G. Cerri A. Fedrizzi G. Ferrari P. Gobbini M. Melloni P. Sputore S. Torri M. J. Med.

We have demonstrated previously that PST 2238 selectively binds to Na-K ATPase and not to other general or hormonal receptors (20Ferrari P. Torielli L. Ferrandi M. Padoani G. Duzzi L. Florio M.

This pharmacological tool has now been used to substantiate the specificity of the ouabain/Na-K ATPase interaction in caveolae and to provide evidence on its molecular mechanism of action. Materials—Osmotic mini-pumps (Mod. 2002, Mod. 2004, Alzet, Charles River, Calco, Italy). The following chemicals were used: Ouabain (Sigma); Amlodipine besylate (Aapin Chemicals Limited-UK); the ouabain-antagonist PST 2238 (17β-(3-furyl)-5β-androstan-3β,14β,17α-triol) (Fig. 1), a digitoxigenin derivate (Sigma-tau, Pomezia, Rome, Italy) whose synthesis and pharmacological characteristics are described elsewhere (19Quadri L.

[γ-32P]ATP (0.5-3 Ci/mmol, 3000 Ci/mmol) and [3H]ouabain (15 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: anti-caveolin (BD); anti-clathrin (Cymbus, CBL); anti-α1 and anti-β1 Na-K ATPase (UBI); anti-α2 Na-K ATPase (McB2, from K. Sweadner); anti-α3 Na-K ATPase (Biomol); anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Src, GD11 clone (UBI); Src-Tyr418 and Src-Tyr529 (BIOSOURCE); ERK and dual-phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK (Cell Signaling); anti-γa/γb Na-K ATPase (C33), anti-γa, and anti-γb Na-K ATPase (from S.

In Vivo Studies—All procedures were in accordance with Institutional Guidelines for animal care. Three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, IN), weighing 100-110 g, were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic mini-pumps, releasing either 15 μg/kg/day of ouabain (OS rats, n = 20) for 18 weeks or sterile saline (CS rats, n = 10) (20Ferrari P. Torielli L. Ferrandi M. Padoani G. Duzzi L. Florio M. Conti F. Melloni P. Vesci L. Corsico N. Bianchi G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 83-94PubMed Google Scholar). At the 6th week of ouabain infusion, OS rats were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 10 each): the first (OS-treated) received PST 2238 orally at 10 μg/kg/day, suspended in 0.5% w/v Methocel, and the second group (OS controls) only vehicle. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured weekly in conscious rats by tail-cuff plethysmography (BP recorder, U. Basile, Italy). At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected and plasma separated by centrifugation. Heart and kidney were excised and weights normalized for tibia length. Plasma and Tissue Ouabain Determination—Ouabain was extracted from plasma, left ventricle free-wall (LVFW), and kidney and measured by a radioimmunoassay, as described (11Ferrandi M. Manunta P. Balzan S. Hamlyn J.M. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rat Kidney Caveolae Preparation and ERK1/2 Measurement—Rat kidneys were homogenized in: (mm) 200 sodium carbonate, pH 11, 2 sodium orthovanadate, 100 mg/liter Pefabloc and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The cytosol was utilized for total and dual-phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK1/2 quantification by Western blotting. The pellet was used for caveolae isolation following a detergent-free method and fractionation on a 5-45% sucrose gradient (21Song K.S. Shengwen L. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Nineteen fractions were automatically collected and protein content determined (Pierce). The distribution along the gradient of the plasma membrane, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum was established by measuring alkaline phosphatase, α-mannosidase II, and α-glucosidase II activity, respectively (22van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Na-K ATPase Activity Assay—Na-K ATPase activity was measured by [32P]ATP hydrolysis method (23Ferrandi M. Tripodi G. Salardi S. Florio M. Modica R. Barassi P. Parenti P. Shainskaja A. Karlish S. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in sucrose fractions washed in: (mm) 250 sucrose, 30 histidine, pH 7.2, and in purified Na-K ATPase obtained from rat kidney medulla, as described (24Jorgensen P.L. Kidney Int. 1986; 29: 10-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of Src on Na-K ATPase activity, recombinant Src kinase, or its medium, was incubated with purified rat renal α1 Na-K ATPase (protein ratio 1:50) for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing: (mm) 150 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 3 ATP, and 70 Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with 3 mm MnCl2. The effect of increasing concentrations of ouabain was evaluated. Na-K ATPase activity was measured as above (23Ferrandi M. Tripodi G. Salardi S. Florio M. Modica R. Barassi P. Parenti P. Shainskaja A. Karlish S. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). [3H[Ouabain Binding and Scatchard Analysis—Washed renal caveolae were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with increasing concentrations of [3H]ouabain in a medium containing 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphoric acid, pH 7.4. Concentrations of labeled ouabain higher than 10-6m were obtained by isotopic dilution with cold ouabain. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 mm ouabain. The separation of bound from free-labeled ouabain was achieved by a rapid filtration method on Whatman GF/F filters, which were washed three times and counted for radioactivity. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Washed renal caveolae were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of ouabain in: (mm) 10 Tris, 10 MgCl2, 5 MnCl2, 0.25 EGTA, 0.025 sodium orthovanadate, 80 NaCl, 2 ATP, 100 mg/liter Pefabloc, pH 7.4. When specified, PST 2238 or amlodipine were added. The samples were incubated with 0.2% CHAPS for 15 min at 4 °C and then with anti-Src antibody (GD11 clone), conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 4 h. A sample of caveolae, incubated with a non-immune IgG (Sigma), instead of the anti-Src antibody, was used as control. The immunocomplexes were precipitated, washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer containing CHAPS, and boiled with Laemmli sample buffer. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting and probed with specific antibodies. In Vitro Src Phosphorylation of Na-K ATPase—Na-K ATPase phosphorylation by Src was measured in vitro by 32Pi incorporation method (A) and Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) (B). Method A: 3 μg of purified rat renal α1 Na-K ATPase were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the absence, or presence of 50 ng of recombinant Src protein kinase in a medium containing: (mm) 10 Tris, pH 7.4, 10 MgCl2, 5 MnCl2, 0.25 EGTA, 0.025 sodium orthovanadate, 80 NaCl, 0.1 ATP, and [32P]ATP (1500 cpm/nmol, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Method B: Na-K ATPase was incubated with Src kinase, as in method A, in a medium supplemented with 2 mm cold ATP in the absence of [32P]ATP. When specified, before the addition of Na-K ATPase, Src kinase was preincubated with its specific inhibitor, PP2 (5 μm), for 30 min at 4 °C or with a specific Src substrate peptide (500 μm), instead of Na-K ATPase. The effect of 10-10-10-8m ouabain was tested. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting and probed with specific antibodies to verify the tyrosine phosphorylation of Na-K ATPase (PY99) and Src kinase (Src-Tyr418 and Src-Tyr529). Western Blotting—Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7-15% acrylamide in glycine or 12% acrylamide in Tricine gels), blotted and overnight incubated at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies, followed by 1 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and chemiluminescent reaction (Lumi-Glo reagent, Cell Signaling). Autoradiography was performed, bands were scanned with Bio-Rad GS710 densitometer and quantified by Bio-Rad Quantity One Software. Blots were stripped (Re-Blot plus, Chemicon) and reprobed no more than three times. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. The difference among groups was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's least squares difference test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ouabain dose-response curves and Scatchard plots were analyzed by a nonlinear regression program (GraphPad Prism Software, version 3). Ouabain Effects on Blood Pressure and Organ Weight—Ouabain infusion doubled plasma ouabain concentration in OS (0.7 ± 0.07 nm, n = 10, p < 0.001) as compared with CS rats (0.3 ± 0.04 nm, n = 10), reaching a value close to that of plasma EO found in hypertensive patients with cardiac hypertrophy (15Manunta P.

Ferrandi M. Hamlyn J.M. Lapenna D. Cuccurullo F. Mezzetti A. Am. J. Hypertension. 2001; 14: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in hypertensive rat models (11Ferrandi M. Manunta P. Balzan S. Hamlyn J.M. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tissue ouabain content (ng/g tissue) was increased 3-fold in OS LVFW (0.96 ± 0.091, n = 10, p < 0.01) and kidney (10.9 ± 1.4, n = 10, p < 0.01) as compared with CS (LVFW: 0.31 ± 0.033, n = 10; kidney: 3.93 ± 0.3, n = 10). Before starting with ouabain infusion, all rats had a similar SBP (130-135 mmHg). After 18 weeks, SBP was significantly increased in OS as compared with CS controls (+20 mmHg, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). The oral treatment with PST 2238 (10 μg/kg/day) significantly reduced SBP in OS rats (-20 mmHg, n = 10, p < 0.001 versus OS, Fig. 2A) within 3 weeks. Neither ouabain nor PST 2238 affected HR (beats/min: CS, 360 ± 8.3; OS, 381 ± 9.5; OS + PST 2238: 358 ± 9) and body weight (g, CS, 459 ± 7; OS, 466 ± 8; OS + PST 2238: 456 ± 6). Ouabain infusion increased cardiac LVFW (+11%, p < 0.05) and kidney weight (+9%, p < 0.01) in OS rats as compared with CS controls (Fig. 2, B and C). PST 2238 treatment prevented the ouabain-induced cardiac and kidney hypertrophy (Fig. 2, B and C). The Ca2+ antagonist amlodipine (oral dose 5 mg/kg/day), taken as an antihypertensive reference compound, significantly reduced SBP in OS rats (-20 mmHg, p < 0.01) but did not affect cardiac and kidney weight (data not shown). These data indicate that in vivo variations of ouabain concentrations within the subnanomolar range, similar to those reported for EO in humans, cause organ hypertrophy in rats besides raising blood pressure. The demonstration that amlodipine prevents the ouabain-induced increase of blood pressure without affecting in vivo organ hypertrophy excludes that the prohypertrophic effect of ouabain might be secondary to pressure overload. Expression of Na-K ATPase and Signaling Molecules in Total Renal Membranes and Caveolae—Preliminary Western blotting analysis of Na-K ATPase, EGFr, and Src in total renal membranes (MT) from CS, OS, and PST 2238-treated OS rats (n = 6) indicated that ouabain infusion significantly increased β1 Na-K ATPase subunit (+16%, p < 0.01) paralleled by an increase, although not statistically significant, of the α1 Na-K ATPase subunit (+11%), EGFr (+14%), and Src (+10%) compared with CS. In the PST 2238-treated OS rats all these differences disappeared. In order to investigate the possibility that the ouabain-induced effects on the protein expression observed in MT are amplified in restricted membrane subdomains, we isolated and characterized renal caveolae from CS, OS, PST 2238-treated OS rats. A typical protein distribution of the renal membranes fractionated on the sucrose density gradient is depicted in Fig. 3. The low density fractions (Fig. 3A, fractions 5-8, containing 5% of the total proteins) contained the specific markers of caveolae (25Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 26Shaul P. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 276: L843-L851Google Scholar), such as caveolin 1, EGFr, and Src, which were enriched 30-, 40-, and 22-fold, respectively, compared with renal MT (Fig. 3B) and were therefore referred to as caveolae. Interestingly, caveolae were enriched 4-fold in α1, β1, and the γa splice variant of the Na-K ATPase subunits as compared with MT (Fig. 3B). The γb variant was not detected. The absence of clathrin, the marker for coated pits (Fig. 3B), excludes contamination by these vesicles. Mannosidase and glucosidase activities were also absent (not shown) in caveolae, thus excluding possible Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum membrane contaminations. The high buoyant density fractions 11-15 (Fig. 3A), positive for all these markers, including clathrin and γa and γb splice variants of Na-K ATPase (not shown), were referred to as plasma membrane. Effect of Ouabain on the Expression of Na-K ATPase and Signaling Molecules in Renal Caveolae—A representative immunoblotting of the Na-K ATPase subunits and signaling molecules in caveolae isolated from one CS, OS, and PST 2238-treated OS rat is shown in Fig. 4A. The densitometric analysis performed on caveolae from six rats for each group, expressed as percent increase over CS, is shown in Fig. 4B and C. Caveolin 1 content was similar in the three groups of rats. Ouabain significantly increased the recruitment of EGFr, Src, and phosphorylated Src at Tyr418, the Src active form (26Shaul P. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 276: L843-L851Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B) in the OS group. The phospho/non-phospho Src ratio resulted 45% increased in OS over CS control rats (p < 0.01). Moreover, the content of the Na-K ATPase subunits was significantly increased in OS caveolae as compared with CS controls (Fig. 4C). PST 2238 largely reverted all the ouabain-induced effects in caveolae of OS rats (Fig. 4). It reduced the ouabain-induced targeting into caveolae of EGFr, Src, Src-Tyr418 (Fig. 4, A and B), normalized the phospho/non-phospho Src ratio to the level of CS controls and reduced the Na-K ATPase subunit content, particularly the α and β subunits (Fig. 4C). Effect of Ouabain on ERK1/2 Activation—We further investigated whether the effect of ouabain infusion on Na-K ATPase, Src, EGFr expression into caveolae might result in the activation of the ERK pathway and whether PST 2238 might reverse this effect. Fig. 5 shows the results obtained by probing kidney extracts from CS, OS, and PST 2238-treated OS rats (n = 6) with anti-total and anti-dual phosphorylated ERK1/2 antibodies. Ouabain caused a significant increase of total p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2) levels as compared with CS controls and PST 2238 reverted this effect (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, ouabain induced an increase of dual-phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 versus CS controls that was abolished by PST 2238 (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate, for the first time, that the in vivo variation of circulating ouabain within the subnanomolar concentration range raises the expression levels of defined Na-K ATPase subunits and signaling molecules into caveolae and the concomitant activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Na-K ATPase Activity and Ouabain Affinity in Rat Renal Caveolae—Since previous work indicated that ouabain signaling depends upon its interaction with Na-K ATPase (5Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 6Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we investigated whether rat α1 Na-K ATPase localized in caveolae retains its catalytic activity and affinity for ouabain. This latter aspect is crucial when assessing the physiological relevance of nanomolar concentrations of ouabain in rat kidney where only the ouabain-resistant α1 isoform has been detected (27Lucking K. Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F253-F260PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of renal MT and caveolae, obtained from CS rats (n = 4), was respectively 3.6 and 2.4 μmol of Pi/min/mg protein as compared with 6 μmol of Pi/min/mg protein for a partially purified rat renal α1 Na-K ATPase. The inhibitory ouabain dose-response curves measured in rat renal caveolae showed the presence of a predominant component with low affinity for ouabain (IC50 = 1.3 × 10-4m), close to that of the purified renal Na-K ATPase (Fig. 6A) and MT (not shown). However, only in caveolae, the ouabain dose-response curve was best fitted according to a two-binding site model (nonlinear regression program, GraphPad Prism Software: one-binding site model, R2 = 0.89; two-binding site model, R2 = 0.99, p < 0.0001, F = 84.09) showing a second minor component (around 25%) of Na-K ATPase having a higher affinity for ouabain (IC50 = 1.2 × 10-7m) (Fig. 6A, inset) and activity of 0.6 μmol of Pi/min/mg protein. Ouabain Binding to Na-K ATPase in Rat Renal Caveolae: Effect of PST 2238—The presence of a ouabain high affinity Na-K ATPase component in rat renal caveolae was further investigated by measuring the [3H]ouabain binding in preparations obtained from CS rats. The ouabain dose-response curve (Scatchard plot, Fig. 6B) was analyzed by a nonlinear regression program comparing one (R2 = 0.76) or two classes (R2 = 0.97) of binding sites (GraphPad Prism Software). Data were best fitted by a two-site model (p < 0.0001, F = 27.02) revealing the presence of the predominant ouabain-resistant Na-K ATPase isoform (Ki = 10-5m; Bmax = 260 pmol of ouabain bound/mg of protein) and a minor component with higher affinity for ouabain (Ki = 2 × 10-7m;"
https://openalex.org/W2168158378,"Many proteins of the secretory pathway contain disulfide bonds that are essential for structure and function. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ero1 alpha and Ero1 beta oxidize protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which in turn transfers oxidative equivalents to newly synthesized cargo proteins. However, oxidation must be limited, as some reduced PDI is necessary for disulfide isomerization and ER-associated degradation. Here we show that in semipermeable cells, PDI is more oxidized, disulfide bonds are formed faster, and high molecular mass covalent protein aggregates accumulate in the absence of cytosol. Addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) reduces PDI and restores normal disulfide formation rates. A higher GSH concentration is needed to balance oxidative folding in semipermeable cells overexpressing Ero1 alpha, indicating that cytosolic GSH and lumenal Ero1 alpha play antagonistic roles in controlling the ER redox. Moreover, the overexpression of Ero1 alpha significantly increases the GSH content in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate tight connections between ER and cytosol to guarantee redox exchange across compartments: a reducing cytosol is important to ensure disulfide isomerization in secretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2144942159,"We have examined expression of the genes on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) during growth under the physiologically well defined standard growth condition of Luria-Bertani medium with aeration. We found that the central regulator hilA and the genes under its control are expressed at the onset of stationary phase. Interestingly, the two-component regulatory genes hilC/hilD, sirA/barA, and ompR, which are known to modulate expression from the hilA promoter (hilAp) under so-called “inducing conditions” (Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.3 m NaCl without aeration), acted under standard conditions at the stationary phase induction level. The induction of hilAp depended not on RpoS, the stationary phase sigma factor, but on the stringent signal molecule ppGpp. In the ppGpp null mutant background, hilAp showed absolutely no activity. The stationary phase induction of hilAp required spoT but not relA. Consistent with this requirement, hilAp was also induced by carbon source deprivation, which is known to transiently elevate ppGpp mediated by spoT function. The observation that amino acid starvation elicited by the addition of serine hydroxamate did not induce hilAp in a RelA+ SpoT+ strain suggested that, in addition to ppGpp, some other alteration accompanying entry into the stationary phase might be necessary for induction. It is speculated that during the course of infection Salmonella encounters various stressful environments that are sensed and translated to the intracellular signal, ppGpp, which allows expression of Salmonella virulence genes, including SPI1 genes.

Infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can cause a systemic, typhoid-like disease in mice. Following ingestion, bacteria can colonize the intestinal tract, penetrate the intestinal epithelium, and access systemic sites such as the spleen and liver through lymphatic and blood circulation (1Carter P.B. Collins F.M. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 139: 1189-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Passage of the bacteria through the intestinal lining is initiated by bacterial invasion into enterocytes and M cells (1Carter P.B. Collins F.M. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 139: 1189-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Hohmann A.W. Schmidt G. Rowley D. Infect. Immun. 1978; 22: 763-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jones B.D. Ghori N. Falkow S.

The invasion is mediated by a bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; α-MG, α-methyl glucoside; LB, Luria-Bertani; SerHX, serine hydroxamate; SPI1, Salmonella pathogenicity island 1; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; α-MG, α-methyl glucoside; LB, Luria-Bertani; SerHX, serine hydroxamate; SPI1, Salmonella pathogenicity island 1; WT, wild type. encoded by genes on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) (5Mills D.M. Bajaj V. Lee C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The TTSS translocates bacterial effector proteins, also encoded on a SPI, into the host cell cytosol to reorganize the cytoskeleton, resulting in membrane ruffling and eventual bacterial uptake (6Galan J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 53-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Expression of the SPI1 secretion system and its secreted effectors is coordinately regulated by HilA encoded on SPI1, a member of the OmpR/ToxR family of transcriptional regulators (7Lucas R.L. Lee C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The genes on SPI1 regulated by HilA include invF and sicA (8Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4949-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1850-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). InvF, a member of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators, in conjunction with SicA, a TTSS chaperone, takes part in the coordinated regulation of SPI1-encoded genes. Regulation of hilA expression has been studied extensively because of its central role in invasion gene activation. Environmental signals such as oxygen concentration, osmolarity, and the growth state of bacteria have been shown to influence the expression of hilA and the secretion of invasion-associated proteins (11Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Bajaj V. Lucas R.L. Hwang C. Lee C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, most studies have been carried out using bacteria grown under so-called inducing conditions, namely high osmolarity and low oxygen conditions (LB containing 0.3 m NaCl without aeration). Studies of bacteria grown under these conditions have, to date, revealed that hilA expression is regulated by a complex array of regulatory systems including hilC/sirC/sprA (13Eichelberg K.

Members of the phosphorylated response regulator superfamily involved in hilA expression include sirA/barA, envZ/ompR, phoR/phoB, and phoP/phoQ (7Lucas R.L. Lee C.A. Mol.

A. 1996; 93: 4197-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, none of these regulatory systems has been shown to directly relay environmental signals to hilA expression. Enteric bacteria elicit stringent control of ribosome production during the transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase (25Sands M.K. Roberts R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1952; 63: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stent G.S. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 2005-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The effector molecule of the stringent control modulation is the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate ppGpp (27Cashel M. Gallant J. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 34: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B.

The ppGpp is synthesized by two synthetases, PSI and PSII, which are encoded by the relA and spoT genes, respectively. These two enzymes respond differently to environmental conditions. PSI is activated during amino acid starvation but is largely inactive during exponential growth; in contrast, PSII is mostly inactive during amino acid starvation but is active during exponential growth to determine basal levels and to respond to certain environmental stress factors, including deprivation of carbon or energy (29Cashel M.

Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Accumulation of ppGpp during the exponential phase of growth results in the reduction of stable RNA synthesis and the activation of certain types of mRNA synthesis. In this study, we examined expression of SPI1 genes, including hilA under physiologically well defined standard growth conditions (LB with vigorous aeration), and observed that these genes were induced at the onset of the stationary phase. This stationary phase induction was, however, not dependent on the stationary phase-specific sigma factor σ38 but on the stringent signal molecule ppGpp. Most interestingly, we found that the stationary phase hilAp induction depended not on RelA but on SpoT function. This suggests an unusual inducing role of the SpoT protein distinct from its ability to produce the stringent signal molecule ppGpp. We conclude that Salmonella virulence genes, including SPI1 genes, are expressed under stressed conditions in a ppGpp-dependent manner. Strains and Plasmids—The Salmonella strains, which were derived from 14028s, and the plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. All bacterial strains were constructed by P22HT int transduction as described previously (35Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics: A Manual for Genetic Engineering, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). The hilC::kan strain was constructed following the method developed by Datsenko and Wanner (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). The hilC carrying kan in the place of its open reading frame was generated by PCR amplification using the following pair of 60-nucleotide primers that included 40-nucleotide homology extensions and 20-nucleotide priming sequences with pKD13 as a template: 5′-TTCAATGAATAAATCAGTTGAGGCCATTAGCAATAATCACGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′ (5′ primer); and 5′-CTAATCCATTTATTAATGGAAATTTGTTCGGCTGTTGAAGATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC-3′ (3′ primer).

The electrocompetent cells were grown in LB broth with ampicillin and l-arabinose (1 mm) at 30 °C to an A600 of ≈0.5. The mutants were confirmed by PCR using the original and common test primers 5′-CAGTCATAGCCGAATAGCCT-3′ (k1) and 5′-CGGCCACAGTCGATGAATCC-3′ (kt) for kan. Growth Conditions—Except when indicated otherwise, cultures were grown in LB medium (Difco Laboratories) containing 1% NaCl with vigorous aeration at 37 °C. For solid support medium, 1.5% granulated agar (Difco Laboratories) was included. MacConkey lactose, nutrient broth, and brain heart infusion media were purchased from Difco Laboratories. Antibiotics were from Sigma. When present, the following antibiotics were added at the given concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 15 μg/ml; and tetracycline, 15 μg/ml. X-gal (Sigma) was used at 20 μg/ml. The carbon source starvation experiment was carried out in LB plus 0.1% glucose with α-methyl glucoside (α-MG; Sigma). Amino acid starvation experiment was carried out as described in Shand et al. (37Shand R.F. Blum P.H. Mueller R.D. Riggs D.L. Artz S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 737-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using dl-serine hydroxamate (SerHX; Sigma) in nutrient broth supplemented with serine (0.75 mm). Analysis of Culture Supernatant—Cultures were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB broth with antibiotics and vigorous aeration and then harvested. Bacteria were pelleted at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were immediately transferred to clean tubes. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size syringe filter (Sartorius), and proteins were precipitated with cold trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. The proteins were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of cold acetone. These mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 rpm at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 1× PBS. The protein sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples, which were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Proteins were visualized with silver stain (38Hong K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Miller (39Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) using cells permeabilized with Koch's lysis solution (40Putnam S.L. Koch A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase-specific activity was expressed as Miller units (A420/min/A600/ml × 1000). To measure β-galactosidase levels in bacteria at different stages of growth, fresh overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into LB or the medium condition described in the text and grown at 37 °C until the cultures reached the stationary phase. Samples were taken for enzyme assay at regular time intervals. Each strain was assayed in triplicate, and average enzyme activities were plotted as a function of time. Primer Extension Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from Salmonella grown statically using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). To study hilA and hisG transcriptions, the primers with 5′-TAATAATATTGTTATAACTAACTGTGATTA-3′, which is complementary to positions 134–114 of the transcription start site of hilA, and 5′-ACTGGAAGATCTGAATGTCTTCCAGCACAC-3′, which is complementary to positions 124–95 of the transcription start site of hisG, were used. 32P-labeled primers (50,000 cpm) were co-precipitated with 30 μg of total RNA. Primer extension reactions were performed as described by Shin et al. (41Shin D. Lim S. Seok Y.J. Ryu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25871-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Invasion Assay—The assays were performed essentially as described previously (42Lee C.A. Jones B.D. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Monolayers for bacterial invasion were prepared by seeding 5 × 105 HEp-2 cells into each well of 24-well plates. The HEp-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's modified (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Salmonellae prepared as described in the text were added to HEp-2 cells at a ratio of 10:1, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 30 min. Infected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing gentamicin (5 mg/ml; Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 60 min. Intracellular bacteria were harvested by extraction with lysis buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4), and replica was plated for colony counting on brain heart infusion agar plates. Growth Phase-dependent Invasiveness of Bacteria Grown under Standard Conditions—The ability of Salmonellae to invade cultured nonphagocytic cells has been correlated with the expression of SPI1-encoded genes (43Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to investigate the regulation of invasion genes under a physiologically well defined standard growth conditions, we determined the invasiveness of bacteria grown under standard conditions (LB with aeration). In this experiment, an overnight culture of bacteria grown in LB was diluted 40-fold in the same media or a high salt media (LB plus 0.3 m NaCl) and grown with or without aeration, respectively. The high salt media without aeration was considered the “inducing condition” for the expression of SPI1 genes (11Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Bajaj V. Lucas R.L. Hwang C. Lee C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows Salmonellae growth under the two conditions. Under the standard condition, bacteria grew rapidly and reached the stationary phase in ∼4 h. Under the inducing condition, the culture entered into the stationary phase at a much lower A600, <1 A600. Bacteria were sampled from the middle of the exponential phase (∼2 h) and from the early (∼4 h) and late (∼12 h) stationary phases grown under the two conditions, and the invasiveness of each growth phase culture was determined using HEp-2 cells. In this experiment, the number of bacteria from various growth phases was adjusted to a multiplicity of infection of 10 (bacteria, 5 × 106; host cells, 5 × 105). Fig. 1B shows the actual number of intracellular bacteria that survived gentamicin treatment (10 μg/ml) and were recovered from the host cells following a 1-h incubation of bacteria and host cells. When grown under the standard condition (Fig. 1B, filled bars), the early stationary phase bacteria were found to be ∼10–20-fold more invasive than the exponential phase and late stationary phase bacteria. By contrast, the invasiveness of bacteria grown under the inducing condition showed a different pattern; the early stationary phase culture was ∼3-fold more invasive than the exponential phase culture but slightly less invasive than the late stationary culture (Fig. 1B, open bars). The maximum invasion was obtained with the early stationary culture grown under the standard condition. It was thought that the loss of invasiveness with the late stationary culture grown under the standard condition was due to the destruction of TTSS by continuous agitation of the culture. Thus, although the inducing condition might closely represent the intestinal milieu (11Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Bajaj V. Lucas R.L. Hwang C. Lee C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), bacteria grown under the standard condition were used in the subsequent experiments to identify the factor(s) conferring the maximum invasiveness at the early stationary phase. Next, we determined the presence of secreted effector proteins encoded within SPI1 (38Hong K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the cultures at different times grown under the standard condition (see Fig. 1C). Total supernatants of cultures at different phases were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1C). The volume of the supernatant was proportionally adjusted to the number of bacteria at each growth phase. The secreted effector proteins, namely SipA (89 kDa), SipB (67 kDa), SigD (62 kDa), and SipC (42 kDa), were detected only in the supernatant of cultures entering the stationary phase (4 h) and thereafter (6 h). Thus, Salmonellae at the entry of the stationary phase were most invasive because SPI1-encoded genes, including those constituting the TTSS apparatus and effector proteins, were expressed exclusively at this growth phase under the standard condition (see below). Growth Phase-dependent Expression from the Promoters in SPI1—We analyzed the activity of the promoters driving expression of the genes involved in Salmonella invasion of host cells encoded on SPI1, namely the hilA, invF, and sicA promoters (abbreviated hilAp, invFp, and sicAp, respectively), during growth under the standard condition. To determine activity of these promoters, Salmonella typhimurium strains carrying lacZY genes transcriptionally fused to individual promoters on the chromosome (SMR2063; Fig. 2A) or a plasmid in the 14028s strain background (Fig. 3) were used. Bacteria were taken at regular time intervals, and β-galactosidase activity representing the activity of each promoter during the course of growth was determined. Fig. 2 shows the hilAp activity determined under the standard and inducing growth conditions. Under the inducing condition, hilAp activity was about the same throughout the exponential and stationary phases. By contrast, hilAp activity under the standard growth condition was induced ∼30-fold when the culture entered the stationary phase. hilAp activity under the standard condition was ∼10-fold less during the exponential phase but ∼3.5-fold more at the entry of the stationary phase as compared with the activities under the inducing condition. Thus, this result accounts for the different invasiveness of the cultures grown under the two conditions; the central regulator hilAp is selectively expressed at the onset of the stationary phase under the standard condition but is maintained at more or less the same level irrespective of the growth phase under the inducing condition. To further verify the hilAp induction under the standard growth condition, the hilAp specific transcript was monitored during the course of growth by the primer extension assay (Fig. 2B). The hilAp-specific RNA was detected at 3 h as culture entered the stationary phase, peaked at 5 h, and disappeared at 7 h.Fig. 3Expression from hilAp (pMS009) (A), sicAp (pMS011) (B), and invFp (pMS010) (C) on the transcription fusion plasmid pRS415 during Salmonella growth under the standard growth condition. The curves with open symbols represent growth (A600), and the curves with closed symbols represent the activity of each promoter activity as determined by the β-galactosidase assay (Miller units).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Subsequently, invF and sicA as well as hilA promoters on the pRS415 plasmid (44Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene. 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) were determined during growth under the standard condition (Fig. 3). The episomal hilAp activity (Fig. 3A) showed a similar pattern of induction at the onset of the stationary phase, but the magnitude of induction was significantly reduced to ∼4-fold. The reduction was ascribed to the huge increase in the basal level activity at the exponential phase, as if a repressor acting at the exponential phase was titrated out by the episomal hilAp DNA. The invFp and sicAp activities were determined using the strain carrying the individual promoters fused to lacZYA on the pRS415. Both invFp (Fig. 3C) and sicAp (Fig. 3B) were increased >50-fold as the culture entered the stationary phase. The extension in the activation of downstream activators invF and sicA, as compared with that of the upstream activator hilA, might represent a magnification of the physiological response in cascade regulation. Taken together, these results clearly establish that the early stationary phase bacteria grown under the standard condition are the most invasive because of the selective expression of the central activator, hilA, and the consequent expression of the downstream activators invF and sicA under its control.

https://openalex.org/W2115103369,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons. In mammalian cells, a termination codon is ordinarily recognized as “premature” if it is located greater than 50–54 nucleotides 5′ to the final exon-exon junction. We have described a set of naturally occurring human β-globin gene mutations that apparently contradict this rule. The corresponding β-thalassemia genes contain nonsense mutations within exon 1, and yet their encoded mRNAs accumulate to levels approaching wild-type β-globin (βWT) mRNA. In the present report we demonstrate that the stabilities of these mRNAs with nonsense mutations in exon 1 are intermediate between βWT mRNA and β-globin mRNA carrying a prototype NMD-sensitive mutation in exon 2 (codon 39 nonsense; β39). Functional analyses of these mRNAs with 5′-proximal nonsense mutations demonstrate that their relative resistance to NMD does not reflect abnormal RNA splicing or translation re-initiation and is independent of promoter identity and erythroid specificity. Instead, the proximity of the nonsense codon to the translation initiation AUG constitutes a major determinant of NMD. Positioning a termination mutation at the 5′ terminus of the coding region blunts mRNA destabilization, and this effect is dominant to the “50–54 nt boundary rule.” These observations impact on current models of NMD.

Lykke-Andersen J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Google Scholar). Nonsense-containing mRNAs targeted by NMD can be generated by naturally occurring frameshift and nonsense mutations, splicing errors, leaky 40 S scanning, and utilization of minor AUG initiation sites (2Maquat L.E. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 453-465Google Scholar, 3Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 401-410Google Scholar). A major function of the NMD pathway is to block the synthesis of truncated proteins that could have dominant negative effects on cell function (2Maquat L.E. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 453-465Google Scholar, 4Maquat L.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 89-99Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that the NMD pathway in mammalian cells is linked to splicing-dependent deposition of a protein complex 20–24 nucleotides (nt) 5′ of each exon-exon junction (exon-junction complex; EJC). The EJC contains the general splicing activator RNPS1, the RNA export factor Aly/REF, the shuttling protein Y14, the nuclear matrix-localized serine-arginine-containing protein SRm160, the oncoprotein DEK, and the Y14 binding protein magoh. The interaction of magoh with Y14 may have a role in cytoplasmic localization of mRNAs and in anchoring the NMD-specific factors Upf3 and Upf2 to the mRNA (5Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Nickerson J.A.

Previous published data have shown that Upf3 and Upf2 join the EJC in different subcellular compartments: Upf3 (Upf3a and Upf3b) is loaded onto mRNAs in the nucleus during splicing via interactions with components of the EJC. In contrast, Upf2 joins the complex soon after cytoplasmic export is initiated (14Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4987-4997Google Scholar, 19Lykke-Andersen J.

According to the present models, translating ribosomes displace EJCs from the open reading frame (ORF) during the “pioneer” round of cytoplasmic translation (21Ishigaki Y. Li X. Serin G. Maquat L.E. Cell. 2001; 106: 607-617Google Scholar). If, however, the mRNA contains a premature termination codon located more than 50–54 nt 5′ of at least one EJC, complex components 3′ to the termination mutation will remain on the mRNA. The retention of one or more EJCs on the mRNA triggers the NMD response by an as yet undefined mechanism. According to current models, recognition of the nonsense codon as “premature” involves a direct interaction of the phosphorylated Upf1 RNA helicase with EJC-bound Upf2 (20Serin G. Gersappe A.

Kulozik A. Hentze M.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 775-783Google Scholar). The interactions of the translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 with Upf1 and of eRF3 with Upf2 and Upf3 appear to provide a mechanistic link between NMD and translation termination at the premature stop codon (reviewed in Refs. 1Wagner E. Lykke-Andersen J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Google Scholar and 27Czaplinski K. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Paushkin S.V. Han X. Weng Y. Perlick H.A. Dietz H.C. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Peltz S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1665-1677Google Scholar).Studies supporting the “50–54 nt boundary rule” suggest that an exon-exon junction serves as the major cis-acting NMD-regulatory element (28Zhang J. Sun X. Qian Y. Maquat L.E. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 801-815Google Scholar, 29Thermann R. Neu-Yilik G. Deters A. Frede U. Wehr K. Hagemeier C. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E.

Although EJC-regulated NMD is supported by multiple lines of evidence, exceptions to the 50–54 nt boundary rule have been reported. These exceptions suggest that additional determinants may be involved in determining the net stability of nonsense-containing mRNAs. For example, nonsense codons positioned close to the initiation AUG of the TPI, immunoglobulin μ heavy chain, and BRCA1 mRNAs, fail to specify NMD (31Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Google Scholar, 32Buzina A. Shulman M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 515-524Google Scholar, 33Perrin-Vidoz L. Sinilnikova O.M. Stoppa-Lyonnet D. Lenoir G.M. Mazoyer S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2805-2814Google Scholar). For the TPI and immunoglobulin μ heavy chain mRNAs, NMD appears to be circumvented by re-initiation of translation 3′ to the nonsense codon. This mechanism of NMD avoidance has also been speculated for nonsense codons located early in the BRCA1 transcript (33Perrin-Vidoz L. Sinilnikova O.M. Stoppa-Lyonnet D. Lenoir G.M. Mazoyer S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2805-2814Google Scholar). Such re-initiation would allow the ribosome to disrupt EJCs located 3′ to the nonsense mutation (31Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Google Scholar, 32Buzina A. Shulman M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 515-524Google Scholar). Nonsense codons in the T-cell receptor-β transcript also fail to elicit canonical NMD; nonsense codons located more 5′ in the mRNA trigger robust NMD, whereas nonsense codons closer to the terminal exon-exon junction induce a much weaker NMD response (34Wang J. Gudikote J.P. Olivas O.R. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 274-279Google Scholar). Finally, premature termination codons located in different exons of the fibrinogen Aα-chain gene or at exon 2 of the human ALG3 gene can avoid NMD (35Asselta R. Duga S. Spena S. Santagostino E. Peyvandi F. Piseddu G. Targhetta R. Malcovati M. Mannucci P.M. Tenchini M.L. Blood. 2001; 98: 3685-3692Google Scholar, 36Denecke J. Kranz C. Kemming D. Koch H.-G. Marquardt T. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 477-486Google Scholar). The basis for NMD avoidance by the fibrinogen Aα-chain and ALG3 mRNAs remains undefined. Thus, present evidence indicates that determinants of NMD, at least in some systems, are more complex than would be predicted on the basis of the single 50–54 nt boundary rule.We have previously reported that human β-globin mRNAs containing naturally occurring nonsense mutations in the 5′-part of exon 1 accumulate to levels similar to those of normal β-globin transcripts (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanism by which these mutant β-globin transcripts circumvent the full impact of NMD. Our results reveal that this unusual NMD behavior reflects the proximity of the nonsense mutations to the AUG initiation codon. Remarkably, the impact of this 5′ localization is dominant to the 50–54 nt boundary rule.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The plasmids containing the normal (βWT), β15 [CD 15 (TGG→ TGA)], or β39 [CD 39 (C→ T)] human β-globin genes were previously described (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). All variants were created within the 428-bp NcoI-BamHI fragment of the β-globin gene template by overlapextension PCR (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed by using Invitrogen primers (Barcelona, Spain; see Table I). To create variants carrying DelA (deletion of 69 bp between codons 3 and 27, exclusively), the PCR reaction 1 was performed by using L5′β-S and DelA-AS primers, and DNA template from the previously cloned βWT gene. PCR reaction 2 was performed by using DelA-S and R5′β-AS primers and the βWT or β39 genes as template. To clone variant βWTseqhet and β39seqhet constructs, which contain a different sequence between codons 3 and 27, from the second exon of the human α2-globin gene (from codon 34 through codon 56), PCR reaction 1 was performed by using Seqhet-S and Seqhet-AS primers, and the hα2-globin gene as the DNA template (pTet-Wt detailed in Ref. 38Ji X. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 899-907Google Scholar). PCR reaction 2 was performed by using 3′ exon1-S and 3′ exon2-AS primers and the βWT or β39 gene DNAs. To obtain β62 and β62DelA variants carrying the nonsense mutation (GCT → TAG) at codon position 62, PCR reaction 1 was performed with ATG-S and 62-AS primers and the previously cloned βWT or DelA gene DNAs. PCR reaction 2 was performed with 62-S and 3′ exon2-AS primers and the βWT gene as DNA template. To clone the double nonsense mutated gene β15nonβ39, carrying both nonsense mutations at codons 15 and 39, PCR reaction 1 was performed by using L5′β-S and 15non39-AS primers and the β39 gene DNA. PCR reaction 2 was performed by using 15non39-S and R5′β-AS primers and the same DNA template. To obtain the constructs βWT-CD55–63/64–73/74, β15-CD55–63/64–73/74, β39-CD55–63/64–73/74, and β39DelA-CD55–63/64–73/74, the three different mutations were introduced sequentially and the βWT-CD55, β15-CD55, β39-CD55, and β39DelA-CD55 genes (βWT, β15, β39, or β39DelA genes carrying a missense mutation that converts Met to Ile (AUG → AUA) at codon 55) were created first. Thus, PCR reaction 1 was performed by using the L5′β-S and 55-AS primers, and the βWT, β15, β39, or β39DelA gene DNAs. PCR reaction 2 was performed by using the 55-S and the R5′β-AS primers and the βWT DNA template. To create the βWT-CD55–73/74, β15-CD55–73/74, β39-CD55–73/74, and β39DelA-CD55–73/74 constructs (corresponding to the βWT-CD55, β15-CD55, β39-CD55, or β39DelA-CD55 human β-globin genes carrying an additional missense mutation that converts the out-of-frame Met to Thr (AUG → ACG) at position 73/74) PCR reaction 1 was performed by using the L5′β-S and 73/74-AS primers, and the βWT-CD55, β15-CD55, β39-CD55, or β39DelA-CD55 genes as DNA template. PCR reaction 2 was performed by using the 73/74-S and the R5′β-AS primers and the βWT DNA template. In all cases, PCR reaction 3 was performed using a mix of PCR reactions 1 and 2 and primers sense from PCR reaction 1 and antisense from PCR reaction 2. The obtained PCR products were digested with NcoI-BamHI and replaced into the plasmid containing the cloned normal human β-globin gene previously digested with the same enzymes. The mutation at position 63/64 (ATG → ACG) was introduced into the genes βWT-CD55–73/74, β15-CD55–73/74, β39-CD55–73/74, and β39DelA-CD55–73/74 by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as indicated by the manufacturers (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Reactions were performed with the 63/64-S and 63/64-AS mutagenic primers and the DNA template from βWT-CD55–73/74, β15-CD55–73/74, β39-CD55–73/74, and β39DelA-CD55–73/74 plasmids. The correct NcoI-BamHI globin gene fragment containing all mutations was employed to substitute the original non-mutated NcoI-BamHI fragment present in the native gene of the p158.2 expression vector (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). To obtain plasmids used to transiently transfect HeLa cells, a human β-globin gene fragment extending from the transcription initiation site to 200 bp 3′ to the polyadenylation site was amplified by PCR from the p158.2 plasmid, using LinkClaI-S and LinkNotI-AS primers (Table I). The 1806-bp ClaI-NotI human β-globin fragment was sub-cloned into pTet2 plasmid, creating the pTet2-βWT plasmid (pTet2 plasmid is derived from pTet-Splice vector (Invitrogen) by deleting a 126-bp fragment upstream of the ClaI site; the deletion was introduced by substituting the native 500-bp XhoI/ClaI fragment by the 374-bp DNA fragment that was amplified using pTet-XhoI1/15-S and pTetClaI351/370-AS primers (Table I)). The human β-globin variants β15, β17, β39, β62, DelA, β39DelA, β62DelA, βWTseqhet, β39seqhet, or β15nonβ39 were cloned into the pTet2-βWT vector previously obtained, by substituting normal NcoI-BamHI fragment for the corresponding mutated fragment, which had been previously cloned into the p158.2 vector (see above). To obtain genes βWT(15: 39) and β15(15:39), which present the original codon 15 at position 39, initially the restriction sites HindIII-ApaI were introduced between codons 14 and 15 into the NcoI-BamHI fragment of the βWT and β15 genes, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as before. Reactions were performed with the following mutagenic primers: WT15:39-S and WT15:39-AS (for βWT) or 15:39-S and 15:39-AS (for β15) (Table I). After to obtain the correct mutagenized βWT and β15 clones, a 60-bp DNA sequence of the ampicillin resistance gene (Ampr; 5′-TACATCGAACTGGATCTCAACAGCGGTAAGATCCTTGAGAGTTTTCGCCCCGAAGAACGT-3′) was introduced in both clones (βWT and β15) between HindIII/ApaI sites. The sequence was previously obtained by PCR using HindIIIAmpr-S and ApaIAmpr-AS primers (Table I), using the pGEM-3 plasmid (Promega) as DNA template. The cloned NcoI-BamHI fragments were transferred to the pTet2-βWT vector by substituting the normal NcoI-BamHI fragment. Because the introduced DNA Ampr spacer contained one splicing donor site with high consensus value (sequence CGGTAAGA), an additional mutagenesis (T → A) was performed to inhibit the alternative splicing. The mutagenesis was carried out in both constructs βWT(15:39) and β15(15:39), with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit using the GA-S and GA-AS oligonucleotides (Table I). The pTet plasmid containing the human α-globin gene (pTet-αwt) used as a control for transient transfection efficiency was previously described (39Kong J. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1125-1134Google Scholar).Table IDNA oligonucleotides used in the current studyPrimeraPrimer designations reflect the corresponding utilization; S means sense and AS means antisense.Sequence (5′ → 3′)Genomic positionCloningL5′ β-STAAGCCAGTGCCAGAAGAGβ 5′ flankingDelA-ASCAACCTGCCCAGGGCCAGGTCCACCATGGTGβ Exon 1DelA-SCACCATGGTGCACCTGGCCCTGGGCAGGTTGβ Exon 1R5′ β-ASTCCCATTCTAAACTGTACCCβ Intron 2Seqhet-SGACCATGGTGCACCTGCTGTCCTTCCCCACCACCbThe underlined sequences anneal to the hα-globin gene.Compound β/αSeqhet-ASTACCAACCTGCCCAGGGCCTTAACCTGGGCAGAGCCbThe underlined sequences anneal to the hα-globin gene.Compound β/α3′ exon1-SGCCCTGGGCAGGTTGGTAβ Exon 1/intron 13′ exon2-ASTCAGGATCCACGTGCAGCβ Exon 2ATG-SGACACCATGGTGACAATGβ 5′UTR/exon 162-ASTTGCCATGCTACTTCACCTTAGGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 262-SCCTAAGGTGAAGTAGTAGCATGGCAAcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 215non39-ASCTTGCCTCACAGGGCAGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 115non39-SCTGCCCTGTGAGGCAAGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 155-ASGGTTGCCTATAACAGCATCcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 255-SGATGCTGTTATAGGCAACCcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 273/74-ASGCCAGGCCGTCACTAAAGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 273/74-SCTTTAGTGACGGCCTGGCcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 263/64-SGGTGAAGGCTCACGGCAAGAAAGTGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 263/64-ASCACTTTCTTGCCGTGAGCCTTCACCcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.β Exon 2LinkClaI-SCCATCGATACATTTGCTTCTGACACAACTGdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.β 5′UTRLinkNotI-ASATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCAGGGATGAATAAGGCATAGGCdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.β 3′ flankingpTetXhoI1/15-SCCCCCTCGAGTTTACCACTdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.pTet-SplicepTetClaI351/370-ASCCATCGATACGGTTCACTAAACGAGCTCdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.pTet-SpliceWT15:39-SGCCGTTACTGCCCTGAAGCTTGGGCCCTGGGGCAAGGTGAACeThe underlined sequences correspond to the HindIII-ApaI restriction sites.β Exon 1WT15:39-ASGTTCACCTTGCCCCAGGGCCCAAGCTTCAGGGCAGTAACGGCeThe underlined sequences correspond to the HindIII-ApaI restriction sites.β Exon 115:39-SGCCGTTACTGCCCTGAAGCTTGGGCCCTGAGGCAAGGTGAACeThe underlined sequences correspond to the HindIII-ApaI restriction sites.β15 Exon 115:39-ASGTTCACCTTGCCTCAGGGCCCAAGCTTCAGGGCAGTAACGGCeThe underlined sequences correspond to the HindIII-ApaI restriction sites.β15 Exon 1HindIIIAmpr-STTTAAGCTTTACATCGAACTGGATCTCAAdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.AmprApaIAmpr-ASAAAGGGCCCACGTTCTTCGGGGCGAAAACdThe underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.AmprGA-SGATCTCAACAGCGGAAAGATCCTTGAGAGcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.Ampr spacerGA-ASCTCTCAAGGATCTTTCCGCTGTTGAGATCcThe underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.Ampr spacerPrimer extension assayHβexon3-ASCACTTTCTGATAGGCAGCCTGCβ Exon 3Hβ3′UTR-ASGAAAGCGAGCTTAGTGATACβ 3′UTRMα-ASCAGCCTTGATGTTGCTMouse α exon 1RT-PCR assayHβ3′RNA-ASGCAATGAAAATAAATGTTTTTTATTAβ 3′UTRHβ5′RNA-SACATTTGCTTCTGACACAACβ 5′UTRHβexon2-STGATGGCCTGGCTCACCTGβ Exon 2Hβ3′ exon2-ASGATCCACGTGCAGCTTGTCAβ Exon 2a Primer designations reflect the corresponding utilization; S means sense and AS means antisense.b The underlined sequences anneal to the hα-globin gene.c The underlined sequences correspond to the introduced mutation.d The underlined sequences correspond to the restriction site indicated in the primer designation.e The underlined sequences correspond to the HindIII-ApaI restriction sites. Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transfections—Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were cultured in RPMI medium with glutamax-1 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable transfections were carried out with 40 μg of linearized plasmid DNA mixed with 2 μg of linearized pGKpuro (plasmid containing the puromycin resistance gene). Electroporations were performed using 3 × 107 cells per transfection, as previously described (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). Each electroporated cell pool was expanded in selective medium during ∼10–12 days, by adding puromycin (Invitrogen) to 2.5 μg/ml. Erythroid cell differentiation was induced by adding 2% (v/v) Me2SO to the media of each transfection cell pool. Following 5 days, cell pools were harvested for RNA extraction. MEL cells stably expressing the tet transactivator (MEL/tTA; described in Ref. 39Kong J. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1125-1134Google Scholar) were used for conditional expression of hβ-globin genes (previously cloned into the pTet vector). For transient transfections, MEL/tTA cells were split 1 day before transfection and cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml tetracycline. Cells were washed three times in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cold serum-free minimal essential medium at a concentration of 3 × 10 7 cells per ml. Two micrograms of pTet2-βWT or each pTet2-β variant were added to the cell suspension and mixed thoroughly. Electroporation was performed at 250 V, 1.180 microfarads, and low resistance in a Invitrogen Cell-Porator system. For steady-state mRNA quantification, cells were harvested after a 12-h transcription pulse. For mRNA stability analysis, cells were split into four 60-mm diameter dishes. Cells were pulsed with β-globin mRNA for 12 h by growth in Tet– media. Following this period, transcription from the plasmid was then blocked by the addition of Tet to the media. Cells from each culture dish were harvested in different time points for further analysis.The adherent HeLa cells, stably expressing the tet transactivator (HeLa/tTA; described in Ref. 39Kong J. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1125-1134Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient co-transfections were performed with the pTet-αwt (to control for transfection efficiency) and the appropriate pTet2-β plasmid, using Lipofectin Plus reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 × 105 cells per transfection and 1 μg of each plasmid. Cells were harvested after 1 day transcription pulse.RNA Isolation—Total RNA from transfected cells was prepared using the RNeasy total kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Before analysis, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) and purified by phenol:chloroform extraction.Primer Extension Analysis—Primer extension assays were performed using 5′-end-labeled primers: Hβexon3-AS or Hβ3′UTR-AS and Mα-AS (Table I). Both primers were mixed, hybridized with 10 μg of MEL RNA at 50 °C during 5 h, and extended with reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen), as described previously (37Romão L. Inácio A. Santos S. Ávila M. Faustino P. Pacheco P. Lavinha J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2895-2901Google Scholar). Primer extension products were analyzed by phosphorimaging, using a Typhoon® Imager 8600 (Molecular Dynamics) with a 6-h exposure period. One, ten, and fifteen micrograms of RNA extracted from cells transfected with the normal β-globin gene were also transcribed to show that the experiment was carried out in the presence of primer in excess. The intensity of each band was quantified using the Image Master Phoretix® Software (Amersham Biosciences).Ribonuclease Protection Assays—Probes used were generated by in vitro transcription of plasmids containing DNA fragments from hβ-globin, hα-globin (40Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russel J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Google Scholar), mα-globin (40Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russel J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Google Scholar), or mGAPDH (Ambion). The hβ-globin probe is a 170-bp fragment encompassing the last 20 bp of intron 2, the entire exon 3 coding region, and first 21 bp of 3′UTR, which was generated by PCR and inserted into the polylinker region of pGEM3. Amplification primers contained restriction sites that facilitated insertion into the vector polylinker. To generate RNA probes, each transcription vector was linearized and transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) using a Maxiscript SP6 kit, under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Ambion). Final concentrations of ATP, GTP, and UTP were 0.5 mm and that of CTP was 0.06 mm. One microgram of RNA was added to 20 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% formamide) supplemented with probes. Samples were heated at 80 °C for 10 min, incubated overnight at 50 °C, and digested for 15 min at room temperature in 200 μl of RNase assay buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 μl of RNase mixture (500 mg of RNase A/ml, 20,000 units of RNase T1/ml; Ambion). Digestions were terminated by addition of 18 μl of an SDS-protease K (10%:2 mg/ml) mixture to each sample followed by incubation 20 min at 37 °C. RNA was extracted, precipitated, dissolved in loading buffer, and resolved onto a 6 or 8% acrylamide 8 m urea gel. Radioactivity in bands of interest was quantified by phosphorimaging, using a Typhoon® Imager 8600.RT-PCR Analysis—Two micrograms of each total RNA sample was mixed with 2 pmol of Hβ3′RNA-AS primer (Table I). The mixture was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and quick chilled on ice. Four microliters of 5× first strand"

The NPC has a 9-nm diffusion channel, which sets an upper limit for free diffusion to ∼45-60 kDa, allowing metabolites, ions, and small macromolecules to pass through. However, NPCs allow active nuclear transport of particles larger than 25 nm in diameter (for a review, see Ref. 1Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Proteins are directed in or out of the nucleus via nuclear localization signals (NLSs) or nuclear export signals, respectively. NLSs and nuclear export signals require binding of specific import/export-receptors (importins and exportins) that are necessary for the translocation of the cargo through NPCs. The NLSs are grouped into several categories. The most commonly known are the classical NLSs (cNLS), which are composed of a basic amino acid stretch (K/R)4-6 preceded by a Gly, Pro, or an acidic amino acid residue (2Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 3Lanford R.E. Butel J.S.

In addition, several nonclassical NLSs have been described, examples being the M9 fragment in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and A2 containing a 38-amino acid stretch enriched in aromatic residues and glycine (5Pollard V.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in addition to linear NLSs, discontinuous epitopes that come together upon folding into tertiary structure contribute to the nuclear import of histone proteins (9Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Baake M. Bauerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J.

Proteins containing a cNLS are imported into the nucleus by the importin-α/importin-β (imp-α/β) import receptors (13Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S.

The ternary complex is directed by imp-β to the NPC, which passes through the nuclear pore by a so-called facilitated diffusion process (16Ribbeck K. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of nuclear import per se has not been solved, it is thought that the direction of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport is dependent on the gradient of the small Ras-related GTPase Ran protein (RanGTP) across the nuclear envelope (17Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Bischoff F.R. Gorlich D.

Alternative nuclear import pathways have been described in which the NLS-containing proteins directly bind one of the nuclear import receptors of the importin-β superfamily. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A1 and A2, for example, are imported by transportin (5Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Integrase (IN) is the retroviral protein responsible for integration of the DNA replica of the viral genome into a cell chromosome. When expressed on their own in the absence of other viral proteins, retroviral INs locate to cell nuclei and are therefore karyophilic (24Depienne C. Roques P. Creminon C. Fritsch L. Casseron R.

It has been suggested that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN, as an essential component of the viral preintegration complex (PIC), plays a role in its nuclear import (24Depienne C.

Recently, lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) has been shown to associate with HIV-1 IN in human cells (30Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Using transient knock-down of endogenous LEDGF/p75 via small interfering RNA, LEDGF/p75 was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for accumulation of HIV-1 IN into the nucleus (31Maertens G.

Although the alternative splice variant of LEDGF/p75, p52, is also karyophilic, its nuclear distribution is different from LEDGF/p75 (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E.

The exact cellular function of LEDGF/p75 is unknown. LEDGF/p75 was originally isolated from HeLa cell extracts as an interactor of transcriptional co-activator PC4 and was therefore suggested to play a role in transcriptional regulation (33Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Singh and co-workers (34Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

LEDGF/p75 binds to heat shock and stress-related regulatory DNA elements, and cellular expression of LEDGF/p75 was increased upon heat, oxidative, or chemical stress. Since LEDGF/p75 was shown to be essential for the nuclear accumulation of HIV-1 IN, we characterized the nuclear import pathway of LEDGF/p75 and identified its NLS. We show that a single point mutation is sufficient to confine LEDGF/p75 and relocate HIV-1 IN to the cytoplasm. Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and EGFP-Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) (GG) Constructs—To create pEGFP-P75/ΔC and pEGFP-P75/Ct, the fragments were PCR-amplified from pCP6H75 (30Cherepanov P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) using Pfu Ultra (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and an appropriate set of primers. The primers used were as follows: p75/ΔCs, 5′-CCGAAGATCTCAACTCGCGATTTCAAACC; p75/ΔCas, 5′-CGGGAATTCCTACTCAGTTTCCATTTGTTCC; p75/Cts, 5′-CCGAAGATCTCACAGCAGAATAAAGATGAAGG; p75/Ctas, 5′-CGGGAATTCCTAGTTATCTAGTGTAGAATCC. The PCR fragments were digested with BglII and EcoRI and subcloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The construction of pEGFP-P75 was described previously (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P.

The design of the EGFPGST fusion vector pGG was based on the work of Woodward et al. (26Woodward C.L. Wang Y. Dixon W.J. Htun H. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4516-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A linker was added upstream and downstream of the GST reading frame, coding for a flexible peptide of alternating Gly-Ala dimers. The following primers were used: GST1, 5′-GCAAGATCTTGGGCGCGGGTGCT; GST2, 5′-GGCGCGGGTGCTGGAGCAGGAGCA; GST3, 5′-GCAGGAGCAATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG; GST4, 5′-CACCCGCGCCATCCGATTTTGGAGGATGG; GST5, 5′-CTCCTGCTCCAGCACCCGCGCCATCCG, GST6, 5′-TGCAAGCTTTGCTCCTGCTCCAGCACC. The first PCR product was created with GST3 and GST4 primers, using pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) as a template. The following PCR was performed on the resulting amplicon using GST2 and GST5 primers, followed by a third PCR with GST1 and GST6. After digestion with BglII and HindIII, the PCR fragment was cloned into pEGFP-C2. To obtain pGG-P75, the EagI/BamHI fragment from pEGFP-P75 carrying the LEDGF/p75 open reading frame was subcloned between HindIII/BamHI sites of pGG (the EagI and the HindIII termini were treated with mung bean nuclease prior to BamHI digestion). To make pGG-P75/ΔC and pGG-P75/Ct, the plasmids pEGFP P75/ΔC and pEGFP-P75/Ct were digested with BglII and treated with T4 DNA polymerase followed by BamHI restriction. The LEDGF/p75 gene fragments were then cloned between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pGG. Missense mutations were introduced via the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene) using pGG-P75 as a template. The following constructs were made: pGG-P75A146-147 (Arg146 and Arg147 both changed to alanine residues), pGG-P75A149-150/155 (residues Arg149-Lys150 and Lys155 replaced by alanine residues; the same designation is used in the other constructs), pGG-P75A150-152/155, pGG-P75A150-152, pGG-P75A150/155, pGG-P75A155, and pGG-P75A150. Construction of pHcRed1-IN was described previously (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol.

LacZ Fusion Constructs—The plasmids pGM-SV40NLS-lacZ and pGM-lacZ were made using the following primers: SVs1, 5′-AAGAGGAAGGTCCTGCAGATGCTAGATCCCGTCGTTTTACAAC; SVas, 5′-CTACTCGAGCTATTTTTGACAGGAGACCAACTGG; SVs2, 5′-CTAAAGCTTGACACCATGGGATCCCCTAAGAAAAAGAGGAAGGTCCTGCAG; LacZs, 5′-CTAAAGCTTGACACCATGGGCATGCTAGATCCCGTCGTTTTACAAC. pHR′CMVlacZ (37Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar) was used as the template to PCR-amplify the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase sequences. To build pGM-lacZ, LacZs and SVas were used as primers. For the construction of pGM-SV40NLS-lacZ, a fragment amplified using SVs1 and SVas primers was used as template in a second round of PCR with primers SVs2 and SVas. Following HindIII and XhoI digestion, the resulting PCR products were subcloned into HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA6/V5-HisB (Invitrogen). To construct pGM-P75NLS-LacZ, the SV40 NLS coding sequence was removed from pGM-SV40NLS-lacZ by BamHI and PstI restriction and replaced by a DNA duplex, formed by oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCGGGCGTAAGCGGAAGGCTGAAAAACAACTGCA and 5′-GTTGTTTTTCAGCCTTCCGCTTACGCCCG. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis to contain no unwanted mutations. Purification and Fluorescent Labeling of Recombinant LEDGF/p75 and LEDGF/p75A150—The bacterial expression vector pCPNat75 for expression of native LEDGF/p75 has been described (31Maertens G.

To produce recombinant LEDGF/p75A150, pCPN75-A150 was engineered by QuikChange (Stratagene) using pCPNat75 as template. Wild type LEDGF/p75 and the NLS mutant LEDGF/p75A150 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and purified as previously described for the wild type protein (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P.

The point mutation did not significantly influence binding of the recombinant protein to heparin-Sepharose or cation exchange resins. Both proteins were labeled using Alexa Fluor 633 succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in phosphate buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stoichiometry of label/protein was maintained at ≤1 during labeling. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% C02 humidified atmosphere. HeLa cells were seeded 1 day prior to transfection into 8-well LabTek chambered cover glass cuvettes. Transfection was performed at ∼80% confluence with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) using 0.36 μg of plasmid DNA. Staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Invitrogen) was performed 24 h post-transfection. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 0.4 mg/ml X-Gal in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2. Western Blot—Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and the total protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Samples containing 15 μg of total protein were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Monoclonal mouse anti-LEDGF p75/p52 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody was from Dako (DakoCytomation California Inc., Carpenteria, CA). Detection was carried out using ECL+ chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Semipermeabilized Cells—Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, the lysate was extensively dialyzed against transport buffer (TB, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiotreitol, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a Pierce dialysis cassette with a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off. The in vitro import assay in semipermeabilized cells was based on methods described in Ref. 38Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar. HeLa cells were seeded on LabTek coverslip cuvettes and used at ∼50-60% confluence. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold TB and permeabilized in 40 μg/ml digitonin in TB on ice for 5 min. The endogenous cytosol was depleted by washing in ice-cold TB. Import reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and contained 50% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (v/v), an energy-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma)), and an import substrate in TB. Sulforhodamine B-labeled bovine serum albumin-conjugated NLS (henceforth referred to as SV40-NLS substrate) carrying the SV40 large T antigen NLS was purchased from Sigma. The SV40-NLS substrate was added to the import mixture at a final concentration of 120 μg/ml. Alexa 633-labeled LEDGF/p75 and LEDGF/p75A150 were added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. To test GTP dependence, GTP was omitted, and 1 mm GTPγS (Sigma) was added. ATP dependence was tested by replacing ATP with 1 mm AMP-PNP (Sigma). Competition experiments were carried out adding a 5-fold excess of unlabeled substrate. Active nuclear import was inhibited using 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) in TB. Cells were incubated for 30 min with WGA at 37 °C and rinsed once in TB prior to incubation with the import mixture. For reconstitution experiments, a Ran mixture containing 3 μm Ran (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany) and 0.5 μm nuclear transport factor 2 (Sigma) in TB was used, with or without 1 μm import receptors imp-α (human) and imp-β (Drosophila melanogaster) (Jena Biosciences). The import was terminated by washing cells with ice-cold TB followed by fixation in 2% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline). Slides were mounted in 50% glycerol. Laser-scanning Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 microscope, interfaced with the Zeiss Axiovert microscope. All single- and two-color images were acquired in 1024 × 1024 resolution mode, using a × 63 water immersion objective. EGFP was excited at 488 nm, rhodamine and HcRed1 at 568 nm, and Alexa 633 at 647 nm. Computer Analysis—LEDGF/p75 and its smaller splice variant p52 are karyophilic (30Cherepanov P. Maertens G.

LEDGF/p75 contains about 21% basic residues, which makes it difficult to reliably predict a NLS from the primary sequence. Thus, we turned to computer prediction programs, first using NUCDISC from the PSORT II server (available on the World Wide Web at psort.nibb.ac.jp) (39Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 40Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), which looks for canonical NLSs using the patterns shown in Table I. PSORT II uses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to score putative NLSs (41Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). Six putative NLSs within LEDGF/p75 were predicted (Table I). We also used the PredictNLS program provided by the Columbia University Bioinformatics Center (available on the World Wide Web at cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/cgi/var/nair/resonline.pl) (42Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), which searches for possible NLSs by comparing the protein sequence with a data base composed of experimentally determined NLSs expanded with “in silico mutagenesis”-created NLS motifs. Two overlapping NLSs were predicted by PredictNLS, both classified as SV40-like canonical NLSs (Table I).Table IComputer prediction of putative NLSs in LEDGF/p75PatternaPattern names employed by PSORT II, which were correlated to a consensus NLS sequence as described in the consensus column, were used for comparison with the primary sequence of LEDGF/p75.ConsensusNLS type4(K/R)4SV40-like(H/P)(K/R)3SV40-like7P(K/R)3SV40-likeBipartite(K/R)2X10(K/R)3-5BipartitePSORTII predictionPositionbAmino acid position in LEDGF/p75 of the first residue in the predicted motif.PatternRKRK1494KPRK2434KKRK2864RKRK3144KKKP5094PNKRKGF717PKRGRPA1787CUBIC predictionPositionNLS typeRRGRKRK146SV40-likeGRKRKAEKQ148SV40-likea Pattern names employed by PSORT II, which were correlated to a consensus NLS sequence as described in the consensus column, were used for comparison with the primary sequence of LEDGF/p75.b Amino acid position in LEDGF/p75 of the first residue in the predicted motif. Open table in a new tab The NLS of LEDGF/p75 Is Contained within the 325 N-terminal Amino Acid Residues—The LEDGF gene encodes for two alternative splice products, p75 and p52, which contain the same sequence over their N-terminal 325 amino acids (33Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Since both LEDGF/p75 and p52 are karyophilic (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K.

Shinohara T. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the NLS must be confined within the first 325 residues. A pair of deletion mutants was constructed to test our prediction. pEGFP-P75/ΔC and pEGFP-P75/Ct encoded for amino acids 1-325 and 326-530 of LEDGF/p75, respectively, fused to the C terminus of EGFP. Confocal microscopy of transiently transfected HeLa cells illustrated that full-length LEDGF/p75 fused to EGFP, EGFP-p75, exhibited a typical heterogeneous distribution pattern in the nucleus and was excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 1A), as was previously reported (31Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Nishizawa Y.

EGFP-p75/ΔC was also concentrated in the nucleus and had a distribution pattern indistinguishable from the full-length LEDGF/p75 protein (Fig. 1B). EGFP-p75/Ct, however, was dispersed throughout the whole cell with somewhat higher concentration in the nucleus, but the nuclear distribution did not reveal the heterogeneous pattern typical of the full-length protein and EGFP-p75/ΔC (Fig. 1C). Since these EGFP-fused proteins have molecular weights near the exclusion limit of the NPC (64 kDa for EGFP-p75/ΔC and 51 kDa for EGFP-p75/Ct), the deletion mutants and full-length LEDGF/p75 were incorporated into a larger protein, EGFP fused to GST (starting mass 54.6 kDa; abbreviated as GG). As can be seen in Fig. 1E, GG-p75/Ct was excluded from the nucleus, as was GG (data not shown), whereas both the full-length protein (GG-p75; Fig. 2A) and the GG-p75/ΔC (Fig. 1D) were nuclear localized. Therefore, a NLS resides within the amino-terminal 325 residues of LEDGF/p75. The NLS predicted by PSORT II at amino acid position 509 (KKKP; see Table I) therefore does not play a role in the nuclear localization of LEDGF/p75.Fig. 2Identification of 148GRKRKAEKQ156 as the functional LEDGF/p75 NLS.

Residues 146 and 147 are dispensable for nuclear localization of LEDGF/p75 (B).

To clone molecules that bind to ADAMTS4, we screened a human chondrocyte cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system using the ADAMTS4 spacer domain as bait and obtained cDNA clones derived from fibronectin. Interaction between ADAMTS4 and fibronectin was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking. A yeast two-hybrid assay and solid-phase binding assay using wild-type fibronectin and ADAMTS4 and their mutants demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of fibronectin is capable of binding to the C-terminal spacer domain of ADAMTS4. Wild-type ADAMTS4 was co-localized with fibronectin as determined by confocal microscopy on the cell surface of stable 293T transfectants expressing ADAMTS4, although ADAMTS4 deletion mutants, including ΔSp (ΔArg693–Lys837, lacking the spacer domain), showed negligible localization. The aggrecanase activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 was dose-dependently inhibited by fibronectin (IC50 = 110 nm), whereas no inhibition was observed with ΔSp. The C-terminal 40-kDa fibronectin fragment also inhibited the activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 (IC50 = 170 nm). These data demonstrate for the first time that the aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS4 is inhibited by fibronectin through interaction with their C-terminal domains and suggest that this extracellular regulation mechanism of ADAMTS4 activity may be important for the degradation of aggrecan in arthritic cartilage.

Wild-type ADAMTS4 was co-localized with fibronectin as determined by confocal microscopy on the cell surface of stable 293T transfectants expressing ADAMTS4, although ADAMTS4 deletion mutants, including ΔSp (ΔArg693–Lys837, lacking the spacer domain), showed negligible localization. The aggrecanase activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 was dose-dependently inhibited by fibronectin (IC50 = 110 nm), whereas no inhibition was observed with ΔSp. The C-terminal 40-kDa fibronectin fragment also inhibited the activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 (IC50 = 170 nm). These data demonstrate for the first time that the aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS4 is inhibited by fibronectin through interaction with their C-terminal domains and suggest that this extracellular regulation mechanism of ADAMTS4 activity may be important for the degradation of aggrecan in arthritic cartilage. Members of the ADAMTS (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) gene family are composed of at least 19 molecules (1Llamazares M. Cal S. Quesada V. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13382-13389Google Scholar) and are involved in various biological and biochemical events such as fertilization, proteoglycan degradation, processing of fibrillar collagens, and intravascular coagulation (2Shindo T.

Among them, ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4 (also referred to as aggrecanase-1), ADAMTS5 (aggrecanase-2), and ADAMTS9 cleave specific Glu–X bonds (where X is most often Ala or Gly) of the core protein of aggrecan, a major proteoglycan in articular cartilage (3Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the major aggrecan fragments found in vitro in response to cytokine-stimulated cartilage degradation and in vivo in arthritic joint fluids are generated through cleavage at Glu–X bonds by the glutamyl endopeptidase activity of these AD-AMTS members (8Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carlson S.S. Iwata M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Google Scholar, 9Lohmander L.S. Neame P.J. Sandy J.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1214-1222Google Scholar). Recent studies further demonstrated that ADAMTS4 is induced by stimulation of chondrocytes and synovial cells with interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, or transforming growth factor-β, although ADAMTS5 is constitutively expressed (6Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Deccico C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Google Scholar, 10Yamanishi Y. Boyle D.L. Clark M. Maki R.A. Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. Firestein G.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1405-1412Google Scholar). In addition, ADAMTS4 is overexpressed by synovial cells and chondrocytes in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (10Yamanishi Y. Boyle D.L. Clark M. Maki R.A. Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. Firestein G.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1405-1412Google Scholar). Thus, ADAMTS4 is considered to play an important role in the aggrecan degradation of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS4 is inhibited by TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3) among the four TIMP proteins (TIMP-1–4) (11Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Google Scholar, 12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Google Scholar), all of which were originally cloned as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; TSP, thrombospondin-1; CR, cysteine-rich; ECM, extracellular matrix; X-α-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Fn-f120, central cell-binding 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Fn-f40, C-terminal 40-kDa fragment of fibronectin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MT, membrane-type. However, it is not known whether this is the only regulatory mechanism of ADAMTS4 activity. ADAMTS4 consists of a prodomain, a furin cleavage site, a catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like motif, a thrombospondin-1 (TSP) motif, a cysteine-rich (CR) domain, and a C-terminal spacer domain. As shown with ADAMTS1 (13Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Google Scholar), ADAMTS4 has an affinity for extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, being deposited in the ECM after synthesis (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Google Scholar). In fact, the binding activity of C-terminal CR and/or spacer domains of ADAMTS4 for sulfated glycosaminoglycans of aggrecan has been reported (15Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Google Scholar). Interestingly, the aggrecanase activity of full-length active ADAMTS4 is blocked probably through interaction with ECM molecules, and activity appears after removal of the C-terminal spacer domain (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that ADAMTS4 may have binding molecules by which the activity is regulated. However, no information is available for proteins interacting with ADAMTS4. In this study, by screening a human chondrocyte cDNA library, we sought binding proteins that may be involved in regulating the activity. Since the spacer domain of ADAMTS4 is not conserved among ADAMTS members, we used the domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system and found fibronectin to be a candidate for a regulator of ADAMTS4 activity. The data in this study demonstrate that fibronectin inhibits the aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS4 through the interaction between the C-terminal regions of each molecule. Yeast Two-hybrid System—MATCHMAKER Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 and the MATCHMAKER human chondrocyte cDNA library were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). cDNA derived from the C-terminal spacer domain of ADAMTS4 was amplified by PCR using a set of primers (forward primer, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAAGCAGTCAGGCTCCTTCAG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TTTGAATTCTTTCCTGCCCGCCCAGGG-3′) from the ADAMTS4 expression plasmid pSG0688 as described previously (16Nakamura H. Fujii Y. Inoki I. Sugimoto K. Tanzawa K. Matsuki H. Miura R. Yamaguchi Y. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38885-38890Google Scholar). The amplified PCR product corresponding to Lys687–Lys837 was digested with NdeI and EcoRI (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) and cloned into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech), generating the pGBKT7/TS4sp plasmid. The plasmids were co-introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 with the human chondrocyte cDNA library according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast transformants were plated and selected on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Robust colonies >2 mm in diameter were restreaked onto the same agar plates and allowed to grow for 1 week. This restreaking step was repeated twice more, and plasmids were isolated and introduced into Escherichia coli strain DH5α according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones harboring target cDNA were isolated, and cDNA sequences were determined using a MegaBase 1000 DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—cDNA fragments encoding six different parts of fibronectin (see Fig. 1A) were amplified by PCR using the chondrocyte cDNA library as a template and the following primer sets: 5′-TTTGGATCCGTTATGACAATGGAAAACACTATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGAATTCAGCTTGGATAGGTCTGTAAAG-3′ (reverse) for fragment I, 5′-TTTGGATCCCAAGTGGTCCTGTCGAAGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGAATTCCAGTGTGGTAAAGACTCCAG-3′ (reverse) for fragment II, 5′-TTTGGATCCCTGGGAGCTCTATTCCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGAATTCAGTGATGGTGGCTCGAGGAG-3′ (reverse) for fragment III, 5′-TTTGGATCCCCCTCACCAACCTCACTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGAATTCTTAATGGAAATTGGCTTGCT-3′ (reverse) for fragment IV, 5′-TTTGGATCCACCGAACAGAAATTGACAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGAATTCCTGTGGACTGGGTTCCAATC-3′ (reverse) for fragment V, and 5′-TTTGGATCCCTATTCCTGCACCAACTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTCTCGAGCTCTCGGGAATCTTCTCTGT-3′ (reverse) for fragment VI. The amplified products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI for fragments I–V, and with BamHI and XhoI for fragment VI and then cloned into the pACT2 vector (Clontech). The pGBKT7/TS4sp plasmid and each fibronectin expression plasmid were co-introduced into strain AH109. They were then selected on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, and raised colonies were streaked onto medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine in the presence of 20 μg/ml X-α-gal and cultured at 27 °C for 2 days. The α-galactosidase activity of each transformant was measured using p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactoside according to the method described (36Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar). The activity measured by the absorbance at 410 nm was normalized by cell density. Chemical Cross-linking—To verify the binding of ADAMTS4 to fibronectin, 125I-labeled ADAMTS4 (13 nm) was incubated with human plasma fibronectin (0, 9.1, or 91 nm; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) or with a 120-kDa fibronectin fragment with the central cell-binding domain (Fn-f120; 100 nm; Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 16 h at 4 °C and cross-linked by treating the mixture with 1 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 2 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by incubation with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature, and the sample was subjected to SDSPAGE (12.5% total acrylamide) under reducing conditions. The gel was dried and analyzed by with a Fuji Film BAS 2000 analyzer. Construction of ADAMTS4 and Its Deletion Mutants—To construct the expression plasmid of wild-type ADAMTS4, pSG0688 was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and ADAMTS4 cDNA with the FLAG tag sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(–) (Invitrogen). Construction of ADAMTS4 and its C-terminally truncated mutants, i.e. ΔSp lacking the spacer domain (Arg693–Lys837), ΔCR/Sp lacking most of the CR domain and the spacer domain (Pro603–Lys837), and ΔT/CR/Sp lacking the TSP, CR, and spacer domains (Gly521–Lys837) (see Fig. 2A), was carried out by PCR using pSG0688 as a template. Amplified products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pCMVtag4a (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer sets used for PCR were as follows: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (common forward) and 5′-TTTCTCGAGGAAGGAGCCTGACTGCTTG-3′ (reverse) for ΔSp (Met1–Phe692), the common forward primer and 5′-TTTCTCGAGCCCTGGGAAGCTCTTGA-3′ (reverse) for ΔCR/Sp (Met1–Gly602), and the common forward primer and 5′-TTTCTCGAGAGCCTGTGGAATATTGAAG-3′ (reverse) for ΔT/CR/Sp (Met1–Ala520). These plasmids were digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and each truncated ADAMTS4 cDNA with a FLAG tag was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(–). Purification of Recombinant ADAMTS4 Proteins—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with the above-mentioned pcDNA3.1/Zeo(–) plasmid containing cDNA encoding ADAMTS4 or its mutants using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Transfected cells were cultured for 2 days and selected with 150 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. Stable transfectants expressing full-length ADAMTS4 or its truncated mutants were established by expansion from a single cell, and the conditioned culture media from these transfectants were harvested after a 48-h incubation in serum-free DMEM. For the purification of full-length ADAMTS4 and ΔT/CR/Sp, the conditioned media were concentrated using an Amicon Diaflo apparatus fitted with a YM-10 membrane; mixed with 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, and 0.02% NaN3 (TCB buffer); and applied to an SP-Sepharose fast flow column (2.5 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TCB buffer. The recombinant proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, and the combined fractions containing ADAMTS4 or ΔT/CR/Sp were applied to a column of anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel (1 × 6 cm; Sigma) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, and 0.02% NaN3 (TNCB buffer). ADAMTS4 and ΔT/CR/Sp were eluted with 6 m urea in TNCB buffer containing 1 m NaCl after washing the column with the buffer containing 1 m NaCl and dialyzed against TNCB buffer to remove urea. For the purification of ΔSp and ΔCR/Sp, which did not show a strong affinity for the anti-FLAG antibody gel, concentrated culture media were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (2.5 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TCB buffer, and unbound fractions mixed with 9 volumes of TCB buffer were applied to an SP-Sepharose fast flow column. The mutants were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl as described above, dialyzed, and then applied to a chelating Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with ZnCl2 according to our previous method (17Imai K. Yokohama Y. Nakanishi I. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Nakai N. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6691-6697Google Scholar). ΔSp and ΔCR/Sp were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl and dialyzed against TNCB buffer. The concentrations of these ADAMTS4 species were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The purity of recombinant proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining of the gels and/or autoradiography of iodinated proteins according to our previous methods (18Hashimoto G. Inoki I. Fujii Y. Aoki T. Ikeda E. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36288-36295Google Scholar). Binding of ADAMTS4 to Immobilized Fibronectin and Its Fragments—Microtiter plates with 96 wells (Immunomodule, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated by incubation with 50 μl of intact fibronectin, the C-terminal 40-kDa fibronectin fragment (Fn-f40; 25 nm; Invitrogen), or 25 nm Fn-f120 for 16 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed twice with TNCB buffer and subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TNCB buffer for 2 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with 125I-labeled full-length ADAMTS4 or its deletion mutants (∼5 × 105 cpm, 20 ng/well) for 24 h at 4 °C. To confirm the specific binding, 125I-labeled ADAMTS4 was mixed with a 10- or 50-fold excess amount of unlabeled ADAMTS4 or buffer and then subjected to the binding assay using microtiter plates coated with intact fibronectin. After washing twice with TNCB buffer, the bound proteins were dissociated by treatment with 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity of the bound fractions was counted using a γ-counter (ARC-600, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Similarly, the possibility of interaction between fibronectin and aggrecan was examined in a binding assay by incubating 125I-labeled fibronectin in the aggrecan-coated wells and measuring the bound radioactivity. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy of Transfected Cells—Stable transfectants expressing full-length or truncated ADAMTS4 species were established as described above and detached from the dishes by incubation with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C. After blocking the activity of trypsin with 10% fetal bovine serum, the cell suspensions were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 1 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium/X supplement (Invitrogen) after washing with serum-free DMEM. Fibronectin-treated cells were then cultured on Lab-Tek chamber slides (1 × 105 cells/well; Nalge Nunc) for 1 day. The cells were incubated with 3% normal goat serum in PBS to block nonspecific binding and then reacted with anti-FLAG antibody (1:100), anti-fibronectin antibody (1: 20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or non-immune mouse IgG (Dako Corp., Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. They were fixed with methanol/acetone/formaldehyde (19:19:2, v/v) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:50; Dako Corp.) after washing with PBS. Transfected cells expressing the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(–) vector (mock transfectants) and parental 293T cells were also subjected to double immunostaining as a negative control. All preparations were viewed under an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope at a similar sensitivity (550 V for fluorescein isothiocyanate and 600 V for rhodamine), and differential interference contrast images were also viewed for comparison. Detection of Aggrecanase Activity and Its Inhibition by Fibronectin— Aggrecan (100 μg) prepared from bovine nasal cartilage (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Google Scholar) was incubated with purified full-length ADAMTS4 (8 nm) or truncated ADAMTS4 species (ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, or ΔT/CR/Sp; 8 nm each) for 16 h at 37 °C and deglycosylated after termination of the reaction with 20 mm EDTA as described previously (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Google Scholar). The digestion products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide) under reducing conditions. Proteins in the gel were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and aggrecanase activity was evaluated by detecting aggrecan fragments with the neoepitope (NITEGE373) by immunoblotting using the neoepitope-specific antibody I19C (2 μg/ml), which was kindly provided by Drs. Kotaro Sugimoto and Kazuhiko Tanzawa (Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo) (19Sugimoto K. Takahashi M. Yamamoto Y. Shimada K. Tanzawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 449-455Google Scholar). After reaction with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG antibody (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences), immunoreactive proteins on the membranes were detected using the ECL™ Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the study of fibronectin inhibition, wild-type ADAMTS4 and ΔSp (8 nm each), which showed sufficient aggrecanase activity, were incubated with increasing concentrations of fibronectin (0, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nm final concentrations) for 2 h at 37 °C prior to the reaction. Aggrecan was then digested by incubation with the mixtures for 16 h at 37 °C, and aggrecanase activity was monitored as described above. Since the aggrecanase activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 was inhibited by intact fibronectin, the inhibitory effects of the fibronectin fragments (Fn-f40 and Fn-f120) on the activity were also examined using ADAMTS4 preincubated with the fragments at final concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, 500, 750, and 1000 nm in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, which was added to completely block a trace amount of serine proteinase(s) contaminating the preparations of fibronectin fragments. The densities of immunoreactive bands were measured by scanning densitometry using NIH Image Version 1.62 according to our previous method (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Measured values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. In the solid-phase binding assay, the difference in radioactivity was analyzed by the Bonferroni/Dunn test. Tests were performed using StatView Version 5.0. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Screening of Proteins That Interact with ADAMTS4 —To identify the proteins that interact with ADAMTS4, 3 × 106 clones from the human chondrocyte cDNA library were screened by the yeast two-hybrid system using a cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal spacer domain (Lys687–Lys837, 151 amino acids) of ADAMTS4 as bait. Among the 156 clones grown on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine, 31 clones (20%) were identified as human fibronectin. These 31 clones had different 5′-ends, but all of them except for the shortest clone covered the whole region of the C-terminal heparin-binding domain/fibrin-binding domain of fibronectin (Fig. 1A). Interaction of ADAMTS4 with Fibronectin Fragments in Yeast—The region of binding of ADAMTS4 to fibronectin was examined by yeast two-hybrid assays. Yeast strain AH109 was cotransformed with the pGBKT7/TS4sp and pACT2/FnI–VI plasmids, containing cDNA encoding fragment I, II, III, IV, V, or VI of fibronectin (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, clones cotransformed with pGBKT7/TS4sp and pACT2/FnVI (referred to as Sp/VI) as well as positive clones expressing p53 and SV40 (referred to as p53/SV40) could grow to form blue-stained colonies on medium lacking the three amino acids and adenine. In contrast to these transformants, other clones expressing ADAMTS4 and fibronectin fragments I–V showed only negligible background growth (Fig. 1B). Although positive control p53/SV40 transformants grew faster than Sp/VI transformants, the intensity of blue color for X-α-gal staining was much higher in the Sp/VI transformants than in the control (Fig. 1B). When the α-galactosidase activity of each transformant was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm, Sp/VI transformants showed remarkably higher activity compared with other transformants and control p53/SV40 transformants (Fig. 1C). Cross-linking Study of ADAMTS4 and Fibronectin—To further study the interaction of ADAMTS4 with fibronectin, a cross-linking experiment was carried out by incubating 125I-labeled ADAMTS4 with increased amounts of intact fibronectin. As shown in Fig. 1D, 125I-labeled ADAMTS4, which migrated at 73 kDa, shifted to the site of ∼400 kDa when reacted with intact fibronectin and cross-linked with DSS. On the other hand, reaction of an ADAMTS4 and Fn-f120 mixture with DSS showed negligible cross-linked products. Although ADAMTS4 became a broad band ranging from 70 to 80 kDa in the presence of DSS, dimerization of the proteinase was not detected. Thus, the molecular shift was considered to be caused by a cross-linked complex of ADAMTS4 and intact fibronectin. Binding of ADAMTS4 to the C-terminal Region of Fibronectin—To identify the region of fibronectin that interacts with ADAMTS4, a solid-phase binding assay was performed using immobilized intact fibronectin, Fn-f120, and Fn-f40. A large amount of 125I-labeled ADAMTS4 could bind to intact fibronectin-coated wells, whereas BSA-coated wells showed only back-ground binding. The radioactivity bound to Fn-f40 (but not Fn-f120) was significantly higher than that to BSA (p < 0.01 versus BSA) (Fig. 1E). Purification and Aggrecanase Activity of ADAMTS4 and Its Mutants—Full-length ADAMTS4 and its C-terminally truncated mutants (ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, and ΔT/CR/Sp, which lack the C-terminal spacer domain; most of the CR and whole spacer domain; and the TSP, CR, and spacer domains, respectively) (Fig. 2A) were expressed in stably transfected 293T cells. These ADAMTS4 species were purified from the conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 2B, purified recombinant ADAMTS4, ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, and ΔT/CT/Sp showed major protein bands of 73, 58, 48, and 39 kDa, respectively, on silver-stained gels after SDS-PAGE. All bands were recognized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2C). When the aggrecanase activity of each recombinant ADAMTS4 species was examined by immunoblotting of aggrecan digestion products using the neoepitope-specific antibody, an immunoreactive aggrecan fragment of ∼80 kDa appeared after digestion with wild-type ADAMTS4 and ΔSp (Fig. 2D), indicating that these two recombinant ADAMTS4 species have potent aggrecanase activity. On the other hand, ΔCR/Sp showed only weak activity, and ΔT/CR/Sp had no activity (Fig. 2D). Binding of the C-terminal Spacer Domain of ADAMTS4 to Fibronectin—To determine which domain of ADAMTS4 is involved in binding to fibronectin, a solid-phase binding assay was performed by incubating 125I-labeled ADAMTS4, ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, or ΔT/CR/Sp in fibronectin-coated wells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the binding activity of these ADAMTS4 species was higher than that of BSA, which had only background signals. However, the binding activity of wild-type ADAMTS4 was remarkably ∼3-fold higher than that of C-terminally truncated ADAMTS4 mutants (Fig. 3A). The specific binding between 125I-labeled ADAMTS4 and fibronectin was confirmed since the binding was competitively inhibited by unlabeled ADAMTS4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results suggest that the C-terminal spacer domain (Arg693–Lys837) of ADAMTS4 is involved in binding to intact fibronectin. Docking of ADAMTS4 on the Cell Membrane of Fibronectin-coated Cells—The pericellular interaction of ADAMTS4 species with fibronectin was examined by double immunostaining of stable transfectants expressing wild-type ADAMTS4, ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, ΔT/CR/Sp, or vector alone. As shown in Fig. 4, fibronectin was immunolocalized on the cell surface of all the transfectants. Although wild-type ADAMTS4 was strongly colocalized with fibronectin on the cell surface, negligible or no immunoreaction was observed with ΔSp, ΔCR/Sp, ΔT/CR/Sp, or mock transfectants (Fig. 4). Inhibition of the Aggrecanase Activity of ADAMTS4 by Fibronectin and Its Fragments—To study the effect of fibronectin on wild-type ADAMTS4 and ΔSp, both of which have definite aggrecanase activity, these recombinant proteinases were incubated with intact fibronectin (0, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nm final concentrations), and aggrecanase activity was determined by immunoblotting using the neoepitope-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, fibronectin c"
https://openalex.org/W2089558162,"Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is phosphorylated on three tyrosine residues: Tyr-771, Tyr-783, and Tyr-1253. With the use of antibodies specific for each of these phosphorylation sites, we have now determined the kinetics and magnitude of phosphorylation at each site. Phosphorylation of Tyr-783, which is essential for lipase activation, was observed in all stimulated cell types examined. The extent of phosphorylation of Tyr-1253 was ∼50 to 70% of that of Tyr-783 in cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), but Tyr-1253 phosphorylation was not detected in B or T cell lines stimulated through B- and T-cell antigen receptors, respectively. Tyr-771 was phosphorylated only at a low level in all cells studied. In cells stimulated with PDGF, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Tyr-783 and of Tyr-1253 occurred with similar kinetics; the receptor kinase appeared to phosphorylate both sites, albeit with Tyr-783 favored over Tyr-1253, before the bound PLC-γ1 was released, and phosphorylation at the two sites occurred independently. PDGF and EGF induced similar levels of phosphorylation of Tyr-783 and of Tyr-1253 in a cell line that expressed receptors for both growth factors. However, only PDGF, not EGF, elicited substantial PLC activity, suggesting that Tyr-783 phosphorylation was not sufficient for enzyme activation. Finally, concurrent production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was found to contribute to the activation of phosphorylated PLC-γ1. Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is phosphorylated on three tyrosine residues: Tyr-771, Tyr-783, and Tyr-1253. With the use of antibodies specific for each of these phosphorylation sites, we have now determined the kinetics and magnitude of phosphorylation at each site. Phosphorylation of Tyr-783, which is essential for lipase activation, was observed in all stimulated cell types examined.

Finally, concurrent production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was found to contribute to the activation of phosphorylated PLC-γ1. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trsiphosphate; IP, inositol monophosphate; IP2, inositol bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PDGF(R), platelet-derived growth factor (receptor); EGF(R), epidermal growth factor (receptor); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. by phospholipase C (PLC) yields the intracellular messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol and is an early signaling event triggered by many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. The PLC family comprises a diverse group of isozymes. Mammalian cells thus express 12 different PLC gene products, which are grouped on the basis of their domain structure and mode of activation into five subfamilies, β (β1 to β4), γ (γ1 and γ2), δ (δ1 to δ4), ϵ, and ζ (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Google Scholar, 2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Google Scholar). The activity of PLC isozymes is strictly controlled in cells; they are virtually inactive in resting cells but are able to generate their messenger products immediately in response to exposure of cells to various extracellular stimuli. Activation of the two γ-type isozymes, PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2, requires their phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. PLC-γ1 is present in most cell types and at most developmental stages, and targeted deletion of its gene in mice results in early embryonic death, underlining the importance of this isozyme in cell proliferation and differentiation (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Google Scholar, 3Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Google Scholar, 4Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Google Scholar). In contrast, PLC-γ2 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, and deletion of the PLC-γ2 gene in mice results in impairment of immune function (5Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Google Scholar). Activation of PLC-γ by tyrosine phosphorylation is an important step in signaling by many stimuli that induce the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). The intracellular domains of receptors for peptide growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor possess intrinsic PTK activity, and many of these receptor PTKs directly phosphorylate and activate PLC-γ1 (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Google Scholar, 4Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Google Scholar). A class of receptors present on hematopoietic cells that are collectively termed immunoreceptors also triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2. Immunoreceptors comprise multiple polypeptide chains but do not possess intrinsic PTK activity; rather, in response to ligand binding, they recruit several distinct types of cytoplasmic PTKs and adapter proteins to form supramolecular complexes that activate PLC-γ (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Google Scholar, 3Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Google Scholar, 6Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 becomes phosphorylated on three tyrosine residues, Tyr-771, Tyr-783, and Tyr-1253 (amino acid numbering is based on the sequence of the rat protein), in cells stimulated with PDGF or EGF (7Kim J.W.

Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Google Scholar). The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was investigated through substitution of Phe for Tyr at each of these three sites and expression of the mutant enzymes in NIH 3T3 cells. Substitution of Tyr-783 with Phe prevented the activation of PLC by PDGF, whereas substitution of Tyr-1253 or Tyr-771 resulted in partial or no inhibition, respectively (9Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Google Scholar). Further examination of the effects of Tyr → Phe substitution by expression of the three mutant proteins in fibroblasts deficient in PLC-γ1 (Null TV-1 cells) revealed that Tyr-783 was essential for PDGF-dependent activation but that Tyr-771 and Tyr-1253 were dispensable. 2B. Poulin, F. Sekiya, and S. G. Rhee, unpublished observation. The evaluation of the Y1253F mutant in Null TV-1 cells is likely more reliable than that in NIH 3T3 cells given that the latter contain endogenous wild-type PLC-γ1. Activation of PLC-γ1 in cells is always accompanied by its tyrosine phosphorylation, and the extent of this phosphorylation is commonly regarded as a measure of its activation status. However, our unpublished observations have suggested that the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 measured in various stimulated cells does not correlate well with the extent of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to tyrosine phosphate such as 4G10 or PY20. One possible explanation for these observations is that tyrosine phosphorylation alone might not be sufficient for the activation of PLC-γ1. Indeed, lipids such as phosphatidic acid (10Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Google Scholar), arachidonic acid (11Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Google Scholar, 12Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Jhon D.Y. Hwang S.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13900-13907Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (13Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Google Scholar, 14Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Google Scholar, 15Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17213-17220Google Scholar) have been shown to augment the catalytic activity of PLC-γ1. Another possibility is that total tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 measured with conventional antibodies to tyrosine phosphate may not closely reflect the extent of phosphorylation at the essential residueTyr-783. Whether or not multiple phosphorylation, such as that on Tyr-783 and Tyr-1253, occurs in the same molecule or in different PLC-γ1 molecules also might be an important determinant of PLC function. To address these questions, we have now measured the kinetics and extent of phosphorylation of each of the three tyrosine residues of PLC-γ1 with the use of phospho-specific antibodies raised against the three phosphorylation sites. We found that phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on Tyr-783 is accompanied by phosphorylation on Tyr-1253 in growth factor-stimulated cells but not in B cells or T cells stimulated via their respective immunoreceptors. Our results also indicate that phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on Tyr-783 per se is not sufficient to initiate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, with the lipase activity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated enzyme also being determined by other factors, including the production of PIP3. Materials and Cell Lines—PDGF-BB (human recombinant) and purified active tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ZAP-70, and Src) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. EGF (human recombinant) and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Null-TV1 cells, which are derived from PLC-γ1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (17Ji Q.S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Google Scholar), were kindly provided by G. Carpenter (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). NIH 3T3/EGFR cells were as described previously (18Honegger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S. Van Obberghen E. Bellot F. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1987; 51: 199-209Google Scholar). Null-TV1, A431, and NIH 3T3/EGFR cells were maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and either 10% fetal bovine serum (Null TV-1 and A431) or 10% calf serum (NIH 3T3/EGFR). Ramos and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Antibodies—A mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies to PLC-γ1 was previously described (19Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Choi W.C. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14497-14504Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for PLC-γ1 phosphorylated on Tyr-783 (anti-pY783) were obtained from Biosource/QCB. Antibodies to PLC-γ1 phosphorylated on Tyr-771 or on Tyr-1253 (anti-pY771 and anti-pY1253, respectively) were prepared by injection of rabbits with the phosphotyrosyl peptides EPD(pY)GALYEGC (corresponding to residues 768–777 of rat PLC-γ1 plus a terminal Cys residue for conjugation; pY, phosphorylated Tyr) or FEAR(pY)QQPFGC (residues 1249–1257 plus a linker Gly residue and a Cys residue), respectively, each conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and synthesized by BioSynthesis. Antisera were depleted of cross-reactive antibodies with nonantigen phosphorylated peptides (pY783 and pY1253 peptides for anti-pY771; pY771 and pY783 peptides for anti-pY1253) to prevent possible recognition of phosphorylated sites other than the target. Given that isolation of monospecific antibodies with the use of immobilized phosphopeptide antigens did not result in improvement of specificity, we used the antisera without further purification for our experiments. Mouse monoclonal antibody to Akt phosphorylated on Ser-473 was from Cell Signaling, goat F(ab′)2 fragments specific for human IgM were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, and the mouse monoclonal antibody OKT-3 to CD3 was kindly provided by L. Samelson (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Expression of PLC-γ1 Mutants—Mutants of rat PLC-γ1 in which the phosphorylation-site Tyr residues had been substituted with Phe were described previously (9Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Google Scholar). The coding sequences of these mutant proteins were transferred to the vector pSC11, and recombinant vaccinia viruses for expression in mammalian cells were prepared as described previously (20Chakrabarti S. Brechling K. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3403-3409Google Scholar). Null TV-1 cells were exposed to the recombinant viruses for 3 h and then cultured in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analysis—Adherent A431, Null TV-1, or NIH 3T3/EGFR cells grown in six-well culture plates to 50–80% confluence were incubated for 24 h in medium containing 1% serum before stimulation with growth factors. The serum-deprived cells were washed, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with DMEM (1 ml per well) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) (plus 1 mm sodium vanadate where indicated), and then stimulated as indicated. After incubation for the indicated times, the medium was removed, and lysis buffer I (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), 0.2 ml per well) was added to the cells, which were then incubated for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged and the resulting supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% gels (Novex). The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with primary antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the chemiluminescent reagent CDP-Star (Tropix). Images were captured and analyzed with a Kodak Image Station 440 equipped with a charge-coupled device camera. Ramos and Jurkat cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 0.5% serum, washed, suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 1 mm sodium vanadate, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated with antibodies to their immunoreceptors. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 0.25 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer II (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm EDTA, 5% Triton X-100, 1.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, leupeptin (25 μg/ml), aprotinin (25 μg/ml)) and incubation for 20 min on ice. After the removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the remaining supernatants were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. For stimulation with pervanadate, cells were equilibrated with 1 mm sodium vanadate for 10 min then stimulated with 2 mm H2O2. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were diluted 5-fold with lysis buffer I and then incubated at 4 °C first with appropriate antibodies for 1 h (with rocking) and then for an additional 2 h with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The Protein G-Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer I and once with water, suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled. The eluted proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. In Vitro Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1—Purified rat PLC-γ1 (20 μg/ml) was incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm ATP, bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and either EGF receptor (EGFR, 0.5 unit/ml), ZAP-70 (1 μg/ml), or Src (4 μg/ml). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the extent of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Measurement of Inositol Phosphates—Cells (in six-well plates) were transferred to myo-inositol-free DMEM containing 1% calf serum and incubated for 2 days in the presence of myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml, 25 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After washing with DMEM, the cells were incubated for 10 min in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm LiCl and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) (plus 1 mm sodium vanadate where indicated) and were then exposed to growth factors for various times. The medium was subsequently removed, and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of 5% perchloric acid on ice. The cell extracts were centrifuged to remove debris, and the resulting supernatants were neutralized with 2 m KOH before analysis of inositol phosphates by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil SAX-10 (Whatman) ion-exchange column with a Flo-One on-line radiometric detector (Packard), as described previously (21Poulin B. Sekiya F. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6411-6416Google Scholar). Measurement of PIP3—Serum-deprived NIH 3T3/EGFR cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM, incubated for 1 h in the same medium, and then labeled for 1 h with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml; ICN) again in phosphate-free DMEM. After stimulation of the cells with EGF or PDGF, the medium was removed and the cells were scraped into 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged, and phospholipids were extracted from the pellets as previously described (22Zhang L. Buxton I.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 105: 47-63Google Scholar). The extracted phospholipids were subjected to deacylation by treatment with methylamine (23Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Google Scholar), and the released fatty acids were removed by extraction with chloroform. The remaining aqueous phase containing glycerophosphoinositol phosphates was then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil SAX-10 column with a 70-min nonlinear gradient of 0 to 1 m NH4H2PO4. The radioactivity associated with deacylated PIP3 in the eluate was monitored with an on-line detector and was expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity in the phospholipid fraction. Characterization of Antibodies Specific for Phosphorylated PLC-γ1—Of the three phosphorylation sites of PLC-γ1, Tyr-771 and Tyr-783 are located between the X and Y catalytic domains and Tyr-1253 is localized near the COOH terminus (Fig. 1A). Polyclonal antibodies specific for PLC-γ1 phosphorylated on Tyr-783 (anti-pY783) are commercially available, and we have prepared anti-pY771 and anti-pY1253. The specificities of these various antibodies were tested with PLC-γ1-deficient fibroblasts (Null TV-1 cells) after their infection with vaccinia virus vectors for wild-type PLC-γ1 or for each of the Tyr → Phe phosphorylation site mutants (Y771F, Y783F, and Y1253F). The cells were stimulated with a combination of PDGF and pervanadate to induce maximal phosphorylation of PLC-γ1; vanadate (VO43−) is a reversible inhibitor of a wide variety of phosphatases, but, in the presence of H2O2, it is converted to pervanadate (a general term for the various adducts formed between vanadate and H2O2), which irreversibly oxidizes the essential cysteine residue of protein tyrosine phosphatases (24Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Google Scholar). Lysates of the cells were then subjected directly to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Anti-pY783 and anti-pY1253 did not recognize PLC-γ1 before cell stimulation but yielded a single immunoreactive band at the position corresponding to the molecular size of PLC-γ1 after cell stimulation, indicating that they are specific for phosphorylated forms of PLC-γ1. Anti-pY771 exhibited a low level of reactivity with PLC-γ1 in nonstimulated cells but showed a much higher level of reactivity with a band of slightly lower mobility, corresponding to phosphorylated PLC-γ1, after cell stimulation. The specificity of each of the three antibody preparations was high, as indicated by the fact that mutation of each of the target tyrosine residues prevented recognition of PLC-γ1 by the corresponding antibodies but not by the other two antibody preparations (Fig. 1B). The binding of these antibodies to PLC-γ1 thus requires not only phosphorylation of tyrosine but also the amino acid sequence surrounding each phosphorylated tyrosine residue. The detection of phosphorylated PLC-γ1 by anti-pY771 or anti-pY1253 was not affected by the inclusion of phosphotyrosine (0.1 mm) in the immunoblot reaction mixture, whereas that by anti-pY783 was partially inhibited (data not shown). The same treatment completely blocked the reactivity of tyrosylphosphorylated proteins with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. In addition, the reactivity of phosphorylated PLC-γ1 with each of the three antibody preparations was blocked by the respective phosphorylated peptide used as the antigen for antibody production but not by the other two phosphorylated peptides (data not shown). Anti-pY771 and anti-pY1253 sometimes recognized several cellular proteins other than PLC-γ1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, whereas anti-pY783 did not. In particular, phosphorylated EGFR was markedly reactive with anti-pY1253 (Figs. 2B and 4B) despite the fact that it does not contain an amino acid sequence similar to that surrounding Tyr-1253 of PLC-γ1.Fig. 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and production of inositol phosphates in NIH 3T3/EGFR cells stimulated with PDGF or EGF.A, serum-deprived cells were stimulated for 5 min with the indicated concentrations of PDGF or EGF in the presence of 1 mm sodium vanadate, after which the extent of phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on Tyr-783 (closed circles) and on Tyr-1253 (open circles) was quantified as described in Fig. 3A. Data are means of three independent determinations. B, serum-deprived cells were left unstimulated or stimulated for 5 min with either PDGF (30 ng/ml) or EGF (20 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of 1 mm sodium vanadate, after which cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies (upper panel). The extent of Tyr-783 phosphorylation was quantified from immunoblot intensities (lower panel); data are means ± S.E. of values from four independent determinations. C, time course of phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on Tyr-783 in serum-deprived cells stimulated for 5 min with either PDGF (30 ng/ml) (circles) or EGF (20 ng/ml) (diamonds) in the presence of 1 mm sodium vanadate. D, cells that had been metabolically labeled with myo-[3H]inositol were stimulated for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of PDGF (circles) or EGF (diamonds) in the absence of sodium vanadate, after which [3H]inositol phosphates (IP, IP2, and IP3) were measured. Data are representative of results from three similar experiments. E, cells that had been labeled with myo-[3H]inositol as in D were stimulated for the indicated times with PDGF (30 ng/ml) (circles) or EGF (20 ng/ml) (diamonds) in the absence (closed symbols) or presence (open symbols) of 1 mm sodium vanadate, after which [3H]inositol phosphates in cell extracts were measured. Data are representative of results from three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in Various Cell Types—We next investigated the reactivity of the phospho-specific antibodies to PLC-γ1 with lysates of NIH 3T3/EGFR fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 cells that express exogenous EGFR in addition to endogenous PDGFR) that had been exposed to PDGF or to a combination of PDGF and pervanadate. Treatment of the cells with PDGF plus pervanadate induced a marked increase in PLC-γ1 reactivity with all the phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis with anti-PLC-γ1 antibody revealed that the PLC-γ1 band of cells stimulated with PDGF plus pervanadate migrated more slowly than did that of nonstimulated cells or that of cells stimulated with PDGF alone and yet was as sharp as the band corresponding to nonphosphorylated PLC-γ1 in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Increasing the incubation time or the concentrations of PDGF and pervanadate did not increase further the blot intensities obtained with any of the three phospho-specific antibody preparations (data not shown). Treatment of immunoprecipitated PLC-γ1 with alkaline phosphatase abolished both the shift in the mobility of the PLC-γ1 band and its reactivity with the phospho-specific antibodies induced by treatment of the cells with PDGF and pervanadate (data not shown), indicating that the mobility shift was due to phosphorylation. Together, these results indicate that most PLC-γ1 molecules in the cells treated with PDGF and pervanadate are phosphorylated at all three tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In contrast, the broad immunoreactive band detected with antibodies to PLC-γ1 in cells stimulated with PDGF alone was suggestive of heterogeneity in the extent of phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). The mobility of this band was intermediate between those of the nonphosphorylated and fully phosphorylated PLC-γ1 bands; the extent of phosphorylation of Tyr-783 and Tyr-1253 was substantial but reduced compared with that apparent in the cells stimulated with PDGF plus pervanadate, and the phosphorylation of Tyr-771 was barely detectable. We compared the phosphorylation profiles of PLC-γ1 in three different human cell types: Ramos B lymphoma cells stimulated by cross-linking of the B cell receptor, Jurkat T lymphoma cells stimulated by cross-linking of CD3, and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells stimulated with EGF (Fig. 2B). The antigenic peptide (FEAR(pY1253)QQPF) used for the preparation of anti-pY1253 was based on the rat protein, which differs in this region by a single amino acid residue (underlined) from the human proteins (FESR(pY1254)QQPF). Although anti-pY1253 is able to recognize both the human and rodent proteins upon phosphorylation, reactivity of anti-pY1253 toward them may not be the same, which would make direct comparison of samples of different origins difficult. Phosphorylation of Tyr-783 was induced in all three cell lines by stimulation with their respective ligands, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr-1254 (equivalent to Tyr-1253 of rodent PLC-γ1) was readily observed in A431 cells but was virtually undetectable in Jurkat and Ramos cells (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of Tyr-771 was hardly detected in any of the three cell lines (data not shown). Stimulation of Ramos or Jurkat cells by pervanadate induced marked phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on Tyr-1254 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the cells are capable of phosphorylating PLC-γ1 on this residue. Phosphorylation of Tyr-771 was also observed in all three cell lines stimulated by pervanadate (data not shown). To determine whether the differences in the phosphorylation patterns of PLC-γ1 among these human cell lines were attributable to differences in the specificity of the responsible kinases, we examined the phosphorylation of purified rat PLC-γ1 by EGFR, ZAP-70, and Src in vitro (Fig. 2C). ZAP-70, which belongs to the Syk family of PTKs, is thought to be the enzyme predominantly responsible for the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in Jurkat cells stimulated via the T cell receptor, and members of the Src family of PTKs are also implicated in the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in lymphocytes (25Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar, 26Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Google Scholar). All three PTKs phosphorylated both Tyr-783 and Tyr-1253, whereas EGFR and Src catalyzed the phosphorylation of Tyr-783 faster than they did that of Tyr-1253, and ZAP-70 phosphorylated the two sites at similar rates. These results thus indicate that the lack of Tyr-1253 phosphorylation in the immune cells is not likely due to the specificity of kinases involved in PLC-γ1 phosphorylation. Mechanism of Growth Factor-induced PLC-γ1 Phosphorylation—To gain insight into the mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, we measured the time course of phosphorylation at each site in NIH 3T3/EGFR cells stimulated with PDGF. As shown in Fig. 2A, PLC-γ1 is fully phosphorylated at all three sites in NIH 3T3/EGFR cells stimulated with PDGF plus pervanadate; we therefore defined 100% phosphorylation at a given position as the corresponding immunoblot intensi"
https://openalex.org/W2123392030,"The yeast ERI1 gene encodes a small ER-localized protein that associates in vivo with GTP bound Ras2 in an effector loop-dependent manner. We showed previously that loss of Eri1 function results in hyperactive Ras phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that Eri1 is a component of the GPI-GlcNAc transferase (GPI-GnT) complex in the ER, which catalyzes transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to an acceptor phosphatidylinositol, the first step in the production of GPI-anchors for cell surface proteins. We also show that GTP bound Ras2 associates with the GPI-GnT complex in vivo and inhibits its activity, indicating that yeast Ras uses the ER as a signaling platform from which to negatively regulate the GPI-GnT. We propose that diminished GPI-anchor protein production contributes to hyperactive Ras phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2078901618,"Although the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) share a similar seven-transmembrane domain structure, only a limited number of amino acid residues is conserved in their protein sequences. One of the most highly conserved sequences is the NPXXY motif located at the cytosolic end of the transmembrane region-7 of many GPCRs, particularly of those belonging to the family of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic-like receptors. Exchange of Tyr305 in the corresponding NPLVY sequence of the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) for Ala resulted in a mutant, termed Y305A, that internalized [3H]bradykinin (BK) almost as rapidly as the wild-type (wt) B2R. However, receptor sequestration of the mutant after stimulation with BK was clearly reduced relative to the wt B2R. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that, in contrast to the B2R-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera, the Y305A-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera was predominantly located intracellularly even in the absence of BK. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis showed that the mutant Y305A constitutively exhibited a phosphorylation pattern similar to that of the BK-stimulated wt B2R. Ligand-independent Y305A internalization was demonstrated by the uptake of rhodamine-labeled antibodies directed to a tag sequence at the N terminus of the mutant receptor. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Y305A is precoupled to Gq/11 without activating the G protein because the basal accumulation rate of inositol phosphate was unchanged as compared with wt B2R. We conclude, therefore, that the Y305A mutation of B2R induces a receptor conformation which is prone to ligand-independent phosphorylation and internalization. The mutated receptor binds to, but does not activate, its cognate heterotrimeric G protein Gq/11, thereby limiting the extent of ligand-independent receptor internalization.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; B2R, bradykinin B2 receptor; BK, bradykinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, inositol phosphates; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); RIPA, radio-immunoprecipitation assay; Ser(P), phosphorylated serine; Thr(P), phosphorylated threonine; wt, wild-type. also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, represent one of the largest classes of membrane receptors in the mammalian genome (1Gether U. Endrocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Google Scholar). They are involved in all aspects of interaction with, and perception of, the environment, including sight, smell, and taste. Such receptors also play a vital role in the control of physiology and behavior, as evidenced by the immense chemical diversity of their endogenous and exogenous ligands. These receptors are named based on their ability to bind to and activate intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins when stimulated by an extracellular agonist. The A family of rhodopsin/β-adrenergic-like receptors is the largest and most well studied of all GPCR families (2Frederikson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.-G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Google Scholar). Although the members of this family do not share a high overall sequence identity, they have a characteristic pattern of a few highly conserved residues and motifs in homologous positions (most of them located in the transmembrane domains) that are not present in the other GPCR families. Given that a high degree of conservation suggests that a residue or segment might play a pivotal structural, functional, or regulatory role in the receptor actions, these residues and motifs have been examined by mutagenesis studies in many GPCRs. One of the most highly conserved motifs, together with the E/DRY sequence at the cytosolic end of transmembrane domain-3, is the NPXXY sequence (where X usually represents a hydrophobic residue and N is rarely exchanged against D) located at the C terminus of transmembrane domain-7. The results of these mutagenesis studies implicate this motif in the signaling, sequestration, and internalization of many GPCRs (3Fritze O. Filipek S. Kuksa V. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P.

Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Google Scholar). A prominent member of the family A of GPCRs is the mammalian type-2 bradykinin receptor (B2R), which mediates the effects of bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (14Regoli D. Barabe L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 210-230Google Scholar). These nona- and decapeptides, respectively, are released from their high molecular weight precursors, the kininogens, through the action of the kallikreins. Effects of kinins via the B2R include vasodilatation, edema formation, and pain sensation (15Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 4-83Google Scholar, 16Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80Google Scholar). As with any other highly potent peptides, the concentration of BK is strictly controlled by rapid degradation involving enzymes such as aminopeptidases, neutral endopeptidase, and angiotensin I converting enzymes. Inhibitors of the latter belong to the most important drugs in the treatment of heart disorders. Although the internalization and desensitization of B2R and the involvement of serine/threonine residues in the C terminus and in other intracellular domains have been studied in great detail (17Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Müller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40431-40440Google Scholar), nothing is known, thus far, about the role of its NPXXY motif in these processes. Here we have used a complementary multi-assay approach measuring internalization of radiolabeled ligands as well as receptor sequestration (relative changes in the number of surface receptors after stimulation with unlabeled agonist), performing total phosphorylation and phosphopeptide mapping, using eGFP-receptor fusion proteins and fluorescent-labeled antibodies directed against a N-terminal receptor tag, to determine the role of the NPLVY sequence and in particular of the critical tyrosine residue in the regulation of wt B2R. Our results suggest that Tyr305 (Tyr 7.53 according to the generalized numbering scheme (Ref. 18Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Google Scholar)) plays an important role in keeping the receptor in an inactive uncoupled state, thereby preventing spontaneous phosphorylation and subsequent interaction with the internalization machinery. Materials—Phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), sodium orthovanadate, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and poly-d -lysine hydrobromide were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany); myo-[2-3H]inositol (21 Ci/mmol), [2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]bradykinin (108 Ci/mmol), and [35S]GTPγS (1250Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; bradykinin from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany); [32P]orthophosphate (500 mCi/ml) from ICN (Eschwege, Germany); okadaic acid from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany); cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates, 1.10-phenanthroline, and Pefabloc SC from Merck (Germany); FuGENE 6, protein G-agarose, anti-HA-antibody, rhodamine-labeled anti-HA antibody, and anti-HA affinity matrix from Roche (Mannheim, Germany); AG 1-X8 anion exchange columns, protein markers, and nitrocellulose membranes from Bio-Rad (Muenchen, Germany); sequencing grade trypsin from Promega (Mannheim, Germany); peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-rat antibody from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany); Gq/11 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany); and Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PCR primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands) and delivered desalted and lyophilized. JE049 was a generous gift from Jerini AG (Berlin, Germany). Mutations, Expression System, and Cell Culture (19Faussner A. Bauer A. Kalatskaya I. Jochum M. Fritz H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1909-H1916Google Scholar)—The wild-type (wt) B2R gene and all other constructs started with the third encoded Met (20Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Google Scholar), which, until recently, was assumed to be the start codon. Site-directed mutagenesis of B2R was performed with standard PCR methodology using appropriate primers and confirmed by sequence analysis (Medigenomix, Martinsried, Germany). Similar methods were used for the construction of chimera with eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) joined to the C terminus of B2R with omission of the stop codon. The Flp-In system from Invitrogen was used to generate stable clones of the constructs. All receptor coding sequences were cloned into the HindIII and the XhoI sites of the pcDNA5/FRT vector and were preceded at the N terminus by a single hemagglutinin (HA) tag of MGYPYDVPDYAGS, with the last two amino acids (GS) of the tag being generated by the insertion of a BamHI site. Transfection of Flp-In TREx-293 (HEK293) cells was performed using FuGENE (Roche) following the instructions of the manufacturer, i.e. 2 μg of plasmid(s) plus 5 μl of FuGENE/6-well dish. Single stably transfected clones were obtained after selection with 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. Clones exhibiting similar high binding activity were considered to represent a single insertion of the pCDNA5/FRT vector DNA containing the receptor gene at the recombinase target site (usually at least 3 of 6 clones). Cells with twice as much binding activity were presumed to have an additional insertion of the vector (rare); clones with less binding activity were assumed to be inhomogeneous and were reselected with hygromycin B or not further propagated. The cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments that required rinsing of the cells, multiwell plates were pretreated with 0.01% poly-d -lysine hydrobromide (molecular mass > 300 kDa) in PBS. Internalization of [3H]Bradykinin—Monolayers on 12-well/24-well plates were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with 0.3/0.15 ml of [3H]BK in incubation buffer (40 mm PIPES, 109 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7 containing 2 mm bacitracin, 0.8 mm 1.10-phenanthroline, 100 μm captopril) for 90 min on ice to reach equilibrium binding. [3H]BK internalization was started by placing the plates in a water bath at 37 °C. The internalization process was stopped at the indicated times by putting the plates on ice and washing the cells four times with ice-cold PBS. Thereafter, the cell monolayers were treated with 0.2 ml of an ice-cold dissociation solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7) for 10 min on ice to induce dissociation of surface bound [3H]BK. The supernatant with formerly surface-bound [3H]BK was quantitatively transferred to a scintillation vial by rinsing the cells with another 0.2 ml of PBS. The remaining monolayer, containing the internalized [3H]BK, was lysed using 0.2 ml of 0.3 m NaOH and transferred with another 0.2 ml of water to a scintillation vial. The radioactivity of both samples was determined in a β-counter after addition of scintillation fluid. Non-receptor-mediated [3H]BK internalization and surface binding was determined in the presence of 5 μm unlabeled BK and subtracted from total binding. Internalization was expressed as intracellular [3H]BK in percentage of the combined amounts of internalized and surface-bound [3H]BK. [3H]Bradykinin Binding Studies—For the determination of the dissociation constant KD and receptor number Bmax at 4 °C, confluent monolayers on 24-well/48-well trays were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with 0.3/0.2 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer containing increasing concentrations of [3H]BK (10 concentrations ranging from ∼0.01 to 30 nm) for at least 90 min on ice. The incubation was stopped by rinsing the cells four times with ice-cold PBS. The cell monolayer was then lysed in 0.2 ml of 0.3 m NaOH and transferred to a scintillation vial. To calculate specific binding, the nonspecific binding (usually less than 5% of total binding) was determined in the presence of 5 μm of unlabeled BK and subtracted from total binding being determined with [3H]BK alone. Measurement of Total Inositol Phosphate Release—Cell monolayers at 80% confluence in 12-well dishes were labeled for 18–24 h with 0.5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of DMEM containing fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The monolayers were then placed on ice, rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.2), and preincubated with the indicated concentration of BK in the presence of 50 mm LiCl for at least 90 min. The stimulation was started by placing the tray in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by exchanging the buffer with 0.75 ml of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid, keeping the tray on ice for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was combined with another 0.75 ml of 20 mm formic acid and, after alkalization with 0.2 ml of 3% ammonium hydroxide solution, was applied to an AG 1-X8 anion exchange column. The column was washed with 1 ml of 1.8% ammonium hydroxide, followed by 9 ml of 5 mm tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. Total inositol phosphates (IP) were eluted in 3 ml of 4 m ammonium formate, 0.2 m formic acid. The radioactivity was determined in a β-counter after addition of scintillation fluid. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed once with PBS and solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) including 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC and 10 μm each 1.10-phenanthroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The lysate was centrifuged at 6.240 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (0.5 ml with ∼1.5 mg of total protein) was incubated with 35 μl of protein G-agarose and 2.5 μl of antiserum AS346 (21Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Google Scholar, 22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar) for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then washed twice with RIPA buffer and once with distilled water, resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer, and incubated 6 min at 95 °C. Following electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the fractionated proteins were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose. The membranes were then incubated overnight with blocking buffer (0.25% gelatin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). The primary high affinity anti-HA antibody (0.1 μg/ml) was added for 2 h at room temperature in fresh blocking buffer. The membranes were washed twice for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 before adding the corresponding secondary peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-rat Ig (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. After washing in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 three times each for 15 min, antibody binding was detected using Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus. Receptor Phosphorylation—Confluent cells on 6-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM, incubated for 3 h at 37 °Cin the same medium, and labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 10–12 h. After a 5-min exposure to 1 μm BK at 37 °C, cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (see above) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.3 μm okadaic acid). Immunoprecipitation and separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel were carried out as detailed above. The proteins of interest electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes were identified by autoradiography. Two-dimensional mapping of the phosphorylation sites was performed as described (17Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Müller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40431-40440Google Scholar, 22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, phosphoproteins were cut out from the membrane, blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in 0.6% acetic acid, and cleaved in situ with 1 μg of modified sequencing grade trypsin in 200 μl of 50 mm (NH4)HCO3 for 12 h at 37 °C. After oxidation in performic acid, the obtained peptides were frozen, vacuum-dried, and digested again with 1 μg of trypsin in 50 μl of 50 mm (NH4)HCO3 for 12 h at 37 °C. The first dimension separation was performed on cellulose thin layer plates in formic acid/acetic acid/water buffer (46:156:1790 (v/v/v)), pH 1.8 at 2000 V for 30 min. The plates were air-dried and subjected to ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid/1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water buffer (1250:38:96:58:558 (v/v/v/v/v)) until the solvent front reached the top of the plate. Plates were then extensively dried and exposed to Fuji X-ray film for 7–10 days at –80 °C. Crude Membrane Preparation—Cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES/Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA), and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with five strokes at 1400 rpm. Thereafter, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and the full procedure repeated. The final crude membrane preparation was resuspended in storage buffer (20 mm HEPES/Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml protein and stored at –80 °C. Total protein was quantified with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce using bovine serum albumin as standard. Co-immunoprecipitation of Receptor-G Protein Complexes—Crude membrane preparations were thawed on ice and solubilized by adding 20 mm CHAPS dissolved in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, to give a final concentration of 4 mm CHAPS (23Faussner A. Heinz-Erian P. Klier C. Roscher A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9442-9446Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight with 20 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) at 4 °C. The pellet obtained by centrifugation was washed as described above. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto nitrocellulose, the membrane was incubated with the indicated anti-HA or anti-Gq/11 antibodies (1:1000). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were plated on glass coverslips pretreated with 0.01% poly-d -lysine in PBS. For confocal microscopy, cells were washed with, and incubated for 2 h in, serum-free medium with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, before addition of rhodamine-labeled anti-HA antibody or stimulation with BK. Images were taken halfway through most of the cells with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 410) using a 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective with no zoom. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Aliquots of crude membrane preparations containing 20 μg of total protein each were incubated for 15 min on ice in 500 μl of 20 mm HEPES/Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GDP, containing 2 mm bacitracin, 0.8 mm 1.10-phenanthroline, 100 μm captopril including 105 cpm [35S]GTPγS in the absence or presence of 1 μm BK. Incubation was continued for 30 min in a water bath at 30 °C. Free and protein-bound [35S]GTPγS were separated by rapid filtration of the preparation through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C) and thorough washing of the filters with 15 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The radioactivity retained by the filters was determined in a β-counter using liquid scintillation mixture. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 mm GTP and subtracted from all values to give specific binding. Data Analysis—All data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism for Macintosh, version 3.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Mutation of Tyr305 Does Not Affect Ligand Affinity of B2R— The NPLVY sequence located in the C-terminal portion of transmembrane domain-7 of B2R (positions 301–305) represents the highly conserved NPXXY motif of family A-type GPCRs. To determine the structural and functional significance of this motif in B2R, Tyr305 was replaced by Ala (mutant receptor Y305A) and more conservatively by Phe (Y305F). Both mutants and the wt B2R were stably expressed in HEK293 cell using the Flp-In system. Because, in this expression system, the gene of interest is inserted in the identical position in the genome of the host cell through the transient action of a recombinase, we varied expression levels by using a vector with either the original cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for higher expression, or the minimal CMV promotor (PminCMV) for lower expression levels. Maximal binding capacities of the stable clones were estimated by incubation on ice with a saturating concentration of [3H]BK (10 nm). Mutant receptor Y305A exhibited considerably less surface binding (2.1 pmol/mg of protein) than either wt B2R (10.4 pmol/mg of protein) or mutant Y305F (12.5 pmol/mg of protein). Expression of the B2R under the control of the PminCMV promotor (4.4 pmol/mg of protein) was closer to the levels of the Y305A mutant expressed under the control of the CMV promotor. It should, however, be mentioned that even cells with a low expression profile produced copy numbers of B2R that were consistently higher than those observed in native cells, e.g. human foreskin fibroblasts. The differences observed in surface expression among the constructs using the Flp-In system (despite using the identical promotor) are likely caused by differences in cellular trafficking and transportation of the newly synthesized proteins. The affinities of B2R, whether expressed at high or low levels, and of the two mutant receptors did not differ markedly (see Table I), indicating that the mutations do not directly affect the ligand binding site.Table IBinding and functional properties of wild-type and mutant B2RConstruct (promoter)KDBmaxIP accumulation (30 min/50 mm LiC1/37 °C)BasalStimulatedEC50nmpmol/mg proteinnmB2R (CMV)4.71 ± 0.99 (3)10.41.93 ± 0.17 (7)12.86 ± 1.37 (7)0.79 ± 0.34 (4)B2R (PCMVmin)1.87 ± 0.36 (3)4.41.82 ± 0.19 (3)9.31 ± 1.69 (3)0.67 ± 0.22 (3)Y305A (CMV)2.82 ± 0.58 (5)2.11.88 ± 0.16 (5)16.78 ± 2.00 (5)1.16 ± 0.67 (3)Y305F (CMV)4.68 ± 0.58 (4)12.51.55 ± 0.06 (4)11.11 ± 1.11 (4)0.55 ± 0.15 (4) Open table in a new tab Exchange of Tyr305 with Phe or Ala Does Not Affect Internalization of [3H]BK—Replacement of the Tyr residue with Ala in the NPXXY motif of the β2-adrenergic receptor led to complete loss of receptor internalization (13Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Google Scholar). In other receptors such as the AT1A, the analogous mutation did not significantly reduce the uptake of the cognate ligand angiotensin-II (12Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Google Scholar). In the human B2R, exchange of Tyr305 with Phe or Ala did not reduce the internalization rate of [3H]BK by the mutant receptors Y305F and Y305A, respectively, as compared with the highly expressed wt B2R (Fig. 1). Whereas the Y305F behaved similarly to the wt receptor (plateau at ∼20% after 10 min), the reduction of surface binding was less pronounced for Y305A (plateau at 40% of initial surface binding) indicating impaired receptor sequestration but unchanged ligand internalization of the latter mutant (Fig. 1, inset). Mutant Receptor Y305A Is Characterized by Attenuated Sequestration—We have recently reported that cells strongly overexpressing B2R respond to a saturating concentration of BK (1 μm) only with poor sequestration of the receptors from the cell surface (also shown in Fig. 2), probably because of an overload of the internalization machinery (19Faussner A. Bauer A. Kalatskaya I. Jochum M. Fritz H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1909-H1916Google Scholar). For the sequestration assay, therefore, we used the lower expressing wt B2R (PCMVmin), which had an expression level closer to that of Y305A. This low expressing B2R clone responded with a strong decrease in surface binding (more than 75% within 10 min) when activated by 1 μm BK. By contrast, the Y305A mutant, which was expressed at even lower levels, dropped only to a plateau at 50% after 5 min (Fig. 2). The same tendency could be seen in long term down-regulation experiments (stimulation in culture medium with 10 μm BK in the presence of protease inhibitors but absence of fetal calf serum), where surface binding even of the high expressing B2R clone was reduced to approximately 20% after 24 h of stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, the low expressing B2R clone had already reached this level after 30 min in the presence of 1 μm BK (cf. Fig. 2). Conversely, the Y305A mutant still retained 40–60% of the initial surface binding even after 24 h of incubation (data not shown), indicating significantly impaired sequestration, probably because of increased receptor recycling and/or mobilization of intracellular pools of spare receptors. It should be mentioned that cells expressing either wt or mutant B2R responded to this prolonged stimulation with cell contraction and weakened adherence, indicating that they do not tolerate persistent receptor activation well, whereas control cells exposed to the same medium without BK retained a normal appearance. Mutant Receptors Stimulate Release of Total Inositol Phosphates and Do Not Exhibit Constitutive Activity—Next, we investigated the effects of the mutations on the main signaling pathway of the B2R, namely the activation of phospholipase C. To this purpose, we determined the accumulation of total IP without (basal activity) and after stimulation with 1 μm bradykinin (stimulated activity) for 30 min in the presence of 50 mm LiCl and expressed it as x-fold increase over IP levels at the beginning of the assay (see Table I). Both wt and mutant kinin receptors showed a low level of agonist-independent signaling, indicating that the mutations do not produce constitutively active receptors, as was reported for an analogous Tyr mutant of the 5HT2C serotonin receptor (6Rosendorff A. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Google Scholar). Wild-type B2R as well as Y305A and Y305F were able to stimulate a severalfold increase above basal level with similar EC50 (see Table I), demonstrating significant coupling to Gq/11 for all three kinin receptor variants. We did not observe a linear correlation between receptor number and IP response for transfections with the wild-type receptor, i.e. despite grossly different expression levels (10.4 pmol versus 4.4 pmol of receptor/mg of prote"
https://openalex.org/W2144479384,"ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is involved in regulation of intracellular lipid trafficking and export of cholesterol from cells to high density lipoproteins. ABCA1 defects cause Tangier disease, a disorder characterized by absence of high density lipoprotein and thrombocytopenia. In the present study we have demonstrated that ABCA1 is expressed in human platelets and that fibrinogen binding and CD62 surface expression in response to collagen and low concentrations of thrombin, but not to ADP, are defective in platelets from Tangier patients and ABCA1-deficient animals. The expression of platelet membrane receptors such as GPVI, α2β1 integrin, and GPIIb/IIIa, the collagen-induced changes in phosphatidylserine and cholesterol distribution, and the collagen-induced signal transduction examined by phosphorylation of LAT and p72syk and by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization were unaltered in Tangier platelets. The electron microscopy of Tangier platelets revealed reduced numbers of dense bodies and the presence of giant granules typically encountered in platelets from Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Further studies demonstrated impaired release of dense body content in platelets from Tangier patients and ABCA1-deficient animals. In addition, Tangier platelets were characterized by defective surface exposure of dense body and lysosomal markers (CD63, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, CD68) during collagen- and thrombin-induced stimulation and by abnormally high lysosomal pH. We conclude that intact ABCA1 function is necessary for proper maturation of dense bodies in platelets. The impaired release of the content of dense bodies may explain the defective activation of Tangier platelets by collagen and low concentrations of thrombin, but not by ADP.

Tangier disease is a monogenic disorder characterized by the virtual absence of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, deposition of cholesteryl ester in cells of reticuloendothelial systems, and premature atherosclerosis in a subset of patients (11Assman G.

These observations prompted us to systematically investigate the role of ABCA1 in platelet activation. We have provided evidence that ABCA1 is expressed in platelets and that its absence results in defective formation and release of dense bodies, followed by defective reactivity to collagen and low doses of thrombin. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-isomer I on celite (10%), mouse IgG-FITC, ADP, and α-thrombin were from Sigma. Sepharose CL-2B was from Amersham Biosciences. Annexin V-FITC (FITC to protein (F/P) molar ratio 1.0) was from Bender Medical Systems. Human fibrinogen (von Willebrandt-factor (vWf) and plasminogen-free) was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Monoclonal anti-CD62P and anti-CD63 antibodies and FITC-labeled antibodies against CD29 and GPIIb/IIIa were from Coulter-Immunotech Diagnostics. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD68, LAMP1, and LAMP2 were from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal antibody against α2 integrin clone Ab-1 was from Merck Biosciences. Phospho-specific antibodies against LAT and p72syk were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Fura-2/AM, mepacrine, NBD-phosphatidylserine, NBD-cholesterol, and LysoSensor Green DND-189 were from Molecular Probes. Convulxin was a generous gift from Prof. K. J. Clemetson, Theodor-Kocher-Institute, Bern, Switzerland. Patients—All studies were performed with blood donors who gave informed consent. Three male patients with Tangier disease were examined in this study: SB (56 years old), NA (brother of SB, 53 years old), and AF (65 years old). All patients presented with dyslipidemia, including total cholesterol <100 mg/ml, high density lipoprotein cholesterol <2 mg/ml, and mild hypertriglyceridemia. Patient NA presented with splenomegaly, patient SB suffered from peripheral neuropathy, and patient AF from coronary heart disease. Moderate thrombocytopenia was present in all three patients (SB: 107,000/μl; NA: 97,000/μl; AF: 104,000/μl). Prolonged in vitro bleeding time (PFA-100; DADE-Behring) in collagen/epinephrine stimulation was observed in patients SB and NA. Coagulation parameters (PT, APTT, TT) were normal in all patients. The defect of ABCA1 was characterized on the molecular level in all patients. In patient AF, a 1-bp deletion in exon 14 led to a stop codon at amino acid position 635, resulting in the deletion of most of the protein sequence, including both ATP cassettes. In patients SB and NA, large chromosomal deletions starting in intron 39 led to a partial deletion of the second ATP cassette and the cytoplasmic C-terminal fragment. For controls, samples were obtained from age-matched, male, healthy volunteers. All subjects included in the study did not take any medication that could affect platelet function for at least 2 weeks before the study. ABCA1 “Knock-out” Animals—Gene targeting of ABCA1 was performed using B6 embryonic stem cells according to standard procedures. ABCA1 genomic sequences were isolated from a λ-Fix mouse genomic library (provided by Stratagene) made of leukocyte DNA from mouse strain C57BL/6. A neoR-gene was introduced into exon 2 of the gene by cloning an ∼4.4-kb DNA fragment containing part of exon 2, intron 2, exon 3, and part of intron 3 into the NotI-XhoI site of the vector pPNT (left arm). A 2.6-kb DNA fragment extending from the KpnI site located upstream of exon 2 to the middle part of exon 2 was cloned into the KpnI-BamH1 sites of the vector pPNT (right arm). After electroporation followed by two-step selection with G418 and ganciclovir, four clones showing homologous recombination were identified. Three of these were used to generate chimeric mice that were subsequently crossed with C57Bl/6 mice, resulting in germ line transmission of the targeted allele. Preparation of Platelets—Preparation of platelets by gel filtration on Sephadex CL-2B has been described elsewhere (17Kehrel B.E. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were equilibrated in buffer A containing 127 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, 0.42 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 12 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, 3.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.35. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Fibrinogen Binding or Antigen Expression on Platelet Surface—Flow cytometric analysis of fibrinogen binding or antigen expression on platelet surface was performed exactly as described previously (18Dormann D. Clemetson K.J. Kehrel B. Blood. 2000; 96: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Kehrel B.E. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, human fibrinogen was conjugated with FITC using the FITC-celite method according to Xia et al. (20Xia Z. Wong T. Liu Q. Kasirer-Friede A. Brown E. Frojmovic M.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Platelet suspensions (0.2 ml) preincubated for 3 min at room temperature with 0.15 mg/ml fibrinogen-FITC were added to 20 μl of a solution containing increasing concentrations of collagen, thrombin, or ADP. The reaction was stopped after 180 s by fixation in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min. For antigen expression analysis, FITC-coupled monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD62, CD63, CD68, LAMP1, or LAMP2 were added after fixation for 1 h at room temperature. The concentrations required for saturated binding of antibodies were determined beforehand. Platelet Aggregation—Platelet aggregation was monitored as described by Born (21Born G.V. Cross M.J. J. Physiol. 1963; 168: 178-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet count was adjusted with autologous plasma. Aggregation from PRP platelets was monitored by assessing light transmission in an aggregometer (Lumitec), with continuous stirring at 1100 rpm at 37 °C. Analysis of Annexin-V-FITC and Convulxin-FITC Binding to Platelets—Gel-filtered platelets were diluted to 2.5 × 107 cells/ml with buffer B containing 127 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, 0.42 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 12 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 4 mmol/liter CaCl2, 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, 3.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.35. Platelets (0.2 ml) were activated with an agonist for 25 min, incubated with 1.5 μg/ml annexin-FITC for an additional 15 min in the dark, diluted, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To estimate the expression of GPVI on platelet surface, convulxin-FITC was used. Convulxin was incubated with FITC using the FITC-celite method according to Xia et al. (20Xia Z. Wong T. Liu Q. Kasirer-Friede A. Brown E. Frojmovic M.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of FITC to convulxin was 100:1. Platelets were incubated with 20 ng/ml convulxin-FITC for 3 min, fixed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Assay for Inward Movement of Phosphatidylserine (PS) and Cholesterol—Fluorescent PS and cholesterol analogs were inserted into the plasma membrane of platelets as described by Sleight and Pagano (22Sleight R.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBD-PS or NBD-cholesterol dissolved in chloroform was mixed with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine in a molar ratio 1:3, transferred to a glass tube, dried under nitrogen, and solubilized in absolute ethanol. The solution (1% of the final volume) was injected under vortexing into phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.5% albumin (v/v). The final concentration of fluorescent analogs in the labeling solution was 20 μmol/liter. Platelets were suspended in the labeling solution (108 cells/ml), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark, centrifuged, and resuspended in buffer A. For determination of the inward transport of NBD-PS, platelets were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 2 and 37 °C, the former temperature corresponding to the passive and the latter to the active transmembranous transport. For determination of the inward transport of NBD-cholesterol, platelets were incubated for 2 min with the agonist. The amount of internalized fluorescent lipid analogues was determined by the selective reduction of NBD-lipids on the outer monolayer by dithionite according to McIntyre and Sleight (23McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 32: 12420-12426Google Scholar). Dithionite was added to the cell suspension to the final concentration of 5 mmol/liter, and the decrease of fluorescence reflecting the amount of NBD analogues remaining in the outer monolayer was monitored at 540 nm (excitation 480 nm) with a Hitachi 2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Thereafter, platelets were permeabilized with 5% digitonine, and the further decrease of fluorescence was monitored. This decrease reflected the amount of fluorescent analogues taken up by the cell during active inward transport. The amount of NBD-lipids residing inside the cells was expressed as percentage of total fluorescent labeling. Analysis of Dense Granule Release with Mepacrine—Gel-filtered platelets were diluted to 2.5 × 107 platelets/ml in buffer A. 0.8 ml of platelet suspension was incubated for 20 min with 5 μmol/liter mepacrine. Platelets were activated with 50 μl of solution containing increasing concentrations of thrombin and collagen. The reactions were stopped after 180 s by fixation with 1% formaldehyde. Platelets were washed and analyzed in a flow cytometer. Estimation of pH in Lysosomal Compartment—Gel-filtered platelets were diluted to 2.5 × 107 platelets/ml in buffer A and incubated for 30 min with LysoSensor Green DND-189. The fluorescence of platelets was then analyzed by flow cytometry. Determination of the Intracellular Ca2+Concentration—Intracellular Ca2+ measurements were performed using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence probe Fura-2/AM according to established methods (24Nofer J.R.

Western Blotting—Western blotting of proteins from cell lysates was performed exactly as described previously (25Nofer J.R. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Loading controls were performed with an antibody against a ubiquitously expressed protein (α-actin). Electron Microscopy of Platelets—Electron microscopy of platelets was performed exactly as described previously (26Morgenstern E. Neumann K. Patscheke H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar). ABCA1 Expression in Human Platelets—Initially we examined whether ABCA1 is expressed in human platelets. As shown in Fig. 1A, ABCA1 was recognized in platelet extracts by a specific anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody. The amount of ABCA1 present in platelets appeared to be comparable with that in macrophages and fibroblasts stimulated with liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist and higher than in unstimulated fibroblasts. No ABCA1 expression could be observed in platelets from Tangier patients (Fig. 1A). The expression of ABCA1 in normal platelets was further confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B, left panel). The binding of the anti-ABCA1 antibody to the cell surface was concentration-dependent and exhibited saturation at higher concentrations, indicating that, similar to nucleated cells, ABCA1 is present in plasma membranes of platelets. By contrast, anti-ABCA1 binding to the cell surface was much reduced in platelets from Tangier patients (Fig. 1B, right panel). Agonist-induced Activation of Tangier Platelets—To assess platelet activation in ABCA1 deficiency, we examined the agonist-induced increase in the number of bound fibrinogen molecules and the exposure of CD62 on the platelet surface. These parameters reflect the rate of platelet aggregation and the extent of platelet secretory responses, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, stimulation of control platelets with low concentrations of collagen, thrombin, and ADP led to an abrupt increase in fibrinogen-FITC and anti-CD62 binding. Both responses reached a plateau at higher agonist concentrations. ABCA1-deficient platelets were markedly less responsive to collagen across the whole agonist concentration range, both with respect to fibrinogen-FITC binding and CD62 surface exposure. Similarly, thrombin-induced fibrinogen-FITC binding and CD62 surface exposure were reduced in Tangier platelets stimulated with low concentrations of thrombin. However, higher thrombin concentrations led to comparable responses both in control and Tangier platelets. No significant differences in fibrinogen-FITC binding and CD62 surface exposure were found between control and Tangier platelets stimulated with ADP. To prove unequivocally whether collagen-induced platelet activation is defective in ABCA1 deficiency, we extended our study to platelets from ABCA1 knock-out animals. As shown in Fig. 3, the collagen-induced fibrinogen-FITC binding and CD62 surface exposure were much reduced in ABCA1-deficient platelets. However, both responses to thrombin were comparable in ABCA1-deficient and control platelets. Agonist-induced Aggregation in Tangier Platelets—The impaired fibrinogen binding and CD62 exposure in response to collagen observed in ABCA1-deficient platelets would be expected to translate into differences in platelet aggregation. Thus, we next compared collagen-induced aggregation in Tangier and normal platelets. As shown in Fig. 4, both the extent and the rate of platelet aggregation were severely impaired in Tangier platelets stimulated with 0.5 or 1.0 μg/ml collagen. Expression of Membrane Receptors in Tangier Platelets—Abnormal expression of platelet membrane receptors could account for the inadequate responses to agonists seen in ABCA1-deficient platelets. Therefore, we next examined the expression of collagen receptors GPVI and integrin α2β1 as well as fibrinogen receptor GPIIb-IIIa in platelets from Tangier patients and control subjects. No significant differences in the surface expression of integrin α2β1, GPIIb-IIIa, and GPVI were noticed between platelets from persons with and without Tangier disease. Phospholipid and Cholesterol Translocation in Tangier Platelets—ABCA1 has been postulated to act as phospholipid and/or cholesterol translocase. Because dysregulation of lipid distribution could account for the impaired response of ABCA1-deficient platelets to collagen, we next examined the translocation of PS and cholesterol across the plasma membrane in agonist-stimulated platelets. No differences in the exposure of negatively charged phospholipids on gel-filtered platelets as determined by annexin V-FITC binding could be observed between control and Tangier platelets stimulated with increasing concentrations of collagen or A23187, a calcium ionophore. To follow the inward PS movement across plasma membranes, platelets were loaded with NBD-PS and incubated for 30 min at 37 or 2 °C to sustain or inhibit active NBD-PS transport, respectively. As expected, substantially less NBD-PS was accessible to dithionite in platelets incubated at 37 °C, indicating that that portion of NBD-PS was translocated from the exo- to the endofacial leaflet of cell membrane. However, the redistribution of NBD-PS within platelet membranes was comparable in Tangier and control platelets (not shown). To investigate the agonist-induced translocation of cholesterol, platelets loaded with NBD-cholesterol were stimulated with collagen for 2 min, and than NBD-associated fluorescence was quenched with dithionite. Similar amounts of NBD-cholesterol were moved out of the outer monolayer in control and Tangier platelets (not shown). Collectively, these results show that phosphatidylserine and cholesterol translocation mechanisms are not affected by ABCA1 deficiency. Collagen-induced Signaling in Tangier Platelets—Collagen-induced platelet activation is preceded by induction of intracellular signaling pathways. To investigate whether signal transduction by collagen is impaired in Tangier platelets, several signaling events located both proximal and distal to collagen receptor activation were examined. The time course of LAT and p72syk phosphorylation was similar in collagen-activated platelets from Tangier and control platelets (not shown). Furthermore, no differences between Tangier and control platelets could be observed with respect to collagen-induced calcium mobilization (not shown). Recent studies revealed that expression of several small G proteins with a potential to regulate platelet activation is dysregulated in cells from Tangier disease (27Hirano K. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Zhang Z. Matsuyama A. Takaishi K. Komuro R. Suehiro T. Yamashita S. Takai Y. Matsuzawa Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, no major differences in the expression levels of Cdc42 and Rac1 could be observed between Tangier and normal platelets in this study (not shown). Electron Microscopy of Tangier Platelets—To gain further insight into the origins of the activation defect associated with ABCA1 deficiency, ultrastructural studies were performed. Fig. 5 shows platelet sections obtained from one patient with Tangier disease and a control subject. It is evident that several structures that are typical for platelet morphology, including α-granules, microtubules, the dense tubular system, and the surface-connected canalicular system, were normal in Tangier cells. A distinct feature of Tangier platelets was a relatively low number of dense bodies. In addition, unusually large and electron-dense structures closely resembling the giant granules typically encountered in platelets from Chediak-Higashi syndrome were noted. Function of Dense Bodies in Tangier Platelets—The presence of reduced and/or irregular dense bodies (δ-granules) as a result of ABCA1 deficiency could account for the defective platelet activation. Therefore, we attempted to more closely characterize the function of dense bodies in Tangier platelets. To this end, platelets were loaded with mepacrine, a fluorescent dye known to accumulate specifically in δ-granules. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, when stimulated with increasing concentrations of collagen and thrombin, Tangier platelets released mepacrine to a much lesser extent than their normal counterparts. To further characterize the release of dense granules from platelets upon agonist stimulation, we determined the surface exposure of CD63, a glycoprotein regarded as a specific marker of organelles of lysosomal origin (i.e. δ- and λ-granules). As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, activation of control platelets led to a concentration-dependent increase in anti-CD63 binding to platelet surfaces in collagen- and thrombin-stimulated platelets. By contrast, CD63 surface exposure was severely impaired in Tangier platelets stimulated with collagen and reduced when thrombin was used as an agonist. Similar to Tangier platelets, the impaired release of mepacrine could also be observed in collagen-stimulated platelets from ABCA1-deficient animals (Fig. 6E). The functional abnormality of lysosomal granules in Tangier platelets was further documented by estimating their pH with LysoSensor, a fluorescent pH indicator that specifically partitions into acidic organelles. As shown in Fig. 6F, Tangier platelets incubated with LysoSensor displayed much lower fluorescence intensity than normal platelets, indicating a higher pH value of δ- and λ-granules and other organelles of lysosomal origin. Agonist-induced Lysosome Release in Tangier Platelets—In addition to dense bodies, lysosomes (λ-granules) are also released from platelets upon activation with agonists. By analogy to δ-granules, we were interested whether ABCA1 deficiency is associated with defective release of lysosomes from platelets. Therefore, we examined the surface expression of several lysosomal markers in platelets stimulated with thrombin and collagen. As shown in Fig. 7, both agonists induced concentration-dependent binding of antibodies against LAMP1, LAMP2, and CD68 to the platelet surface. By contrast, the exposure of all lysosomal markers was severely impaired in Tangier platelets. The defective externalization of lysosomal markers was seen both in collagen- and thrombin-activated platelets. The present study has demonstrated for the first time that ABCA1 is expressed in human platelets. The amount of ABCA1 in platelets as estimated by Western blotting was comparable with that found in cells known to efficiently export cholesterol. In addition, we found that, similar to nucleated cells, ABCA1 is present on the surface of platelets. These observations are consistent with the notion that ABCA1 may be involved in the regulation of platelet function, which prompted us to investigate systematically agonist-induced platelet activation in ABCA1 deficiency. We have demonstrated that platelets from both Tangier patients and ABCA1 knock-out animals are impaired in their ability to respond to collagen and, to a much lesser extent, to thrombin stimulation. By contrast, ADP-induced activation remained intact in platelets from Tangier patients. Previous investigations of platelet activation in Tangier disease led to conflicting results. Similar to our findings, Harmon et al. (15Harmon J.T. Tandon N.N. Hoeg J.M. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1986; 68: 498-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed an impaired activation of platelets in the presence of low, but not high, concentrations of thrombin. Shastri et al. (13Shastri K.M. Carvalho A.C.A. Lees R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 467-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found normal platelet activation by collagen but an impaired response to ADP and epinephrine. In contrast to these studies, hyper-responsiveness to aggregating agents and increased thromboxane B2 production were reported by Vergani et al. (14Vergani C.G. Plancher A.C. Zuin M. Cattaneo M. Tramaloni C. Maccari S. Roma P. Catapano A.L. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 14: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although reasons for these discrepancies remain unknown, it must be stressed that the present study is the first one in which platelet function was tested in humans or animals with defined molecular defects. Phenotypes closely resembling Tangier disease are known to be caused by defects of proteins other than ABCA1 (28Mott S. Yu L. Marcil M. Boucher B. Rondeau C. Genest Jr., J. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it cannot be excluded that some contradictory results reported previously were a consequence of misidentification of Tangier subjects. Alternatively, the hypo- or hyper-responsiveness of Tangier platelets to various agonists might reflect the wide diversity of molecular defects encountered within ABCA1 that may have inhibiting or activating influences on platelet function. It is generally assumed that ABCA1 functions as a translocase involved in the movement of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and/or cholesterol across the plasma membrane (29Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciano M.F. Toti F. Haslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNaish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The distribution of lipids between both monolayers of the plasma membrane undergoes tight regulation in platelets; its perturbation may result in an impaired platelet activation. For instance, the defect of the transmembranous PS transport seen in platelets from Scott syndrome is associated with defective signaling from collagen receptors, abnormal platelet function, and prolonged bleeding time (30Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J.M. Fressinaud E. Toti F. Freyssinet J.M. Nurden A.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Esmon C.T. Weiss H.J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17049-17057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the defective response of Tangier platelets to collagen stimulation might be related to a distorted plasma membrane asymmetry followed by a dysregulation of intracellular signaling. However, we failed to observe any changes in PS externalization or the inward cholesterol translocation in agonist-stimulated Tangier platelets as compared with normal platelets. Neither was the inward PS movement disturbed in these cells. In addition, treatment of Tangier platelets with collagen initiated regular signal transduction, both with respect to signaling events proximal (phosphorylation of LAT and p72syk) and distal (Ca2+ mobilization) to collagen receptors. Cdc42 and Rac1 are important elements of collagen-induced signaling in platelets, and subnormal expression of Cdc42 in cells from patients with Tangier disease has been reported recently (27Hirano K. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Zhang Z. Matsuyama A. Takaishi K. Komuro R. Suehiro T. Yamashita S. Takai Y. Matsuzawa Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, normal small G-protein levels were found in Tangier platelets. Finally, normal expression levels of collagen receptors, integrin α2β1, and GPVI were observed in Tangier platelets. Taken together, our results argue strongly against the notion that the impaired platelet activation by collagen in Tangier disease results from abnormal lipid distribution in plasma membrane and/or dysregulation of collagen receptor-dependent intracellular signaling. The functional impairment of dense bodies is a distinguishing feature of platelets in ABCA1 deficiency. It is well established that liberation of several potent agonists, including ADP and serotonin, from dense granules in response to agonists provides a major contribution to platelet activation. Compared with other agonists, collagen appears to have particularly strong dependence upon the co-secretion of ADP for full activation. Several studies demonstrated suppression of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding in the presence of apyrase, an enzyme that specifically destroys ADP (32Ardlie N.G. Garrett J.J. Bell L.K. Thromb. Res. 1986; 42: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Atkinson B.T. Stafford M.J. Pears C.J. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5242-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, collagen-induced platelet reactivity could be completely blocked by a soluble form of CD39, an endothelial ecto-enzyme with ADPase and ATPase activity (34Gayle III, R.B. Maliszewski C.R. Gimpel S.D. Schoenborn M.A. Caspary R.G. Richards C. Brasel K. Price V. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Chediak-Higashi platelets, which similar to Tangier platelets have a decreased number of dense granules, are characterized by defective aggregation and fibrinogen binding to collagen but not to ADP (35Legrand C. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, it seems reasonable to assume that the impaired collagen-induced platelet reactivity in ABCA1 deficiency is a consequence of the defective dense body function and decreased liberation of agonists from δ-granules during activation. The presence of reduced dense bodies and giant granules in Tangier platelets suggests a defect in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles in these cells. Similar giant granules seen in Chediak-Higashi syndrome likely arise as a consequence of impaired fission/fusion events that determine the size of lysosomes and related organelles (36Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Huizing M. Anikster Y. Gahl W.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). By analogy, defective vesicle fusion could arise in Tangier platelets as a consequence of ABCA1 deficiency. The results of recent studies on cellular localization and trafficking of ABCA1 provide some evidence to support this contention. In a fibroblast cell line, ABCA1 was shown to reside on the surface of both small and large vesicles likely representing early and late endosomes, respectively (38Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The latter compartment is a direct precursor of lysosomes and is equivalent to lamellar bodies in platelets, where δ-granules are thought to be sorted (39Heijinen H.F.G. Debili N. Vainchencker W. Breton-Gorius J. Geuze H.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2313-2325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ABCA1-containing early endosomes were found to undergo continuous fusion and fission events and to interact transiently with late endocytic vesicles and with the plasma membrane (38Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, it is seems likely that ABCA1 is involved in endosomal sorting and, as a consequence, ABCA1 defects might result in distorted maturation of lysosomes and/or lysosome-related organelles. Actually, large and morphologically abnormal lysosomes were found in macrophages from Tangier patients (40Robenek H. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1991; 11: 1007-1020Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, impaired activity of lysosomal enzymes (i.e. phospholipase A1) because of abnormally high pH was observed in Tangier fibroblasts. 2U. Seedorf, unpublished observations. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that the presence of reduced dense bodies and giant granules in Tangier platelets is a consequence of defective ABCA1-mediated regulation of endosomal sorting and distorted δ-granule maturation. In conclusion, ABCA1 is expressed in human platelets, and its proper function appears to be necessary for normal δ-granule maturation and release. Consequently, ABCA1-deficient platelets are defective in their ability to respond to collagen and low concentrations of thrombin, but not to ADP. We thank Y. Lang and C. Kuhn for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2054483928,"Degradation of many short-lived cellular proteins such as the transcription factor MyoD occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. MyoD, similar to many rapidly degraded regulatory factors, interacts with several high affinity binding partners, including members of the Id (inhibitors of DNA binding) family. Following transfection to HeLa cells, Id1 is localized to the nucleus and rapidly (t1/2 ∼ 1 h) degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mutagenesis of lysine residues within the putative nuclear localization region (amino acids 68-82) directs Id1NLS to the cytoplasm yet confers an increased rate of degradation (t1/2 ∼ 0.5 h). Id1 in which all lysine residues were mutagenized to alanine (lysineless Id1) was also rapidly degraded (t1/2 ∼ 0.6 h). Addition of a Myc6 tag to the N terminus of lysine-less Id1 markedly stabilized Id1 (t1/2 > 10 h) and suggests degradation via the N terminus-dependent pathway. Co-transfection of MyoD with Id1 or Id1NLS increases Id1 or Id1NLS within the nucleus and markedly reduces the rate of Id1 or Id1NLS degradation. These results thus demonstrate that in vivo MyoD modulates the rate of Id1 degradation and suggest a dynamic interplay of these factors.

These results thus demonstrate that in vivo MyoD modulates the rate of Id1 degradation and suggest a dynamic interplay of these factors. Degradation of many short-lived cellular proteins, such as transcription factors, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle regulators, occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Google Scholar, 2Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Google Scholar, 3Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Google Scholar). Through this pathway, proteins are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome via the formation of a polyubiquitin chain. The process begins with activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; Id, inhibitor of DNA-binding; NLS, nuclear localization sequence(s); NES, nuclear export sequence(s); TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; LMB, leptomycin B; HA, hemagglutinin; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. followed by transfer of ubiquitin to E2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2 shuttles the ubiquitin molecule to the substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase (E3), which then delivers the ubiquitin to the substrate to be degraded. Initially, it was thought that ubiquitination occurred only through a lysine-dependent ubiquitination pathway in which ubiquitin is covalently attached to the substrate protein via an amide linkage to the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-429Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the N terminus of a protein substrate may also serve as the site of ubiquitination (5Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 6Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Google Scholar, 7Reinstein E. Scheffner M. Oren M. Ciechanover A.

Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Google Scholar), a pathway termed N terminus-dependent ubiquitination. Via either ubiquitination pathway, polyubiquitin chain formation continues by the conjugation of subsequent ubiquitin moieties to the attached ubiquitin, and the substrate-ubiquitin conjugate is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. Isopeptidases cleave the ubiquitin chain, and the single ubiquitin molecules are recycled (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-429Google Scholar). Currently, the relative contribution of each of these two pathways has been described only for MyoD (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). Among the short-lived proteins degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system are several transcription factors including MyoD, a key regulator of muscle differentiation (10Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L.S. Rudnick M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that both of the two (lysine-dependent and N terminus-dependent) pathways are responsible for the rapid degradation of MyoD in vitro and in vivo (5Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 11Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell.

Degradation of MyoD occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, however, the lysine-dependent and N terminus-dependent pathways play differential roles within these subcellular compartments (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). A nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system also appears to be responsible for the degradation of several other transcription factors (13Freiman R.N. Tijian R. Cell. 2003; 112: 11-17Google Scholar, 14Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Google Scholar, 15Blondel M. Galan J.-M. Chi Y. Lafourcade C. Longaretti C.

Biol. 2001; 24: 8521-8532Google Scholar) require nuclear export prior to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Many of the rapidly degraded transcription factors and oncoproteins have regulatory high affinity binding partners. Among these is MyoD, which can form inactive (non-DNA binding) heterodimers with members of the Id family. The four Id (inhibitors of DNA-binding) members are helix-loop-helix proteins that contain no basic region, and thus do not bind DNA. However, they are able to dimerize with one another and with MyoD and its family members, albeit with various affinities (23Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 24Edmonston D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Google Scholar, 25Benezra R. Rafii S. Lyden D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8334-8341Google Scholar). Langlands et al. (26Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Google Scholar) reported Id1 as the most active in terms of MyoD binding. Overexpression of Id protein inhibits MyoD-mediated muscle development in vitro (27Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar). Thus, Id proteins are negative regulators of cell differentiation. The turnover of Id proteins appears to be rapid (28Bounpheng M.A. Dimas J.J. Dodds S.G. Christy B.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2257-2264Google Scholar, 29Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 314: 505-512Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms and subcellular locus involved in Id degradation is unknown as is its role in MyoD degradation and vice versa. In the present study we show that Id1 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system within the nucleus and that interaction with MyoD modulates the degradation of Id1. The importance of these observations lies in understanding the alterations in cellular protein degradation in physiological and pathophysiological states. Plasmids and Construction of MyoD, MyoDNLS, Id1, and Id1 Mutants—Wild type MyoD and MyoDNLS both in the pCIneo vector have been previously described (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A.

Id1 in pcDNA3 was a gift from Burton Wice. Preparation of the NLS and lysine-less mutants of Id1 was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. N-blocked Id1 and N-blocked lysine-less Id1 were prepared by insertion of various tags (HA, sic1p, and myc) into pcDNA3, on the N terminus of Id1 (see below). sic1p in YCplacIII was a gift from David Pellman. Foxj1 in pcDNA3 was from Brian Hackett. DNA sequencing using Big Dye version 3.1 (ABI Biosystems) was used to confirm all sequences. Cell Culture—HeLa cells, which were selected because they do not express MyoD and express Id1 at only minimally detectable levels, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen) and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfections (efficiency ∼40- 60%) were performed using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and cells were analyzed 16-24 h later. Immunofluorescent Localization of Id1 and Id1 Mutants—Subcellular localization of Id1 and its mutants in HeLa cells was determined by direct immunofluoresence using the rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 antibody (1:300 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20) followed by incubation with a Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chain) (Molecular Probes). MG132 (20 μm, Peptides International) or leptomycin B (10 nm, Sigma) were added to cells 2 h prior to fixation where indicated. MG132 was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO. Leptomycin B was prepared as a 10 μm solution in ethanol. Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope and 10-20 random fields of each culture condition were photographed (magnification ×40) using a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Google Scholar), 16-24 h after transfection the HeLa cells were incubated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml, Sigma) to inhibit further protein synthesis. MG132 (20 μm) or leptomycin B (10 nm) were added along with the cycloheximide as noted. The cells were then lysed after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% Igepal, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin for at least 30 min after which the cells were sonicated then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris. The lysates were mixed with an equal amount of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and equal amounts of each sample were run on an 18% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (Osmonics). The blots were probed with polyclonal anti-Id1D antibody (1:300 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and detection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting bands were quantitated using the Kodak EDAS system and the data were graphed using the Excel graphing program (Microsoft). The degradation rate is expressed as half-life (t1/2), the time for degradation of 50% of the Id1. Each of the constructs was evaluated by generally three to six independent determinations of t1/2. The data are expressed generally as mean ± S.E. Localization of Id1 and MyoD—HeLa cells were co-transfected with Id1 and MyoD in a molar ratio of 1:1. Subcellular localization of Id1 was determined by indirect immunofluoresence using the rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 antibody (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20) followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chain) (Jackson Immunochemical). MyoD was probed using the mouse monoclonal anti-MyoD (1:100 dilution, Vector Labs, NCL-MyoD1) followed by incubation with a TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain) (Jackson Immunochemical). Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope and 10-20 random fields of each culture condition were photographed (magnification ×40) using a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera. Cells were scored and the percent of cells expressing nuclear Id1 or MyoD was determined as previously described (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). Degradation of Id1/MyoD—HeLa cells were co-transfected with MyoD and Id1NLS or MyoDNLS and Id1 in a 1:1 ratio. 16-24 h after transfection the HeLa cells were incubated with cycloheximide to inhibit further protein synthesis. The half-life experiments on Id1, Id1NLS, MyoD, and MyoDNLS were described previously. The cell lysates were run on a 12% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad), and the blots were probed with polyclonal anti-Id1 or polyclonal anti-MyoD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, M-318) in dilutions of 1:100 followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and detection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the pathway of Id1 degradation we transfected Id1 cDNA into HeLa cells. Following transfection of Id1 cDNA, Id1 is localized (∼72%) to the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Nucleoli are negative. As seen in Fig. 1B, Id1 is rapidly degraded (t1/2 ∼ 1 h). Incubation of cells with MG132, a potent and selective inhibitor of the proteasome, markedly slowed the rate of Id1 degradation (t1/2 ∼ 9 h). These observations suggest that Id1 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Many nuclear proteins appear to be degraded following export from the nucleus, whereas others appear to be degraded within the nucleus. To determine whether Id1 cycles into and out of the nucleus, and ultimately to determine the locus of its degradation, we sought to determine whether Id1 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that targets it to the nucleus. Evaluation of the Id1 amino acid sequence reveals only one region of high positive charge density (amino acids 68-84: RLKELVPTLPQNRKVSK). We thus generated a mutant of Id1 (termed Id1NLS) in which amino acids Arg68, Lys70, Arg80, Lys81, and Lys84 were substituted with alanine. Following transfection into HeLa cells, Id1NLS was localized both to the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Scoring of transfected cells were revealed to be 72% predominantly cytoplasmic and 28% predominantly nuclear (see below, Table II). This is in contrast to wild type Id1, which is 72% nuclear. The rate of degradation of Id1NLS was 0.5 ± 0.1 h (Table I, Fig. 2B), and was markedly prolonged by incubation with MG132 (Fig. 2B). Thus, this region (amino acids 68-84) is necessary to confer nuclear localization upon Id1.Table IIEffect of coexpression of Id1 and MyoD on subcellular localization and rates of degradationConstructLocalizationRate of degradationId1MyoDId1MyoD% nucleart½ in hAId1NLS280.5 ± 0.1MyoD990.9 ± 0.1Id1NLS/MyoD58971.5 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.1BId1721.0 ± 0.1MyoDNLS91.5 ± 0.1Id1/MyoDNLS52161.8 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.2CId1721.0 ± 0.1MyoD980.9 ± 0.1Id1/MyoD87961.5 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IRates of degradation of lysine mutants of Id1Amino acid residueRate of degradationNLS−MG132LMB219718285t½ in hId1KKKKK1.0 ± 0.1 (33)14 ± 4.5 (8)0.9 ± 0.1 (5)Id1K2AAKKKK1.1 ± 0.5 (2)13 ± 1.0 (2)0.9 ± 0.2 (2)Id1NLSKKAAA0.5 ± 0.1 (24)4.8 ± 1.0 (9)0.5 ± 0.1 (5)Id1NLS,K2,19AAAAAA0.6 ± 0.1 (8)4.0 ± 1.7 (2)0.6 ± 0.2 (2) Open table in a new tab As many nuclear transcription factors undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, the incomplete localization of Id1NLS to the cytoplasm may be the result of a minimally functional or absent nuclear export signal. To determine whether an exportin-mediated nuclear export sequence signal on Id1 is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling we incubated cells expressing Id1NLS with leptomycin B (LMB). LMB covalently binds to exportin-1/CRM1 and irreversibly inhibits nuclear export mediated via this pathway. The presence of LMB does not alter the localization of Id1. Furthermore, the rate of degradation of Id1NLS (t1/2 ∼ 0.5 h) was unaltered in the presence of LMB (Fig. 2B) (Table I). These results suggest that LMB-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic export is not a significant pathway for Id1. Because Id1NLS was rapidly degraded, in fact more rapidly than wild type Id1, and because Id1NLS has three of the five lysine (Lys) residues mutated to alanine (Ala), it is possible that one or both of the remaining lysine residues (Lys2 or Lys19) are targets for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To address this, Id1 mutants with modification of each of the lysine residues were generated and the rates of degradation of the resultant proteins were examined. As seen in Table I, Id1K2A was rapidly degraded (t1/2 ∼ 1.1 h). Similarly Id1K2R, Id1NLS,K2A, and Id1NLS,K2A,K19A (also termed lysine-less Id1) are each rapidly degraded (t1/2 ∼ 0.6, 0.7, and 0.6 h, respectively) (Table I). Incubation with MG132 markedly slowed the rate of degradation of each of these mutants (Table I). Furthermore, wild type Id1 was localized to the nucleus, whereas Id1NLS and Id1NLS,K2A,K19A (data not shown) were each predominantly localized to the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. These results demonstrate that Id1 is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system although this occurs independent of its (five) lysine residues. To determine whether the free N terminus of Id1 is necessary for its rapid degradation, a series of Id1 mutants were generated in which various inserts were placed at the N terminus of either wild type Id1 or lysine-less Id1. Previous work demonstrated that an N-terminal addition of Myc6 tags (78 amino acids), or alternatively deletion of 11 amino acids from the N terminus of the parent protein, was required to stabilize the degradation of lysine-less MyoD, LMP1, and E7 (5Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 6Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Google Scholar, 7Reinstein E. Scheffner M. Oren M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5944-5950Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies on sic1p have demonstrated that the lysine-less protein is stable and the N-terminal 31 amino acids do not contain a degradation recognition motif (30Petroski M.D. Deschaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Google Scholar). Thus, we generated a mutant of lysine-less Id1 that contained a 78-amino acid, Myc6 tag at the N terminus. When expressed in HeLa cells, this Myc6-lysine-less Id1 was stable (t1/2 = > 10 h, Fig. 3). No additional stability was conferred by MG132 addition. To determine whether this N-terminal block by the Myc6 tag was the result of a simple bulk addition (78 amino acid residues), we examined the stability of HA7-lysine-less Id1, with 63 amino acids added to the N terminus. HA7-lysine-less Id1 is also rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 0.7 ± 0.1 h). We then generated another lysine-less Id1 mutant with the N-terminal 30 amino acids of sic1p, sic1p-HA6-lysine-less Id1 (an 84 amino acid residue addition), which is also rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 0.7 ± 0.1 h) but stabilized in the presence of MG132 (t1/2 = 4.2 h). Thus, the particular nature of the N-terminal addition, not simply its size, is necessary for abrogation of N-terminal recognition. To determine whether MyoD interacts with Id1 in vivo and alters the rate of Id1 degradation we transfected HeLa cells with various Id1 and MyoD constructs. Initially we selected MyoD and Id1NLS because interaction of the two might direct Id1NLS to the nucleus via the NLS of MyoD. We evaluated both localization and rate of degradation of Id1NLS and MyoD. As seen in Table II, MyoD expressed alone is localized to the nucleus (99%) and degraded with a t1/2 ∼ 0.9 h as we have shown earlier (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). Id1NLS, as seen above, is 28% nuclear and is degraded with a t1/2 ∼ 0.5 h (Table II). Transfection of both MyoD and Id1NLS resulted in a marked increase in Id1NLS nuclear localization (28 → 58%) and decrease in the rate of Id1NLS degradation (t1/2 ∼ 1.5 h) (Table II). The rate of degradation of MyoD was unaltered by the presence of Id1NLS, as was its localization (Table II). These results demonstrate that MyoD is able to direct Id1NLS to the nucleus and that MyoD slows the rate of Id1NLS degradation. Next, cells were cotransfected with Id1 and MyoDNLS and similar analyses were performed. As seen in Table II, MyoDNLS is localized to the cytoplasm (9% nuclear) and is degraded with a t1/2 ∼ 1.5 h ± 0.2 similar to that seen earlier (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). Transfection of Id1 and MyoDNLS resulted in an increase in MyoDNLS nuclear localization (9% → 16%) (Table II). The rate of MyoDNLS degradation was unaltered (t1/2 ∼ 1.8 h) by the presence of Id1. However, the rate of Id1 degradation was slowed (t1/2 1.0-1.8 h) in the presence of MyoDNLS (Fig. 4). In addition, the presence of MyoDNLS reduced Id1 nuclear localization from 72 to 52% (Table II). As seen in Table II, cotransfection with MyoD increased Id1 nuclear localization (72 → 87%) and slowed Id1 degradation (t1/2 ∼ 1.0 to 1.5 h). The nuclear localization of MyoD was essentially unaltered, as was its degradation rate (Table II). Taken together these results demonstrate that cotransfection of MyoD or MyoDNLS slows the rate of Id1 degradation. To determine whether the effect of MyoD on Id1 degradation is specific, cells were cotransfected with Id1 and Foxj1, a nuclear forkhead transcription factor (31Chen J. Knowles H.J. Herbert J.L. Hackett B.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1077-1082Google Scholar). The rate of Id1 degradation (t1/2 = 0.9 h) was not prolonged by Foxj1 expression (data not shown). Despite extensive studies on the regulation of transcription factor synthesis, little attention has been directed at transcription factor degradation and its regulation. MyoD, a key regulator of muscle differentiation, provides an excellent example. While its role in cellular differentiation and regulation of its synthesis is well understood, until recently little was known of the mechanisms involved in its degradation (5Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar, 9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar, 12Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Google Scholar). MyoD and its family members (23Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar) are often complexed with one another or with Id1, a small helix-loop-helix protein. To date, there is little or no data regarding the degradation of the active or the inactive complexes. As seen herein (Table II), expression of MyoD results in a decrease in the rate of degradation of Id1. The converse is not seen, expression of Id1 does not result in a decrease in the rate of MyoD degradation. We show that the degradation rate of MyoD is not diminished while that of Id1 is. This finding is important in its subtlety and suggests a dynamic interplay of these factors. At least two possible mechanisms may underlie these observations. First, the Id1 domain necessary for recognition by the ubiquitination machinery (e.g. the N terminus region) may be masked/altered upon Id1-MyoD complex formation, whereas the MyoD recognition domain remains unaffected. Second, the relative nuclear versus cytoplasmic N terminus-dependent and lysine-dependent degradation pathways may be different for Id1 and MyoD, such that subcellular localization may play a significant role in the rate of degradation of one species relative to the other. Other possibilities certainly exist. Our present studies demonstrate that Id1 is localized to the nucleus and rapidly degraded (t1/2 ∼ 1 h) in vivo via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 1). Many nuclear regulatory proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway although the mechanisms vary. Some are exported from the nucleus prior to degradation (e.g. IκBα and p27Kip1). Others are ubiquitinated in the nucleus and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation (e.g. p53), whereas still others are both ubiquitinated and degraded within the nucleus (e.g. MyoD) (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). To define the underlying mechanism(s) for Id1 degradation, we took advantage of leptomycin B, the irreversible exportin1/CRM1 inhibitor, as well as of mutants of the NLS of Id1. Amino acid residues 68-84 in the Id1 sequence contain a positive charge cluster similar to NLS motifs in several nuclear proteins, including MyoD (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). Mutagenesis to alanines of these lysine and arginine residues to alanines (Id1NLS) resulted in a protein with enhanced localization to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). It is not surprising that Id1NLS is found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, because its monomer size (∼16 kDa) is small enough to passively transit the nuclear pore complex (32Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Google Scholar, 33Macara I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rate of degradation of Id1NLS is exceedingly rapid (t1/2 ∼ 0.5 h) and more rapid than that of wild type Id1 (Table I). This may be the result of altered homodimer formation or enhanced recognition by the ubiquitination machinery. Neither the subcellular localization nor the rate of degradation were altered in the presence of LMB (Fig. 2, Table I), consistent with these observations and distinct from those seen with 46-kDa MyoD (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar, 12Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Google Scholar). At present it appears that many more proteins are tagged for ubiquitin-dependent degradation on internal lysines than via the free N terminus. Among those degraded via the free N terminus are MyoD (5Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Google Scholar), the E7 oncoprotein of human papilloma virus (7Reinstein E. Scheffner M. Oren M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5944-5950Google Scholar), LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus (6Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Google Scholar), p21 (8Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Google Scholar), and Id2 (29Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 314: 505-512Google Scholar). Recent studies with MyoD suggest that the lysine-dependent pathway appears to be more active in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (9Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that nuclear proteins that are degraded in the nucleus undergo degradation via an N terminus-dependent pathway, as is the case with MyoD. Our results with lysine-less Id1 and N terminus blocked lysine-less Id1 identifies Id1 as another nuclear protein degraded via the N terminus-dependent pathway. Id1 and MyoD have been shown to interact in vitro in a variety of assays. For example, Langlands et al. (26Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Google Scholar), using a yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated Id1 interaction with MyoD and myf-5 but not myogenin nor MRF4/Myf-b. They further showed interaction of Id1 and Id2 with MyoD via coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins. In vivo Id1/MyoD interactions have been observed following transient transfections of a modified two-hybrid interaction in HeLa cells (26Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Google Scholar) or with a split luciferase reporter system (34Paulmurugan R. Umezawa Y. Gambhir S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15608-15613Google Scholar). Our results (Table II) provide additional insight into Id1/MyoD interactions in vivo. Transfection of Id1NLS (which by itself is localized 28% to the nucleus) together with MyoD (which by itself is localized 99% to the nucleus) causes substantial redistribution of Id1NLS to the nucleus (28 → 58% nuclear). This observation suggests that MyoD (via its NLS) is able to chaperon Id1NLS into the nucleus. Similarly, MyoD is able to increase wild type Id1 within the nucleus. These results thus demonstrate in vivo that Id1 and MyoD interact. Examples of in vitro and in vivo interaction of other members of the helix-loop-helix families have recently been reported (35Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar), including the observation of Immink et al. (36Immink R.G. Gadella Jr., T.W. Ferrario S. Busscher M. Angenent G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2416-2421Google Scholar) who applied FRET to examine the in vivo interaction of two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and demonstrated both molecular interaction and chaperone-mediated nuclear targeting. Not only do MyoD and Id1 interact and traffic within subcellular compartments, this interaction influences their degradation. Other reports of degradation of transcription factor pairs are sparse. Zhao et al. (37Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Google Scholar) showed that Cbfa1 and its partner Smad1 are each degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but their interrelationship was not reported. The dioxin receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which upon ligand binding translocates to the nucleus and complexes with its partner, Arnt, to form a DNA binding heterodimer. Dioxin receptor is constitutively degraded via the E3, C-terminal hsp 70-interacting protein (CHIP), and the ubiquitin-proteasome system via a process termed “protein triage” whereby fate decisions regarding proper folding versus degradation occur (38Lees M.J. Peet D.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35878-35888Google Scholar). XAP2, a molecular chaperone, protects dioxin receptor from degradation during this process (38Lees M.J. Peet D.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35878-35888Google Scholar). Finally, Hattori et al. (39Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Onco-gene. 2003; 22: 1273-1280Google Scholar) have shown that the inhibitory/regulatory C/EBP transcription factors are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that dimer formation via leucine zipper motifs suppresses this degradation. This suggests a system for the regulation of the cellular complement of non-dimerized binding partners. Our observations with Id1 and MyoD extend this notion in that dimerization alters the rate of degradation of Id1, but not that of MyoD. The implications of these results are broad and suggest that regulation of the Id1 degradation rate and thus its cellular and tissue levels may significantly impact the biological processes in which it is involved. Recent studies also suggest that transcription factor ubiquitination serves a key role in regulating gene expression by linking transcription factor activity to its proteasome-dependent degradation (40Salghetti S.E. Caudy A.A. Chenoweth J.G. Tansey W.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1651-1653Google Scholar, 41Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Google Scholar, 42Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2003; 296: 1254-1258Google Scholar). Several ubiquitin E3 ligases function as transcriptional co-activators. For example, Kim et al. (43Kim S.-Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1177-1188Google Scholar) have shown that the ubiquitin ligase, Skp2, itself an oncoprotein, is a transcriptional co-activator for Myc, and thus connects Myc activity and destruction. Biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that the biological actions of the Id proteins is via a “dominant-negative” effect whereby they sequester the tissue-restricted basic helix-loop-helix proteins (e.g. MyoD) or their ubiquitously expressed partners (e.g. E proteins). Thus, by sequestering these DNA-binding basic helix-loop-helix proteins, Id proteins can control the activity of basic helix-loop-helix proteins in diverse cell lineages (e.g. muscle, lymphocytes, and endothelium). Additional Id protein partners have been recently found, including Rb, ets proteins, and pax family members (44Zebedee Z. Hara E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8317-8325Google Scholar). A variety of mechanisms have been shown to increase Id1 protein expression including signaling via the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor and STAT 3 (45Belletti B. Drakas R. Morrione A. Tu X. Prisco M. Yuan T. Casaburi I. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 107-118Google Scholar). In addition, increased expression of Id1 has been shown to delay cellular senescence in several cell lineages including the endothelium (46Tang J. Gordon G.M. Nickoloff B.J. Foreman K.E. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1073-1079Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of Id1 protein level via changes in its rate of degradation is likely to be important in tissue differentiation and developmental programs."

In this study, we have analyzed heparan sulfate synthesized by primary fibroblast cell cultures established from mice with a gene trap mutation in Ext1. The gene trap mutation results in embryonic lethality, and homozygous mice die around embryonic day 14. Metabolic labeling and immunohistochemistry revealed that Ext1 mutant fibroblasts still produced small amounts of heparan sulfate.

However, a dramatic difference was seen in the polysaccharide chain length. The average molecular sizes of the heparan sulfate chains from wild type and Ext1 mutant embryonic fibroblasts were estimated to be around 70 and 20 kDa, respectively.

Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar, 2Ornitz D.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 108-112Google Scholar, 3Selva E.M. Perrimon N. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 67-80Google Scholar). The constituent sulfated HS polysaccharide chains exert their biological functions by interacting with a multitude of proteins in differential and specific fashion. The critical roles of HS structure in normal growth and development have become evident using model animals including Drosophila and mouse (4Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 175-180Google Scholar, 5Nybakken K. Perrimon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 280-291Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of HSPG is a multistep process involving the concerted action of several enzymes and includes (a) formation of the polypeptide core; (b) assembly of the polysaccharide-protein linkage region; (c) generation of a polymer consisting of alternating GlcA and GlcNAc residues; and (d) a series of modification reactions by which N- and O-sulfate groups are introduced and a fraction of the GlcA residues are C5-epimerized to l-iduronic acid (IdoUA) units. The HS-protein linkage region consists of the tetrasaccharide: glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-xylose (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl), where xylose is linked to a serine residue in the protein core. Separate enzymes catalyze the incorporation of the different sugar units (6Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar). Transfer of a single GlcNAc unit to the tetrasaccharide linkage region initiates HS assembly. The alternating addition of GlcA and GlcNAc, from their respective UDP-derivatives, to the nonreducing terminus of the growing polymer thus forms the (GlcA-GlcNAc)n HS chain, which is modified through sulfation and GlcA C5-epimerization reactions (reviewed in Refs. 7Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Google Scholar, 8Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar, 9Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Google Scholar). The regulation of this process, as required to generate specific saccharide structures, is poorly understood but apparently involves arrays of enzyme isoforms that differ with regard to substrate specificities and kinetic properties. Hereditary multiple exostoses is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by the presence of cartilage capped bony outgrowths mainly located at the juxtaepiphyseal region of the long bones (10Salomon L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Br. 1963; 45: 292-304Google Scholar). Genetic linkage studies in families with hereditary multiple exostoses disclosed two main loci, EXT1 on chromosome 8q24.1 and EXT2 on chromosome 11p11-p12 (11Cook A. Raskind W. Blanton S.H. Pauli R.M. Gregg R.G. Francomano C.A. Puffenberger E. Conrad E.U. Schmale G. Schellenberg G. Wijsman E. Hecht J.T. Wells D. Wagner M.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 71-79Google Scholar, 12Hecht J.T. Hogue D. Strong L.C. Hansen M.F. Blanton S.H. Wagner M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1125-1131Google Scholar). Although linkage to another locus, EXT3, on chromosome 19p has been described (13Le Merrer M. Legeai-Mallet L. Jeannin P.M. Horsthemke B. Schinzel A. Plauchu H. Toutain A. Achard F. Munnich A. Maroteaux P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 717-722Google Scholar), the EXT3 gene has not yet been isolated, and genetic linkage to this locus has only been detected in a few pedigrees to date. Together with EXT1 and EXT2, three additional members, designated EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, form the exostosin (EXT) gene family (14Van Hul W. Wuyts W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Genomics. 1998; 47: 230-237Google Scholar, 15Wise C.A. Clines G.A. Massa H. Trask B.J. Lovett M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 10-16Google Scholar, 16Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 382-389Google Scholar). The EXT as well as EXTL proteins show sequence homology especially in the C-terminal regions. However, there is no evidence that defects in the EXTL genes result in hereditary multiple exostoses. Despite extensive genetic characterization, the function of the EXT proteins remained unknown until 1998, when two independent studies revealed the connection between HS-synthesizing glycosyltransferases and the EXT gene family (17Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Google Scholar, 18McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L. Dyer A. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Google Scholar). An ∼70-kDa enzyme committed to HS polymer formation was isolated from bovine serum, and analysis of the corresponding cDNA showed that the isolated protein was identical to EXT2 (17Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Google Scholar). Transfection of EXT1 into an HS-deficient l-cell mutant restored the ability to synthesize HS, suggesting that chain elongation may involve both EXT1 and EXT2 (18McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L. Dyer A. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Google Scholar). Recently, more detailed functional data on the role of the EXT protein family members in HS biosynthesis has been provided by several studies. EXT1 and EXT2 form a heterooligomeric complex in vivo that is accumulated in the Golgi apparatus (19Kobayashi S.-i. Morimoto K.-i. Shimizu T. Takahashi M. Kurosawa H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 860-867Google Scholar, 20McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Google Scholar). The Golgi-localized EXT1-EXT2 protein complex possesses substantially higher glycosyltransferase activity than EXT1 alone, suggesting that this complex represents the biologically relevant form of the HS polymer modification unit (20McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Google Scholar, 21Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 282-286Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of CHO cells defective in EXT1 demonstrated that the GlcA-transferase catalytic domain is localized to the N-terminal region of the EXT1 protein (22Wei G. Bai X. Gabb M.M. Bame K.J. Koshy T.I. Spear P.G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27733-27740Google Scholar). No mutations in EXT1 affecting only GlcNAc-transferase activity have yet been found. Less is known about the domain organization of EXT2 that has been shown to have both GlcA- and GlcNAc transferase activities when expressed in COS-7 cells and in yeast (17Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Google Scholar, 21Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 282-286Google Scholar). Interestingly, the three other members of the EXT gene family, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3 also encode glycosyltransferases, which are likely to be involved in HS biosynthesis (23Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar, 24Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the Drosophila orthologs of EXT2 and EXTL3 (sister of tout-velu (sotv) and brother of tout velu (botv), respectively) seriously diminish HS synthesis (25Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A. Tabata T. Development. 2004; 131: 73-82Google Scholar, 26Han C. Belenkaya T.Y. Khodoun M. Tauchi M. Lin X. Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 1563-1575Google Scholar). An indispensable role for EXT1 in HS polymerization has been suggested by the observations that HS synthesis is abolished in Ext1-deficient embryonic stem cells (27Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Google Scholar) and in Drosophila bearing a mutation in tout-velu, the orthologue of human EXT1 (28Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar). Ext1-deficient mice generated by gene targeting fail to gastrulate, lack HS, and die by embryonic day 8.5 (27Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Google Scholar). In contrast, Ext1 mutant mice generated by the gene trap method (Ext1Gt(pGT2TMpfs)064Wcs, ExtGt/Gt) survive to embryonic day 14.5 and have a much less severe phenotype (29Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Google Scholar). 2O. G. Kelly and W. C. Skarnes, manuscript in preparation. The longer survival time of the Ext1Gt/Gt mice suggested that the gene trap insertion created a hypomorphic allele of Ext1.To study the effect of the gene trap disruption of Ext1 on HS polymerization, we have studied the structural properties of HS produced by fibroblasts from ExtGt/Gt embryos. Our results show that sulfated HS chains are still produced, albeit much less than normally. The decrease in HS was mainly due to reduced chain length. The overall HS sulfation pattern was moderately affected by the mutation. HS is required for growth factor signaling and diffusion, and the embryonic lethal phenotype of Ext1Gt/Gt may reflect the inability of the mutant HS to mediate some of the HS-dependent steps in embryogenesis. These findings may have important implications for our understanding of the structural requirements of HS in regulating growth factor signaling. Materials—Heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8), heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo. d-[6-3H]GlcN (24 Ci/mmol) and Na 352SO4 were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d-[1-3H]Galactose (6.1 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP, DEAE-Sephacel, PD-10 columns containing Sephadex G-25 (medium), and Superdex 30 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. HexA-[3H]aManR disaccharides, with and without O-sulfate groups in different positions, used as reference compounds were as described (30Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Google Scholar). Polysaccharide standards for estimations of molecular mass values were derived from heparin (3.3 and 8.6 kDa) and from hyaluronan (19, 30, 43, and 210 kDa) as described (31Hagner-McWhirter A. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J. Roden L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 159-171Google Scholar). The generation of Ext1-deficient mice was performed as described (29Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was obtained using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Denatured RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at three occasions with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Each lane of the blot contained 10 μg of total RNA. The probes used were a 0.55-kb fragment (nt 862–1407) of the mouse Ext1 cDNA, a 0.53-kb fragment (nt 1938–2464) of the mouse Ext1 cDNA, and a 0.39-kb fragment (nt 777–1163) of the mouse Ext2 cDNA. Unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed with a Microspin S-300 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were hybridized at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) first with the ∼550-bp Ext1 fragment, subsequently with the 530 bp Ext1 fragment, and then with the mouse Ext2 cDNA probe. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was isolated as described above, and 0.8 μg of each preparation were used for RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for mouse Ext1: forward primer, 5′-TCCTGGAGGATTGTTCGTC-3′ (nt 1939–1957); reverse primer, 5′-TAGCAGCTCCTGTCAACAC-3′ (nt 2450–2468). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gel. Assay of GlcNAc- and GlcA-transferase Activities—Oligosaccharide acceptors were prepared from a purified capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K5, with the structure (GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4)n. The polysaccharide was partially N-deacetylated by incubation in 2 m NaOH for 40 min at 60 °C, The incubation mixture was cooled to room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 7.0, and the modified polysaccharide was desalted, lyophilized, and finally depolymerized by deaminative cleavage (pH 3.9 (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Google Scholar)). The generated fragments were reduced with NaBH4, yielding reducing terminal 2,5-anhydromannitol (aManR) residues. The resulting oligosaccharides (GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]n-aManR) were size-separated on a column (2.5 × 140 cm) of Sephadex-G50 (superfine grade) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Fractions corresponding to oligosaccharides larger than hexasaccharides were pooled and lyophilized. [GlcNAc-GlcA]n-aManR acceptors were prepared by digestion of GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]n-aManR with bovine liver β-d-glucuronidase (Sigma). To assay GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities, protein preparations from wild type or Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblast cultures were incubated for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C with 14C-labeled UDP-GlcA and [GlcNAc-GlcA]n-aManR oligosaccharide acceptors (measuring GlcA-transferase activity) or with 14C-labeled UDP-GlcNAc and GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]n-aManR acceptors (measuring GlcNAc-transferase activity). Labeled oligosaccharides were isolated by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 superfine column (1 × 22 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, and quantified by scintillation counting. The protein concentration of cell homogenate was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Isolation of Metabolically Labeled HS—Fibroblast cells obtained from wild type and homozygous Ext1Gt/Gt animals (embryonic day 11.5) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin G-streptomycin. At passage 3 or 4, cells were labeled with 200 μCi/ml Na 352SO4,50 μCi/ml [3H]galactose, or 50 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 48 h. The medium was removed from each cell culture, and the cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS. The cell layer was solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 under gentle rocking at 4 °C for 4 h and centrifuged. To release the O-linked sugars from the protein core, the supernatants were treated with 0.5 m NaBH4, 0.5 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 m acetic acid to decompose excess NaBH4 and neutralized with 1 m NaOH. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were applied to a Sephadex G-50 superfine column (1 × 145 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions eluting at the void volume were recovered, galactosaminoglycans were eliminated by chondroitinase ABC digestion, and resistant HS chains were recovered by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (33Cheung W.-F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Google Scholar). Alternatively, after centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, treated with 0.5 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight, and neutralized, and labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by anion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Galactosaminoglycans were eliminated by digestion with chondroitinase ABC, and resistant HS chains were recovered by gel filtration. The purity of labeled HS was determined by the sensitivity to enzyme digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase. Embryonic fibroblasts obtained from wild type and homozygous Ext1Gt/Gt animals were immortalized by transformation with recombinant retroviruses encoding simian virus 40 large T antigen (34Jat P.S. Cepko C.L. Mulligan R.C. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1204-1217Google Scholar). A producer cell line, Ψ2, containing integrated copies of defective ectropic Moloney murine leukemia virus provirus, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin G-streptomycin. The conditioned medium from confluent Ψ2 cell culture was collected and mixed with Polybrene (Aldrich) to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. Embryonic fibroblasts at ∼60% confluence in a 10-cm dish were incubated with 2 ml of the culture medium containing 0.2 ml of the viral supernatant at 37 °C for 2 h, and then 8 ml of the growth medium was added. Colonies of transformed cells started to appear after 1.5–2 weeks. Immortalized cells were labeled with 50 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine or 200 μCi/ml Na 352SO4 for 48 h, and the resultant labeled HS was isolated as described above. Labeled HSPGs present at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix were isolated after labeling of immortalized cells with 50 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine. After 24 h of labeling, the culture medium was removed and frozen. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. The trypsin was then neutralized with 2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were frozen for future use. The supernatants were treated with 0.5 m NaOH, and labeled HS chains were recovered by gel filtration as described above. Enzymatic Digestions—Enzymatic digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC was carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 3.3 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, respectively. The digestion products were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-50 superfine (0.55 × 95 cm) using 0.5 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. Structural Analysis of HS—The size of labeled HS chains prepared from wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt mouse embryonic fibroblasts was analyzed by gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.0 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and the radioactivity was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. Nitrous acid treatment at pH 1.5 was conducted with 0.5 m HNO2 followed by reduction of the products with NaBH4, yielding an aManR residue at the reducing end (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Google Scholar). Under these conditions, N-sulfated glucosamine units are selectively attacked, but N-acetylated glucosamine residues are not affected. The degradation products were size-fractionated by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 180 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 or on Superdex 30 in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. For essentially complete depolymerization to disaccharides, labeled HS was chemically N-deacetylated by treatment with 70% (w/v) aqueous hydrazine (Fluka) containing 1% (w/v) hydrazine sulfate at 96 °C for 4 h, and the product was treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and at pH 3.9 (35Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Twada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Google Scholar). Recovered labeled disaccharides were analyzed on a Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column eluted at a rate of 1 ml/min with KH2PO4 solutions of stepwise increasing concentration as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Alternatively, the disaccharide composition of [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS was determined after depolymerization with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase and separation on an amino-bound silica PA-03 HPLC column. Individual disaccharides were identified by co-chromatography with disaccharide standards as described previously (36Kishibe J. Yamada S. Okada Y. Sato J. Ito A. Miyazaki K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15321-15329Google Scholar). HS Formation in Ext1 Mutant Embryos—It has been demonstrated that EXT1 plays an essential role in the HS polymerization process and that the formation of HS is abolished in mice with a targeted mutation in Ext1 (27Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Google Scholar). However, it has never been clarified whether the HS chain elongation process stops after the formation of the HS protein linkage region (GlcNAc-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl) or at some later stage of HS synthesis. We have generated mutant mice with a lethal insertional mutation in the gene encoding Ext1 (Ext1Gt/Gt) (29Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Google Scholar) using a gene trap strategy and generated fibroblasts from embryonic day 11.5 wild type and gene trap mutated Ext1Gt/Gt embryos.2 To examine the effect of the gene trap mutated Ext1 on the sequential addition of GlcA and GlcNAc contiguous to the HS-protein linkage region, wild type fibroblasts and Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose. During glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, galactose is primarily incorporated into the linkage region. Galactose is also converted to UDP-GlcA and incorporated into the uronic acid units of glycosaminoglycans although less efficiently. Cell extracts were treated with alkali to liberate O-glycans including glycosaminoglycan-related polysaccharides from core proteins, and samples were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column, to separate di-, tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharide from large polysaccharides (data not shown). Both wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblasts incorporated very small amounts of [3H]galactose (less than 1% of isolated labeled O-linked sugars) at the elution position of a linkage pentasaccharide. Instead, the majority of the radioactivity was incorporated into larger polysaccharides containing material susceptible to specific HS-degrading enzymes, indicating that HS chain elongation had occurred also in the mutant cells. To determine whether the Ext1Gt/Gt mice indeed synthesize HS chains, embryonic fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine. The yields of [35S]sulfate-labeled glycosaminoglycans were comparable between wild type cells (2.3 × 105 cpm/mg protein) and Ext1Gt/Gt cells (2.5 × 105 cpm/mg protein). Isolated 35S-labeled polysaccharides from wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblasts were subjected to selective degradation of chondroitin sulfate (chondroitinase ABC digestion) or HS (nitrous acid deamination), and the respective degradation products were analyzed by gel chromatography (Fig. 1). The mutant sample contained material susceptible to nitrous acid treatment, showing that Ext1Gt/Gt embryonic fibroblasts synthesize sulfated HS chains. The proportion of HS (i.e. material resistant to digestion by chondroitinase ABC but susceptible to nitrous acid deamination) decreased from ∼65% of the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans in the wild type cells to ∼35% in the Ext1Gt/Gt cells. When wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt cells were labeled with [3H]glucosamine, the incorporation of label into glycosaminoglycans was slightly reduced in Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblasts (2.65 × 105 cpm/mg protein) as compared with the wild type cells (3.1 × 105 cpm/mg protein). The proportion of HS in Ext1Gt/Gt and wild type cells was determined as 12 and 55%, respectively, of the 3H-labeled glycosaminoglycans (data not shown). Thus, the amount of 3H-labeled HS synthesized by Ext1Gt/Gt cells was ∼18% of the HS produced by wild type cells. The presence of HS in Ext1Gt/Gt cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent staining using the HepSS-1 antibody that recognizes sulfated HS chains (37Kure S. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3900-3908Google Scholar) and subsequent confocal microscopic examination. A dense staining for HS was observed (data not shown). Analysis of Ext1 Gene Disruption—To investigate whether the gene trap insertion leads to a deficiency of the normal Ext1 transcript, the mRNA level was analyzed by Northern blotting. The gene trap mutation is inserted in the intron between exons 1 and 2 in the Ext1 gene (Fig. 2). As a result of the insertion, a fusion transcript is generated containing part of the Ext1 mRNA (exon 1) fused to the gene trap vector sequence (Fig. 2). To characterize the Ext1 mRNA expression, two different probes A and B (corresponding to nucleotides 862–1407 and 1938–2464 in the mouse Ext1 cDNA sequence) were hybridized to RNA from wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt cells (Fig. 3). A band of ∼3.5 kb was detected in wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with the previously reported size of the Ext1 mRNA (38Lin X. Gan L. Klein W.H. Wells D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 738-743Google Scholar). In the Ext1Gt/Gt cells, the putative fusion transcript (>9 kb) was detected by probe A (Fig. 3A). However, no transcript was detected using probe B, indicating that the gene was disrupted prior to the sequence corresponding to probe B (Fig. 3B). No differences in the expression levels of Ext2 were observed between wild type and Ext1Gt/Gt fibroblasts. To use a more sensitive method, an RT-PCR amplification experiment was performed using primers F1 and R1 shown in Fig. 2. The expected 500-bp product, corresponding to nucleotides 1939–2468, was generated in the wild type but initially not in the Ext1Gt/Gt sample (data not shown). However, using the PCR product mixture from the initial PCR as a template in an additional PCR resulted in the amplification of a 500-bp product also from the Ext1Gt/Gt sample, suggesting that the mutant cells still produced small amounts of wild type transcript.Fig. 3Ext1 and Ext2 mRNA expression levels were analyzed by Northern blotting. A membrane with RNA from WT (+/+) and Ext1Gt/Gt (Gt/Gt) fibroblasts was hybridized, first with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment specific for the 5′-end of mouse Ext1 (A) and subsequently with a cDNA probe from the 3′-end of Ext1 (B). The probes A and B are as shown in Fig. 2. The same blot was also hybridized with a probe recognizing Ext2 (C). Sizes of RNA markers in kilobases are indicated to the right.View Large"

Many of the more than 600 mutations currently known in fibrillin-1 eliminate or introduce cysteine residues in epidermal growth factor-like modules. Here we report structural and functional consequences of three selected cysteine mutations (R627C, C750G, and C926R) in fibrillin-1. The mutations have been analyzed by means of recombinant polypeptides produced in mammalian expression systems. The mRNA levels for the mutation constructs were similar to wild-type levels. All three mutated polypeptides were secreted by embryonic kidney cells (293) into the culture medium. Purification was readily feasible for mutants R627C and C750G, but not for C926R, which restricted the availability of this mutant polypeptide to selected analyses. The overall folds of the mutant polypeptides were indistinguishable from the wild-type as judged by the ultrastructural shape, CD analysis, and reactivity with a specific antibody sensitive for intact disulfide bonds. Subtle structural changes caused by R627C and C750G, however, were monitored by proteolysis and heat denaturation experiments. These changes occurred in the vicinity of the mutations either as short range effects (R627C) or both short and long range effects (C750G). Enhanced proteolytic susceptibility was observed for R627C and C750G to a variety of proteases. These results expand and further strengthen the concept that proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 might be an important potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome and other disorders caused by mutations in fibrillin-1.

Fibrillins are major components of a class of 10-12-nm extracellular microfibrils, which occur either in association with elastin or in elastin-free bundles (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Google Scholar, 2Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Google Scholar). The highly homologous fibrillin family consists of three members, fibrillin-1, -2, and -3, which are encoded by different genes (2Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Google Scholar, 3Maslen C.L. Corson G.M. Maddox B.K. Glanville R.W. Sakai L.Y. Nature. 1991; 352: 334-337Google Scholar, 4Lee B. Godfrey M.

Charbonneau N.L. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 2004; 83: 461-472Google Scholar). Like many other extracellular glycoproteins, fibrillins are composed of individual modules in a mosaic fashion (Fig. 1A). Most of these modules are rich in cysteine residues, accounting for the high overall content of cysteine residues in fibrillins (12-13%). Multiple tandem arrays of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like module; cbEGF, calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module; 8-Cys/TB, 8-cysteine-containing modules; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MFS, Marfan syndrome; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CCA, congenital contractural arachnodactyly. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like module; cbEGF, calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module; 8-Cys/TB, 8-cysteine-containing modules; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MFS, Marfan syndrome; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CCA, congenital contractural arachnodactyly. domains constitute the majority of the fibrillin molecules. There are 46-47 EGF modules in each fibrillin, 42-43 of which are associated with calcium binding. Each EGF module contains six highly conserved cysteine residues, which form disulfide bonds in a 1-3, 2-4, 5-6 arrangement, generating an anti-parallel β-pleated sheet conformation (8Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Google Scholar, 9Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). It has been shown that calcium binding to calcium-binding EGF (cbEGF) modules in fibrillin-1 protects the molecules against proteolytic degradation by a variety of proteases (10Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Google Scholar) and that calcium plays a crucial role in stabilizing tandem repeats of cbEGF modules in fibrillin-1 (9Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar, 11Reinhardt D.P. Mechling D.E. Boswell B.A. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7368-7373Google Scholar). Other prominent modules in fibrillins are 8-cysteine-containing structures typically referred to as 8-Cys/TB modules and hybrid modules. Both types of modules are exclusively found in fibrillins and latent transforming growth factor-β-binding proteins (for a review, see Ref. 12Saharinen J. Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Google Scholar). Mutations in fibrillins lead to various connective tissue disorders such as the Marfan syndrome (MFS; MIM 154700) and some other related disorders of connective tissue commonly referred to as type-1 fibrillinopathies caused by mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1), and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA; MIM 121050) caused by mutations in the gene for fibrillin-2 (FBN2) (for a review, see Ref. 13Milewicz D.M. Urban Z. Boyd C. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 471-480Google Scholar). Most of the known mutations in FBN1 (95%) result in various forms of MFS (14Collod-Beroud G. Le Bourdelles S. Ades L. Ala-Kokko L. Booms P. Boxer M. Child A. Comeglio P. De Paepe A. Hyland J.C. Holman K. Kaitila I. Loeys B. Matyas G. Nuytinck L. Peltonen L. Rantamaki T. Robinson P. Steinmann B. Junien C. Beroud C. Boileau C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 199-208Google Scholar). MFS is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 5000 individuals (15Pyeritz R.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 481-510Google Scholar). MFS is characterized by highly variable clinical manifestations including aortic dilation and dissection, ectopia lentis, dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, pectus deformities, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities (15Pyeritz R.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 481-510Google Scholar). A dominant negative model for the pathogenesis of MFS has been proposed in which the product of the mutant allele interferes with polymerization of fibrillin into microfibrils or destabilizes the microfibrils after incorporation, and the severity of the disease is dependent on the mutant protein level (16Dietz H.C. McIntosh I. Sakai L.Y. Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Pyeritz R.E. Francomano C.A. Genomics. 1993; 17: 468-475Google Scholar). In addition, other mechanisms must play a role, since some premature termination mutations that cause selective degradation of the mutant mRNA can result in severe disease (17Hewett D. Lynch J. Child A. Firth H. Sykes B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 447-452Google Scholar, 18Halliday D. Hutchinson S. Kettle S. Firth H. Wordsworth P. Handford P.A. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 587-597Google Scholar, 19Montgomery R.A. Geraghty M.T. Bull E. Gelb B.D. Johnson M. McIntosh I. Francomano C.A. Dietz H.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1703-1711Google Scholar). Independent of the involved mechanism, the common pathway of various types of mutations appears to involve a reduction in the amount of functional microfibrils in the extracellular matrix (20Robinson P.N. Booms P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1698-1707Google Scholar). The majority of the more than 600 mutations in FBN1 currently known are point mutations (72.4%); the rest are frame-shifts caused by deletions and insertions (16.1%) and splice site mutations (11.5%) (data set of the FBN1 online data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.umd.be) as of April 2004; see Ref. 14Collod-Beroud G. Le Bourdelles S. Ades L. Ala-Kokko L. Booms P. Boxer M. Child A. Comeglio P. De Paepe A. Hyland J.C. Holman K. Kaitila I. Loeys B. Matyas G. Nuytinck L. Peltonen L. Rantamaki T. Robinson P. Steinmann B. Junien C. Beroud C. Boileau C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 199-208Google Scholar). Missense point mutations substituting (28.0%) or generating new (6.7%) cysteine residues represent the largest group, whereby the majority of cysteine-substituting (23.1%) or cysteine-generating (3.8%) mutations occur in cbEGF modules. Another prominent group (8%) are missense mutations that affect amino acid residues in cbEGF modules involved in calcium binding. For both groups, it is predicted that the mutations locally abolish or reduce calcium binding either directly by changing residues involved in calcium binding or indirectly by changing the structure of the mutated cbEGF module. It has been shown in vitro that a number of mutations affecting calcium binding residues render fibrillin-1 more susceptible to proteolysis, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for dominant negative effects (21Ashworth J.L. Murphy G. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Shapiro S.D. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 171-181Google Scholar, 22Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Google Scholar, 23McGettrick A.J. Knott V. Willis A. Handford P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1987-1994Google Scholar). For some of these mutations, it has been shown that the enhanced susceptibility is caused by subtle structural changes in the region of the mutation (22Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Google Scholar). For the much larger group of cysteine mutations, however, very little information is available on their structural and functional consequences. Based on quantitative pulse-chase analyses of a number of cysteine mutations, normal synthesis and stability were observed for the majority of mutations analyzed accompanied with delayed secretion in about 55% (24Schrijver I. Liu W. Brenn T. Furthmayr H. Francke U. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1007-1020Google Scholar). In another study, two cysteine mutations studied in a recombinant system were retained and accumulated in the cells (25Whiteman P. Handford P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 727-737Google Scholar). Enhanced protease susceptibility induced by a cysteine mutation have been shown in another study (26Booms P. Tiecke F. Rosenberg T. Hagemeier C. Robinson P.N. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 216-224Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that typical cysteine mutations in cbEGF modules, which result in the classical form of Marfan syndrome, render recombinantly expressed polypeptides susceptible to proteolysis. Structural analyses reveal minor changes introduced by the mutations. These results extend and strengthen the concept that enhanced proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 may be the causative mechanism for at least certain groups of mutations leading to type-1 fibrillinopathies. Expression Constructs—The construction of an episomal plasmid pCEPSP-rF45 to express wild-type human fibrillin-1 fragment rF45 (Asp451-Lys1027) as well as the cloning plasmid pBS-rF45 was described in detail previously (22Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Google Scholar). To introduce the mutation C1879T leading to amino acid substitution R627C (27Hayward C. Rae A.L. Porteous M.E. Logie L.J. Brock D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 373-375Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis was performed with plasmid pBS-rF45 and complementary primer pairs 5′-GATCTGCATGAATGGGTGTT GCGTCAACACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTGTTGACGCAACACCCATTCATGCAGATC-3′ using the QuikChange™ procedure as instructed by the supplier (Stratagene). Mutations in the oligonucleotides are in boldface type and underlined. The resulting plasmid was restricted with NheI-NotI, and the 1745-bp fragment was subcloned into the NheI-NotI-restricted pCEPSP-rF45, resulting in pCEPSP-rF45-C1879T. To introduce the mutation T2248G, leading to amino acid substitution C750G (27Hayward C. Rae A.L. Porteous M.E. Logie L.J. Brock D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 373-375Google Scholar), an analogous procedure was employed using primer pairs 5′-GGGACCTATAAATGTATAGGCAATTCAGGATATGAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACTTCATATCCTGAATTGCCTATACATTTATAGGTCCC-3′. To produce the mutation T2776C resulting in amino acid substitution C926R (28Nijbroek G. Sood S. McIntosh I. Francomano C.A. Bull E. Pereira L. Ramirez F. Pyeritz R.E. Dietz H.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 8-21Google Scholar), template HFBN23 was used to amplify a 346-bp fragment with sense primer 5′-CCTTGCATTAATGGAGTCTGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TAGTGTTAACACGCAGGCCATTTTTACACACTCC-3′ by polymerase chain reaction. A 267 bp BamHI-HpaI fragment was excised from the product and subcloned into the BamHI-HpaI-restricted pBS-rF45 plasmid. A 1745-bp NheI-NotI fragment was then subcloned into NheI-NotI-restricted pCEPSP-rF45, resulting in pCEPSP-rF45-T2776C. Correct insertions of all mutations as well as the absence of new mutations introduced by DNA amplification were verified by DNA sequencing. All mutation constructs code for a protein with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp451-Lys1027 including the individual mutation and without an additional histidine tag. The Flp-In system was used to generate stable recombinant cell clones with exactly one copy of the expression plasmid incorporated at a predefined locus of the cellular genome (Invitrogen). All mutation constructs in the pCEPSP plasmids were restricted with NheI-NotI, and the 1745-bp fragments were subcloned into NheI-NotI-restricted pcDNA5-FRT plasmid (Invitrogen), which had been modified by adding the sequence encoding the BM40 signal peptide. The sequences of the proteins expressed were identical to what is described above for the pCEPSP expression plasmids. To facilitate epitope mapping, several new expression plasmids for fragments of human fibrillin-1 have been generated. All of the following expression constructs are designed with a His6 tag at the C-terminal end to facilitate protein purification. To assemble an expression plasmid coding for Ser19-Gly714 of human fibrillin-1, plasmid pDNSP-rF16 (29Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Google Scholar) was cut with EcoRI-NotI, and the 7516-bp fragment was religated using two complementary oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCAGCGGAATATCAGGCACTCTGCAGCAGTGGGCATCACCATCACCATCACTAATAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCACTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCCCACTGCTGCAGAGTGCCTGATATTCCGCTG-3′ as linkers. The resulting plasmid pDNSP-rF1F codes for a recombinant polypeptide (rF1F) with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Ser19-Gly714-His6. An expression plasmid coding for Asp613-Leu951 was generated by amplification of template HFBN23-29 (30Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar) with primers 5′-CGTAGCTAGCAGACATTAACGAGTGTGAAACCC-3′ and 5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAAGACAGATCCTTCCTGTGGC-3′. The product was restricted with NheI-XhoI (1048 bp) and subcloned into pDNSP-rF16 (29Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Google Scholar) restricted with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid codes for a recombinant protein (rF51) with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp613-Leu951-His6. To prepare an expression plasmid coding for Asp723-Leu951, HFBN23-29 (30Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar) was amplified with primers 5′-CGTAGCTAGCTGATATAAATGAATGTGCACTAGATCC-3′ and 5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAAGACAGATCCTTCCTGTGGC-3′. The resulting product was cut with NheI-XhoI (730 bp) and subcloned into the NheI-XhoI-restricted pcDNA5-FRT plasmid (Invitrogen) including a sequence for the BM40 signal peptide. The resulting expression plasmid codes for the recombinant polypeptide rF1A with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp723-Leu951-His6. To assemble an expression plasmid coding for Asp952-Lys1027, template pCEPSP-rF18 (30Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-CGTAGCTAGCCGATATCCGCCTGGAAACCTGC-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTGAAGAAAGGCTTTCCATTTG-3′. A 256-bp fragment (NheI-NotI) was cut from the product and subcloned into the NheI-NotI-restricted pCEPSP-rF18, resulting in pCEPSP-rF35. This expression plasmid codes for recombinant polypeptide rF35 with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp952-Lys1027-His6. The relative position of all expressed polypeptides in comparison with full-length fibrillin-1 is shown in Fig. 1A. Transfection of Cells and Culture Conditions—293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were used to generate episomal recombinant cell clones with the pCEPSP plasmids, Flp-In-293 cells (Invitrogen) were used to generate stable recombinant cell clones with the pcDNA5-FRT plasmids, and 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were used for the production of stable clones with the pDNSP-based plasmids. All cell types were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For 293-EBNA and 293 cells, calcium phosphate transfection was performed as described in detail (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). For Flp-In-293 cells, cotransfection with a plasmid encoding the Flp recombinase (pOG44) was performed as instructed by the supplier (Invitrogen). Selection of recombinant clones was started after 24 h with 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin (293-EBNA, Flp-In-293) or 0.25 mg/ml G418 (293). Single colonies resistant to the antibiotics were picked and propagated. Positive clones were identified by analysis of conditioned medium by Western blotting and SDS-gel electrophoresis using standard protocols. mRNA Synthesis and Secretion of Recombinant Proteins—Nontransfected and transfected Flp-In-293 cell clones were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks and used for RNA purification and secretion analysis. After isolation of total RNA with Trizol following the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen), the mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II and oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and primer pair 5′-AAGTGTCAGTGTCCCAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGC-3′, which produced a 350-bp fragment specific for the rF45 constructs. A standard control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was included, which resulted in a 1173-bp DNA fragment. The intensity of the DNA fragments was visualized by standard agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The conditions for the DNA amplifications (rF45 constructs and control) were optimized for quantification with respect to the cycle number and the amount of cDNA used as template. For this goal, the intensities of the stained DNA bands were correlated with a wide range of cycle numbers and the amount of cDNA used in the amplification procedure. The final parameters for quantification were chosen from linear ranges and were 0.5 μl of template cDNA solution for both reactions, 26 cycles for the recombinant constructs, and 22 cycles for the control. To test the secretion of the recombinant polypeptides, confluent cell layers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was harvested after 48 h. Equal amounts (1 ml) of secreted proteins, precipitated from the serum-free medium with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, were analyzed by standard Western blotting techniques using monoclonal antibody (mAb) 201 (∼4 μg/ml), which is specific for authentic fibrillin-1 and only reacts with nonreduced material (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Google Scholar, 22Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Google Scholar). Production and Purification of Recombinant Polypeptides—For large scale production of rF45-wt, rF45-R627C, rF45-C750G, rF45-C926R, and the histidine tag-containing recombinant polypeptides rF35, rF51, rF1A, and rF1F, cells were grown in triple layer flasks (500 cm2; Nalge Nunc International) to confluence, washed twice with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or alternatively with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with 60-70 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h. The conditioned medium was centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C (5000 × g) to remove cells, supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fluka) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and frozen at -20 °C. About 2-3 liters of serum-free medium were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-30-kDa cut-off) to 40-50 ml. For the recombinant polypeptides without a histidine tag (rF45 wild-type and mutation constructs), the concentrated medium was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. The dialyzed medium was passed over an anion exchange column (1 ml of HiTrap Q; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 25 mm NaCl/ml (0-400 mm NaCl total). Fractions containing the recombinant polypeptides were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cut-off) to ∼1.5 ml. Fractions of ∼0.5 ml were passed over a Superose 12 gel filtration column (24 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and stored at -80 °C. Purification of recombinant polypeptides with a His6 tag (rF35, rF51, rF1A, and rF1F) was performed by chelating chromatography as described in detail previously for other recombinant polypeptides with minor modifications (32Lin G.

Assessment of the purity and visualization of the purified material was performed by standard SDS gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Epitope Mapping—Overlapping recombinant fragments of the N-terminal part of fibrillin-1 were used to localize the epitope of mAb 201 by standard Western blotting as described in detail (33Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Google Scholar). The purified recombinant fragments (5 μg each) were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with ∼4 μg/ml mAb 201. To correlate bands recognized by mAb 201 with the position of the purified proteins, a control was included with Coomassie Blue-stained purified polypeptides after SDS gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Degradation Experiments and N-terminal Sequence Analysis—Recombinant polypeptides rF45-wt, rF45-R627C, and rF45-C750G (1.0 mg/ml in TBS) were supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After removal of a control, enzymes were added at a concentration of 1:20 (w/w) for plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7; Roche Applied Science) or 1:100 (w/w) for trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4; Sigma) treated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1; Sigma) treated with Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone for incubation periods of 60 min (plasmin) or 10 min (trypsin and chymotrypsin). The reaction was stopped by adding 2-fold concentrated reducing SDS sample buffer to equal aliquots of the samples and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Degradation products were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis (7.5-12% gradient gels) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal sequence analysis, the degradation products were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P (Milli-pore) or Pro Blott (Applied Biosystems)), stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and analyzed on a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 494). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The purified recombinant polypeptides rF45-wt, rF45-R627C, and rF45-C750G (0.5 mg/ml in TBS) were analyzed either in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 or 0.25 mm EDTA from 200 to 260 nm in a quartz cuvette at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 instrument. Heat denaturation of the purified recombinant polypeptides was determined by measuring the circular dichroism at 220 nm at increasing temperatures (20-100 °C in steps of 0.4 °C/min). The signal at 20 °C was set to 0% denaturation, and the signal at 100 °C was set to 100% denaturation. Low Angle Rotary Shadowing Electron Microscopy—Purified polypeptides rF45-wt, rF45-R627C, rF45-C750G, and rF45-C926R (∼0.25 mg/ml) were supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and dialyzed against H2O. The samples were mixed with equal volumes of glycerol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and dried under vacuum (Edwards Auto 306). Rotary shadowing was performed as described in detail previously (32Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Bätge B. Brinckmann J. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50795-50804Google Scholar). Replicates were examined at 100 kV in a transmission electron microscope (Zeiss TEM 109). In this study, we have investigated structural and functional consequences of cysteine mutations in fibrillin-1, leading to the classical form of MFS. Missense mutations substituting or eliminating cysteine residues in cbEGF modules represent the largest group of mutations in fibrillin-1 (see Introduction and Ref. 14Collod-Beroud G.

Steinmann B. Junien C. Beroud C. Boileau C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 199-208Google Scholar). The mutations in the FBN1 gene analyzed in this study were C1879T and T2248G, resulting in an additional cysteine residue (R627C) in cbEGF module 6 or a cysteine substitution at the C5 position of cbEGF module 7 (C750G), respectively (27Hayward C. Rae A.L. Porteous M.E. Logie L.J. Brock D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 373-375Google Scholar). The third mutation analyzed was T2776C, leading to a cysteine substitution at the C3 position of cbEGF module 10 (C926R) (28Nijbroek G. Sood S. McIntosh I. Francomano C.A. Bull E. Pereira L. Ramirez F. Pyeritz R.E. Dietz H.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 8-21Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the expression vector for the previously described fibrillin-1 wild-type construct rF45-wt, spanning the fourth generic non-calcium-binding EGF-like module to the third 8-Cys/TB module (Fig. 1A) (22Reinhardt D.P.

The relative position of the cysteine mutations within a typical cbEGF module is shown in Fig. 1B. In order to analyze and compare mRNA expression and protein secretion from cells, stable expression clones were generated with the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). With this system, exactly one copy of the expression plasmid is incorporated into a predefined locus in the genome of the cells, eliminating differences of the copy number and the locus between different recombinant cell clones. Analysis of the mRNA by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription into cDNA demonstrated that all recombinant clones expressed the mutant mRNA at similar levels as compared with the wild type (Fig. 2A).

Using caspase reporter assays under conditions in which nonspecific cleavage of the reporter peptides by the proteasome has been inhibited, we investigated whether any specific caspase activities are temporally correlated with this process of organelle loss. Extracts from neonatal mouse lenses contained strong VEID-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) and minor IETD-AFC and LEVD-AFC cleavage activities, but no DEVD-AFC cleavage activity. Further testing suggested that the VEID-AFC and IETD-AFC cleavage activities were likely due to the same enzyme. In lens extracts from rat embryos, VEID-AFC cleavage activity increased during the period when organelles are eliminated, between embryonic days 15.5 and 18.5, whereas procaspase-6 protein levels decreased, suggesting that this enzyme is responsible for VEID-AFC cleavage. By contrast, in extracts from αAE7 transgenic mouse lenses in which apoptosis was induced, strong DEVD-AFC cleavage activity and activated caspase-3 protein were detected. Thus, within the same tissue, different caspase activities can predominate depending on the context, normal differentiation versus apoptosis. These results highlight the difference between normal fiber cell differentiation and apoptosis and the capacity of the lens to differentially regulate these two processes.

Thus, within the same tissue, different caspase activities can predominate depending on the context, normal differentiation versus apoptosis. These results highlight the difference between normal fiber cell differentiation and apoptosis and the capacity of the lens to differentially regulate these two processes. Apoptosis is a tightly controlled process that results in the ordered disassembly of cells into small membrane-bound fragments that are efficiently eliminated from the organism. It is an important mechanism in the development of all multicellular organisms, being used for such processes as eliminating self-reactive immune cells, ensuring appropriate cell-tissue targeting, and defining organ morphology (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Google Scholar, 2Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Google Scholar). In addition to classical apoptosis, there appear to be a few cases in which a limited destruction of components of the cell occurs during terminal differentiation. In these cases, a restricted destruction of subcellular organelles is necessary to accommodate some unique cellular function. The classical examples of this phenomenon are found in the lens, epidermis, and mammalian erythrocytes (3Dahm R. Ophthalmic Res. 1999; 31: 163-183Google Scholar, 4Polakowska R. Piacentini M. Bartlett R. Goldsmith L. Haake A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 176-188Google Scholar, 5Morioka K. Tone S. Mukaida M. Takano-Ohmuro H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 206-217Google Scholar). Although these differentiation events are distinct from classical apoptosis in that a highly specialized cell remains behind, these processes and apoptosis do share some characteristics, suggesting that a common set of effector molecules may be involved. In apoptosis, the effector molecules include members of a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases (6Earnshaw W. Martins L. Kaufmann S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar, 7Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Google Scholar). These enzymes play central roles in both the initiation and execution of the apoptotic pathway. Through their cleavage of a limited number of important cellular proteins, caspases alter specific enzymatic processes and structural properties of cells, ultimately resulting in the ordered dismantling of those cells. Caspases may also be important in initiating and executing discrete steps in cell differentiation such as intracellular organelle loss. In this study, we investigated which caspases are active during normal lens differentiation and compare the results with those found under conditions in which apoptosis is induced in the same tissue.The vertebrate lens consists of a single cell type in two general states: a single cell layer called the anterior epithelium that, on the anterior surface, covers a large mass of differentiated cells referred to as fiber cells (8Piatigorsky J. Differentiation. 1981; 19: 134-153Google Scholar, 9Kuszak J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 305-350Google Scholar). The process of fiber cell differentiation involves extensive reconstruction of the architecture of the cell. Lens cells begin as small cuboidal epithelial cells, but during the process of differentiation, they become extremely elongated, highly specialized cells that are ordered into very precise arrays. To accommodate the lens' proper function in vision, the fibers must express large amounts of tissue-specific crystallin proteins as well as eliminate all membrane-bound organelles from the optical pathway. Failure to eliminate these organelles results in opacity in the lens due to disordered fiber cell packing and scattering of light by the organelles.The manner in which lens cell nuclei are lost during lens fiber cell differentiation bears many similarities at the morphological and biochemical levels to that seen in apoptosis. These include a clumping and marginalization of chromatin (10Vrensen G.F. Graw J. De W.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 647-659Google Scholar), DNase I-like activity that leaves 3′-OH groups and fragmentation of DNA into integers of nucleosomal length (11Appleby D.W. Modak S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5579-5583Google Scholar), and kinase activities (12Gao C.Y. Bassnett S. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 185-194Google Scholar). Experimental evidence also suggests molecular links between apoptosis and the differentiation of fiber cells. Expression of transgenes that disrupt normal cell cycle control within the lens, such as the E7 oncogene from human papilloma virus type 16 and C-terminally truncated T antigen from simian virus 40, leads to massive apoptosis within the lens (13Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1285-1299Google Scholar, 14Pan H. Griep A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2157-2169Google Scholar, 15Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J. Overbeek P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Google Scholar, 16Griep A. Westphal H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 727-738Google Scholar). Coexpression of human papilloma virus type 16 E6 with E7 can attenuate this apoptosis. Notably, when expressed alone, E6 also can inhibit nuclear loss during fiber cell differentiation (13Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1285-1299Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 in the lenses of transgenic mice severely disrupts normal lens development, resulting in defects in fiber formation and the retention of nuclei in spatially inappropriate regions of the lens (17Fromm L. Overbeek P. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 276-287Google Scholar). Finally, in in vitro lens epithelial cell differentiation models, the addition of cell-permeable caspase inhibitors to the culture medium results in the retention of nuclei (18Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M. Raff M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Google Scholar, 19Wride M. Parker E. Sanders E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 13: 142-156Google Scholar). Although suggesting a role for caspases in denucleation, these latter in vitro studies failed to provide direct evidence for specific caspase activities that correlate with organelle loss. Despite these similarities in organelle loss during fiber cell differentiation and apoptosis, there are key differences. In fiber cell differentiation, a functional cell body remains behind; cell membrane integrity and an actin cytoskeleton are maintained; and the overall period of time from the beginning of organelle loss to the DNA fragmentation at the end of denucleation is estimated to be several days rather than hours (20Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Google Scholar, 21Bassnett S. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 1-6Google Scholar). These differences in the organelle loss program between fiber cell differentiation and apoptosis suggest that they are distinct processes. If and how they overlap at the molecular level therefore remains to be elucidated.Because of their central role in apoptosis, we have chosen to determine whether caspases are expressed and active within normal murine lenses in a temporal pattern that could suggest a role in organelle loss during fiber cell differentiation. Multiple caspases and many of their regulatory genes were found to be expressed in the lens. A caspase-6-like VEID-AFC 1The abbreviations used are: AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; RT, reverse transcription; E, embryonic day; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CHO, aldehyde; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP digoxygenin nick end labeling. 1The abbreviations used are: AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; RT, reverse transcription; E, embryonic day; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CHO, aldehyde; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP digoxygenin nick end labeling. cleavage activity was detected within normal lenses, and this activity increased just prior to the onset of DNA degradation in primary fiber cells. Additionally, a decrease in the full-length inactive proenzyme form of caspase-6 was detected in this same time frame. Surprisingly, no DEVD-AFC cleavage or activated caspase-3 protein was detected in normal lenses. On the other hand, strong DEVD-AFC cleavage activity and activated caspase-3 were detected in extracts from lenses in which apoptosis was induced by the human papilloma virus oncogene E7. We conclude that lens cells are capable of the differential regulation of caspase activities and that only some of these activities are temporally correlated with organelle destruction during differentiation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that some (but not all) caspases associated with apoptosis contribute to organelle loss during lens fiber cell differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsFVB/n mice were used as the source for all non-transgenic mouse RNA, fixed sections, and extracts. αAE7 transgenic mice, from line 75a described previously (13Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1285-1299Google Scholar), were used as the source for apoptotic lens extracts. Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.) were used as the source for all rat RNA, fixed sections, and lens extracts. For lenses isolated from embryos, the day of the vaginal plug was defined as day 0.5 in embryogenesis (E0.5).RT-PCRRT-PCR was carried out using 2.5 μg of total mRNA from lenses of neonatal FVB/n mice for the genes indicated in Table I. 2Primer sequences are available on request. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed either by restriction digest analysis or by cloning into pGEM®-T (Promega) or pBluescript SK II vectors, followed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing.Table IExpression of caspases and their regulators in the mouse lensGeneExpressionMethod of detectionGroup I caspasesCaspase-1YesRT-PCRGroup II caspasesCaspase-2YesaBoth long and short forms were detected.RT-PCRCaspase-3YesRT-PCRCaspase-7YesRT-PCRGroup III caspasesCaspase-6bCaspase-6 is grouped with Group III caspases as done by Thornberry et al.

Open table in a new tab In Situ hybridizationIn situ hybridization was performed as described previously (14Pan H. Griep A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2157-2169Google Scholar). bax and bak were amplified by PCR from 5′-RACE products derived from an E12.5 whole mouse embryo and cloned into the pGEM®-T-Easy vector to generate probes for in situ hybridization. A rat bcl-x gene (provided by R. Nickells, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) was used for in situ hybridization of eye sections from neonatal mice. RNase protection was carried out with rat mRNA as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Cell Culture15-ml cultures of THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells were grown at 37 °C and 95% humidity in Iscove's modified medium, 9% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.05 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. THP-1 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis (referred to as “activated” THP-1 cells) by incubation in 25 μm cycloheximide for 4 h prior to preparation of the extract (see below).Cytosolic Extract PreparationWhole lenses from neonatal mice or E15.5–18.5 rat embryos were excised, placed in hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (13Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1285-1299Google Scholar)), and sheared in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (23Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Google Scholar). The extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer® mini-dialysis units (Mr 7000 cutoff, Pierce) against buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, and 20 mm dithiothreitol and then stored at –80 °C until used. Typically, lenses from two litters of neonatal mice were pooled, and three separate pools were analyzed for caspase activities. Likewise, lenses from two to four litters of mouse or rat embryos were pooled, and at least two separate pools were analyzed for caspase activity. For THP-1 cell extracts, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g; the pellet was resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer; and cells were allowed to swell for 20 min prior to lysis in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Extracts were prepared as described for lens tissue. Protein concentrations for all extracts were determined by BCA reaction (Pierce).Enzyme Activity AssaysGeneral Caspase Activity Assay Conditions—Assays were performed in 100-μl reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 μm dithiothreitol with the extract amounts and peptide concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Production of AMC or AFC was measured at 10-min intervals for 50–60 min at 37 °C in a Tecan Flurostar 96-well plate reader using excitation wavelengths of 360 nm (AMC) and 405 nm (AFC) and emission wave-lengths of 465 nm (AMC) and 535 nm (AFC). For each sample in each assay, duplicate measurements were made. Enzyme activities were calculated using the CaspACE™ fluorometric assay system (Promega Corp.) as described by the manufacturer (60Corp Promega CaspACE™ Assay System, Fluorometric, Technical Bulletin No. 248. Promega Corp., Madison, WI2003Google Scholar). Briefly, the caspase-dependent cleavage activity of the specific reporter peptide was calculated as the difference between the rate of cleavage of the peptide in the absence of the corresponding inhibitor and the rate of cleavage after preincubation with the corresponding CHO or fmk inhibitor for 30 min. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using one-way analysis of variance.Caspase Reporter and Inhibitor Peptides—Caspase activity was measured using the following reporter peptides and inhibitors: YVAD-AFC/YVAD-CHO, WEHD-AFC/WEHD-fmk, VDVAD-AFC/VDVAD-fmk, DEVD-AFC/DEVD-CHO, LEVD-AFC/LEVD-CHO, VEID-AFC/VEID-CHO, IETD-AFC/IETD-CHO, and LEHD-AFC/LEHD-fmk (Calbiochem).Proteasome Activity Assays and Proteasome Inhibitors—Proteasome activity was measured by monitoring cleavage of 300 μm LLVY-AMC (Calbiochem) as described for caspase activity. Lactacystin (100 μm) was used to control for proteasome-specific activity. The proteasome inhibitors tested for their effects on caspase activity were lactacystin (100 μm), 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone (100 μm), epoxomicin (50 μm), and clasto-lactacystin/β-lactone (50 μm) (all from Calbiochem). The effect of proteasome inhibitors on caspase cleavage activity was calculated as the percentage of caspase reporter peptide cleavage by the recombinant caspase in the absence of inhibitor. All recombinant caspases were obtained from Calbiochem.Western Blot AnalysisLenses were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer; lysates were prepared; and protein concentrations were measured as described previously (13Pan H. Griep A.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1285-1299Google Scholar, 24Stolen C.M. Jackson M. Griep A.E. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4009-4017Google Scholar). 300 μg of extract was separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were probed overnight with anti-caspase-6 or anti-caspase-3 antibody (9762 and D175, respectively; Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and signal was detected using the ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (MAB374, Chemicon International, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a loading control. Blots were imaged on the Storm™ 860 system, and levels of fluorescence were quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) and Microsoft Excel.TUNEL AnalysisHeads from E15.5, E17.5, and E19.5 rat embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm sections were cut, and sections corresponding to the most central regions of the lens were subjected to TUNEL analysis using the ApopTag Plus fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen Co.) as described previously (14Pan H. Griep A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2157-2169Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression of Caspases and Regulatory Molecules in the Lens—Many caspases and caspase regulatory molecules have been reported to be expressed in lenses from a range of species (3Dahm R.

Although some studies have examined caspase and caspase regulator expression in murine lenses (28Tamada Y. Fukiage C. Nakamura Y. Azuma M. Kim Y.H. Shearer T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 300-306Google Scholar, 29Yoshizawa K. Oishi Y. Nambu H. Yamamoto D. Yang J. Senzaki H. Miki H. Tsubura A. Toxicol. Pathol. 2000; 28: 555-564Google Scholar, 30Yao K. Wang K. Xu W. Sun Z. Shentu X. Qiu P. Chin. Med. J. (Engl. Ed.). 2003; 116: 1034-1038Google Scholar), a broad survey of the spectrum of molecules involved in the caspase pathway for mouse and rat has not been conducted. To determine the extent to which caspases and their regulators are expressed in murine lenses, we conducted RT-PCR, RNase protection, and in situ hybridization experiments on lens RNA or lens sections from neonatal mice. Caspases can be divided roughly into three groups based on their substrate affinities (31Thornberry N. Rano T. Peterson E. Rasper D. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V. Nordstrom P. Roy S. Vaillancourt J. Chapman K. Nicholson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Google Scholar). Group I caspases are primarily involved in the generation of an immune response. Group II caspases are thought to mediate the majority of changes that are associated with the apoptotic phenotype. Group III caspases are thought to be primarily involved in the activation of the group II caspases. RNA transcripts from a wide range of caspase genes and genes that encode proteins that can regulate caspases were detected in neonatal mouse lenses (Table I). Intact receptor-associated pathways were present for both tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and fas. Transcripts for the Group I caspase, caspase-1, and for several Group II and III caspases were detected. Finally, transcripts for many caspase regulatory molecules also were also detected, indicating that multiple levels of control of caspase activity might be in place within the lens. Thus, it would appear that lens cells should be capable of regulating and promoting a variety of caspase responses.Establishing Caspase-specific Assays for the Lens: Eliminating the Contribution of the Proteasome in Caspase Activity Assays—To determine which caspases are active in cell extracts from the lens, we used caspase activity assays. These assays take advantage of a panel of short peptide substrates, each of which contains the preferred sequence for cleavage by a given caspase (32Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R.

Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar). For use in these activity assays, the short peptide substrates are conjugated to fluorochromes and used as reporter molecules. When mixed with extracts containing caspases, the reporter peptide is recognized by caspases in an amino acid sequence-specific manner, and the fluorochrome is cleaved from the peptide, generating fluorescence that can be measured by fluorometry. The same peptides, when conjugated to reactive chemical moieties such as CHO and fmk are potent inhibitors of caspases (33Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Google Scholar). Preincubation of an extract with an inhibitor prior to the addition of the corresponding reporter peptide arguably controls for non-caspase-mediated cleavage of the reporter peptides. The difference between fluorescence generated in the absence and presence of inhibitor is taken to be reflective of the “caspase-specific” activity. However, for the calculation to be accurate, these peptides must be highly specific substrates for caspases. If any other enzyme cleaves the reporter and is also inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, then caspase activity will be overestimated. This error could become quite pronounced if there is a large amount of nonspecific enzyme activity and/or a small amount of intrinsic caspase activity within the extracts being tested.The proteasome is a cytosolic multisubunit complex containing a number of discrete proteolytic activities that degrade specifically targeted proteins. The proteasome contains an activity capable of cleaving caspase reporter peptides (34Kobayashi T. Shinozaki A. Momoi T. Arahata K. Tsukahara T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 699-704Google Scholar, 35Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Google Scholar). This capacity of the proteasome most likely is due to the post-glutamyl-peptide hydrolase activity of this enzyme complex (36Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Google Scholar). Of note, this proteasome activity was also found to be sensitive to preincubation with YVAD-CHO and YVKD-CHO, two caspase peptidyl inhibitors. Bovine, rat, and human lenses have been shown to contain significant levels of proteasome activity (37Wagner B. Margolis J. Garland D. Roseman J. Exp. Eye Res. 1986; 43: 1141-1143Google Scholar, 38Shang F. Gong X. McAvoy J. Chamberlain C. Nowell T. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 179-192Google Scholar, 39Andersson M. Sjostrand J. Karlsson J.-O. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 231-236Google Scholar). To assess proteasome activity levels in murine lens extracts ourselves, we tested extracts from whole lenses of neonatal mice for their capacity to cleave the proteasome chymotrypsin-like substrate LLVY-AMC. The extracts contained an activity of 15.88 ± 1.82 fmol μg–1 min–1. Additionally, the LLVY-AMC cleavage activity was inhibited by the caspase inhibitors VEID-CHO and IETD-CHO (data not shown). Finally, YVAD-AFC cleavage activity was abolished by preincubation with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Thus, not only can the proteasome recognize caspase substrates, as previously noted (34Kobayashi T. Shinozaki A. Momoi T. Arahata K. Tsukahara T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 699-704Google Scholar, 35Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Google Scholar), but also at least four different caspase inhibitory peptides can significantly inhibit the proteasome. From these data, we conclude that proteasome activity must be inhibited to measure accurately caspase activity in lens extracts.To identify a proteasome inhibitor that would not cross-react with caspases, we tested four common proteasome inhibitors for their ability to inhibit caspases. Recombinant caspase-1, -3, -6, and -8 were examined for activity against their preferred reporter peptides after preincubation with the proteasome inhibitors listed in Table II. Each of these proteasome inhibitors has been demonstrated to inhibit the trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and post-glutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities of the proteasome (40Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 905-912Google Scholar, 41Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Google Scholar, 42Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the inhibitors varied in their effect on the recombinant caspases, ranging from minimal to almost complete inhibition. Of the four inhibitors studied, lactacystin was the only one to show minimal effects on the activity of all caspases tested. Therefore, we chose to use lactacystin to inhibit the proteasome in subsequent caspase activity assays.Table IIProteasome inhibitors versus recombinant caspasesInhibitorCaspase-1Caspase-3Caspase-6Caspase-8%%%%NIP-L3 VS60ND1281Epoxomicin619172NDβ-Lactone729269NDLactacystin11211210891 Open table in a new tab We next determined the concentration of lactacystin needed to inhibit the proteasome activity found in lens extracts. Consistent with previous studies in the lens (39Andersson M. Sjostrand J. Karlsson J.-O. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 231-236Google Scholar), proteasome activity was fully inhibited by 100 μm lactacystin (data not shown), a concentration ∼10-fold higher than that typically used to inhibit this activity in extracts from other tissues.Caspase Activity in Normal Lens Extracts—Having determined the appropriate conditions for reliably measuring caspase activities in mouse lens extracts, we next tested lens extracts for caspase peptidyl cleavage activities. As a wide range of caspases were found to be transcribed in the lens (Table I), cleavage of eight different reporter peptides that are the preferred substrates for eight different caspases (31Thornberry N. Rano T. Peterson E. Rasper D. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V. Nordstrom P. Roy S. Vaillancourt J. Chapman K. Nicholson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Google Scholar) was tested. First, to verify that all peptides could be cleaved, cleavage of all the peptides was tested in an extract generated from THP-1 cells that had been induced to undergo apoptosis. In preliminary experiments, there was very"
https://openalex.org/W2097840795,"The NIa proteinase from pepper vein banding virus (PVBV) is a sequence-specific proteinase required for processing of viral polyprotein in the cytoplasm. It accumulates in the nucleus of the infected plant cell and forms inclusion bodies. The function of this protein in the nucleus is not clear. The purified recombinant NIa proteinase was active, and the mutation of the catalytic residues His-46, Asp-81, and Cys-151 resulted in complete loss of activity. Most interesting, the PVBV NIa proteinase exhibited previously unidentified activity, namely nonspecific double-stranded DNA degradation. This DNase activity of the NIa proteinase showed an absolute requirement for Mg2+. Site-specific mutational analysis showed that of the three catalytic residues, Asp-81 was the crucial residue for DNase activity. Mutation of His-46 and Cys-151 had no effect on the DNase activity, whereas mutant D81N was partially active, and D81G was completely inactive. Based on kinetic analysis and molecular modeling, a metal ion-dependent catalysis similar to that observed in other nonspecific DNases is proposed. Similar results were obtained with glutathione S-transferase-fused PVBV NIa proteinase and tobacco etch virus NIa proteinase, confirming that the DNase function is an intrinsic property of potyviral NIa proteinase. The NIa protein present in the infected plant nuclear extract also showed the proteinase and the DNase activities, suggesting that the PVBV NIa protein that accumulates in the nucleus late in the infection cycle might serve to degrade the host DNA. Thus the dual function of the NIa proteinase could play an important role in the life cycle of the virus.

The NIa protein present in the infected plant nuclear extract also showed the proteinase and the DNase activities, suggesting that the PVBV NIa protein that accumulates in the nucleus late in the infection cycle might serve to degrade the host DNA. Thus the dual function of the NIa proteinase could play an important role in the life cycle of the virus. The genus Potyvirus is the largest plant virus group comprising more than 30% of all known plant viruses and is economically very important (1Hull R. Matthews Plant Virology. 4th Ed. A Harcourt Science and Technology Company, London, UK2002Google Scholar). The name potyvirus is derived from the type member of the group, the potato Y virus. It belongs to the Potyviridae family, which includes five other genera. All members of the genera in this family have similar genome organization and gene expression strategies and are grouped under the “Picornalike superfamily” of viruses (2Riechmann J.L. Lain S. Garcia J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Google Scholar). The virions of potyviruses are flexuous rod-shaped particles of 700–900 nm in length and 9–11 nm width. The genome is a single-stranded positive sense RNA of about 10 kb length, which is encapsidated by ∼2000 identical coat protein subunits of 30–37 kDa (1Hull R. Matthews Plant Virology. 4th Ed. A Harcourt Science and Technology Company, London, UK2002Google Scholar). Pepper vein banding virus (PVBV) 1The abbreviations used are: PVBV, pepper vein banding virus; TEV, tobacco etch virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser de-sorption ionization-time-of-flight; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. is the most prevalent virus infecting chili pepper in India. Recently, the complete genomic sequence of the virus was determined, and phylogenetic analysis clearly established that PVBV is a distinct member of the Potyvirus genus (3Anindya R. Joseph J. Gowri T.D. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2004; 149: 625-632Google Scholar). The PVBV genome is 9771 nucleotides in length with 5′- and 3′-nontranslated end regions and a poly(A) tail at the 3′-end. As in other potyviruses, the PVBV genome contains a single large open reading frame, which can be translated to a polyprotein of 340 kDa that undergoes proteolytic processing predominantly by a viral proteinase, called nuclear inclusion proteinase-a (NIa proteinase) (4Carrington J.C. Cary S.M. Parks T.D. Dougherty W.G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 365-370Google Scholar). The potyviral NIa proteinases share structural motifs typical of cellular serine proteinases, although there is no sequence similarity, with a Cys rather than Ser at the active site (5Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Koonin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 103-114Google Scholar, 6Kim D.H. Hwang D.C. Kang B.H. Lew J. Choi K.Y. Virology. 1996; 221: 245-249Google Scholar, 7Kim D.H. Hwang D.C. Kang B.H. Lew J. Han J. Song B.D. Choi K.Y. Virology. 1996; 226: 183-190Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis studies with tobacco etch virus (TEV) (13Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. Cary S.M. Parks T.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1281-1287Google Scholar), Plum pox potyvirus (8Garcia J.A. Lain S. Cervera M.T. Riechmann J.L. Martin M.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2773-2779Google Scholar), and PVBV NIa proteinases (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar) have unequivocally established the role of His-Asp-Cys in forming the catalytic triad responsible for the cleavage by the proteinase. The specificity of these proteinases is determined by the heptapeptide recognition sequence surrounding each cleavage site (10Carrington J.C. Haldeman R. Dolja V.V. Restrepo-Hartwig M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6995-7000Google Scholar, 11Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Google Scholar). NIa proteinase cleaves the polypeptide on the C-terminal side of a Gln or Glu residue at the P1 position within the heptapeptide sequence. Most interesting, another serine-like cysteine protease, picornaviral 3C protease, also has similar specificity of cleavage. Recently, the structure of TEV NIa proteinase complexed with a substrate peptide was determined (12Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters III, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Google Scholar). The structure of the NIa proteinase was found to be similar to that of picornavirus 3C protease (12Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters III, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Google Scholar). The NIa protein has two domains, the C-terminal NIa-proteinase domain and the N-terminal viral genome-linked protein domain (13Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. Cary S.M. Parks T.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1281-1287Google Scholar). As the name suggests, it forms “inclusion bodies” inside the nucleus of infected cells at a late stage of infection (2Riechmann J.L. Lain S. Garcia J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Google Scholar, 14Knuhtsen H. Hiebert E. Purcifull D.E. Virology. 1974; 61: 200-209Google Scholar). NIa protein has independent nuclear localization signals that allow it to accumulate in the nucleus, although their function in the nucleus is unclear (15Hajimorad M.R. Ding X.S. Flasinski S. Mahajan S. Graff E. Haldman-Cahill R. Carrington J.C. Cassidy B.G. Virology. 1996; 224: 368-379Google Scholar, 16Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. Leinicke A.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 953-962Google Scholar, 17Schaad M.C. Haldeman-Cahill R. Cronin S. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7039-7048Google Scholar). The NIa proteinase was also shown to bind to RNA nonspecifically, suggesting its involvement in virus replication (18Daros J.A. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1997; 237: 327-336Google Scholar). Thus the NIa functions as a multifunctional protein in the infected cell cytoplasm. In the present investigation, the wild-type and the site-specific mutants of PVBV NIa proteinase were used to establish an additional enzymatic activity of NIa proteinase, i.e. nonspecific dsDNA degradation. Furthermore, the NIa protein in the nucleus of infected leaves was shown to be a dual function enzyme, containing both the proteinase and the DNase activities. It is possible that the NIa proteinase with this novel DNase activity might play an important role in host cell DNA degradation in the later stages of infection cycle. Materials—Restriction endonucleases and modification enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas. Deep Vent DNA polymerase and DpnI were obtained from New England Biolabs. Ampicillin, IPTG, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, acrylamide, EDTA, imidazole, reduced glutathione, Agarose, Triton-X100, 2-mercaptoethanol, MgCl2, and all the buffers used were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Glutathione-Sepharose and Ni-NTA-agarose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Qiagen, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Sigma. λ phage DNA, M13 single-stranded DNA, was obtained from Bangalore Genei, India. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Point Mutants in Escherichia coli—The cloning of the NIa gene in pRSET-C (Invitrogen) and the construction of pRNIa and site-specific mutant pRNIa C151A and pRNIa D81N clones have been described previously (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar). Using pRNIa as template and the corresponding set of mutant primers (H46-sen, 5′-CAA ATC GCG CTT TAC TC-3′, His-46-anti, 5′-GAG TAA AGC GCG ATT TG-3′, D81G-sen, 5′-GTA GAG AAA CAT GGA ATT CTG CTC-3′, and D81G-anti, 5′-GAG CAG AAT TCC ATG TTT CTC TAC-3′), the mutant clones pRNIa-H46A and pRNIa-D81G were constructed by the PCR-based method (19Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Google Scholar). The clones pRNIa, pRNIa H46A, pRNIa D81N, pRNIa D81G, and pRNIa C151A were used for the expression of His-tagged NIa proteinase and its mutants as described earlier (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar). To obtain GST-fused NIa proteinase and site-specific mutants, NIa and the mutants were PCR-amplified with a pair of specific primers (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar) using pRNIa and the corresponding mutants as template and subcloned at a SmaI site of pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting constructs were named pGNIa, pGNIa-D81G, pGNIa D81N, pGNIa H46A, and pGNIa C151A. All the plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pRNIa or pGNIa or mutant constructs were grown and induced for protein expression. A single colony was inoculated in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 30 °C. This overnight culture was inoculated into 0.5 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After 4 h of growth at 30 °C, the cells were induced with 0.3 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells from 1 ml of culture were used for checking the expression by SDS-PAGE analysis on 12% gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or immunoblotted (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against purified His-tagged NIa proteinase (22Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1679-1687Google Scholar) to confirm their identity. Purification of His-tagged proteins was carried out as described previously (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar). Purification of GST-NIa proteinases was carried out using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturers. Typical yields after elution with glutathione were 5 mg of protein/liter of culture. We obtained the plasmid pTEV-NIa as a kind gift from Dr. Michael Ehrmann. The recombinant His-tagged TEV NIa proteinase was purified similarly as described for PVBV NIa proteinase. The PVBV NIa proteinase and the mutants were further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl-S200 (Amersham Biosciences) column (90 × 1 cm, 60 ml). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, and calibrated using gel filtration standard (Sigma) for size exclusion chromatography. Purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and MALDI-MS (Amersham Biosciences). Construction, Expression, and Purification of the GFP Substrate— Green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding region was PCR-amplified using a pair of specific primers, GFP-sen, (5′ CGGTGAAGTTGC/CCATCAGGCAGGAGA ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG CTG TTC-3′) GFP-anti (5′-CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC GAG AGT-3′) from the vector pProEX-HT (Invitrogen) and cloned at PvuII site of pRSET-C. The underlined nucleotides in GFP-sen primer represent nine amino acid residues corresponding to the conserved cleavage recognition sequences of PVBV NIa proteinase (NH2-GEVAHQ↓AGE-COOH). The expressed protein from the recombinant clone (pSubGFP) would have 41 residues (including 6 histidines) from the vector and 9 residues corresponding to the cleavage recognition sequence of PVBV NIa proteinase at the N terminus of GFP. Such a fused protein can serve as substrate for NIa proteinase and was therefore called GFP substrate. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pSub-GFP were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with IPTG (0.3 mm) for overexpression. Purification of GFP substrate fusion protein was carried out using Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Typical yields after elution with imidazole were 15 mg protein/liter culture. Purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of the cleavage site residues was confirmed by PVBV NIa proteinase assay. NIa proteinase assay with GFP substrate in solution was carried out as follows. GFP substrate (100 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of His-tagged or GST-fused PVBV NIa proteinase in 50 μl of assay buffer (200 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 10% glycerol) at 37 °C for 4 h. For assay with the plant nuclear extract, total extract was taken as a source of proteinase at a final concentration of 100 μgin50 μl of assay buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cleavage by the NIa proteinase was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against Ni-NTA affinity-purified GFP obtained from expression of pRGFP. NIa Proteinase Assay with Bead-attached GFP Substrate—In vitro bead-attached GFP substrate cleavage by NIa proteinase was carried out as described by Patel et al. (23Patel D. Frelinger J. Goudsmit J. Kim B. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (1196, and 1198): 1194Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, 25 ml of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pSub-GFP were grown and induced for expression. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.2) and lysed by mild sonication. Ni-NTA-agarose slurry (200 μl) was added to the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of cell lysate and incubated for 30 min. GFP substrate-bound Ni-NTA-agarose beads were washed three times with wash buffer (binding buffer with 30 mm imidazole) followed by a final wash with binding buffer. Parallel experiments were carried out to determine the amount of bound GFP substrate by eluting the protein from the washed beads by adding 300 mm imidazole. Substrate-bound beads were resuspended in reaction buffer (binding buffer with 10% glycerol), and the final concentration of the substrate was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. His-tagged PVBV NIa proteinase was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the proteinase reaction mixture was incubated with intermittent gentle agitation at 37 °C for 60 min. Agarose beads attached to uncleaved substrate were removed by brief centrifugation. The supernatant retained the cleaved product (GFP) and the amount of GFP released was measured by GFP fluorescence (excitation at 490 nm and emission at 510 nm) using a spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) over the blank reaction where no enzyme was added. A standard curve was generated by plotting the relative fluorescence emission of recombinant GFP at 510 nm as a function of GFP concentration and was used as reference for determining the amount of product formed by the PVBV NIa proteinase. DNA Binding Analysis—A 300-bp PCR product (4 μg), λ phage DNA (0.5 μg), or M13 single-stranded DNA (0.5 μg) was incubated with a range of concentrations (0.5–2 μg) of PVBV His-tagged NIa proteinase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 0.5 h in a final volume 40 μl. After stopping the reaction by addition of 6 μl of loading dye, 10 μl of each sample was loaded in 0.7% agarose gel and electrophoresed in 1× TAE. The DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Deoxyribonuclease Activity—DNase reaction mixture, containing λ phage DNA or M13 single-stranded DNA or double-stranded pUC-19 vector DNA (5 μg) and purified recombinant His-tagged or GST-NIa proteinase (1 μg), was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 1 mm MgCl2 in a final volume 40 μl. For each reaction sample, 6 μl of DNA loading dye (MBI Fermentas) was added to terminate the reaction. 5 μl of each sample was loaded in 0.7% agarose gel and electrophoresed in 1× TAE, and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In the reactions involving total nuclear extract, 5 μg of total nuclear protein was used instead of NIa proteinase. DNA was visualized under ultraviolet light by ethidium bromide staining. DNase activity was also estimated quantitatively by measuring the liberated acid-soluble oligonucleotides and mononucleotides as described by Rashid et al. (24Rashid N. Morikawa M. Nagahisa K. Kanaya S. Imanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 719-726Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction mixture contained 50 μgof λ phage DNA, 5 μg of purified His-tagged or GST-NIa proteinase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 1 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 60 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of equal volumes of acid lanthanum reagent (20 mm La(NO3)3 in 0.2 n HCl). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) against a blank sample without enzyme. The amount of product released was calculated by using an average molar absorption coefficient of 10,750 per nucleotide at 260 nm (25Warshaw M.M. Cantor C.R. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1079-1103Google Scholar). Plots of nanomoles of product released per min/mg of protein versus DNA concentration were hyperbolic for wild-type and the mutant NIa proteinases, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to generate apparent Vmax and Km values. Although the present study could not provide absolute steady state values because of polymeric nature of the substrate, useful information was obtained by a comparison of Vmax values between the mutants and the wild-type enzyme. The kcat values for these enzymes were calculated from the respective Vmax values using a molecular mass of 33,524.2 Da for the enzymes (25Warshaw M.M. Cantor C.R. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1079-1103Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclei from the Plant Tissue—Nuclei from healthy and infected plants were prepared by a method described by Cheah and Osborne (26Cheah K.S. Osborne D.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 141-144Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Minced leaves were homogenized in a pre-chilled mortar and pestle in homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose in 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered through three layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem). The residue was washed with homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and was pelleted at 350 × g for 8 min in a centrifuge (Hitachi). The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer without Triton X-100 and centrifuged as before. The final pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer (homogenization buffer containing 20% v/v glycerol) and stored at –70 °C. All the procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Nuclear extract was prepared as described by Parker and Topol (27Parker C.S. Topol J. Cell. 1984; 37: 273-283Google Scholar) with some modification. Frozen nuclei were thawed, and an equal volume of homogenization buffer was added. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation as before and dissolved in nuclear lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgCl2) with gentle stirring. Total protein was precipitated by 80% ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was dissolved in nuclear extraction buffer (NEB: 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol) and dialyzed overnight against NEB. Total protein in the extract was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay System using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunodepletion Experiments—For immunodepletion, total nuclear protein concentration was adjusted to 2 mg/ml. Any unsolubilized material was discarded by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 400 μl of the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 μg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-NIa antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgGs (as a negative control). Subsequently, 100 μl of pre-washed protein-A-Sepharose was added to the sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunodepleted supernatants were separated from the pellets by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. Expression and Purification of PVBV NIa Proteinase and Its Mutants in E. coli—PVBV NIa proteinase and its mutants were overexpressed in E. coli as N-terminal histidine tag or GST-fused proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis of IPTG-induced E. coli showed the induction of 33.5-kDa His-tagged (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and 58-kDa GST fusion NIa proteinase (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The His-tagged proteinase was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 1), whereas GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1D, lane 1). The affinity-purified proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography, and their native molecular weight was determined (Fig. 1E). The His-tagged NIa proteinase eluted as a monomer at 28.6 ml corresponding to 34 kDa (solid line, Fig. 1E), whereas the GST-fused NIa proteinase eluted at 24.1 ml as a dimer of 110-kDa size (dotted line, Fig. 1E). The dimer formation could be because of GST, as GST is known to exist as dimers (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar), and in this instance a monomer (NIa) has “dimerized” as a GST fusion protein. The purity of the NIa proteinase was assessed by MALDI-MS, and the molecular weight of His-tagged NIa proteinase was determined to be 33,456.3 Da (Fig. 1F), which was in agreement with the expected Mr of 33524.2. Two of the catalytic triad residues of PVBV NIa proteinase Asp-81 and Cys-151 were mutated to Asn and Ala, respectively, and were shown to be inactive (9Joseph J. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 2493-2502Google Scholar). In the present study His-46 was mutated to Ala and Asp-81 was mutated to Gly as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These mutants, H46A, C151A, D81N, and D81G, were expressed both as N-terminal His tag or GST fusion proteins and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography or GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography, respectively, as described earlier. The purity of the His-tagged H46A, C151A, D81N, and D81G mutant NIa proteinases (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5) and the corresponding GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1D, lanes 2–5) was checked by SDS-PAGE. These highly pure wild-type and mutant proteins were used for the characterization of the enzymatic properties. His-tagged TEV NIa proteinase was expressed and purified similarly like that of His-tagged PVBV NIa proteinase. Characterization of Proteinase Activity—The proteinase activity of PVBV NIa proteinase and its mutants was evaluated using a new fluorometric procedure. The substrate for the assay was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein substrate had three different modules (Fig. 2A), namely binding module (hexahistidine tag), proteinase cleavage module representing nine amino acid recognition sequence (NH2-GEVAHQ↓AGE-COOH), and detection module (green fluorescence protein). If such a protein substrate (37 kDa) were incubated with the purified NIa proteinase, then specific cleavage by the enzyme would result in the release of GFP (31 kDa) that can be monitored by Western analysis by using anti-GFP antibodies. The reaction can also be monitored by using Ni-NTA-agarose bound substrate in which case the GFP released into the buffer is estimated by measuring the relative fluorescence at 510 nm after the excitation at 490 nm. The quantity of the released GFP can be estimated from the standard curve of relative fluorescence as a function of GFP concentration. As shown in Fig. 2B, the assay with bead-attached substrate resulted in the release of GFP as a function of time, with wild-type His-tagged NIa proteinase, whereas the H46A, D81G, D81N, and C151A mutant NIa proteinases did not show any substrate cleavage activity. The progression of the cleavage reaction was also monitored by Western analysis using anti-GFP polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 2, C–E). There was a progressive increase in the formation of a 31-kDa GFP with an increase in the time of incubation, and more than 95% of the substrate (100 μg) (Fig. 2C, lane 9) was cleaved in 90 min by the His-tagged NIa proteinase (5 μg). These results demonstrate that the solution assay is more efficient than the cleavage of the bead-attached substrate. The efficiency of proteinase reaction was neither affected by addition of divalent cations like Mn2+ and Mg2+ nor by the presence of metal chelator EDTA (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2D, His-tagged H46A, D81G, D81N, and C151A mutant NIa proteinases failed to cleave the protein substrate, and no GFP release (31-kDa band) was observed. GST-fused NIa proteinase also cleaved the GFP substrate (Fig. 2E, lane 2), and as expected, the GST-fused C151A, D81N, H46A, and D81G mutant proteins did not show any release of GFP (Fig. 2E, lanes 3–6, respectively). These results demonstrate that both the recombinant His-tagged NIa proteinase and GST-fused NIa proteinase are active, and His-46, Asp-81, and Cys-151 constitute the catalytic triad in the enzyme. Mutation of any of these residues completely abolished the activity of both the monomeric (His-tagged NIa proteinase) and the dimeric forms (GST-tagged NIa proteinase) of PVBV NIa proteinase. DNase Activity of PVBV NIa Proteinases—Earlier, potyviral NIa proteinase was shown to bind to RNA nonspecifically. Most interesting, when the purified His-tagged PVBV NIa proteinase was tested for its nucleic acid binding properties, we observed that it also binds to single-stranded and doublestranded DNA nonspecifically. As shown in Fig. 3A, His-tagged NIa proteinase could gel-shift a 300-bp PCR-amplified dsDNA fragment, when incubated along with 0.5 mm EDTA. The protein-DNA complex migrated slower than the free DNA, and the large protein-DNA complex remained within the well (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when doublestranded λ phage DNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) and single-stranded M13 phage DNA (Fig. 3C, lane 3) were incubated with His-tagged NIa proteinase. However, when double-stranded λ DNA was incubated with NIa proteinase at 37 °C in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 1 mm MgCl2) without EDTA, there was a linear increase in the degradation of DNA with an increase in the time of incubation, and almost complete degradation was observed in 45 min as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–8). NIa proteinase could also cleave pUC-19 plasmid DNA (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 2). Most interesting, when single-stranded DNA instead of double-stranded DNA was incubated with PVBV NIa proteinase at 37 °C, no such degradation was observed (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 4). We have also tested TEV NIa proteinase, another potyvirus with 48% sequence identity to PVBV NIa proteinase, for such activity. As shown in Fig. 3F, TEV NIa proteinase also showed comparable DNase activ"
https://openalex.org/W2072247726,"Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1) is a DNA-binding protein required for embryonic development and linked to clinical depression and suicidal behavior in humans. Although primarily nuclear, cytoplasmic localization of DEAF-1 has been observed, and this suggests the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES). Using a series of fluorescent fusion proteins, an NES with a novel spacing of leucines (LXLX6LLX5LX2L) was identified near the COOH-terminal MYND domain at amino acids 454-476. The NES was leptomycin B-sensitive and mutation of the leucine residues decreased or eliminated nuclear export activity. In vitro pull downs and an in vivo fluorescent protein interaction assay identified a DEAF-1/DEAF-1 protein interaction domain within the NES region. DNA binding had been previously mapped to a positively charged surface patch in the novel DNA binding fold called the “SAND” domain. A second protein-protein interaction domain was identified at amino acids 243-306 that contains the DNA-binding SAND domain and also an adjacent zinc binding motif and a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Deletion of these adjacent sequences or mutation of the conserved cysteines or histidine in the zinc binding motif not only inhibits protein interaction but also eliminates DNA binding, demonstrating that DEAF-1 protein-protein interaction is required for DNA recognition. The identification of an NES and NLS provides a basis for the control of DEAF-1 subcellular localization and function, whereas the requirement of protein-protein interaction by the SAND domain appears to be unique among this class of transcription factors.

McGinnis N. Chadwick R. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 767-777Google Scholar). The human, rat, and monkey homologs of Drosophila DEAF-1 (dDEAF-1) were previously called “nuclear DEAF-1 related” (NUDR) because of the limited protein similarity (46%) to dDEAF-1 (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Genomic sequencing projects have confirmed a single gene in metazoan genomes with the overall structure of dDEAF-1, therefore we have adopted the DEAF-1 designation for all orthologs of the gene. DEAF-1 proteins are structurally defined as having both a DNA binding SAND domain (Sp100, AIRE-1, NucP41/75, DEAF-1) (3Gibson T.J. Ramu C. Gemund C. Aasland R. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Google Scholar, 7Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Google Scholar). Functional domains outside of these regions of DEAF-1 have yet to be extensively characterized.DEAF-1 appears to be an important factor in development and cancer. Loss of function mutations in DEAF-1 produce early embryonic arrest or segmentation defects in Drosophila, whereas overexpression of DEAF-1 can disrupt eye and wing development (8Veraksa A. Kennison J. McGinnis W. Genesis. 2002; 33: 67-76Google Scholar). DEAF-1 mRNA is widely expressed during mouse embryogenesis with elevated levels in several tissues, including the central nervous system and the dorsal root ganglia (9Sugihara T.M. Bach I. Kioussi C. Rosenfeld M.G. Andersen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15418-15423Google Scholar). DEAF-1 interacts with LMO4 and NLI (10Sum E.Y. Peng B. Yu X. Chen J. Byrne J. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7849-7856Google Scholar), transcriptional regulators that mediate embryonic pattern formation and cell fate, including neuronal differentiation (11Chen H.H. Yip J.W. Stewart A.F. Frank E. Development. 2002; 129: 4879-4889Google Scholar, 12Thaler J.P. Lee S.K. Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 2002; 110: 237-249Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the DEAF-1 and LMO4 alleles in mice produce similar phenotypes of neural tube defects and exencephaly (13Hahm K. Sum E.Y. Fujiwara Y. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2074-2082Google Scholar, 14Tse E. Smith A.J. Hunt S. Lavenir I. Forster A. Warren A.J. Grutz G. Foroni L. Carlton M.B. Colledge W.H. Boehm T. Rabbitts T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2063-2073Google Scholar). In humans, recent evidence suggests that DEAF-1 is required for normal repression of the 5HT-1a receptor in neurons of the Raphe nucleus, and loss of this repression may result in clinical depression and suicidal behavior (15Lemonde S. Turecki G. Bakish D. Du L. Hrdina P.D. Bown C.D. Sequeira A. Kushwaha N. Morris S.J. Basak A. Ou X.M. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8788-8799Google Scholar). Also, DEAF-1 (called “suppressin”) appears to be mutated in tumors and cell lines from human colorectal adenocarcinoma (16Manne U. Gary B.D. Oelschlager D.K. Weiss H.L. Frost A.R. Grizzle W.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3495-3503Google Scholar), suggesting DEAF-1 could contribute to cancer etiology. In transfected cells, DEAF-1 protein appears predominantly as a nuclear protein (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar), whereas colorectal tissue and a neuronal cell line have shown cytoplasmic or perinuclear localization of DEAF-1 (15Lemonde S. Turecki G. Bakish D. Du L. Hrdina P.D. Bown C.D. Sequeira A. Kushwaha N. Morris S.J. Basak A. Ou X.M. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8788-8799Google Scholar, 16Manne U. Gary B.D. Oelschlager D.K. Weiss H.L. Frost A.R. Grizzle W.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3495-3503Google Scholar). Mutation of a single amino acid in the nuclear localization signal can completely shift DEAF-1 from nuclear to cytoplasmic localization, suggesting the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Nuclear export signals are often small regions rich in leucines and hydrophobic amino acids (17Tajima Y. Goto K. Yoshida M. Shinomiya K. Sekimoto T. Yoneda Y. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10716-10721Google Scholar, 18Michael W.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 46-50Google Scholar), and the NES appears to be an important regulatory domain for proteins such as p53, BRCA-1, and HDAC4 (19O'Keefe K. Li H. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6396-6405Google Scholar, 20Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Google Scholar, 21Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Google Scholar).The DNA binding activity of DEAF-1 has been mapped to a novel α/β-fold called the SAND domain (24Bottomley M.J. Collard M.W. Huggenvik J.I. Liu Z. Gibson T.J. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 626-633Google Scholar). A conserved KDWK motif is part of a positively charged surface patch within the SAND domain and is required for DNA binding. In the SAND domain of the glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding (GMEB) protein (25Zeng H. Jackson D.A. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17756-17762Google Scholar, 26Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21901Google Scholar), an adjacent zinc binding motif may help provide structure to the DNA binding domain, however, it does not appear necessary for DNA binding (27Lo Surdo P. Bottomley M.J. Sattler M. Scheffzek K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1283-1295Google Scholar). Other SAND domain containing proteins, such as SP100 and AIRE-1, lack this zinc binding motif, indicating this structure is not required for DNA binding by the SAND domain of some proteins (27Lo Surdo P. Bottomley M.J. Sattler M. Scheffzek K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1283-1295Google Scholar). In DEAF-1, the function of the zinc finger adjacent to the SAND domain has not been evaluated.Because nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking may play an important role in the regulation of DEAF-1 function, we have sought to further define the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in DEAF-1. We have found that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and newly identified NES of DEAF-1 can participate in DEAF-1/DEAF-1 protein interaction. In addition, the NLS, and the zinc binding motif adjacent to the SAND domain are shown to be required for DEAF-1 binding to DNA. Thus, these protein regions appear to provide unique functions to DEAF-1 relative to other SAND domain-containing factors.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—All DEAF-1 constructs were derived from human nuclear DEAF-1-related cDNA, accession number AF049459, unless otherwise noted. COOH-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged or FLAG-tagged DEAF-1 constructs in pcDNA3 were generated using PCR with the reverse primer 5′-GGGATCCTCATGCATAGTCTGGTACGTCATATGGATACACGGTCACCTTCTCCATCAC-3′ for the HA tag or the reverse primer 5′-GGGATCCTCACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCACGGTCACCTTCTCCATCAC-3′ for the FLAG tag. Both primers eliminate the DEAF-1 stop codon and provide an in-frame HA or FLAG sequence followed by a stop codon and a BamHI site. Plasmid constructs of the K304T mutation in DEAF-1 and the GFP-DEAF-1-(K304T) were previously described (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). A region that encompassed the K304T mutation was excised with restriction enzymes and used to replace the wild type region in DEAF-1-HA to create the HA-tagged K304T construct. The DNA encoding K315A/K316A, K304R, and L465A/L466A mutations in DEAF-1 were generated by PCR following previously described methods (28Jensik P. Holbird D. Cox T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. 2002; 172: 569-576Google Scholar). The DEAF-1 construct with the K304T/L465A/L466A mutations was generated by ligating a HindIII/AatII fragment of K304T and an AatII/BamHI fragment of L465A/L466A into HindIII/BamHI cut pcDNA3. The 2xGFP construct was generated by ligating an NheI/BamHI fragment from GFP-C1 (Clontech), which included the GFP coding region, into a NheI/BamHI cut pGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). The 2xGFP-(p73NES) (29Inoue T. Stuart J. Leno R. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15053-15060Google Scholar), 2xGFP-(453-476), and 2xGFP-(NESm1-6) constructs were synthesized using overlapping primers and PCR. Regions of DEAF-1 cDNA were amplified by PCR using specific primers that allowed for in-frame ligation into the HindIII/BamHI sites of 2xGFP or BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GFP-DEAF-1 or GST-DEAF-1 fusion proteins, respectively. DEAF-1-HA-tagged deletion constructs were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3. His-tagged-DEAF-1 fusion constructs were generated by replacing specific regions in a peptide J construct (Ala167-Val370) in pET-24d obtained from M. Bottomley and M. Sattler (27Lo Surdo P. Bottomley M.J. Sattler M. Scheffzek K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1283-1295Google Scholar). Mutation of the zinc binding motifs in peptide J and full-length DEAF-1 constructs were generated through PCR. The K304T/Δ447-475 and the H275S/Δ447-475 constructs were generated by ligating a HindIII/AatII fragment of K304T or H275S and an AatII/BamHI fragment of Δ447-475 into HindIII/BamHI cut pcDNA3. A full-length human small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO-1) clone was purchased as an IMAGE clone (number 6144435) and subcloned into pcDNA3. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the Southern Illinois University sequencing facility.Localization of Fusion Proteins by Intrinsic Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence—CV-1 cells were grown on slides and plasmid DNA constructs were transfected for 3 h using Superfect (Qiagen). Fourteen hours after transfection, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with mouse anti-HA (Covance), mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), rabbit anti-SUMO-1 (Santa Cruz), or rabbit anti-DEAF-1 antibodies (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Cells were washed and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or TRITC (Sigma). DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 to show nuclei. For the leptomycin B studies, cells were treated for 3 h with 15 ng/ml leptomycin B or vehicle. Epitope-tagged proteins were visualized in cells by immunofluorescence using a ×60 oil immersion objective with an Olympus BX50WI Fluoview microscope. GFP fusion proteins in cells were visualized using a ×60 underwater objective in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell counts were performed using at least two independent experiments counting at least 200 transfected cells. PC3 cells were also used to verify localization of various GFP constructs.Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with gentamycin on 100-mm plates. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid DNAs using the calcium phosphate method for 14 h (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Transfection media was then replaced with fresh media and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on the plates using lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA with 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche)) for 30 min. Cell lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C following the manufacturer's protocols. Immunocomplexes and 1/40th of the input lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz) and visualized with secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by ECL treatment (Pierce).Protein Purification—GST and GST fusion proteins were constructed in the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and were expressed in CAG748 Escherichia coli cells (New England Biolabs) by 90 min induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in 8 ml of lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)). After sonication 800 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 800 μl of 10% Tween 20 were added and the lysate was left on ice for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer and proteins were left bound to the beads for pull down experiments. Protein concentrations of the beads were determined by both SDS-PAGE comparisons to bovine serum albumin standards and by BCA assay (Bio-Rad). His-tagged fusion proteins were made from a modified pET-24d vector (Novagen Inc.) and were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus-RIL E. coli (Stratagene) by 2 h induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in 8 ml of lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm ZnCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)). After sonication, 800 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 800 μl of 10% Tween 20 were added and the lysate was left on ice for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the lysate was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose beads (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed once with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer plus 30 mm imidazole, and then twice with lysis buffer plus 1 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with three aliquots of 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against lysis buffer with 3 buffer exchanges. Proteins were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE and quantified by BCA assay.GST Pull Downs—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced by in vitro translation using a TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Two μg of GST fusion proteins coupled to GSH beads were incubated with 10 μl of 35S-labeled proteins for 16 h at 4 °C in interaction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin). Proteins coupled to the beads were washed 3 times with interaction buffer plus bovine serum albumin and 3 times with interaction buffer without bovine serum albumin. Proteins were eluted from the beads with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences 445S1).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—His-tagged fusion proteins were purified from E. coli as described above. 32P-Labeled DNA probes were synthesized using Klenow fill-in reactions as previously described (24Bottomley M.J. Collard M.W. Huggenvik J.I. Liu Z. Gibson T.J. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 626-633Google Scholar) and incubated with 1 μm of the indicated proteins for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 μg of dAdT. After electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels, migration of the DNA probes were visualized by PhosphorImager.RESULTSDefining the Nuclear Localization Signal of DEAF-1—A potential bipartite NLS in human DEAF-1 was initially attributed to two clusters of basic amino acids between amino acids 299 and 316 (Fig. 1A) and had originally been proposed based upon similarity to the NLS motifs in nucleoplasmin and glucocorticoid receptor (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Mutation of lysine 304 to threonine in the DEAF-1 protein (K304T) changes localization from strong nuclear expression to strong cytoplasmic expression, whereas mutation of the two lysines at positions 315 and 316 to alanines (K315A/K316A) does not affect nuclear localization and is similar to wild type DEAF-1 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the basic amino acids between 301 and 305 comprise a monopartite NLS rather than the bipartite NLS previously proposed (2Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Google Scholar). Analysis of the DEAF-1 protein sequence indicates that there is a potential SUMO-1 binding site, KKE-(304-306), which overlaps with the NLS in an arrangement similar to that found in cAMP-response element-binding protein. The KKE site in the cAMP-response element-binding protein was recently shown to be sumoylated and mutation of the first lysine resulted in loss of cAMP-response element-binding protein nuclear localization (30Comerford K.M. Leonard M.O. Karhausen J. Carey R. Colgan S.P. Taylor C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 986-991Google Scholar). To examine if potential sumoylation at a similar site in DEAF-1 affects localization, lysine 304 was mutated to an arginine (K304R) to maintain the basic charge of an NLS but disrupt the potential sumoylation site. The K304R mutant protein was localized to the nucleus like wild type DEAF-1, indicating that this site is unlikely to be sumoylated, or that sumoylation has no effect on DEAF-1 nuclear import or export in transfected cells (Fig. 1B). No change in DEAF-1 localization was observed by co-expression with SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B). Transfection of wild type or dominant-negative forms of Ubc9 and HA-tagged SUMO-1 also did not alter DEAF-1 localization or produce anti-HA immunoreactivity in DEAF-1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown), again suggesting a lack of DEAF-1 sumoylation.Identification of a Nuclear Export Signal in DEAF-1—To identify a region of DEAF-1 that may contain a nuclear export signal, specific regions of DEAF-1 were amplified by PCR and inserted into a 2xGFP construct to produce fusion proteins with GFP. Regions of 70 to 72 amino acids that were rich in hydrophobic residues were examined as potential NES sites, including amino acids 161-233, 284-357, and 411-484. As an NES-negative control, a 2xGFP construct was transfected into cells, and for a positive control, the 2xGFP with an insert encoding 20 amino acids that encompass the characterized NES of p73 (p73NES) (29Inoue T. Stuart J. Leno R. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15053-15060Google Scholar) was also examined. The 2xGFP was distributed throughout the cell, whereas the p73NES showed strong cytoplasmic distribution, indicating that GFP localization was dependent on the inserted sequence (Fig. 2). An NH2-terminal DEAF-1 region (161-233) showed diffuse distribution throughout the cell (similar to 2xGFP) and indicated a lack of NES or NLS function in this region. Amino acids 284-357 of DEAF-1, which includes the DEAF-1 NLS, localized the GFP fusion protein to the nucleus. The same region with the K304T mutation showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization demonstrating that although this mutation disrupts the NLS, it is not sufficient to produce the complete cytoplasmic distribution observed with proteins containing more COOH-terminal regions. A region COOH-terminal of the NLS (411-484) showed cytoplasmic localization indicating a possible NES sequence (Fig. 2). Based on the documented NES motif defined by the consensus sequence, LX(1-3)LX(2-3)LXL/I/V (31Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Google Scholar, 32Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Google Scholar, 33Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Google Scholar), a potential NES does exist in this region (420LTSLPALAV428). The 411-484 region was divided into three smaller overlapping regions to further distinguish the NES sequence. Both the 411-448 region, which includes the NES consensus mentioned above, and the 429-467 region localized GFP throughout the cell indicating a lack of NES activity (summary in Fig. 2). The 449-484 region fused to GFP showed strong cytoplasmic expression, indicating NES activity. This region contains a number of leucine residues but it does not contain a well defined NES sequence. To determine the minimal sequence of the putative NES, 4-7 amino acids from either the COOH- or NH2-terminal ends were deleted from the 449-484 sequence in the 2xGFP construct. Upon deletion of four amino acids from the NH2-terminal end, 453-484 showed NES activity, however, when an additional 6 amino acids were removed, 459-484, NES activity was lost. COOH-terminal deletions showed that region 449-476 retained NES activity, but further deletion to 449-471 lacked NES activity. Based on this mapping, a minimal NES is contained within the sequence 453WLYLEEMVNSLLNTAQQLKTLFEQ476 and was confirmed in both CV-1 and PC3 cells (Fig. 2). This amino acid sequence is highly conserved among human, monkey, rat, and mouse DEAF-1 orthologs.Fig. 2Mapping the DEAF-1 nuclear export signal. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with full-length DEAF-1-GFP or with 2xGFP expression vectors with inserts encoding selected amino acid regions indicated by numbers on the left. The 2xGFP expression vector without an insert or with a 20-amino acid region encoding the p73NES were used as controls. Intrinsic fluorescence of the GFP proteins was observed by fluorescent microscopy and intracellular localization of the proteins recorded as N (nuclear), N/C (nuclear and cytoplasmic), and C (cytoplasmic). Cytoplasmic localization of 2xGFP-(453-476) was observed in transfected CV-1 cells and confirmed in PC3 cells to identify a nuclear export signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterizing the Nuclear Export Signal of DEAF-1—Because the 453-476 region behaves as an NES and is leucine-rich yet does not conform to a consensus NES motif, we sought to determine which leucines were critical for nuclear export. Six mutations were designed in the 453-476 region and inserted into the 2xGFP construct (Fig. 3A); namely, three pairs of leucines and three neighboring but non-leucine amino acids were changed to alanines. Ninety-two percent of cells transfected with WT 453-476 showed strong cytoplasmic expression of GFP (export positive). Mutation of leucines to alanines at positions 454 and 456 (NESm1) decreased the percentage of export positive cells to 76%. Mutation of leucines 463 and 464 to alanines (NESm3) and leucines 470 and 473 to alanines (NESm5) strongly diminished export positive cells to 3 and 8%, respectively. The mutation of non-leucine amino acids in this region (NESm2, NESm4, and NESm6) appeared to have no effect on nuclear export. We conclude that the NES of DEAF-1 is located between amino acids 453 and 473 with the critical leucines in positions LXLX6LLX5LX2L.Fig. 3Characterization of the DEAF-1 nuclear export signal.A, CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with a 2xGFP-(453-476) expression vector (WT 453) or 2xGFP-(453-476) with specific amino acids mutated to alanines as shown for each NES mutant (NESm1-6). Intrinsic fluorescence of the GFP proteins in the cells was observed by fluorescent microscopy. Cells showing strong cytoplasmic and weak nuclear fluorescence were scored as export positive cells and expressed as a percent of at least 200 transfected cells. Results are the average of two independent experiments. B, CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with 2xGFP-(p73NES) or 2xGFP-(453-476) expression vectors and treated for 3 h with 15 ng/ml leptomycin B (+LMB) or vehicle. The percentage of export positive cells was determined as in A. C, CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors to produce full-length DEAF-1 with NES and/or NLS mutations as HA-tagged fusion proteins. TRITC fluorescence was detected as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and scored as N (nuclear), N/C (nuclear and cytoplasmic), and C (cytoplasmic). The results are expressed as a percent of at least 200 transfected cells and are the average of two independent experiments. Leucine residues within 453-476 are critical to the nuclear export signal and nuclear export is LMB sensitive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether export of the DEAF-1 NES was dependent on the export factor chromosome region mainte"

It thereby enhances the capacity of FcγRI to bind, internalize, and present antigens on MHC class II. Here, we characterized the domains involved in FcγRI-periplakin interaction using truncated and alanine-substituted FcγRI mutants and randomly mutagenized periplakin.

FcR cross-linking can trigger a variety of cellular responses including phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine production.

Glycine replacement of aspartic acid 1694 (D1694G) of periplakin clone 2.2 was achieved by substitution of periplakin bp Ala-5081 for Gly by PCR using an adjacent unique SpeI site of periplakin and a mutated primer. Mammalian expression constructs WT-FcγRI and truncated mutants were cloned with HindIII/XbaI restriction into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described in Van Vugt et al. (25Van Vugt M.J. Kleijmeer M.J. Keler T. Zeelenberg I. Van Dijk M.A. Leusen J.H.W. Geuze H.J. Van de Winkel J.G.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Periplakin clones 2.2, 3.4, and the mutated 2.2 (D1694G) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 HISABC (Invitrogen). The murine FcR γ-chain with mutated ITAM (Y65F,Y76F) was expressed from pNUT (40Palmiter R.D. Behringer R.R. Quaife C.J. Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Brinster R.L.

PCR reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) except for primers (Isogen Bioscience, Maarssen, the Netherlands). All construct were verified by dideoxy sequencing using BigDye Terminators (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and analyzed on an ABI Prism® 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Yeast Two-hybrid Protein Interaction Assays—A GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to assess interactions between truncated FcγRI molecules and periplakin. Bait and prey plasmids were transformed by 1 m sorbitol, 10 mm Bicine, 3% ethylene glycol (42Klebe R.J. Harriss J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) into yeast strain YGHI. Protein-protein interactions were reported by yeast growth on medium without leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and expression of β-galactosidase, indicated by blue staining of yeast colonies after replica filter lifting, N2 snap-freezing, and incubation for 2–4 h in Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 60 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4; Sigma) containing 1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Roche Applied Science). Confocal Microscopy—For co-localization studies, clone 3.4, clone 2.2, and clone 2.2-D1694G were transiently transfected in IIA1.6 cells stably expressing WT-FcγRI, FcγRI-Δ342, FcγRI-Δ332, or the tailless FcγRI-Δ315 (numbers refer to the last C-terminal residue present in FcγRI-CY) and the mutated murine FcR γ-chain cultured as described in Van Vugt et al. (25Van Vugt M.J. Kleijmeer M.J. Keler T. Zeelenberg I. Van Dijk M.A. Leusen J.H.W. Geuze H.J. Van de Winkel J.G.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dead cells were removed ∼24 h post-transfection by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. After an additional 24 h, viable cells were adhered to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass slides. Cells were fixed for 30–60 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, quenched for 5 min in 20 mm NH4Cl, and blocked for 30 min in PBS with 0.1% saponin, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 5% mouse serum, 5% goat serum (blocking buffer). FcγRI was stained directly by CD64 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 10.1-FITC (Serotec, Oxford, UK) in blocking buffer. Periplakin was stained by incubation with polyclonal rabbit serum 5117 (a kind gift of Dr. B. Burgering, Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry and Center for Biomedical Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht (37Van den Heuvel A.P. de Vries-Smits A.M. Van Weeren P.C.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequent incubation with goat-α-rabbit CY3 (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Double staining of mIgG1-FITC (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and pre-immune serum 5117 in combination with goat-α-rabbit-CY3 served as negative controls as well as staining on mock-transfected cells. The slides were rinsed extensively, mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane; Sigma), and examined with a 63× planapo objective on a Leitz DMIRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Voorburg, The Netherlands) interfaced with a Leica TCS4D confocal laser microscope (Leica). Random Mutagenesis of C-terminal Periplakin—pGAD-GH clone 2.2 served as a PCR template in the presence of dITP and limiting amounts of dATP or dATP and dTTP to generate a pool of randomly mutated periplakin PCR products. This method was adapted from a protocol described by Spee et al. (43Spee J.H. de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Specific PCR characteristics were: 10 ng of pGAD-GH clone 2.2, 10 pmol per primer (pGAD-GH2, 5′-agatcctagaactag-3′, and pGAD-GH3, 5′-gaattgtaatacgac-3′), 2 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 1× Gold buffer, 8 mm MgCl2,30 μm dATP, 30 or 200 μm dTTP, 200 μm dCTP, dGTP, and dITP in a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR program consisted of an initial 5-min incubation at 95 °C and 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C. PCR products were purified, and 100 ng of PCR product with 500 ng of EcoRI/ApaI-restricted, gel-purified pGAD-GH and 2 μg of pGBT9-FcγRI-CY was transformed by 1 m sorbitol, 10 mm Bicine, 3% ethylene glycol in yeast cells. Yeast cells were plated on complete supplement mixture medium without leucine and tryptophan to select for functional plasmids. After 3 days, colonies were lifted and tested for loss of interaction by the absence of β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids were prepared from β-galactosidase-negative colonies and sequenced. Sequences were aligned using BioEdit software (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). EA-rosetting—Human erythrocytes were prepared by Ficoll/Hypaque density centrifugation, stored in sterile Alsever at 4 °C, and used within 2 weeks. Erythrocytes were fluorescently labeled using the PKH26 fluorescent cell linker kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol and opsonized by hybridoma supernatant containing mIgG2a anti-human glycophorin A for 1 h at 2 × 108 erythrocytes/ml at 4 °C (44Boot J.H. Geerts M.E. Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1217-1223PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were washed twice with Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Subsequently, 5 × 106 erythrocytes were resuspended with 1 × 105 cells in 50 μl of RPMI in round-bottom 96-well plates, incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, and resuspended after a 30-min incubation. EA-rosettes were fixed by the addition of 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were diluted 2–3-fold in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells and free erythrocytes were distinguished by their scatter patterns and autofluorescence in the FL1 channel. The percentage of cells that were FL-2-positive was expressed as percentage of EA-rosettes. FcγRI surface expression was measured on a FACScalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences) using the F(ab′)2 fragment of CD64 mAb H22 (Ref. 45Graziano R.F. Tempest P.R. White P. Keler T. Deo Y.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3478-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the binding domains of FcγRI for periplakin (TAT-FcγRI) or vice versa (TAT-PPL) were from Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium). The sequence of TAT-FcγRI is YGRKKRRQRRRGVTIRKELKRKKKWDLEI (29-mer), and that of TAT-PPL is YGRKKRRQRRRGKLRSQECDWEEISVK (27-mer). Peptides were >95% pure and had standard N and C termini. Control TAT-peptide (YGRKKRRQRRRG) consisted of the TAT sequence above and was a kind gift of Dr. P. Coffer (Dept. of Pulmonary Diseases, University Medical Center Utrecht). For transduction, cells were washed twice in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mm EDTA (EDTA buffer) to remove free extracellular calcium. Cells were incubated for 30 min in 10 μm TAT peptide at 37 °C in EDTA buffer at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were diluted in ice-cold EDTA buffer, washed at 4 °C in buffer without EDTA, and used in EA-rosette assays. Aliquots were analyzed by flow cytometry for FcγRI surface expression and cell viability by annexin V and propidium iodide staining (Roche Applied Science). Periplakin expression was assessed by Western blot using periplakin-recognizing rabbit serum 5117 after transient expression of full-length periplakin (construct kindly provided by Dr. F. Watt, Keratinocyte Laboratory, London Research Institute). For control experiments, TAT peptides were FITC-labeled (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), pulsed as described above, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Surface IgG was stained by an anti-mouse IgG mAb CY-3 conjugated (Jackson). Identification of the Periplakin Interaction Domain within FcγRI—To pinpoint the binding domain of FcγRI for periplakin, we tested progressive truncations of FcγRI-CY for interaction with C-terminal periplakin in yeast two-hybrid binding assays (Fig. 1). The minimal binding domain consisted of the membrane-proximal 17 amino acids of FcγRI-CY, as demonstrated by growth of yeast colonies on histidine-depleted media after transformation with FcγRI-Δ327 and periplakin (residues 1372–1756). However, in β-galactosidase assays a slightly larger domain of FcγRI (22 residues, FcγRI-Δ332) was required for periplakin interaction in yeast cells. Removal of the N-terminal valine (residue 311) or more (312 + 313) completely abrogated periplakin interaction. However, residues of the GAL4 DNA binding domain directly upstream of the N terminus of FcγRI-CY did not contribute to the interaction, as a stretch of six glycines in between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and FcγRI-CY left binding to periplakin intact (data not shown). We next mapped the binding domain of FcγRI for periplakin in IIA1.6 transfectants. Stable transfectants of WT-FcγRI, FcγRI-Δ342, FcγRI-Δ332, and FcγRI-Δ315 were co-transfected with C-terminal periplakin clone 3.4 and assessed after 48 h without further stimulation. WT-FcγRI and FcγRI-Δ342 co-localized with c-terminal periplakin, showing both proteins to be present at similar sites in cells. Although periplakin localized to the (sub)plasma membrane area, co-localization of FcγRI-Δ332 and tail-less FcγRI (FcγRI-Δ315) with C-terminal periplakin was abrogated, suggesting a loss of interaction. To assess the relative contribution of residues within FcγRI-CY for periplakin interaction, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was applied to FcγRI-CY residues 311–325, and proteins were assessed for interaction with periplakin in yeast cells. Notably, substitutions were found that either abrogated or improved the interaction between FcγRI and periplakin (Fig. 2A). Alanine replacement of plasma membrane-proximal residues abrogated the interaction, except for Thr-312, whereas single substitutions of the stretch of positively charged residues (KRKKK) and Asp-324 apparently led to a better interaction, except for the last lysine. The increase in β-galactosidase activity may reflect a better-stabilized interaction with periplakin. By alanine substitution of the proximal part of FcγRI-CY, we targeted a sequence that is largely conserved from mouse to man (Fig. 2B). However, we did not detect any interaction between murine FcγRI-CY and human periplakin. The absence of Glu-316 and Trp-323 in the mouse sequence might contribute to the differences between these species. Together, these results pointed to a periplakin binding domain of FcγRI-CY in juxtaposition to the plasma membrane. Periplakin binding to FcγRI-CY in yeast required a minimal motif of 17 residues within FcγRI-CY, but significant co-localization was only observed when 32 residues of FcγRI-CY were present. This discrepancy was observed consistently and indicated that both systems differ in FcγRI-periplakin binding requirements. For further studies with blocking peptides, we utilized the membrane-proximal 17 residues of FcγRI as a blocking domain for FcγRI-periplakin interaction. Identification of the Interaction Domain of Periplakin for FcγRI—Random mutagenesis of periplakin (schematically shown in Fig. 3A) was chosen as a tool to define the periplakin domain that interacts with FcγRI. We prepared a library of mutated clone 2.2 cDNAs by PCR amplification in the presence of dITP and screened for loss of interaction with FcγRI in yeast cells (Table I). A 2-fold increase of colonies that acquired a loss-of-interaction phenotype was achieved by the addition of dITP in the PCR. FcγRI-periplakin interaction was lost in 43% (68/158), and 57.3% (55/96) of yeast colonies by lowering dATP and dATP/dTTP concentrations, respectively. By (partially) sequencing plasmids from 41 colonies, a total of 65 missense mutations and 8 premature stop codons were identified. The most C-terminal-located stop codon was introduced after residue 1688, indicating that residues 1510–1688 of periplakin do not contain a full binding site for FcγRI. Only one of the missense mutants had a single amino acid substitution (aspartic acid at position 1694 into glycine (D1694G)) that resulted in a disturbed interaction (Fig. 3B). We confirmed this observation by site-directed mutagenesis of D1694G in the original periplakin 2.2 construct. Interactions were mitigated both in yeast cells (data not shown, n = 2) and transfected IIA1.6 cells (Fig. 3C). The D1694G-mutated clone 2.2 staining was more dominant in the cytoplasm and sometimes followed a filamentous pattern.Table IRandom PCR mutagenesis of periplakinScreen no.Control PCRMutagenesis PCRStop codonsI [dATP] ↓27.5% (53/193)43.0% (68/158)1644, 1649, 1663, 1666, 1676II [dATP] + [dTTP] ↓29.6% (28/95)57.3% (55/96)1653, 1681, 1688 Open table in a new tab Six substitutions were located within the 15 residues adjacent to Asp-1694 (1687-KLRSQECDWEEISVK-1701). At four positions residue charge was affected, and two times a proline was inserted (K1687E,K1687D, L1688P, D1694G, E1696G, S1699P, K1701E; Fig. 3B). When this domain was aligned to the proximal part of FcγRI-CY (in opposite direction), several parts exhibited clear opposing electrostatic charges that may well contribute to the interaction between both proteins (Fig. 3B). However, it is hard to assign specific periplakin residues besides Asp-1694 of being located at the binding interface, as the tertiary structure of these domains is unknown. These data supported periplakin 1687-KLRSQECDWEEISVK-1701 to be part of the FcγRI binding domain of periplakin, and we hypothesized that a peptide with this sequence may block such interaction. Flow Cytometric Analysis of EA-rosetting—Our previous work documented the ligand binding capacity of FcγRI to be increased by C-terminal periplakin transfection. Here, we developed a quick assay to measure FcγRI-ligand binding via the use of EA-rosetting by flow cytometry (i.e. the percentage of cells that bound mIgG2a-sensitized erythrocytes, upper right panel in Fig. 4B). Non-bound cells and FL2-labeled erythrocytes were found in the lower right and upper left quadrants, respectively. We observed 5% background binding to untransfected IIA1.6 cells or unsensitized erythrocytes (data not shown). A 2.5-fold increase in binding of mIgG2a-sensitized erythrocytes to FcγRI was observed upon co-expression of C-terminal periplakin in IIA1.6 cells (Fig. 4C). Binding appeared independent of small differences in surface levels of FcγRI (Fig. 4A) and FcR γ-chain signals. Similar differences were observed when EA-rosetting was scored by light microscopy (data not shown, n = 4). Modulation of EA-rosetting by TAT-Periplakin—Peptides containing a TAT motif and the postulated binding domains of FcγRI and periplakin were designed to block intracellular FcγRI-periplakin interaction. FcγRI surface expression and periplakin levels were unaffected by the addition of TAT peptides (Fig. 5, A and B; n = 3). Similarly, cell viability assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide-staining remained intact (data not shown, n = 3). To visualize cell transduction with the TAT peptides, FITC-conjugated TAT-FcγRI 311–327 (TAT-FcγRI), TAT-periplakin 1687–1701 (TAT-PPL), and non-TAT peptides were incubated with IIA1.6 cells (n = 3). Intracellular accumulation of FITC was observed only with the TAT peptides, consistent with their intracellular delivery (Fig. 5C). Subsequently, transfectants were pulsed with TAT peptides and incubated with mIgG2a-sensitized erythrocytes to assess the modulating capacity of these peptides on FcγRI-ligand interaction. TAT-PPL increased the interaction of IIA1.6 cells with mIgG2a-sensitized erythrocytes to levels observed in C-terminal periplakin transfection experiments (Fig. 5D, n = 3). TAT-FcγRI slightly increased the capacity of FcγRI to form EA-rosettes, but differences were not significant, possibly due to an inability of this peptide to transduce cells as efficiently as TAT-PPL or to adapt to an appropriate tertiary structure. Similarly, a peptide consisting of only the TAT sequence did not affect EA-rosetting ability. When C-terminal periplakin was co-expressed with FcγRI none of the peptides modulated EA-rosetting. These data support that the interaction between FcγRI and endogenous periplakin was effectively blocked by C-terminal periplakin. In this report we studied the molecular interaction between FcγRI and periplakin. Minimal binding domains were defined and generated as TAT peptides to disrupt intracellular FcγRI-periplakin interactions. TAT-PPL transduction enhanced the capacity of FcγRI to form EA-rosettes in transfected IIA1.6 cells without affecting receptor expression levels (Fig. 5). Because this effect mimicked stable transfection of C-terminal periplakin, it is likely that C-terminal periplakin and TAT-PPL regulate FcγRI by preventing FcγRI-CY binding to endogenous periplakin (Fig. 6). This suggests that endogenous periplakin somehow decreases FcγRI-ligand binding. We showed that the proximal part of FcγRI-CY binds periplakin. Receptor truncation experiments in yeast cells indicated FcγRI C-terminal residues 333–374 to be fully dispensable for the interaction of FcγRI-CY with periplakin. FcγRI-Δ327, albeit less efficient than WT-FcγRI, bound periplakin, as indicated by growth on histidine-depleted media showing the 17 membrane-proximal residues of FcγRI to be minimally required for interaction. In transfected cells, FcγRI-CY-dependent co-localization with periplakin was observed. Notably, however, a larger motif of FcγRI (FcγRI-Δ342) was required than in the yeast system. The discrepancy between yeast and mammalian cells for the minimal requirements of interaction between FcγRI and periplakin might be explained by differences in protein folding in the two systems or associated molecules like the FcR γ-chain or filamin A in IIA1.6 cells. This might account for the non-functional TAT-FcγRI peptide as well. The presence of the WT or ITAM-mutated FcR γ-chain did not influence co-localization under the conditions tested. FcγRI-CY harbors an antigen presentation motif present in FcγRI-Δ342 and not in FcγRI-Δ332 (25Van Vugt M.J. Kleijmeer M.J. Keler T. Zeelenberg I. Van Dijk M.A. Leusen J.H.W. Geuze H.J. Van de Winkel J.G.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In IIA1.6 cells, we observed co-localization of FcγRI-Δ342, but not FcγRI-Δ332, with periplakin, consistent with a possible regulatory role for periplakin in MHC class II antigen presentation. We recently found that IFN-γ, a cytokine regulating proteins important for MHC class I and II antigen presentation (for review, see Ref. 47Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar), up-regulated both periplakin and FcγRI expression in monocytes and PMN. Recently, also PMN were shown to functionally express MHC class II (48Radsak M. Iking-Konert C. Stegmaier S. Andrassy K. Hansch G.M. Immunology. 2000; 101: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). If periplakin is involved in antigen presentation, its role may be to “fine-tune” responses, as tailless FcγRI was shown capable of mediating antigen presentation, although less efficiently when a functional FcR γ-chain was present (25Van Vugt M.J. Kleijmeer M.J. Keler T. Zeelenberg I. Van Dijk M.A. Leusen J.H.W. Geuze H.J. Van de Winkel J.G.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 808-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of individual FcγRI-CY residues 311–325 that affected binding to periplakin were found largely conserved from mouse to man (Fig. 2). Residues located directly adjacent to the plasma membrane and more downstream (Lys-322, Trp-323, and Leu-325) abrogated FcγRI binding to periplakin. Remarkably, most single substitutions of the large positive KRKKK stretch and Asp-324 seemed to facilitate binding between FcγRI and periplakin. Overall sequence similarity of FcγRI with mouse FcγRI or other activable human FcR receptors is low (maximally 20%), and no obvious overlapping domains are present. These could not interact with periplakin in yeast two-hybrid studies,2 although the membrane =proximal region of mouse FcγRI shares significant similarity with human FcγRI. In mice, seven allelic variants of FcγRI have been described, from which three have altered amino acids in the proximal part of the intracellular domain (49Gavin A.L. Leiter E.H. Hogarth P.M. Immunogenetics. 2000; 51: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although no functional polymorphisms have been assigned to the cytosolic tail of human FcγRI, amino acid substitutions that influence periplakin interaction might have an effect on FcγRI function in vivo. Notably, the human FcγRI b and c isoforms have identical cytosolic tails to FcγRIa1 but contain asparagine at position 324 instead of aspartic acid (11Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.M. Miller K.L. Anderson C.L. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This cytosolic tail variant exhibited increased interaction with periplakin in yeast two-hybrid binding studies (data not shown). However, the functional relevance of these isoforms is not known at present. The random mutagenesis PCR suggested periplakin residues 1687–1701 to be part of the FcγRI binding domain within periplakin (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the effect of TAT-PPL on FcγRI function implies this region to be essential (Fig. 5). Within this sequence aspartic acid at position 1694 diminished binding to FcγRI-CY. The negatively charged residues in this region of periplakin align with the cationic residues in FcγRI-CY, and mutations found in periplakin align with critical residues of FcγRI in yeast (Fig. 3). This part of periplakin also binds vimentin and is a conserved structure among plakin family members (36Karashima T. Watt F.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 5027-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, periplakin residues 1687 and 1689 are exclusively found in periplakin and might facilitate selective binding of FcγRI to periplakin in immune cells. In addition, protein kinase B and the μ-opioid receptor can bind to the C terminus of periplakin (37Van den Heuvel A.P. de Vries-Smits A.M. Van Weeren P.C. Dijkers P.F. de Bruyn K.M. Riedl J.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33400-33407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No clear sequence similarity exists between FcγRI and other periplakin-binding proteins. Thus far, it is not known whether other proteins beside FcγRI can compete for binding to periplakin in immune cells or bind simultaneously to form complexes. Thus far we have not succeeded in demonstrating modulation of FcγRI binding to monomeric IgG by periplakin. Although we observed a small increase in a stable transfectant containing C-terminal periplakin, TAT-PPL did not consistently modulate monomeric IgG binding to FcγRI (data not shown, n = 3). COS cells express considerable levels of endogenous periplakin, and FcγRI monomeric IgG binding assays in these cells showed that FcγRI-CY lowered ligand affinity by ∼2-fold (50Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that FcγRI-CY-periplakin binding decreases FcγRI interaction with monomeric IgG. This report describes FcγRI function to be enhanced by reagents that target the receptor intracellular tail. This might lead to the development of selective reagents that regulate FcγRI function for immunotherapy. FcγRI-directed immunotherapy may be enhanced by TAT-PPL, resulting in increased treatment efficacies when applied in combination."
https://openalex.org/W1996660028,"Glycoprotein hormone heterodimers are stabilized by their unusual structures in which a glycosylated loop of the α-subunit straddles a hole in the β-subunit. This hole is formed when a cysteine at the end of a β-subunit strand known as the “seatbelt” becomes “latched” by a disulfide to a cysteine in the β-subunit core. The heterodimer is stabilized in part by the difficulty of threading the glycosylated end of the α-subunit loop 2 through this hole, a phenomenon required for subunit dissociation. Subunit combination in vitro, which occurs by the reverse process, can be accelerated by removing the α-subunit oligosaccharide. In cells, heterodimer assembly was thought to occur primarily by a mechanism in which the seatbelt is wrapped around the α-subunit after the subunits dock. Here we show that this “wraparound” process can be used to assemble disulfide cross-linked human choriogonadotropin analogs that contain an additional α-subunit cysteine, but only if the normal β-subunit latch site has been removed. Normally, the seatbelt is latched before the subunits dock and assembly is completed when the glycosylated end of α-subunit loop 2 is threaded beneath the seatbelt. The unexpected finding that most assembly of human choriogonadotropin, human follitropin, and human thyrotropin heterodimers occurs in this fashion, indicates that threading may be an important phenomenon during protein folding and macromolecule assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. We suggest that the unusual structures of the glycoprotein hormones makes them useful for identifying factors that influence this process in living cells. Glycoprotein hormone heterodimers are stabilized by their unusual structures in which a glycosylated loop of the α-subunit straddles a hole in the β-subunit. This hole is formed when a cysteine at the end of a β-subunit strand known as the “seatbelt” becomes “latched” by a disulfide to a cysteine in the β-subunit core. The heterodimer is stabilized in part by the difficulty of threading the glycosylated end of the α-subunit loop 2 through this hole, a phenomenon required for subunit dissociation. Subunit combination in vitro, which occurs by the reverse process, can be accelerated by removing the α-subunit oligosaccharide. In cells, heterodimer assembly was thought to occur primarily by a mechanism in which the seatbelt is wrapped around the α-subunit after the subunits dock. Here we show that this “wraparound” process can be used to assemble disulfide cross-linked human choriogonadotropin analogs that contain an additional α-subunit cysteine, but only if the normal β-subunit latch site has been removed. Normally, the seatbelt is latched before the subunits dock and assembly is completed when the glycosylated end of α-subunit loop 2 is threaded beneath the seatbelt. The unexpected finding that most assembly of human choriogonadotropin, human follitropin, and human thyrotropin heterodimers occurs in this fashion, indicates that threading may be an important phenomenon during protein folding and macromolecule assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. We suggest that the unusual structures of the glycoprotein hormones makes them useful for identifying factors that influence this process in living cells. The glycoprotein hormones are essential for vertebrate reproduction and thyroid function. Each of the four human hormones is composed of non-covalently bound α- and β-subunits that are divided into three large loops (α1, α2, α3; β1, β2, β3) 1The abbreviations used are: α1, α-subunit loop 1; α2, α-subunit loop 2; α3, α-subunit loop 3; β1, β-subunit loop 1; β2, β-subunit loop 2; β3, β-subunit loop 3; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; hCG, human choriogonadotropin; hFSH, human follitropin; hTSH, human thyrotropin; hCGβ, hCG β-subunit; abbreviations of the analogs used in these studies are described in Fig. 2. by a cystine knot (1Lapthorn A.J.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The β-subunit also contains 20 additional residues that form a strand commonly known as the “seatbelt” because of its topology and its role in stabilizing the heterodimer (1Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The seatbelt begins at the β-subunit cystine knot and its carboxyl-terminal cysteine is “latched” by a disulfide to a cysteine in loop β1. This creates a hole in the β-subunit that is bordered on one side by the core of the β-subunit and on the other side by the seatbelt. The α-subunit straddles this hole such that the glycosylated end of loop α2 must pass beneath the seatbelt through the β-subunit hole for the heterodimer to dissociate. This contributes to the stability of the heterodimer, which dissociates at low pH or in high concentrations of urea (4Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar), but not in the presence of ionic detergents such as 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. If the seatbelt were to be latched before the subunits combine, the glycosylated end of loop α2 would also need to pass through the β-subunit during heterodimer assembly. This would impede assembly, a notion supported by the finding that removal of this oligosaccharide accelerates assembly in vitro substantially (5Xing Y. Moyle W.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a process that occurs by a threading mechanism (6Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analyses of hCG assembly in cells led to the suggestion that the seatbelt remains unlatched until after the subunits dock with one another (7Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this pathway, which we term “wraparound” (Fig. 1, upper pathway), formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide is the final step in heterodimer assembly and occurs after the seatbelt has been wrapped around loop α2. This pathway circumvents the need for the glycosylated end of loop α2 to pass through the hole in the β-subunit and explains the abilities of cells to make cross-linked hormone analogs in which the seatbelt is latched to cysteines added to the α-subunit (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assembly of glycoprotein hormone heterodimers can occur by a threading pathway in vitro at high subunit concentrations (6Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Before heterodimer assembly begins in the threading pathway, the seatbelt is latched to a cysteine in loop β1 (Fig. 1, lower pathway). Studies described here were initiated to learn if threading has a role in the intracellular assembly of the glycoprotein hormones using a strategy that circumvents the need for pulse-chase analysis, the most common approach to studying protein folding in cells. Pulse-chase methods require labeling, isolating, and characterizing partially folded intermediates. Important intermediates such as heterodimers that have not yet latched their seatbelts or in which loop α2 has not been threaded beneath the seatbelt are unstable and difficult, if not impossible to isolate. As shown here based on the abilities of β-subunit analogs to compete for formation of cross-linked and non-cross-linked heterodimers, cells can assemble hCG, hFSH, and hTSH by a threading mechanism. Indeed, it appears as if these human glycoproteins are assembled in the ER primarily by a threading route and that the wraparound pathway is used sparingly, if at all. Pure recombinant hCG was obtained from Dr. Robert Campbell (Serono Reproductive Biology Institute, Rockland, MA). Constructs used to express hCG in cultured cells were produced by polymerase chain reaction and cassette mutagenesis (9Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and were sequenced prior to use. Analogs used in this study are listed in Fig. 2 and are readily identified by their names. Thus, α-L41C is the natural human α-subunit having a codon for cysteine in place of that for αLeu41. Proteins were produced by transfecting the constructs into COS-7 cells obtained from the ATCC (Bethesda, MD) using a calcium phosphate procedure (10Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1992; 6: 632-638Google Scholar). The amounts of α- and β-subunit constructs used were 20 and 10 μg/10-cm culture plates, respectively. Secreted analogs were harvested 3 days after transfection and analyzed in monoclonal antibody sandwich immunoassays (11Moyle W.R. Ehrlich P.H. Canfield R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2245-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) employing antibodies A113, B111, B112, B404, B603, and B806, obtained from Dr. William Munroe (Hybritech Inc., San Diego, CA, a subsidiary of Beckman Coulter, Inc.), B101 was obtained from Dr. Robert Canfield (Columbia University, New York), B122 was obtained from Dr. Robert Campbell, and B110 was produced as described (12Moyle W.R.

The relative binding sites of these conformation-dependent antibodies have been determined and are indicated in Fig. 3. This figure also illustrates the locations of several residues discussed in this study. A113 recognizes a conformation-dependent α-subunit epitope in the heterodimer. B101 recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope in loop β2 of hCG and the uncombined β-subunit. B110 and B112 recognize conformation-dependent epitopes formed when loops β1 and β3 are adjacent in hCG and the uncombined β-subunit. B112 binds hCG and analogs in which βAsn77 is replaced by cysteine but not by aspartic acid or analogs in which a cysteine substitution participates in a disulfide bond. B111 recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope formed when βCys110 at the end of the hCG seatbelt is latched to βCys26 in the heterodimer and the uncombined β-subunit. B111 can also recognize analogs of hCG in which βCys26 and βCys110 are converted to alanine provided the heterodimer is stabilized in another fashion, such as fusing the NH2-terminal end of the α-subunit to the COOH-terminal end of the β-subunit (8Xing Y.

This indicates that B111 does not recognize the βCys26-βCys110 disulfide per se. B111 does not recognize hCG analogs in which the seatbelt is latched to any other residue other than βCys110, however, or when residues near βCys110 are derived from hLH, hFSH, or hTSH. B603 and B806 recognize loops β1 and β3inthe β-subunits of hFSH and hTSH, respectively, but the binding sites of these antibodies have not been well characterized. None of the antibodies used in these studies recognize the β-subunit prior to formation of the cystine knot, a key step in formation of the β-subunit core.Fig. 3Relaxed stereo view depicting the Cα carbon atoms of hCG, the locations of mutations used in this study, and the relative antibody binding sites.

The seatbelt latch disulfide is normally formed between β-subunit residues 26 and 110. Note, the proximity of α-subunit residues 37, 41, and 43 to β-subunit residue 26, the normal seatbelt latch site. The small seatbelt loop is stabilized by a disulfide between β-subunit residues 93 and 100. B111, an antibody that was essential to distinguish the location of the seatbelt latch disulfide, recognizes a region of hCG near β-subunit cysteines 26 and 110, although it does not recognize the seatbelt latch disulfide per se. Although B111 can bind to single chain analogs of hCG in which β-subunit cysteines 26 and 110 are converted to alanine, it does not recognize any analog in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit (8Xing Y.

B111 can also recognize heterodimers in which β-subunit cysteines 26 and 110 are converted to alanine if the heterodimer is stabilized by the presence of an NH2-terminal Fos/Jun dimerization domain or if the heterodimer is stabilized by an N-terminal disulfide cross-link (27Xing Y.

The acid stability of the heterodimers was tested in 0.4-ml samples by reducing the pH to 2 by addition of microliter aliquots of 2 m HCl, while monitoring the pH, and incubating acidified samples 30 min at 37 °C, readjusting the pH to 7.5 by addition of sufficient microliter aliquots of a mixture of 10 n NaOH, 1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5) (1:2), and then quantifying them by sandwich immunoassay (11Moyle W.R. Ehrlich P.H. Canfield R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2245-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Material that contained the ER retention signal was isolated from the cells 1 or 2 days after transfection by scraping them from the culture dishes and solubilizing them in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 140 mm KCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1 μm leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 500 μm pefablock, and 1% octyl glucoside (Sigma). Following sedimentation at 14,000 × g (10 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were diluted 6.7-fold with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (40 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) and assayed by sandwich immunoassay (11Moyle W.R. Ehrlich P.H. Canfield R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2245-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using the indicated antibodies and pure recombinant hCG as a standard. The hCG β-subunit used as a standard was purified from this hCG by high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 resin using an acetonitrile gradient in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described (6Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Standards were dissolved in octyl glucoside extracts of untransfected COS-7 cells for measurements of intracellular β-subunits and heterodimers. This minimized the possible influence of detergent and cell extract on the assay. Procedures to monitor assembly in vitro have been described (6Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All sandwich assay estimates were determined statistically using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Most analogs were studied three or more times. Differences in expression relative to that of hCG, which was always included as a standard, are typical despite the fact that some transfections were more efficient and led to the formation of larger amounts of heterodimers than others. Rationale for Our Approach to Distinguish Heterodimer Assembly Pathways—The relative timing of subunit docking and seatbelt latch formation are reversed in the threading and wraparound pathways. Therefore, in principle, the threading and wraparound pathways could be distinguished by pulse-chase analysis (7Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 15Lorenz I.C. Allison S.L. Heinz F.X. Helenius A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5480-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the most common method for studying protein folding in mammalian cells. This approach would not be useful for detecting trace quantities of transient unstable folding intermediates such as heterodimers that have not latched their seatbelts (16Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or those in which loop α2 is only partially threaded through the β-subunit hole, however. Furthermore, pulse-chase methods can give undue weight to deadend folding products that appear transient because they are degraded, not because they are folding intermediates. These considerations led us to monitor assembly using methods that depend on the abilities of folding intermediates to compete for the formation of cross-linked heterodimers. We distinguished the threading and wraparound pathways by measuring the amounts of cross-linked heterodimer formed when α-subunit analogs containing an additional cysteine were cotransfected with the native β-subunit (Fig. 4, middle and bottom lines). We have found that the hCG seatbelt can be latched to a cysteine added to the α-subunit during the wraparound pathway of heterodimer assembly (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assembly by this route is efficient and many of the cross-linked heterodimers produced are as active as hCG in receptor binding and signal transduction assays (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During assembly that occurs by a threading pathway (Fig. 4, lower row), the seatbelt is latched to the cysteine in loop β1 before assembly begins. As a result, the seatbelt would remain latched to loop β1, which would lead to the formation of a heterodimer that would be unstable at pH 2, 37 °C. During assembly that occurs by a wraparound mechanism, the seatbelt would have the opportunity to be latched to the cysteine in loop β1 or that had been added to the α-subunit. Consequently, the heterodimer would contain an intersubunit cross-link. An alternative method of distinguishing the threading and wraparound mechanisms depends on the competition between two β-subunits (Fig. 4, top and bottom lines). We employed this method to eliminate the possibility that the seatbelt latch site might be rearranged during assembly in the cell. For example, it might be possible for the seatbelt of the native hCG β-subunit to be latched to a cysteine in the α-subunit during assembly that occurs by a wraparound mechanism. Subsequently, the seatbelt latch site might “migrate” to its native latch site by a disulfide exchange with βCys26 (Fig. 4, dashed arrow), making it appear that the heterodimer had been formed by a threading pathway. To avoid this possibility, we took advantage of the observation that the seatbelts in hCG β-subunit analogs such as hCGβ-C26A, which cannot latch their seatbelts to loop β1 because they contain an alanine in place of βCys26, can become latched to cysteines added to the α-subunit in place of residues 35, 37, 41–50, 64, 86, 88, and 90–92, among others (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the seatbelts of these analogs cannot be latched until after the subunits contact one another, heterodimers containing these β-subunits can only be assembled by the wraparound pathway. Furthermore, once latched, the seatbelt in these heterodimers cannot migrate to the β-subunit unless the heterodimer dissociates. The observation that these heterodimers are secreted efficiently indicates that they do not dissociate. Before its seatbelt is latched, hCGβ would be expected to have the same overall conformation as hCGβ-C26A (Fig. 4). Thus, hCGβ-C26A and the unlatched form of hCGβ (i.e. hCGβ*) would be expected to compete with one another for docking with the α-subunit in the wraparound pathway. If most heterodimers became assembled by the wraparound pathway, one would expect to find a significant fraction of the total heterodimer that contained hCGβ-C26A. In contrast, because hCGβ-C26A can be incorporated into heterodimers only by the wraparound pathway, it would not be expected to compete with hCGβ for heterodimers that are assembled after the seatbelt is latched, i.e. by threading (Fig. 4). Therefore, if most assembly occurs by threading, very little of the heterodimer formed would contain hCGβ-C26A. The position of the seatbelt latch site in hCG can be determined by the acid stability of the heterodimer and by its ability to be recognized by monoclonal antibody B111. Heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit contain an intersubunit disulfide cross-link. These are distinguished readily from heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys26 by their resistance to dissociation at pH 2, 37 °C, and by their inabilities to bind monoclonal antibody B111 (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). B111 binds a conformational hCG epitope formed when the seatbelt is latched normally, i.e. to βCys26. It does not bind heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to other cysteines such as those that have been added to either subunit (8Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P.

Human Choriogonadotropin Can Be Assembled in the ER by Two Different Routes, but Most Is Made by the Threading Pathway—The seatbelts of heterodimers produced by co-expressing hCGβ and each of the α-subunit analogs tested became latched primarily to βCys26, not to the cysteine added to the α-subunit. This was the first indication that hCG is formed in the ER by a threading pathway. An example of this is seen by comparing the properties of heterodimers produced when hCGβ, was expressed with α-L41C (Table I, 1). Most heterodimers secreted by cells that were co-transfected with α-L41C and hCGβ lacked an intersubunit disulfide and were unstable following 30 min at pH 2, 37 °C (Table I, 1, row 1). As a result they were detected readily in heterodimer-specific sandwich immunoassays employing an antibody to the α-subunit for capture (i.e. A113) and a radioiodinated antibody to the β-subunit for detection (i.e.125I-B110) before, but not after low pH treatment. These heterodimers were also detected in similar immunoassays employing A113 for capture and 125I-B111 for detection before treatment at low pH. This indicated that their seatbelts were latched to βCys26, not αCys41. Both findings are consistent with the conclusion that the heterodimer was formed by a threading mechanism.Table IhCG β-subunit analogs forced to latch their seatbelts to the α-subunit compete poorly with those that can latch their seatbelts to βCys26β-Subunit analogHeterodimer total/50 μlLow pH stable heterodimerB111/B110 Ratio total dimerB111/B110 ratio stable dimerWraparound pathway, αCys to βCys110ng ± S.E.% Total ± S.E.% Stable ± S.E.1) Heterodimers containing α-L41C measured in mediahCGβ2.42 ± 0.23Undetectable65.5 ± 3.4Not doneUndetectablehCGβ-C26A2.73 ± 0.2396.5 ± 0.80 ± 0.3Not done≥96%Both2.13 ± 0.12Undetectable67.0 ± 4.3Not doneUndetectable2) Heterodimers containing α-L41C measured in cell lysateshCGβ-KDEL6.16 ± 0.409.69 ± 0.3954.66 ± 8.4055.78 ± 3.66UndetectablehCGβ-C26A-KDEL9.13 ± 0.63103.01 ± 1.830.64 ± 0.180.50 ± 0.10100%Both6.68 ± 0.5718.60 ± 0.4256.65 ± 8.9935.50 ± 1.636.8%3) Heterodimers containing α-L41C,N52D measured in cell lysateshCGβ-KDEL3.16 ± 0.196.08 ± 0.4580.64 ± 3.8079.64 ± 4.68UndetectablehCGβ-C26A-KDEL2.25 ± 0.10110.76 ± 2.691.68 ± 0.571.78 ± 0.31100%Both2.05 ± 0.0817.30 ± 1.7268.90 ± 10.4543.78 ± 4.257.8%4) Heterodimers containing α-S43C measured in cell lysateshCGβ-KDEL5.27 ± 0.3518.1 ± 1.064.10 ± 4.0359.6 ± 1.2≤1.5%hCGβ-C26A-KDEL10.92 ± 1.7399.8 ± 18.80.37 ± 0.070.4 ± 0.1100%Both6.35 ± 0.4123.9 ± 2.042.47 ± 5.9640.6 ± 0.67.6%5) Heterodimers containing α-T46C measured in cell lysateshCGβ-KDEL7.71 ± 0.4414.4 ± 1.163.33 ± 7.0449 ± 3≤3.7%hCGβ-C26A-KDEL14.1 ± 0.6592.8 ± 40.67 ± 0.030.8 ± 0≥93%Both7.1 ± 0.5537.5 ± 2.550.57 ± 3.6821.2 ± 2.221.3%6) Heterodimers containing α-S92C measured in cell lysateshCGβ-KDEL9.45 ± 0.896.03 ± 0.447.77 ± 7.1985.03 ± 4.98UndetectablehCGβ-C26A-KDEL11.66 ± 1.05128.47 ± 16.80.97 ± 0.120.37 ± 0.07100%Both7.4 ± 0.316.60 ± 0.749.00 ± 1.4265.00 ± 5.681.6% Open table in a new tab To exclude the possibility that the location of the seatbelt in the heterodimer had undergone a disulfide exchange and become latched to βCys26 in loop β1 after it had been latched to αCys41, we repeated the study in the presence of hCGβ-C26A, an analog that cannot latch its seatbelt to loop β1. When α-L41C was expressed with hCGβ-C26A, the heterodimer that formed was detected in A113/125I-B110 assays before and after acid treatment (Table I, 1, row 2). Furthermore, none of it was detected in A113/125I-B111 assays before or after low pH treatment. These findings showed that seatbelt residue βCys110 of this heterodimer was cross-linked to the α-subunit, a consequence of its formation by a wraparound mechanism. When both β-subunits were expressed simultaneously with α-L41C, heterodimers secreted into the medium contained hCGβ and little or no hCGβ-C26A (Table I, 1, row 3). Because the seatbelts in these heterodimers were latched to βCys26, not αCys41, they were detected readily in A113/125I-B110 and A113/125I-B111 assays before, but not after low pH treatment. The finding that hCGβ-C26A did not compete with hCGβ for formation of heterodimers containing α-L41C indicated that hCG assembly occurs primarily by threading. One could argue that heterodimers having their seatbelts latched to αCys41 were disrupted or degraded during secretion and that this prevented us from detecting them in preparations containing α-L41C and hCGβ. This appeared highly unlikely because heterodimers containing hCGβ-C26A were found in the medium when it was the only β-subunit used in the transfection. Nonetheless, we tested this possibility using analogs of hCGβ and hCGβ-C26A that contained four COOH-terminal residues (i.e. KDEL) known to delay the secretion of other proteins from the ER (18Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). To determine how this affected the secretion of hCG, we transfected COS-7 cells with the native α-subunit and hCGβ or hCGβ-KDEL and measured the appearance of heterodimer in media and cell lysates. The KDEL tag delayed heterodimer secretion from the cell and caused it to be accumulated in the cells (Fig. 5). Prolonged incubation resulted in release of the KDEL-tagged material from the cells, probably because the ER retention mechanism had been saturated. These studies suggested that assays of KDEL-tagged heterodimers in cell lysates would reflect material located primarily in the ER. The seatbelts of heterodimers measured in lysates of cells co-transfected with α-L41C and hCGβ-KDEL were latched to βCys26. As a result, most were unstable at low pH and readily detected by B111 (Table I, 2, row 1). A small fraction (9.7%) of the heterodimer was stable at low pH even though it was detected in A113/125I-B111 assays. Whereas its acid stability suggested that this fraction contained an intersubunit disulfide cross-link, its ability to be recognized by B111 showed that its acid stability was not due solely to the formation of a disulfide between seatbelt residue βCys110 and loop α2 residue αCys41. This indicated that αCys41 can participate in an intersubunit disulfide with β-subunit cysteines other than that at the end of the seatbelt (i.e. βCys110). The amounts of the acid stable α-L41C/hCGβ-C26A-KDEL heterodimer in cell lysates were too small for us to attempt identifying this intersubunit disulfide using traditional biochemical methods. Therefore, we modeled each of the 12 intersubunit dis"

A growth inhibition activity was also observed with (N)-MCT and ganciclovir in non-transduced cells in a cell line-dependent manner, whereas TK(-) cells were not affected. The presented 1.95-A crystal structure of the complex (S)-MCT.HSV1 TK explains both the more favorable binding affinity and catalytic turnover of (S)-MCT for HSV1 TK over the North analog. Additionally the plasticity of the active site of the enzyme is addressed by comparing the binding of (North)- and (South)-carbathymidine analogs. The presented study of these two potent candidate prodrugs for HSV1 TK gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy suggests that (S)-MCT may be even safer to use than its North counterpart (N)-MCT."

In PRIP-deficient mammary glands, the elongation of ducts during puberty was not affected, but the numbers of ductal branches were decreased, a condition that persisted long after puberty, indicating that the potential of ductal branching was impaired. During pregnancy, PRIP-deficient mammary glands exhibited decreased alveolar density. The lactating PRIP-deficient glands contained scant lobuloalveoli with many adipocytes, whereas the wild type glands were composed of virtually no adipocytes but mostly lobuloalveoli.

The ductal branching of mammary glands in response to estrogen treatment was attenuated in PRIP mutant glands. Whereas the proliferation index was similar between wild type and PRIP-deficient glands, increased apoptosis was observed in PRIP-deficient glands. PRIP-deficient glands expressed increased amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-α, and betacellulin mRNA as compared with wild type glands.

During puberty, accelerated ductal growth that finally fills the entire fat pad is stimulated by estrogen. Whereas the exact downstream signals responsible for estrogen-stimulated ductal growth remain elusive, analysis of gene knock-out mice suggests that estrogen receptors in both stromal and epithelial cells are required for optimal ductal growth under physiological conditions (3Mueller S.O.

It would be important to elucidate the physiological function of PRIP in mammary gland development and to establish the contribution of PRIP to estrogen and progesterone signaling pathways during mammary gland development.

Here we report the generation of a PRIP null mutation in mammary glands. PRIP-deficient mammary glands exhibit decreased numbers of ductal branches, impaired lobuloalveolar development, severely deficient lactation, and attenuated ductal branching of mammary glands in response to estrogen treatment with relatively intact expression of milk gene proteins. These results suggest that PRIP is an important coactivator for normal mammary gland development. Generation of PRIP Conditional Null Mutation in Mammary Glands—MMTV-Cre transgenic mice (30Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium Repository at the NCI, Frederick, MD. The heterozygous LoxP-PRIP mice (27Zhu Y.J. Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Dwivedi R.S. Rao M.S. Gonzalez F.J. Qi C. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1986-1990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were bred with MMTV-Cre transgenic mice to delete the DNA fragment between LoxP1 and LoxP3. The heterozygous mice with the expected deletion were interbred to generate homozygous mutants. Whole-mount Histology and Immunostaining—Whole-mount examination of the inguinal mammary glands was performed as reported previously (31Gallahan D. Jhappan C. Robinson G. Hennighausen L. Sharp R. Kordon E. Callahan R. Merlino G. Smith G.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1775-1785PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mammary glands were fixed in Carnoy's fixative and stained overnight in hematoxylin. Samples were then cleared in xylene and mounted. For routine histological assessment, formalin-fixed mammary glands were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues. Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After the inactivation of endogenous peroxidase activity and antigen retrieval, sections were blocked with 10% normal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by sequential incubation at room temperature with anti-PRIP antibodies for 3 h, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h, streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase for 30 min, and finally 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution for 4 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Staining and Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of BrdUrd (30 μg of BrdUrd/g of body weight) 2 h before sacrifice. Mammary glands were isolated, fixed, embedded, and sectioned. BrdUrd immunostaining was performed using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay using an in situ cell death detection kit from Roche Applied Science as instructed. A total of 6000 cells were counted from six different sections of a sample, and final counts were expressed as the percentage of epithelial cells positive for BrdUrd or TUNEL. Only intensely stained nuclei were scored as positive. RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Inguinal glands were collected from wild type and PRIP mutant mice. Mammary epithelial cells were separated from stromal cells by collagenase digestion and Percoll gradient centrifugation (32Yang J. Richards J. Guzman R. Imagawa W. Nandi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and used for isolation of total RNA by the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. RT-PCR was performed with the SuperScript one-step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen as instructed. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase followed by PCR amplification consisting of 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. For each 100 μl-reaction, 10 μCi of 35S-dATP was included, and 20 μl of the amplified product was taken out at cycles 25 and 30. 5 μl of the PCR product was separated on PAGE, which was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. The primers used are as follows: EGF, 5′-ACCAGCAATTGGTGGTGGAT-3′ and 5′-ATGTAAGCGTGGCTTCCTTC-3′; betacellulin, 5′-GTAGCAGATGGGAACACAAC-3′ and 5′-CTTGCCACCAGCTTGTGATA-3′; TGF-α, 5′-GTATCCTGTTAGCTGTGTGC-3′ and 5′-CAAATTCCTCCTCTGGGATC-3′; amphiregulin, 5′-AGCTGCTTTGGAGCTCAATG-3′ and 5′-ATTGCATGTCACCACCTCCA-3′; β-actin, 5′-CCATCTACGAGGGCTATGCT-3′ and 5′-GCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTCAAAGA-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—10 μg of total RNA was separated through the formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel and was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes including β-casein, WDNM1, and WAP. Conditional Null Mutation of PRIP in Mammary Glands—As PRIP null mutation results in an embryonic lethality that precludes studying the role of PRIP in mammary gland development, a conditional null mutation in mammary glands was generated by crossing mice with the LoxP integrated recombinant PRIP gene and MMTV-Cre transgenic mice. MMTV-Cre specifically expressed Cre recombinase in mammary epithelial cells, which deleted exon 7 of the PRIP gene flanked by two LoxP sites (Fig. 1A). The deletion of the PRIP exon 7 led to a reading frameshift and generated a stop codon right after the fusion between exon 6 and exon 8. The successful deletion of the PRIP gene in mammary epithelial cells was revealed by PCR using primers specifically for the deleted and undeleted gene (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR showed that PRIP mRNA from mammary epithelial cells with the deleted PRIP gene was absent (Fig. 1C). Immunostaining with anti-PRIP confirmed that mammary epithelial cells with the deleted PRIP gene did not express the PRIP protein (Fig. 1D). Defective Mammopoiesis during Puberty, Pregnancy, and Lactation—Mammary glands at different developmental stages were examined in age- and weight-matched wild type and PRIP mutant mice. The mammary ducts extend and branch into the fat pad under the stimulation of gonadal hormones during puberty. In comparison with wild type mammary glands, PRIP-deficient mammary glands from 5-week-old mice also exhibited ductal growth with a similar extent of ductal elongation. However, the number of ductal branches and the density of ducts were greatly reduced in PRIP-deficient mammary glands (Fig. 2). Histological analysis revealed no appreciable difference between wild type and PRIP-deficient glands except for the fact that PRIP-deficient glands contained fewer ducts (data not shown). By 10 weeks, ductal growth almost reached the edge of the fat pad in both wild type and PRIP mutant mice with greatly decreased branching observed in PRIP mutant mammary glands (Fig. 2). The mammary duct completely fills the mammary fat pad in mature virgin mice and ceases active growth afterwards. An examination of mammary glands by whole-mount revealed that the extent of ductal branching was still substantially reduced in 15-week-old PRIP mutant females (Fig. 2), indicating that the potential of branching was compromised in PRIP-deficient mammary glands. During pregnancy, mammary glands undergo further ductal branching, lobuloalveolar proliferation and differentiation. Whole-mount preparation of glands from mice on the 15th day of pregnancy revealed that PRIP deficiency caused impairment of lobuloalveolar development (Fig. 3). The density of alveoli in PRIP-null glands was markedly reduced as compared with that in wild type glands (Fig. 3). However, the morphology of the alveolus, as revealed by hematoxylin and eosin section, was indistinguishable between wild type and PRIP-null glands (data not shown). Mammary glands complete lobuloalveolar development and functional differentiation during lactation. The lobuloalveoli from PRIP-deficient glands were still much less abundant and smaller than those from wild type glands as revealed by whole-mount (Fig. 4). PRIP-deficient glands on the 8th day of lactation revealed numerous adipocytes; in contrast, virtually no adipocytes were present in wild type glands (Fig. 4). PRIP mutant mice delivered normal sized litters but only two or three pups could survive. Most pups died within 48 h after birth with no milk detected in their stomachs. However, pups could be fostered by wild type females, indicating that PRIP-deficient glands are unable to produce sufficient quantities of milk to nurse pups because of defective mammary gland development.Fig. 3Morphology of PRIP-deficient glands on the 15th day of pregnancy. The fourth inguinal mammary glands from wild type (A and C) and PRIP mutant mice (B and D) were isolated and whole-mounted.

The fourth pairs of mammary glands from wild type (A, C, E) or PRIP mutant (B, D, F) mice on the 8th day of lactation were isolated and then whole-mounted or fixed for hematoxylin and eosin section. Whole-mount revealed that PRIP-deficient glands (B) contained fewer and smaller lobuloalveoli than wild type glands (A). C and D represent higher magnification of the lobuloalveolar structures in A and B, respectively. On hematoxylin and eosin section, PRIP-deficient glands (F) showed abundant adipocytes surrounding alveoli, whereas wild type glands (E) contained well developed alveoli with no recognizable adipocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Attenuation of Ductal Branching of Mammary Glands in Response to Estrogen Treatment—To examine mammary gland development in response to estrogen treatment, mice were ovariectomized, and estrogen pellets were implanted. Three weeks later, uterine weight was increased ∼11-fold in both wild type and mutant mice, confirming the successful implantation of the estrogen pellets. The whole-mount of the fourth pair of mammary glands from four wild type and four PRIP mutant mice consistently demonstrated that PRIP-deficient glands exhibited much less extensive ductal branching as compared with wild type glands (Fig. 5 as the representative). Therefore, PRIP is required for efficient ductal branching of mammary glands in response to estrogen. Proliferation and Apoptosis of PRIP-deficient Mammary Epithelial Cells—To determine whether the retarded mammapoiesis was caused by altered proliferation and survival of mammary epithelial cells, DNA synthesis and apoptosis were examined in the terminal end buds of inguinal mammary glands from both wild type and PRIP mutant mice. Six-week-old wild type and PRIP-deficient mice were injected with bromodeoxyuridine to label the proliferating cells in the mammary glands. Immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd revealed no quantitative differences in the mitotic index between wild type and PRIP-deficient mammary glands (Fig. 6). The apoptotic index was determined by TUNEL assay. A slight increase in apoptosis was found in the terminal end buds from PRIP-deficient glands as compared with wild type mammary glands (Fig. 6), raising the possibility that abnormal apoptosis contributes to the impaired ductal branching. Altered Expression of Growth Factors in PRIP-deficient Glands—ERBB signaling pathways are essential for mammary gland development (33Stern D.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar). EGF-like growth factors including amphiregulin, EGF, TGF-α, and betacellulin are the ligands for ERBB receptors. To understand the underlying mechanism for defective mammapoiesis, the levels of amphiregulin, EGF, TGF-α, and betacellulin mRNA from PRIP-deficient glands were examined by semiquantitative PCR. The level of EGF mRNA from wild type glands was slightly higher than that from PRIP-deficient glands (Fig. 7). However, PRIP-deficient glands expressed markedly increased amphiregulin (Areg), TGF-α, and betacellulin (Btc) mRNA (Fig. 7), indicating that PRIP-deficient mammary epithelial cells may have impaired response to growth factors. Expression of Milk Protein Genes in PRIP-deficient Glands—Whereas lobuloalveolar development was retarded, the morphology of individual alveolus from PRIP-deficient lactating glands was indistinguishable from that of wild type alveolus. This prompted us to investigate the differentiated functions of mammary epithelial cells. We examined the mRNA expression of the milk protein genes β-casein, WAP, and WDNM1 from mammary glands on the 8th day of lactation. Northern blot showed that PRIP-deficient glands still expressed high levels of β-casein, WAP, and WDNM1 (Fig. 8). Whereas the expression level of WDNM1 from PRIP-deficient glands was slightly higher than that from wild type glands, the expression of β-casein and WAP was reduced in PRIP-deficient glands. To define the role of PRIP in mammary gland development, we created a conditional PRIP null mutation in mammary glands. PRIP-deficient glands showed a normal elongation of ducts but a decreased number of ductal branches during puberty, and this condition remained long after puberty, indicating that the potential of ductal branching was impaired. PRIP-deficient glands exhibited decreased density of alveoli during pregnancy. The lactating PRIP-deficient glands contained decreased numbers of lobuloalveoli with many adipocytes and failed to nurture all pups. This study demonstrated that PRIP is pivotal for normal mammary gland development. PRIP-deficient mammary epithelial cells expressed abundant mRNAs of milk protein genes, but these mice appeared unable to produce enough milk to nurse all pups. Therefore, the major defect leading to reduced milk production is most probably the impaired side branching, which generated too few and smaller alveoli to produce sufficient quantities of milk rather than the mildly affected differentiated function of mammary epithelial cells. ERBB signaling pathways activated by EGF-like factors are essential for mammary gland development. We found that expression of several of the EGF-like factors was increased in PRIP-deficient glands. The defect in PRIP-deficient glands should not be attributed to the lack of these EGF-like factors. Other growth factors may be the targets for PRIP protein and remain to be identified. Another possibility is that the PRIP-deficient mammary epithelial cells have an intrinsic defect, which causes an inefficient response to growth factors for ductal branching and alveologenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, microarray studies found that STAT5a and HIF-1 mRNAs were significantly decreased in PRIP-deficient glands. 2C. Qi, unpublished data. A gene knock-out experiment revealed that STAT5 is essential for lobuloalveolar development (35Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Loss of HIF-1 was demonstrated to impair mammary epithelial differentiation and lipid secretion, resulting in failure of lactation (36Seagroves T.N. Hadsell D. McManaman J. Palmer C. Liao D. McNulty W. Welm B. Wagner K.U. Neville M. Johnson R.S. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore these two genes are good candidates whose decreased expressions are responsible for the mammary gland defect associated with PRIP deficiency. Ductal growth during puberty and the side branching and alveologenesis during pregnancy are stimulated by estrogen and progesterone, respectively. In PRIP mutant mice, ductal branching and alveolar development were still present but severely impaired. Moreover, the ductal branching stimulated by direct estrogen treatment was attenuated in mutant mice. These phenotypes of PRIP-deficient glands were consistent with those from mammary glands with compromised function of estrogen and progesterone receptors, although it is possible that these defects were caused by the loss of PRIP function unrelated to its role as the coactivator of estrogen and progesterone receptors in mammary glands. Analysis of estrogen and progesterone target genes would provide direct in vivo evidence that PRIP is required for the function of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Although a few estrogen and progesterone target genes have been identified in breast cancer cell lines (37Kester H.A. van der Leede B.M. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol.

With the identification of estrogen and progesterone target genes in mammary glands, the function of PRIP as the nuclear receptor coactivator can be further analyzed to see how it is involved in the transcriptional regulation of different target genes.

CarS, produced on illumination, relieves repression of carB by physically interacting with CarA to dis-mantle CarA-DNA complexes. Here, we demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal portions of CarA are organized as distinct structural and functional domains. Specifically, we show that the 78 N-terminal residues of CarA, CarA(Nter), form a monomeric, highly helical, autonomously folding unit with significant structural stability. Significantly, CarA(Nter) houses both the operator and CarS binding specificity determinants of CarA. CarA(Nter) binds operator with a lower affinity than whole CarA, and the CarA(Nter)-CarS complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry. In vitro, sufficiently high concentrations of CarA(Nter) block M. xanthus RNA polymerase-promoter binding, and this is relieved by CarS. In vivo, substitution of the gene carA by that for CarA(Nter) results in constitutive expression of carB just as in a carA-deleted background. However, re-engineering the latter strain to overexpress CarA(Nter) restores repression of carB. Thus, the 78-residue N-terminal portion of CarA is an autonomously folded, dual function domain that orchestrates specific DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions and, when overexpressed, can be functionally competent in vivo.

Light induces the synthesis of carotenoids in the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus (1Hodgson D.A. Murillo F.J. Dworkin M. Kaiser A.D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1993: 157-181Google Scholar). The carotenoids quench singlet oxygen and other free radicals produced upon illumination and thereby protect cells against photo-oxidative damage (2Goodwin T.W.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The photoinducible expression of these genes is controlled by several novel transcription factors (Fig. 1). In the dark, the extracytoplasmic function σ-factor CarQ is sequestered by the membrane protein CarR, whereas light triggers the inactivation of CarR to release CarQ (6Gorham H.C. McGowan S.J.

The present study is a molecular dissection of the structural and functional domains of CarA aimed at elaborating the molecular bases for the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involving the CarA-CarS pair. Our earlier yeast two-hybrid analysis had suggested that the 78 N-terminal residues of CarA, CarA(Nter), contain the regions mediating the interactions with CarS and that the remaining 209-residue C-terminal portion, CarA(Cter), was involved in CarA oligomerization (16López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ability of each of these two segments of CarA to mediate specific protein-protein interactions hinted that they could fold independently to the required conformation in the hybrid proteins employed. In the present study, we show that CarA(Nter) does indeed constitute an autonomously folding unit. Employing purified proteins, we confirm the existence of the physical interactions between CarA(Nter) and CarS, and establish the stoichiometry of the CarA(Nter)-CarS complex. We further demonstrate that CarA(Nter) is the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of CarA, in accord with sequence analysis that hinted at a bacterial MerR-type helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif in this domain (15Cervantes M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Botella J.A. Murillo F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also provide evidence that CarA(Nter) can inhibit RNA polymerase-promoter binding in vitro and that this inhibition is removed by the association of CarA(Nter) with CarS. The dual ability of CarA(Nter) to exhibit specific protein-DNA as well as protein-protein interactions is a remarkable feature of this domain of the CarA repressor. Given that key properties of CarA reside in CarA(Nter), we examined the consequences in vivo of substituting CarA by CarA(Nter) and found that sufficiently high levels of expression of this domain can on their own repress carB. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Wild-type M. xanthus strain DK1050 (19Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 818-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its derivative MR844 carrying a nonpolar deletion within carA (15Cervantes M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were grown in the rich CTT medium (20Bretscher A.P. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 763-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid constructions were performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and protein production in BL21-(DE3)pLysS, both grown in LB (21Sambrook J. Russell 3rd Ed., D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.2Google Scholar). Protein Overexpression and Purification—Standard protocols were followed for DNA manipulation (21Sambrook J. Russell 3rd Ed., D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.2Google Scholar). Vector pET15b was used to overexpress proteins with His6 tag (22Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Using pMAR172 (see above) as template and appropriately designed primers, we PCR-amplified DNA fragments coding for (i) CarA(Nter), with the initiator ATG codon of CarA forming part of an NdeI site and with a stop codon at position 79 followed by an XhoI site, and (ii) CarA(Cter), corresponding to the region coding for the CarA C-terminal residues 80-288, immediately preceded by an NdeI site (that provides the initiator ATG codon) and with an XhoI site following the stop codon. The fragments were purified and cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET15b, and the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The proteins used in the present study were all expressed as soluble proteins except for the partly soluble His6-CarA. Native His6-tagged CarA, CarS, and CarS1 were overexpressed and purified as previously described (16López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). His6-CarA(Nter) and His6-CarA(Cter) were purified using TALON metal affinity resin, and the native purification protocol at neutral pH, with imidazole elution (Clontech). His6-CarA(Nter) was further purified by reverse phase chromatography using a SourceRPC column in an AKTA HPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) and lyophilized, and its identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The yield per liter of cell culture was 10-20 mg of protein. CarA(Nter) and CarS were obtained by cleaving the His6-tagged proteins with thrombin at a 1000-fold dilution for 6 h in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was quenched with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, and the His tag peptide was removed by reverse-phase HPLC or extensive dialysis. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m GdmCl 1The abbreviations used are: GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; CarA(Nter), the 78-residue N-terminal domain of CarA; CarA(Cter), the 209-residue C-terminal domain of CarA; CTT, casitone-Tris; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Km, kanamycin; RNAP, RNA polymerase. using the following extinction coefficients, ϵ280: CarA(Nter) (1 Trp, 3 Tyr), 9540 m-1 cm-1; CarA (4 Trp, 6 Tyr), 30,940 m-1 cm-1; CarS (1 Trp and 1 Tyr), 6990 m-1 cm-1; CarS1 (1 Tyr), 1490 m-1 cm-1 (23Pace C.N.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge and a Ti-60 rotor with six-sector Epon charcoal centerpieces of 12-mm optical path length. CarA(Nter) and His6-CarA(Nter) were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol using 3500-dalton cut-off dialysis tubing with three changes of buffer (each for >8 h). 70 μl of the pure dialyzed protein at 150-250 μm was centrifuged at 20 °C at 20,000 rpm (50,000 rpm for the base line) to equilibrium (verified when consecutive scans acquired in 2-h intervals were superimposable). Data were fit to the equation for an ideal solution with a single species (24Cole J.L. Hansen J.C. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar) using EQASSOC (Beckman) to obtain apparent weight-average molecular weight. Partial specific volumes, ν, calculated from the amino acid composition, were 0.728 ml/g for His6-CarA(Nter) and 0.722 ml/g for CarA(Nter) (25Laue T.M. Shak B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical gel filtration was carried out in an AKTA HPLC unit, using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). 100 μl of 5-50 μm pure protein or of a preincubated mixture were injected into the column equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl in buffer A, and the elution was tracked by absorbances at 280, 235, and 220 nm at flow rates of 0.3 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the following as standards (all from Sigma): cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and blue dextran (2 MDa) to determine the void volume (Vo) and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) to estimate total bed volume, Vt. The calibration curve was as follows: log Mr = 7.52-0.206 Ve (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.99). Ve, the elution volume, was assigned for each peak after verifying its identity in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—CD and fluorescence measurements were done in an Applied Photophysics (UK) Pistar apparatus coupled to a Peltier temperature control device and a Neslab RTE-70 water bath. CD calibration was with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (26Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Sample mixing and temperature measurement in the cuvette were achieved with magnetic stirrer and thermosensor accessories, respectively. Far-UV CD data were collected using 5-40 μm Car(Nter) in 1- or 10-mm path length cuvettes and a slit width of 2 nm and averaged over four scans for CD spectra acquired with adaptive sampling or 10 repeats for the CD signal at 222 nm. A 10-mm path length cuvette, 5-10 μm protein, 280-nm excitation wavelength, and a slit width of 5 nm were used for recording intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra with an emission slit width of 9.5 nm (averaged over three scans). Thermal denaturation data were recorded in 0.2 °C steps over a 90 °C temperature range using the far-UV CD signal at 222 nm, the sample overlaid with mineral oil to minimize evaporation. Data acquired with a zero settling time and a 2-h duration and with a 10-s settling time and a 5-h period yielded coincident traces. Urea- and GdmCl-induced denaturations were monitored by Trp fluorescence at 328 nm and far-UV CD at 222 nm. Concentrations of denaturant stock solutions prepared in CD buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5) were determined from their refractive indices (27Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1990: 331Google Scholar). Thermal and denaturant-induced folding transitions for CarA(Nter) are reversible and equilibrate very rapidly, the spectroscopic signal being invariant for a 5-min or overnight equilibration. Consequently, titrations were carried out by serial addition of small aliquots of a concentrated denaturant stock solution to the sample in the cuvette and recording the spectroscopic signal after a 5-min equilibration period with stirring. Each denaturation experiment was repeated twice. A two-state model for the N (native) ↔ U (unfolded) equilibrium with an apparent equilibrium constant KU = [U]/[N] was used in analyzing denaturation data. KU = fU/fN, where fU and fN are, respectively, the fractions of unfolded and native protein at a given point in the denaturation curve. The free energy of unfolding, ΔGU (equal to -RTln KU), is assumed to be linear with denaturant concentration (Equation 1), and its temperature dependence is expressed in terms of a modified form of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (Equation 2; see Ref. 28Padmanabhan S.

ΔGU=ΔGU0−m[Den];ΔGU0=mCm (Eq. 1) ΔGU(T)=ΔHm(1−T/Tm)−ΔCP[(Tm−T)+Tln(T/Tm)] (Eq. 2) ΔGU0 is the free energy of unfolding in zero denaturant; Cm and Tm are, respectively, the denaturant concentration and temperature at the midpoint of the folding transition; ΔHm is the enthalpy at Tm. ΔCP, the heat capacity, and m, the denaturant dependence, are assumed to be temperature-independent. The observed (y), native (yN) and unfolded (yU) CD or fluorescence signal at a given temperature (T, in Kelvin) or denaturant concentration yield ΔGU as follows. ΔGU=−RTln{(yN−y)/(y−yU)} (Eq. 3) or y=yN+yUe−ΔGU/RT(1+e−ΔGU/RT) (Eq. 4) yN and yU, the pre- and post-transition “base lines,” are described as linear functions of temperature or denaturant concentration. Urea or GdmCl denaturation curves were fit to Equation 1 with m, Cm (or ΔGU0), and four parameters for the pre- and post-transition base lines as variables. Thermal denaturation curves were fit to Equation 2 by fixing ΔCP and varying ΔHm, Tm, and the four parameters for the pre- and post-transition base lines. Curve fittings and the reported errors were obtained using SigmaPlot (Jandel Corp.).

Briefly, binding was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 200 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor, 1.2 nm end-labeled double-stranded probe (∼13,000 cpm), and the amounts of proteins indicated. In reactions with M. xanthus RNAP, 5 mm MgCl2 was included, and CarA or CarA(Nter) was incubated with CCR for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of M. xanthus RNAP and a further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. CarS, when present, was added simultaneously with CarA or CarA(Nter). Samples were electrophoresed in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1), 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) for 1-1.5 h at 200 V/10 °C, and the gels were vacuum-dried for analysis by autoradiography. DNase I footprinting was performed under identical conditions except for including 10 mm MgCl2 in the reaction mix. DNase I (0.07 units) was added to binding reactions at 37 °C and quenched with EDTA after 2 min, and DNA was recovered by ethanol-precipitation was run in 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels with G + A and C + T chemical sequencing ladders of CCR (29Ausubel F.M.

Using pMAR189 as template and primers pJBseq1 (5′-CTGCGCAACTGTTGGGCCAGC-3′), which hybridizes upstream of the HindIII site in pMAR189, and CterDEL (5′-AAAGAATTCCTACTCACGCGGCGGCTCCGTCTT-3′), a 1.6-kb PCR product was generated, where the first 234 bp of carA would be followed by a stop codon (UAG) and an EcoRI site (shown underlined in CterDEL). The PCR product was purified and digested with HindIII and EcoRI to generate a 1.4-kb fragment (PCR1). A second PCR was carried out using as template plasmid pMAR172 (a pUC19 derivative with a 4.3-kb KpnI restriction fragment that includes carA) (15Cervantes M. Murillo F.J. J.

The purified PCR-amplified fragment was treated with KpnI and EcoRI to generate a 1.3-kb product (PCR2). PCR1 and PCR2 were then cloned into the HindIII and KpnI sites of pBJ114, which carries a KmR gene for positive selection and a galactose sensitivity gene (GalS) for negative selection (30Julien B. Kaiser D. Garza A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pMR2804, contains the carA gene replaced by the DNA sequence coding for CarA(Nter), and flanked by about 1.3 kb of M. xanthus DNA to allow for efficient homologous recombination. pMR2804 was electroporated into M. xanthus strain DK1050 and plated on CTT plates containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Since pMR2804 can only be maintained after integration into the chromosome by homologous recombination, this selects for the stable KmR merodiploids that contain the original carA gene as well as a copy of the carA(Nter) allele. Cells carrying only the latter allele can then arise by intramolecular recombination events that evict the original copy together with the vector DNA. For this, independent merodiploid electroporants were grown for several generations in the absence of kanamycin and then plated on CTT plates supplemented with 10 mg of galactose per ml so as to select for the loss of the GalS marker present in the vector. Several of the GalRKmS colonies were then diagnosed by PCR for the replacement of carA by the carA(Nter) allele. Construction of M. xanthus Strains Overexpressing CarA(Nter)—The M. xanthus strain Mxx132 16 S rRNA gene sequence (NCBI accession number AJ233930) was used as query to retrieve the ribosomal RNA tandem promoters in a search of the M. xanthus genome available at the Cereon Microbial Genome Database (available on the World Wide Web at microbial.cereon.com; now www.tigr.org). The following PCR primers were designed: prRNA-1, 5′-AAAACTGCAGGGACGAGTCGAGGGAGTCAACG-3′ (PstI site underlined); prRNA-2, 5′-AAAAGGTACCGCCTCCGCTGATTTCCTCCAGAG-3′; and prRNA-3, (5′-AAAAGGTACCGCCTCCCCGTCTTCTTCTGCCCGG-3′) (KpnI sites underlined; reverse complement of a ribosomal binding site in boldface type). M. xanthus genomic DNA (isolated using the Promega Wizard™ genomic DNA purification kit) was used as template. A 112-bp fragment (PR1) containing only one of the two tandem rRNA promoters was produced using the first two primers, and a 231-bp fragment (PR2) containing both rRNA promoters was produced using the first and third PCR primers. Both PCR-amplified fragments contain a PstI restriction site at the 5′-end and a KpnI site at the 3′-end. The coding sequence for CarA(Nter), with a KpnI restriction site immediately preceding the initiation ATG codon and an EcoRI site right after the stop was PCR-amplified using pMAR172 as template and as primers CterDEL (see above) and CterDEL2 (5′-AAAAGGTACCATGACGTTGCGCATCCGCACCATC-3′) (KpnI site underlined). This fragment digested with EcoRI and KpnI and PstI/KpnI-digested PR1 or PR2 were cloned into the PstI and EcoRI sites of pMR2700. This plasmid vector is a derivative of pBGS18 (KmR) (31Spratt B.G. Hedge P.J. te Heesen S. Edelman A. Broome-Smith J.K. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) that contains a 1.5-kb fragment of M. xanthus DNA sufficiently long for chromosomal integration by homologous recombination and with no promoter activity (32Martínez-Argudo I. Ruiz-Vázquez R. Murillo F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs, pMR2805 and pMR2806, carry CarA(Nter) under the control of one or both tandem rRNA promoters, respectively, and have a Shine-Dalgarno region upstream with the optimal spacing from the initiator Met codon. Each of these plasmid constructs (verified by DNA sequencing) was introduced into the carA-deleted M. xanthus strain MR844 by electroporation, and integration of the plasmid was selected for on CTT plates containing 40 μg/μl kanamycin. The KmR transformants were directly examined for the carotenogenesis (color) phenotype developed on plates. To quantitate expression at PB, a carB::lacZ reporter gene (the transposon insertion ΩMR401::Tn5-lac(TetR)-33) was introduced by generalized transduction into the given M. xanthus strains using phage Mx4-LA27 under conditions previously described (34Avery L.

Sequence analysis also revealed the similarity of the remaining 209 C-terminal residues of CarA, CarA(Cter), to the domain for cobalamin-binding (15Cervantes M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) such as in methionine synthase, where it occurs as an autonomous unit (38Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The charged residue distribution in CarA is consistent with its structural and functional compartmentalization into CarA(Nter) and CarA(Cter); CarA(Nter) is highly basic, with a calculated pI of 10.68, whereas CarA(Cter) is acidic, with a calculated pI of 5.78. As mentioned earlier, each of these two CarA fragments exhibited specific protein-protein interactions when analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system, CarA(Nter) with CarS and CarA(Cter) with CarA, implying that each folds correctly in the hybrid proteins (16López-Rubio J.J.

Both genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that essential components of the spliceosome include five small RNAs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and as many as 300 distinct proteins. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional analysis of a novel cDNA encoding for a protein of 149 amino acids. This protein has 38% amino acid sequence identity with and is evolutionally related to yeast Dim1 protein. Hence we named this protein DLP for Dim1-like protein. We showed that DLP is required for S/G2 transition. We also demonstrated that DLP functions in cell nucleus and interacts with the U5-102-kDa protein subunit of the spliceosome, and blocking DLP protein activity led to an insufficient pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting that DLP is yet another protein component involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Collectively, our experiments indicated that DLP is implicated in not only cell cycle progression but also in a more specific molecular process such as pre-mRNA splicing.

During evolution, the size of the proteome of an organism (i.e. the complete set of proteins expressed by the genome during the lifespan of an organism) is expanded by increasing the number of genes via elaborating pre-existing mechanisms that generate protein diversity as well as via inventing new mechanisms. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is considered to be the principal source of protein diversity in vertebrates (1Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing operates via assembly of a series of highly dynamic spliceosomal complexes followed by two successive transesterification reactions. The high fidelity of the splicing is achieved through networks of interactions involving four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; DLP, Dim1-like protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GFP, green fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RNAi, RNA interference; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; DLP, Dim1-like protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GFP, green fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RNAi, RNA interference; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. particles (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6) (2Adams M.D. Rudner D.Z.

Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Google Scholar, 5Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Google Scholar), each of which contains the corresponding small nuclear RNA and a set of specific and common proteins (6Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Chusainow J. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42370-42381Google Scholar). The complex also contains multiple non-snRNP-associated proteins that are essential for spliceosome assembly and catalysis (6Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Chusainow J. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42370-42381Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in the expression of most metazoan protein-coding genes, often regulated in a cell-type specific or developmental specific manner. Members of the highly conserved SR (arginine/serine) protein family of splicing regulators, including SRp20/X16/RBp1, SF2/ASF (SRp30a), SC35 (SRp30b), and B52/SRp55, possess modular structures featuring one or two RNA recognition motifs and a carboxyl-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain. In addition to the SR proteins, there are other non-SR proteins that are also critical players in pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, these proteins appear also to be required for cell cycle progression. For example, Prp4, by virtue of its kinase activity, is required for pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the formation of active spliceosomes through activating non-SR components (7Schwelnus W. Richert K. Opitz F. Gross T. Habara Y. Tani T. Kaufer N.F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 35-41Google Scholar). However, the phenotypic manifestations of loss of the kinase activity of Prp4 included impairments of G1-S and G2-M progression of the cell cycle (7Schwelnus W. Richert K. Opitz F. Gross T. Habara Y. Tani T. Kaufer N.F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 35-41Google Scholar). Loss of the function of another non-SR protein, Prp6, led not only to the accumulation of pre-mRNA, but also to a cell cycle arrest phenotype (8Abovich N. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6417-6425Google Scholar). An essential step of pre-mRNA spliceosome assembly is the interaction between the snRNPs U4/U6 and U5 to form the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. The tri-snRNP protein, Prp6, plays a key role in this process, at least in yeast (9Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Achsel T. Luhrmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 567-575Google Scholar). Prp6, containing multiple tetratrico peptide repeats that are typically involved in multiple protein-protein interaction, is a 102-kDa protein that interacts within the tri-snRNP with both the U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs and bridges the two particles. The U5 small ribonucleoprotein particle contains various proteins with catalytic activities involved in conformational rearrangements of the spliceosome. Among these proteins, the human U5-15-kDa protein (also known as hDim1) is an evolutionarily conserved U5 snRNP-specific protein, and its ortholog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae named Dim1p was identified as a factor essential for cell cycle progression and pre-mRNA splicing in yeast (10Berry L.D. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1337-1354Google Scholar). Dim1 proteins associate with multiple proteins known or strongly predicted to be associated with pre-mRNA processing, with interactions of hDim1 with hnRNPF, hnRNPH, and NP/PQ (11Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Banroques J. Mann M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4535-4548Google Scholar, 12Stevens S.W. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7226-7231Google Scholar). Over the years, more protein components implicated in pre-mRNA splicing have been cloned and identified. Recently, Zhou et al. (13Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Google Scholar) identified ∼145 distinct spliceosomal proteins. Of these, 88 were known splicing factors/snRNP proteins/-spliceosomal proteins, including U5-102-kDa/Prp6 protein and U5-15-kDa/Dib1 protein. They also found 58 proteins that had not been previously identified as spliceosomal proteins. In this report, we show that a novel Dim1-like protein, DLP, is involved in cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that DLP interacts with splicing factor Prp6 and affects pre-mRNA splicing when its activity was blocked. These results indicate that DLP is implicated in both general cellular functions as well as more specific molecular processes. Bioinformatics—The full-length of DLP gene was aligned out from 96 sequences from 89 cDNA clonal homologies in silico. The open reading frame, conserved domains, and chromosome location of DLP were predicted from the databases in NCBI (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point of DLP were predicted from the data base at www.expasy.ch/tools, and membrane-spanning motifs and signal peptide were analyzed at www.cbs.dtu.dk. The homologous alignment was analyzed by The ClustalW program (version 1.60) (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar), and the phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the Phylip software package. Plasmid Construction—The coding region of DLP was amplified in multiple tissue cDNA panels (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by RT-PCR with primers 5′-ATGAGC TTC CTA CTGCCC AAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGATGTGCCTTCTTCTTCATC-3′ (reverse) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate plasmid named pcDNA3.1-DLP. The sequence of human DLP is available in the GenBank™ data base under accession AY566808. Plasmids pcDNA3.1-U5-102, pcDNA3.1-PQBP, pcDNA3.1-hnRNPF, and pcDNA3.1-APC4 were constructed by cloning the cDNAs of these genes using Advantange™-cDNA PCR kit (Clontech) from the human cDNA panel followed by inserting these PCR products into pcDNA3.1 vector. The primers used for cloning the cDNAs were: Prp6, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATACTTTGCTACGGAGTGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGCTGACACGAGACATAAAAACT-3′ (reverse); PQBP, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATGGGAGAGGAACAGGGCCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGGGTGGGCAGGATCACCAGAA-3′ (reverse); hnRNPF, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATTCTGGCCATTTCTCTTGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCAAGTTGAAAAACAAACAAATCT-3′ (reverse); and APC4, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATATGTTGCGTTTTCCGACCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTTAGGAGTCTAGCTCAGGGTC-3′ (reverse). To generate pcDNA3.1-FLAG-prp6, the cDNA of Prp6 was amplified using primer 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGAATTCACTTTGCTACGGAGTGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGCTGACACGAGACATAAAAACT-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested and cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. To generate green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct, the entire coding region of DLP was amplified by PCR from pcDNA3.1-DLP using primer: 5′-GGAATTCATGAGCTTCCTACTGCCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGGATCCAATGTCTTGATAGCGAAGGTCATATTTG-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech). The resultant construct was named pEGFP-DLP. For GST fusion protein construction, the entire coding region of the DLP was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCCATGAGCTTCCTACTGCCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAACTAAATGTCTTGATAGAGAAGGTCA-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested and cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). For the construction of GST-fused DLP deletion mutants, the following primers were used: deletion1 (1-128), 5′-GGAATTCCATGAGCTTCCTACTGCCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAATTAAAGCTTCCCCCTCATTGC-3′ (reverse); deletion2 (21-126), 5′-GGAATTCCATGAGCTTCCTACTGCCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAAAAAGCTTCCCCCTCATTGC-3′ (reverse); deletion3 (33-149), 5′-GGAATTCCATGGAAGATCCTGTCTGTCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAACTAAATGTCTTGATAGAGAAGGTCA-3′ (reverse). To generate red fluorescent protein fusion construct, the full-length cDNA of Prp6 was amplified by PCR with primer 5′-GGAATTCCACTTTGCTACGGAGTGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGTACCCTGACACGAGACATAAAAACT-3′ (reverse) and inserted into the pDsRed-C1 expression vector (Clontech). The resultant construct was named pDsRed-Prp6. For yeast two-hybrid assay, a yeast expression vector for DLP fusion protein, named pGBKT7-DLP, was made as follow: the entire coding region of the DLP was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCATGAGCTTCCTACTGCCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGCGTCGACGCTAAATGTCTTGATAGAGAAGG-3′ (reverse) from pSUPER-DLP plasmid. The PCR product were digested with EcoRI and SalI and then ligated into the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). Yeast expression vector for Prp6 fusion protein, named pGADT7-Prp6, was made as follow: the entire coding region of the Prp6 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCACTTTGCTACGGAGTGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCGATCTGACACGAGACATAAAAACT-3′ (reverse) from pcDNA3.1-Prp6 plasmid. The PCR product were digested with EcoRI and ClaI and then ligated into the vector pGADT7 (Clontech). RT-PCR and Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was prepared using the ProtoScript™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit with a dT23 VN Primer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). cDNA synthesis was checked by PCR with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers as a positive control. Human adult multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were used to detect human DLP mRNA expression profile. A 447-bp fragment spanning 287-736 bp of human DLP cDNA was prepared as a probe and labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After stringent washing the filters were exposed for autoradiography at -80 °C. GST Pull-down Assays and Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies against DLP—GST fusion constructs were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells, and crude bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in TEDGN (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl) in the presence of the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The in vitro transcription and translation experiments were done with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT systems, Promega, Madison, WL) and l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In GST pull-down assays, about 10 μg of the appropriate GST fusion proteins was mixed with 5-8 μl of the in vitro transcribed/translated products and incubated in binding buffer (75 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The binding reaction was then added to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and resolved on 10-12% of gels. The gels were then fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min and dried. Protein bands were detected by autoradiography at -80 °C for 4-16 h. Antibodies to recombinant human DLP (anti-DLP) was raised in rabbits against purified GST-DLP fusion protein. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—MCF-7 cells were grown in dishes of 100-mm diameter seeded with 106 cells and transfected with expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-FLAG-Prp6. Forty hours after transfections, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), collected using a rubber policeman, and then resuspended in ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted at 2,000 × g and incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were then sonicated twice for 10 s at one-third of full power at 4 °C using a Sanyo Gallenkamp sonicator. The lysate was pre-cleared using protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with pre-immune serum or anti-FLAG antibody (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 4 °C; immune complexes were then captured using protein A-Sepharose. Following centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, the protein-A-Sepharose was washed four times in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 900 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). Complexes were released from the protein-A-Sepharose by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS loading buffer. The immunoprecipitated material was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose; the membrane was probed using anti-DLP antibody. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech protocol PT3247-1) was used to screen for proteins interacted with DLP from a human mammary gland library (Clontech). pGBKT7-DLP was transformed into yeast strain AH109 as a bait. Approximately 5 × 106 transformants were screened. Plasmids were recovered from yeast and retransformed into native AH109 yeast with the bait construct or nonspecific control bait. The transformants were assayed for MEL1 activation by selecting on high stringency plates: SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-galactosidase. Yeast colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a colony-lift filter as follows: colonies were transferred to 3 MM filter paper, permeabilized by brief immersion in liquid nitrogen, and incubated on a filter paper saturated with Z-buffer containing 1 mg/ml X-gal at 30 °C for 0.5-8 h. Positive clones were then subjected to sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assay—The Matchmaker GAL4 Two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech protocol PT3247-1) was used to confirm the interactions between with DLP and Prp6. pGBKT7-DLP and pGADT7-Prp6 were co-transformants into strain Y187 or AH109. We then assayed the transformants for MEL1 activation by selecting for transformants on high stringency plates: SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-galactosidase. Positive and negative controls in parallel were performed. Yeast colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using colony-lift filter as following: colonies were transferred to 3 MM filter paper, permeabilized by brief immersion in liquid nitrogen, and incubated on a filter paper saturated with Z-buffer containing 1 mg/ml X-gal at 30 °C for 0.5-8 h. RNA Interference and Western Blotting—Vector-based RNAi was utilized. Plasmids were constructed by inserting a synthesized 64-mer oligonucleotide containing a specific sequence for a 197- to 215-bp region of DLP open reading frame into pSUPER vector (15Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). The sequences synthesized were: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-GATCCCCCTGCAGTTTATACACAGTATTCAAGAGATACTGTGTATAAACTGCAGTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and oligonucleotide 2, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAACTGCAGTTTATACACAGTATCTCTTGAATACTGTGTATAAATGCAGGGG-3′. The oligonucleotides were resuspended in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm acetate) and heated to 95 °C for 4 min, 70 °C for 10 min, and then cooled to room temperature to generate double-stranded DNA. The double-stranded DNA was then phosphorylated and cloned into the BglII/Hind III site of the pSUPER vector. The vector was then transfected into cells with the LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). Total proteins were extracted after 48 h of transfection. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with an E. coli lacZ construct (pcDNA4/His/Max/lacZ; Invitrogen). For Western blotting, 48 h after the transfection, cell culture media were collected and cellular total protein was extracted. Extracts were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen) or anti-GSTDLP polyclonal antibody. Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 cells were plated into six-well chamber slides and transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-DLP by LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. Cells were washed for four times and a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) was included in the final washing to stain nuclei. Images were visualized with an Olympus 1X70 inverted microscope equipped with a charge-coupled camera. The resulting images were deconvolved with Deltavision software. For co-localization analysis, pDsRed-Prp6 and pEGFP-DLP were co-transfected into MCF-7 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and visualized under Nilcon confocal microscope (Nikon, Bio-Rad). Cell Cycle Analysis—To prepare cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, 105 ∼ 106 MCF-7 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 10 μl (10 mg/ml) of RNase A (Sigma) in PBS/0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 50 mm sodium citrate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Cell cycle data were collected with a FACScan (BD Biosciences immunocytochemistry system) and analyzed with CELLUEST software. Cell Proliferation Analysis—Cell proliferation of transiently transfected 293T, HeLa, C2C12, and MCF-7 cells was measured by MTT dye reduction assay (16Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and on the day of harvest, 100 μl of medium was replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium containing 10% MTT 5 mg/ml stock. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before addition of 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide to each well, and the plates were shaken at room temperature for 10 min. Cellular viability was determined by measuring the absorbance of converted dye at a wavelength of 570 nm. In Vitro Pre-mRNA Splicing Assays—The plasmids used to transcribe the adenoviral major late-M3 pre-mRNA (pAdml-M3) were kindly provided by Dr. Robin Reed (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). They were linearized and transcribed in vitro in the presence of 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), 1 μg of the linearized plasmids, and 5 μm [γ-32p]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) in a 1 mm monomethyl cap (New England Biolabs) in 25 μl of reaction buffer. The radiolabeled RNAs were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were briefly exposed to films, and the band corresponding to the full-length RNA was excised. RNAs were eluted from the gel slice in elution buffer (0.75 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA) overnight at 37 °C. The eluted RNAs were separated from the gel pieces by a Millipore Ultrafree-MC filter unit (0.45 μm), ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in nuclease-free water, and stored at -80 °C. Splicing reaction mixture, in a total volume of 25 μl, contained NE (6∼8 μl), [32P]pAdml-M3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μl of RNasin (Promega). Splicing reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The assay was stopped by addition of proteinase K and SDS to final concentrations of 4 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and diluted to 100 μl with 125 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium acetate. RNAs were extracted with 200 μl of phenol/chloroform (50:50, v/v) followed by 200 μl of chloroform and precipitated with 300 μl of ethanol at -80 °C. The extracted RNAs were subjected to electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels. The radioactive RNA bands were revealed by autoradiography. Cloning and Characterization of DLP—The full-length sequence of DLP gene was assembled in silico first through searching the GenBank™ data base, and clones were obtained from human MCF-7 cells, HepG2 cells, and Ishikawa cells by RT-PCR. These clones were 2540 bp in length (GenBank™ AY566808) and contained an open reading frame encoding for a protein of 149 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass of this protein is 17 kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point 5.63. The corresponding gene was mapped to chromosome 16q22.3 and consists of four exons and six introns (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of the deduced protein indicated that it has 38% amino acid sequence identity with and is evolutionally related to yeast Dim1 protein. Thus this protein was given the name of DLP for Dim1-like protein. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that DLP harbors three putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (residues 9-11, 10-12, and 105∼107), five casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (residues 10-13, 20-23, 48-51, 108-111, and 132-135), and two N-myristoylation sites (residues 104-109 and 122-127) (Fig. 1B). Structural analysis revealed that DLP contains only one putative functional domain, i.e. a Dim1 domain, from 4 to 126 amino acids. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that DLP shares 97% identity with its mouse homolog, NP_079575. The similarity of the amino acid sequence of DLP with a homolog in other organisms was 55% in Arabidopsis thaliana, 40% in Oryza, 38% in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster, and 35% in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1C). Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that DLP is a well conserved protein, and there is an evolutionary relationship between DLP and Dim1 protein (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1Cloning and sequence analysis of DLP.A, the genome structure of DLP, which contains four exons and three introns.

D, the phylogenetics analysis of the evolutionary relationship between the DLP and Dim1 proteins in different species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tissue Expression Profile of DLP—The expression of DLP was investigated by Northern blots and by RT-PCR experiments. The results indicated that DLP gene was expressed as a message of ∼2.5 kb in eight normal tissues assayed (Fig. 2A). Highest expression was seen in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and pancreas, whereas the expression of DLP was modest in kidney, brain, and placenta, and low in lung tissue (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR experiments indicated that DLP was also expressed in cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, HepG2, and Ishikawa (Fig. 2B). To confirm the predicted molecular weight of the DLP protein, a c-Myc-tagged DLP expression construct was transfected into 293T cells. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells were lysed and total proteins were subjected to Western blotting analysis with a monoclonal antibody against c-Myc. As shown in Fig. 2C, Western blotting indicated that the DLP was expressed as a protein of ∼17 kDa in DLP-transfected 293T cells, confirming its predicted molecular weight. Subcellular Localization of DLP—To gain insight into the biological function of DLP protein, we first analyzed the subcellular localization of this protein. For this purpose, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression construct pEGFP or with a DLP-EGFP fusion construct pEGFP-DLP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the fluorescence was visualized under fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, while cells transfected with pEGFP displayed diffuse fluorescence throughout subcellular compartments of the cells, in pEGFP-DLP transfected cells, intensive fluorescence were observed mainly in cell nucleus (Fig. 3B), suggesting that DLP may mainly function in cell nucleus. Functional Analysis of DLP Protein in Cell Cycle Progression—As stated before, previous studies indicated that Dim1 protein was implicated in the cell cycle (17Zhang Y.Z. Gould K.L. Dunbrack R.J. Cheng H. Roder H. Golemis E.A. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 109-118Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not DLP is also involved in cell cycle progression, the expression of the DLP protein was silenced by RNAi or enhanced by transfection of a DLP expression vector, and the"

It has been proposed that the binding of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) and the activating transcription factor (ATF) to the three imperfect cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) located in each TaxBLV-responsive element mediates TaxBLV transactivation. Here we demonstrated that deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activation of the BLV promoter by TaxBLV in a CRE-dependent manner. TaxBLV was acetylated in vivo at its Nα terminus but not at internal lysine residues. Rather, HDACi potentiation of TaxBLV transactivation was mediated by an HDACi indirect action that requires new protein synthesis. Mechanistically, using a dominant-negative form of CREB, we showed that TaxBLV and HDACi synergistically activated BLV gene expression via a CREB-dependent mechanism. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot experiments revealed that HDACi increased the in vitro DNA binding activity of CREB/ATF but did not alter CREB/ATF intranuclear presence. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that HDACi treatment increased the level of CREB bound to the BLV promoter in vivo. Our results together suggest that an increase in CREB/ATF occupancy of the viral CREs in response to HDACi potentiates TaxBLV transactivation of the BLV promoter.

Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). BLV is closely related structurally and biologically to the human T-lymphotropic viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II (1Willems L. Burny A. Collete D. Dangoisse O. Dequiedt F. Gatot J.S. Kerkhofs P. Lefebvre L. Merezak C. Peremans T. Portetelle D. Twizere J.C. Kettmann R. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression of BLV is regulated at the transcriptional level by the virus-encoded transactivator TaxBLV (2Willems L. Kettmann R. Portetelle D. Burny A. Haematol. Blood Transfus. 1987; 31: 482-487PubMed Google Scholar, 3Derse D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which TaxBLV activates viral transcription is not fully understood. Transactivation by TaxBLV requires three 21-bp imperfect repeats located in the U3 region of the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) (2Willems L. Kettmann R. Portetelle D. Burny A. Haematol. Blood Transfus. 1987; 31: 482-487PubMed Google Scholar, 4Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Kettmann R. Burny A. Droogmans L. Willems L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5845-5853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These TaxBLV-responsive elements (called TxREs) contain a core octanucleotide sequence with similarity to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) consensus (TGACGTCA) (5Willems L. Kettmann R. Chen G. Portetelle D. Burny A. Derse D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 766-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BLV CRE-like motifs located in the middle of each TxRE have been shown to serve as binding sites for three members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of cellular transcription factors: the CRE-binding protein (CREB) and the activating transcription factors-1 and -2 (ATF-1 and ATF-2) (4Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Kettmann R. Burny A. Droogmans L. Willems L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5845-5853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Burny A. Kettman R. Willems L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is no evidence for direct binding of TaxBLV to DNA, it has been proposed that TaxBLV transactivation of the BLV promoter could be mediated, as reported for the HTLV-I system, through protein-protein interactions with CREB/ATF (4Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Kettmann R. Burny A. Droogmans L. Willems L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5845-5853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Burny A. Kettman R. Willems L.

The formation of this promoter-bound TaxBLV-CREB/ATF complex could then serve for the recruitment of the multifunctional cellular coactivators CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300. There is now strong evidence that both transcriptional activation and silencing are mediated through the recruitment of enzymes that control protein acetylation: the histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Acetylation of specific lysine residues within the amino-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones is generally linked to chromatin disruption and transcriptional activation of genes (8Gregory P.D. Wagner K. Horz W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Reversible acetylation has also been identified as a critical posttranslational modification of non-histone proteins, including general and specific transcription factors, non-histone structural chromosomal proteins, acetyltransferases themselves, the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein, non-nuclear proteins (α-tubulin), and nuclear import factors (such as human importin-α) (10Chen H.

Depending on the functional domain that is modified, acetylation can regulate different functions of these non-histone proteins, such as DNA recognition, protein stability, protein-protein interaction, and subcellular localization. In the case of BLV, we have reported previously that treatment with deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) increases viral expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected sheep or cows (13Merezak C.

Indeed, several of the nuclear factors that are known to bind to the BLV LTR have been shown to interact with HATs (CREB/ATF, PU.1/Spi-B, USF2, the glucocorticoid receptor, IRF1, and IRF2) (14De Cesare D.

Among these factors binding to the BLV LTR, the members of CREB/ATF family are of particular interest because they have been demonstrated to play a critical role in BLV gene expression and because they are known to interact with the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300. CBP/p300 act as bridging factors between cellular activators and the general transcription factors (30Janknecht R. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized coactivator property of CBP and p300 is their intrinsic HAT activity (31Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 32Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

CBP and p300 also bind to other coactivator complexes such as p300/CBP-associated factor, SRC-1/NcoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1/NcoA-2, and pCIP/ACTR, which also possess intrinsic HAT activity (10Chen H.

Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATF-2 is so far the only transcription factor that possesses its own HAT activity (35Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 36Kawasaki H. Taira K. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 2000; : 259-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the potential link between protein acetylation and transactivation of the BLV promoter by TaxBLV. We demonstrated that HDACi (such as trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBut)) markedly potentiated TaxBLV transactivation of the BLV LTR in a CRE-dependent manner, leading to a strong synergism between TaxBLV and HDACi. These data suggested that TaxBLV transactivation could be functionally regulated by post-translational acetylation in vivo. However, additional studies showed that TaxBLV and its mediator bovine CREB-2 were not subjected to direct acetylation at internal lysine residues in vivo. Nevertheless, TaxBLV was acetylated in vivo at its Nα terminus. The synergistic activation of the BLV LTR by TaxBLV and HDACi required neither intact internal lysine residues in TaxBLV nor the Nα-terminal acetylation of TaxBLV. Rather, the effect of TSA on TaxBLV transactivation of the BLV LTR was indirect through the activation of cellular genes because it was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition. Mechanistically, overexpression of a dominant-negative acidic CREB (A-CREB) polypeptide markedly inhibited the TaxBLV/HDACi synergism, indicating that CREB/ATF are required for HDACi to synergize maximally with TaxBLV on the BLV promoter. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Western blot experiments revealed that HDACi increased the DNA binding activity of the CREB/ATF factors in both the absence and the presence of TaxBLV but did not alter their intranuclear presence. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using the BLV-infected YR2 cell line demonstrated the in vivo relevance of our EMSAs in the context of a chromosomally integrated BLV provirus. Our results support a role of CREB/ATF in the synergistic activation of the BLV promoter by TaxBLV and inhibitors of deacetylases.

A mutant pSG-WT-TaxBLV construct containing combinations of mutations in the three TaxBLV lysine residues (Lys-149, Lys-288, and Lys-296) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using simultaneously the following three mutagenic oligonucleotide pairs (mutations are highlighted in bold and the three lysine codons are underlined on the coding strand primer): CV 202/203, 5′-CCTGTCCTCGGAGCAGTCCTTATATTAAATC-3′; CV 204/205, 5′-GGTTGCTAGCAGAGCAATAGGACTTGATTCC-3′; and CV 206/207, 5′-CTTGATTCCCCCTTAGCATTACAACTGCTAG-3′. The mutated resulting plasmid was designated pSG-TaxBLV-mut3K. In addition, a TaxBLV expression vector with an HA epitope at the TaxBLV N terminus was generated with the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers CV503/504, 5′-CGACTCTAGAGGATCATCAGATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGGAGGCGCAaa1AGTGTTGTTGGTTGG-3′ (the HA tag is underlined on the coding strand primer and the TaxBLV open reading frame is indicated in bold by the TaxBLV N-terminal alanine codon (aa1)).

The adherent cell line COS-7, a simian fibroblastic cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Glutamax I medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. The YR2 B-cell line is derived from leukemic cells of a BLV-infected sheep and contains a single, monoclonally integrated silent provirus with two mutations in TaxBLV that impair the infectious potential of the integrated provirus.

All cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Raji and SupT1 cells were transfected by using the DEAE-dextran procedure as described previously (41Van Lint C. Ghysdael J. Paras Jr., P. Burny A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2632-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 22 h after transfection, the cells were mock-treated or treated with TSA (500 nm) or NaBut (5 mm) (Sigma). At 42 h after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentrations using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). RNase Protection Assays—RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (37Calomme C. Nguyen T.L. de Launoit Y. Kiermer V. Droogmans L. Burny A. Van Lint C. J. Biol.

The BLV-specific 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized in vitro by transcription of XbaI-restricted pGEM-LTRBLV with SP6 polymerase according to the protocol provided with the Riboprobe in vitro Transcription Systems (Promega). The luciferase antisense riboprobe was similarly synthesized by transcription of SgrAI-restricted pSP-luc+ vector (Promega) with T7 polymerase. As control, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific antisense riboprobe was synthesized by the same method and used on the same RNA samples. In Vivo Acetylation Assays—In vivo acetylation assays were performed as described previously (43Adam E. Quivy V. Bex F. Chariot A. Collette Y. Vanhulle C. Schoonbroodt S. Goffin V. Nguyen T.L.

In brief, COS-7 cells were transfected, using FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with expression vectors for WT-TaxBLV, TaxBLV-mut3K, HA-TaxBLV, bovine CREB2, or p53 (500 ng). Experiments were performed in duplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were pulsed for 1 h with 1 mCi/ml sodium [3H]acetate (20 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 500 nm TSA in complete culture medium or, as a control for expression and immunoprecipitation of the proteins, for 4 h with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (10 mCi/ml; ICN Corp.) in the presence of TSA in methionine/cysteine-free medium. TaxBLV, bCREB2 or p53 were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates with either an anti-TaxBLV (monoclonal antibody termed 5A5 provided by Daniel Portetelle), an anti-hCREB1, or an anti-p53 antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSAs and supershift assays were performed as described previously (37Calomme C. Nguyen T.L. de Launoit Y. Kiermer V.

The DNA sequence of the coding strand of the double-stranded TxRE2 probe (nt -139 to -133) is 5′-AAGCTGGTGACGGCAGCTGGT-3′ (the CRE-like site is underlined). For supershift assays, monoclonal antibodies against ATF-1 and ATF-2 and polyclonal antibodies against human CREB-1 and CREM (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added at a final concentration of 2 μg/reaction mixture at the beginning of the binding reaction for 20 min before adding the DNA probe (blocking conditions). As loading controls, the same nuclear extracts were tested for binding of Sp1 to an Sp1 consensus probe, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (Promega). ChIP Assays—The ChIP assays were performed with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Formaldehyde cross-linking reactions from 107 BLV-infected YR2 cells, mock-treated or treated with TSA (500 nm) for 20 h, were quenched with 125 mm glycine. Cells were lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to obtain an average DNA length of 500 bp. After centrifugation, the chromatin was diluted 10-fold and precleared with a protein A-agarose slurry containing salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin (Upstate Biotechnology). Precleared chromatin (2 ml) was incubated or not overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-hCREB-1 antibody or a purified rabbit IgG as control, (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed and eluted twice with 200 μl of elution buffer. The protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight, and 10% of the recovered DNA was used for radioactive PCR amplification (35 cycles) with a primer set amplifying the BLV promoter TxRE region (nt -172 to 29): 5′-Cnt-172CGTAAACCAGACAGAGACGTCAG-3′/5′-Cnt+29ACGAGGGTCTCAGGAGGAGAAC-3′. PCR products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Synergistic Activation of BLV Promoter Activity by TaxBLV and HDACi—To examine the potential link between protein acetylation and TaxBLV transactivation, we tested the effect of two HDACi (TSA and NaBut) on both basal and TaxBLV-induced BLV LTR activity. To this end, human B-lymphoid Raji cells were transiently cotransfected with a LTRwt-luciferase reporter construct (pLTRwt-luc) and increasing amounts of a TaxBLV expression vector, pSG-WT-TaxBLV. Transfected cells were either mock-treated or treated with TSA or NaBut and assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 1). As expected, in the absence of TSA or NaBut, TaxBLV transactivated the BLV promoter in a dose-dependent manner up to 402-fold (Fig. 1, TaxBLV -fold activation, lanes 2–7). Treatment of cells with TSA or NaBut alone resulted in a 51.6- or 51.4-fold activation of transcription, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 1). Remarkably, when cells were both cotransfected with increasing amounts of the TaxBLV expression vector and treated with TSA (or NaBut), a strong synergism was observed between TaxBLV and these HDACi, resulting in transactivations ranging from 421- to 4578-fold in the presence of TSA (Fig. 1, TaxBLV + TSA -fold activation, lanes 2–7) and from 409- to 6522-fold in the presence of NaBut (Fig. 1, TaxBLV+NaBut -fold activation, lanes 2–7). Transcriptional activators synergize when their combination produces a transcriptional rate that is greater than the sum of the effects produced by the individual activators (44Herschlag D. Johnson F.B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfection of 0.5 ng of pSG-WT-TaxBLV led to an 88.7-fold stimulation of transcription in absence of HDACi, whereas, in the presence of TSA or NaBut, it led to a 915- or 833-fold stimulation, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 3). This amount of transcription is 6.5- or 5.9-fold greater (-fold synergism) than the sum of the effect produced by each activator separately (88.7 + 51.6 or 88.7 + 51.4) (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Likewise, transfection of 8 ng of pSG-WT-TaxBLV in the presence of TSA (or NaBut) stimulated transcription 4578- (or 6522-)fold, corresponding to a 10- (or 14-) fold synergism (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 7). This synergism between TaxBLV and TSA (or NaBut) persisted even at saturating amounts of the TaxBLV transactivator (data not shown), indicating that the observed effect was not the consequence of increased TaxBLV expression because of activation of the simian virus 40 promoter by TSA or NaBut. Similar results were observed using other B-lymphoid cell lines (such as the DG75 and Daudi cell lines) or non-B-lymphoid cell lines (such as the T-lymphoid cell line SupT1 and the epithelial cell line Hela) (data not shown). Synergistic activation by ectopically expressed TaxBLV and by HDACi required intact CRE binding sites in the three BLV TxREs, because point mutations in these three CRE-like motifs abrogated the synergistic effect (Fig. 1, pLTR-mut3CRE-luc, lanes 8–14). This implied that the synergistic effect was mediated by interactions at the CRE-like motifs and not at the otherwise intact LTRBLV DNA sequences. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HDACi TSA and NaBut synergistically enhance transcriptional activity of the BLV promoter by TaxBLV in a CRE-dependent manner, suggesting that TaxBLV transactivation could be functionally regulated by posttranslational acetylation in vivo. The TaxBLV/TSA Synergism Occurs at the Transcriptional Level—To demonstrate that the synergistic activation by Tax-BLV and TSA can be observed when the amount of transcription (i.e. RNA levels) is analyzed, transcript levels in transiently transfected Raji cells were measured by RNase protection assays using probes proximal and distal to the BLV promoter (Fig. 2A). The proximal probe, which overlaps the start of transcription in the BLV reporter plasmid, stretches from nt -118 to +83 and therefore hybridizes to all transcripts that initiate at the BLV LTR to produce a protected species of 83 nt. The distal probe, producing a 225-nt protected luciferase product, can only detect transcripts that have extended into the luciferase gene and it therefore"

I transcribes exclusively the precursor that is processed into the 28, 18, and 5.8 S RNAs. These RNAs, along with ribosomal proteins and 5 S RNA, an RNA polymerase III product, make up the ribosome. Since ribosomal RNA comprises about 75% of the total RNA being transcribed in the growing cell, it is energetically critical to tightly regulate its transcription. More importantly, there has accumulated recently compelling evidence that excessive ribosome elaboration, including transcription by both pol I and pol III, is a key element of carcinogenesis. Pivotal tumor suppressors, Rb and p53, and the oncogene c-myc have been shown to be important regulators of rRNA, 5 S RNA, and tRNA transcription, regulators that are compromised in a majority of cancers. It is, indeed, an open question whether this misregulation is a consequence or a more direct cause of neoplasia. In Acanthamoeba castellanii, transcription is regulated at the level of recruitment of pol I to the promoter (1Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1986; 47: 445-450Google Scholar), whereas in mammals transcription is either modulated by promoter clearance (2Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Google Scholar) or by pol I recruitment (3Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Google Scholar, 4Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Google Scholar). Promoter recruitment involves interaction of pol I and/or of a factor tightly associated with polymerase with previously bound transcription factor(s) (3Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Google Scholar, 4Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factor Rrn3p interacts with both the pol I-specific A43 subunit and one of the TAFIs, Rrn6p, that bind the promoter DNA as part of core factor, prompting Peyroche et al. (8Peyroche G. Milkereit P. Bischler N. Tschochner H. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Riva M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Google Scholar) to suggest Rrn3p bridges between pol I and core factor to bring about recruitment. However, Aprikian et al. (9Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Google Scholar) showed by direct biochemical analysis that yeast pol I in the absence of Rrn3p can be bound to the promoter, but the resulting complex is inactive in subsequent steps leading to promoter clearance. Similarly, mouse pol I is recruited to its promoter in the absence of its Rrn3p ortholog, TIF-IA, which must be added before subsequent steps in initiation can occur (2Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Google Scholar, 6Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Google Scholar, 10Bodem J. Dobreva G. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Iben S. Zentgraf H. Delius H. Vingron M. Grummt I. EMBO J. 2000; 1: 171-175Google Scholar). In contrast, human pol I is only recruited to the promoter in the presence of Rrn3/TIF-IA (3Miller G. Panov K.I. Friedrich J.K. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Zomerdijk J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Google Scholar, 4Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol.

Whereas in the mammals, it appears that it is the TIF-IA itself that is regulated, in yeast, it may be the association of TIF-IA with pol I that is modulated, in this case by the phosphorylation state of the polymerase (12Fath S. Milkereit P. Peyroche G. Riva M. Carles C. Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14334-14339Google Scholar). In A. castellanii, pol I is not recruited to the promoter when isolated from transcriptionally inactive cells (1Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1986; 47: 445-450Google Scholar), suggesting that in this organism TIF-IA plays a critical role in recruitment (9Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Google Scholar). Thus, in order to fully understand regulation, the protein-protein interaction(s) that mediate pol I recruitment and promoter clearance need further elucidation. A. castellanii, a small free-living amoeba, provides the best model for studying pol I transcription biochemically. The A. castellanii in vitro transcription system is unusually robust, allowing a meaningful structural analysis of active complexes using a variety of structural techniques (14Geiss G.K.

The preinitiation complex (PIC) includes only three or four proteins that can be assembled stepwise in solution using highly purified components. Transcription initiation factor-IB (TIF-IB) is the factor that recognizes the promoter (7Kownin P. Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1987; 50: 693-699Google Scholar, 15Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P.

TIF-IB is composed of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and four TBP-associated factors (TAFIs), named for their sizes of 145, 99, 96, and 91 kDa (24Radebaugh C.A. Kubaska W.M. Hoffman L.H. Stiffler K. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27708-27715Google Scholar). Unlike in the pol II and III functional homologs of this factor, TBP does not bind DNA using its normal TATA interaction surface in the pol I factor (19Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F.

Transcription initiation factor IE (TIF-IE) is an accessory factor necessary for stable binding of TIF-IB to the core promoter (24Radebaugh C.A. Kubaska W.M. Hoffman L.H. Stiffler K. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27708-27715Google Scholar), but it does not bind DNA (25Al-Khouri A.M. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22 (in press)Google Scholar). Pol I makes no sequence-specific contacts with the DNA but is recruited to the promoter by TIF-IB through protein-protein interactions (7Kownin P. Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1987; 50: 693-699Google Scholar). This step apparently requires a homolog of mouse TIF-IA that is associated with a small fraction of the pol I. 2J. Gogain, unpublished results. Footprinting and minor groove-binding drug inhibition studies (14Geiss G.K. Radebaugh C.A. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29243-29254Google Scholar) indicated that TIF-IB binds primarily in the minor groove. Thus, it seemed logical to test photocross-linking reagents that either targeted the minor groove or, better, were unbiased as to groove. In addition, our earlier cross-linking study (17Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Google Scholar) did not include pol I, and a similar photocross-linking study of RNA pol II showed it to cross-link far upstream of the transcription initiation site (tis) on the DNA (26Kim T.K. Lagrange T. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12268-12273Google Scholar). We were curious about whether pol I also extended upstream and what implications that would have in regard to its contact with TIF-IB subunits. In order to further define TIF-IB binding and to determine where pol I contacts the DNA without regard to which groove is contacted, we have performed experiments using a derivative that is linked to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, thus extending into both the major and minor grooves. We have found that TBP in TIF-IB cross-links over a 22-base pair stretch of DNA, about twice that of free yeast TBP, and excludes much of the TAFI binding. The unusually large TBP footprint is discussed in terms of the differential roles of TBP in rRNA and pol II transcription. TIF-IB TAFIs cross-link both upstream and downstream of TBP, from –78 to +10 relative to the tis. Pol I was found to cross-link downstream to +16, in agreement with where it had been previously footprinted (15Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8004-8008Google Scholar), and upstream no farther than –13. This pattern localizes the interaction between TAFI96 and pol I in the DNA-binding cleft of the polymerase. We also report that a partial clone of TAFI96 shows that it is the homolog of mammalian TAFI68 and yeast Rrn7p and that this suggests a mechanism for pol I recruitment involving multiple interactions between polymerase per se, in addition to that mediated by TIF-IA/Rrn3p. Derivatized Promoter DNA Fragments—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were derivatized by the method of Bartholomew. 3B. Bartholomew, personal communication. All reactions before UV irradiation were performed under reduced lighting. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides 15–17 nucleotides in length with a phosphorothioate between the second and third residue (Macromolecular Resources and Invitrogen) were derivatized in a 150-μl reaction by mixing a 75-μl solution of 7.5 nmol of oligodeoxyribonucleotide in 100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.93, with 75 μl of 100 mm p-azidophenacyl bromide (Sigma) in acetonitrile. Reactions were incubated 4 h at 25 °C and then lyophilized in the Speedvac at the medium heat setting. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water and extracted three times with water-saturated isobutyl alcohol and four times with water-saturated ethyl ether. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were diluted to 10 pmol/μl with 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. 10 pmol of oligodeoxyribonucleotides were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]-ATP and annealed to pBSx(+) single-stranded plasmid (pBS(+) 18 containing the RNA polymerase I promoter from –120 to +80) (17Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Google Scholar), followed by primer extension and ligation (27Travers A.A. Buckle M. DNA, Protein Interactions: A Practical Appoach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was omitted from all reactions, since it reduces phenyl azides to photoinert phenyl amines (28Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Google Scholar). The plasmid was digested with BamHI and HindIII to produce a 221-bp fragment, which was purified on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and passively eluted. Photocross-linking—20-μl binding reactions contained 30 fmol of derivatized DNA fragment, 0 or 40 milliunits of A. castellanii RNA pol I (22Spindler S.R. Duester G.L. D'Alessio J.M. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4669-4675Google Scholar), and no TIF-IB·TIF-IE or the amount needed to shift all template DNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml pBR322, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were incubated 20 min at 25 °C and then irradiated for 4 min at 365 nm (11 mJ/mm2) with UV light (Spectroline model SB-100p). Complexes were digested as described (17Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on 7.5 and 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, which were dried, exposed to phosphor storage screens (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2–4 days, and visualized on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Proteins—RNA pol I was purified as described (29Iida C.T. Paule M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3211-3221Google Scholar) through the heparin-Sepharose stage. TIF-IB·TIF-IE was purified through one round of the DNA promoter affinity column (24Radebaugh C.A. Kubaska W.M. Hoffman L.H. Stiffler K. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27708-27715Google Scholar). This TIF-IB contains sufficient TIF-IE for the formation of stable complexes with the promoter DNA. In one test experiment, additional TIF-IE was added but was not found to cross-link to the DNA (data not shown). TIF-IB Peptide Sequencing—TIF-IB was purified from 5 kg of A. castellanii cells through the promoter-DNA affinity column. Peptide sequencing of the purified subunits (TAFIs) was completed by the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope (Duarte, CA). TAFI96 peptide sequences T60 (GQIPYPF), T11 (YLDYFQD), and T65 (TWLDEMG) were reverse translated to yield both mRNA-like (T60R, CARATYCCNTAYTTYCC; T11R, TNGAYTAYTTYCARGAY; T65R, ACBTGGYTNGAYGARATGGG) and antisense (T60, CGRAARTANGGRATYTG; T11, RTCYTGRAARTARTCNA; T65, CCCATYTCRTCNARCCAVGT) degenerate primer sequences. TAFI96 Genomic DNA Cloning and Sequencing—Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 × 107 logarithmically growing A. castellanii cells using a GenomicPrep Cells and Tissue DNA isolation kit from Amersham Biosciences. PCR amplification was completed using each possible TAFI96 primer pairing and the following reaction conditions: 180 ng of genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 1× Masteramp J (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Step down PCR was completed using the following segments: three cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 55 °C for 1 min, and 3 min at 72 °C; three cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 3 min at 72 °C; three cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 49 °C for 1 min, and 3 min at 72 °C; three cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 46 °C for 1 min, and 3 min at 72 °C; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 43 °C for 1 min, and 3 min at 72 °C; and one cycle of 5 min at 72 °C. The ∼1.6-kbp PCR product was cloned and partially sequenced using standard methods. Gene-specific RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 logarithmically growing A. castellanii cells using Trizol reagent from Invitrogen. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA and 10 pmol of either the T60 or 3-1A (GGGAGAGGAGCGAGGTGAGG) primers using Superscript II RNase H-free reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The second cDNA strand was synthesized, and the cDNA was amplified under the PCR conditions noted above, except that 10 μl of cDNA template and 50 pmol of primers 3-1 (CCTCACCTCGCTCCTCTC) and 5-1 (CGGAAGAGGCCCGAAGAC) or T11R and T65 were used. Step down PCR was completed using the profile noted above except that the annealing and extension steps were reduced to 30 s and 2 min, respectively. The resulting 1029- and 296-bp products were cloned and sequenced using standard methods. 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—First strand cDNA was synthesized as described above except that Rm008 cDNA cloning primer from Invitrogen was used. The second cDNA strand was synthesized, and the cDNA was amplified as noted above except that primer 5-1A (GTCTTCGGGCCTCTTCCGCG) and RM009 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends primer from Invitrogen were used. Step down PCR was completed using the following segments: three cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s and 2 min at 72 °C; three cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 30 s, and 2 min at 72 °C; three cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 30 s, and 2 min at 72 °C; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 30 s, and 2 min at 72 °C; and one cycle of 5 min at 72 °C. The resulting 587-bp product was cloned and sequenced using standard methods. Data Base Searches for Orthologs to TAFI96 —Using BLASTP 2.2.3, the partial TAFI96 amino acid sequence was used as a query against the nonredundant protein data base at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (available on the World Wide Web at www.ch.embnet.org). Multiple protein alignments of TAFI96 with Rrn7p from S. cerevisiae, SpRrn7h from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and TAFI68 from mice and humans were completed using ClustalW and displayed using Boxshade at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Modeling—DeepView (version 3.7) was used to create a single Protein Data Bank file from 1I50 (30Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Google Scholar) plus a DNA Protein Data Bank file, and then Rasmol (version 2.6) was used to create an α-carbon backbone representation of the polymerase. Positions of DNA Derivatization and Factor Binding—Modified DNA templates were made by incorporating single derivatization sites located on primers into the A. castellanii rRNA promoter from –78 to +16 relative to tis. This part of the promoter was chosen, because it encompasses TIF-IB and pol I binding sites as shown by DNase I and methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) (MPE) footprinting assays (7Kownin P. Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1987; 50: 693-699Google Scholar, 15Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8004-8008Google Scholar). The modified derivatization sites were 2–6 base pairs apart, resulting in 27 DNA fragments each derivatized at a single, distinct site. Each primer used for promoter synthesis was tested for derivatization by comparing its slower mobility with nonderivatized primers on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). Derivatization efficiency approached 100%. Templates were tested for TIF-IB binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Sample assays are shown for two derivatized DNAs (Fig. 1). TIF-IB was titrated until almost 100% of the template forms complexed with slower mobility (lanes 2 and 4) than the free DNA template (lanes 1 and 3). Pol I binding was not tested by EMSAs, since the DNA·TIF-IB·pol I complex is so large that it stays in the well in this assay. We know, however, that pol I is active and that the full initiation complex is formed because we can induce transcription elongation by adding NTPs to the reaction mixture (e.g. see Fig. 5), leading to loss of photocross-linking starting first at the upstream sites, but complete loss is noted when the polymerase has cleared the promoter (Fig. 5). We also can footprint the bound pol I both before elongation and at several stalled sites downstream of the tis. In these assays, template usage is greater than 90%, and nearly all PICs formed are transcriptionally active (data not shown) (18Kahl B. Li H. Paule M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 75-89Google Scholar, 31Kahl B.F. Paule M.R. Moss T. DNA-Protein Interactions: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 63-75Google Scholar).Fig. 5Photocross-linking of TIF-IB·TIF-IE and pol I in the initiation complex, in the elongation complex, and after promoter clearance by pol I. A, cross-linking upstream of the start site. A133 of polymerase cross-links at –11, –8, –4, and –1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14) in the initiation complex. When polymerase is elongated and stalled at +7, the farthest upstream that A133 cross-links is at –4(lane 11). When all four NTPs are added, as well as heparin to ensure single round transcription, pol I cross-linking disappears (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16). TAFI96 cross-links at all sites tested in this region. B, the same reactions are performed for cross-linking sites downstream of the start site. Both A133 and A185 are found at +4 (lane 2), +10 (lane 10), and +16 (lane 14). When polymerase is stalled at +7, A185 cross-linking disappears. All pol I cross-linking disappears with the addition of all four NTPs. TAFI96 cross-links at one site, +10, which is exactly one helical turn from the start site, where it is last seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Specificity of Photocross-linking—In order to verify that TIF-IB and pol I were cross-linking specifically, we tested cross-linking under a variety of conditions. One example of these data is shown in Fig. 2. No consistent radiolabeled products are found in the absence of TIF-IB and pol I (lanes 1 and 9). However, we do observe a group of bands migrating between the 60- and 80-kDa markers that are irreproducibly present even when there are no added proteins other than the large excess of bovine serum albumin. These are marked with an asterisk in this and all subsequent figures. When these bands appear, there frequently are also bands between the 20- and 30-kDa markers in a 12% gel (e.g. Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 2, and 16–18). In contrast, when TIF-IB·TIF-IE is bound to the DNA derivatized at –1 (Fig. 2, lanes 1–8) or –24 (lanes 9–12), strong and reproducible cross-linking to the 96-kDa subunit occurs (lanes 2, 10, and 11). After the addition of pol I to the committed complex, a new strongly cross-linked band corresponding to the A133 subunit (the β subunit homolog (21D'Alessio J.M. Perna P.J. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11282-11287Google Scholar)) is obtained (lane 3). Pol I does not cross-link in the absence of TIF-IB under the conditions used (lanes 4 and 12), in agreement with its inability to recognize promoters in the absence of TIF-IB. However, it is critical to note that if too much polymerase is added or not enough nonspecific competitor is used, pol I cross-links over the entire template, demonstrating its strong nonspecific affinity for DNA (data not shown). Therefore, in these experiments, the controlled titration of pol I and competitor DNA was carried out to eliminate this spurious background. TIF-IB cross-linking is abolished by the addition of specific competitor (lanes 5 and 6) but remains strong even in the presence of a large excess of nonspecific competitor (lane 7), demonstrating the sequencespecific interaction of TIF-IB·TIF-IE with the promoter DNA. As expected, photocross-linking does not occur in the absence of exposure to UV light (lane 8). This example of the control experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in mapping the positions of the transcriptional components in the PIC.Fig. 3Photocross-linking with TIF-IB·TIF-IE and pol I in the initiation complex at sites from –78 to –17 relative to tis. A, TAFI145 cross-links along this entire region, as does TAFI96, with few cross-linked sites in the up-stream part of TBP cross-linking (see B). TAFI91 cross-links mostly upstream (lanes 2–5) with a single cross-linking site farther downstream at –17 (lane 18). B, TBP cross-links from –57 to –35 (lanes 6–13), covering a region of about 22 bp. Electrophoretic mobilities of molecular weight standards are shown to the right. Labeled bands apparently resulting from incomplete probe digestion (see “Results”) are marked with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of the polypeptides that are cross-linked is accomplished by comparison of the migration of the labeled bands on polyacrylamide gels with the electrophoretic mobility of the subunits from the purified protein, as described previously (17Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Google Scholar, 28Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Google Scholar for a discussion of the identification of TIF-IB subunits. A. castellanii rRNA Transcription Complexes—Photocross-linking was carried out on three different complexes. TIF-IB·TIF-IE was incubated with derivatized promoter DNA fragments to map TBP and the individual TAFIs. In separate reactions, Pol I was also added to form the PIC. Pol I and TIF-IB were cross-linked at numerous sites along the promoter region to see how far each protein extends, both upstream and down-stream, and to see how much overlap there is between TIF-IB and pol I. Cross-linking was also performed with the same set of proteins in the elongation complex, after pol I was moved to +7 by the addition of two NTPs, ATP and GTP. Our ability to move the polymerase in this way demonstrates that we have a complete, active A. castellanii rRNA transcription complex. TAFI Cross-linking—The TIF-IB TAFIs cross-link from –78 to +10 on the rRNA promoter (Figs. 3, 4, 5). TIF-IE does not cross-link to the DNA, in accord with its not binding DNA (32Al-Khouri A.M. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 750-761Google Scholar). TAF photocross-linking was identical whether or not RNA polymerase I was present, so only the data for the quaternary complex are shown. The largest TIF-IB subunit, TAFI145, is found from –78 to –17 (Fig. 3A), cross-linking mainly on one side of the helical axis. It does not cross-"

Therefore, disruption of the HGF/Met autocrine loop may lead to down-regulation of tumorigenesis. To study the HGF/Met interaction, we have developed a cell-free system to detect HGF binding to a Met fusion protein, Met-IgG, using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology. Since we previously showed that HGF can be purified by copper(II) affinity chromatography, we further explored the effect of copper(II) on the HGF/Met interaction. The divalent metal cations copper(II) and zinc(II) significantly inhibited HGF binding to immobilized Met-IgG with IC50 values of 230–270 μm, respectively, whereas manganese(II) and magnesium(II) were less inhibitory with 20–60-fold higher IC50 values. Incubation of 1 mm copper(II) with HGF resulted in nondenaturing and denaturing gel-mobility shifts, indicating that copper(II) binds directly to HGF. This interaction occurs at the N terminus of HGF, as incubation of 1 mm copper(II) with both HGF and the HGF derivative NK1 yielded similar results on SDS-PAGE. HGF-induced activation of Met and cell scattering were inhibited upon addition of HGF in the presence of 1 mm and 500 μm copper(II), respectively. Chemical protonation with diethyl pyrocarbonate of HGF histidine residues impeded the ability of 500 μm copper(II) to inhibit the binding of HGF to immobilized Met-IgG. Based on the NK1 domain structure, we propose that copper(II) may interact with HGF via the histidine residues in either N-terminal or kringle domains. The inhibition of HGF/Met interaction and subsequent downstream cellular functions may be through direct interference by copper(II), such as a change in charge or an induced local conformational change. This putative copper(II) binding domain may be the basis for developing potential inhibitors of HGF/Met binding and downstream functions and could lead to novel strategies for anti-cancer treatment.

Therefore, targeting the HGF/Met interaction may be important in novel therapy designs for treatment of cancers in which an HGF/Met autocrine loop is implicated.HGF is secreted as an immature pro-HGF, which then undergoes processing by a number of factors such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (14Mars W.M.

Pathol. 1995; 143: 949-958Google Scholar), or HGF-converting enzyme (15Mizuno K. Tanoue Y. Okano I. Harano T. Takada K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1161-1169Google Scholar). This post-translational processing yields mature HGF, consisting of a 69-kDa α-chain disulfide linked to a 34-kDa β-chain (16Gherardi E. Sharpe M. Lane K. Experientia Suppl. 1993; 65: 31-48Google Scholar, 17Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar, 18Nakamura T.

The HGF α-chain consists of an N-terminal hairpin loop (N), followed by four sequential kringle domains, designated K1, K2, K3, and K4 (20Tashiro K. Hagiya M. Nishizawa T. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3200-3204Google Scholar). Located at the C terminus of the α-chain, following the kringle domains, is a cysteine residue involved in the disulfide linkage to the HGF β-chain (20Tashiro K. Hagiya M. Nishizawa T. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3200-3204Google Scholar). HGF interacts with the extracellular domain of Met, resulting in the activation of Met and subsequent downstream functions.Deletion and mutational studies indicate that the HGF β-chain is not required for Met binding but is needed for complete activation of the receptor (21Matsumoto K. Takehara T. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 691-699Google Scholar, 22Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B.

Commun. 1995; 210: 1017-1024Google Scholar). Sequential C-terminal deletions of the HGF β-chain correlate with loss of HGF function, whereas no effectual single mutation has been identified, suggesting a role for the β-chain in conformational stabilization of the HGF/Met interaction (23Lee H.S. Huang G.T. Sheu J.C. Chiou L.L. Horng M.C. Lai M.Y. Chen D.S. Lee S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1017-1024Google Scholar). An HGF variant, NK4 (24Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Google Scholar), consisting of the α-chain N-terminal hairpin loop and the four kringle domains, antagonizes HGF-induced cell motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, and phosphorylation of Met (25Parr C. Hiscox S. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Jiang W.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 563-570Google Scholar, 26Date K. Matsumoto K. Kuba K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T.

Davies G. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Mason M.D. Jiang W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1330-1337Google Scholar). Most interesting, K1–4, an NK4 variant lacking the N-terminal hairpin loop, does not exhibit the full range of NK4 antagonistic behavior (27Kuba K. Matsumoto K. Ohnishi K. Shiratsuchi T. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 846-852Google Scholar). Sequential deletion of the fourth and third kringles decreases HGF activity, whereas sequential deletion of the second and first kringles, along with the N-terminal hairpin loop, completely blocks HGF activity (21Matsumoto K. Takehara T. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 691-699Google Scholar). Mutational analysis was used to map Met binding activity to the region of the HGF molecule spanning the hairpin loop, the first kringle, and the N terminus of the second kringle (22Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B. Godowski P.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2503-2510Google Scholar). The HGF isoforms, NK1 and NK2, containing the hairpin loop and the first kringle or both the first and second kringle, respectively, exhibit both antagonistic and agonistic effects on HGF binding to Met and functional properties (29Chan A.M.

Byrd R.A. Sowdhamini R. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 126-129Google Scholar). The modulating effects of NK1 and NK2 are dependent on cell type and therefore may be influenced by the presence or absence of cellular stabilizing co-factors that affect HGF/Met binding.We have demonstrated previously that HGF can be purified utilizing copper(II) affinity chromatography (34Rahimi N. Etchells S. Elliott B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 329-333Google Scholar). Copper(II) binding to kringle-containing apolipoprotein(a) has also been documented recently (35Hill B.C. Becker L. Anand V. Kusmierczyk A. Marcovina S.M. Rahman M.N. Gabel B.R. Jia Z. Boffa M.B. Koschinsky M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 186-195Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HGF may contain copper(II)-binding sites, which could potentially modulate HGF activity. This paper investigates the binding of copper(II) to HGF, the effect of copper(II) on HGF binding to Met, the stabilization of this complex, and the effect on cellular functions. Our results indicate that copper(II) inhibits HGF/Met interaction and downstream cellular functions.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—ELISA, nondenaturing gel, and SDS-PAGE buffer materials were purchased from Fisher, as were Harris modified hematoxylin and EDTA.

A spontaneous nonmetastatic mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line, SP1, which expresses both HGF and Met, was isolated at Queen's University and has been described previously (6Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270Google Scholar). SP1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 7% FBS at 37 °C, with an atmosphere of 5% CO2.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Measuring HGF-Met Binding—ELISA plates were obtained from Costar (Corning, NY). Either the Met-IgG fusion protein or HGF was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in coating buffer (0.1 m HCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated (100 μl/well) in 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times (150 μl/well) with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were then blocked (150 μl/well) with PBS containing 2% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C and again washed, as above. Either serial dilutions or a fixed concentration (100 ng/ml) of HGF in HBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 was incubated (100 μl/well) in plates containing immobilized Met-IgG for 2 h at room temperature with various screening conditions, as indicated in the figure legends. When required, HGF (12 μg/ml) was pretreated with 0.1% DEPC for 45 min prior to ELISA incubation. Plates were washed, as above, and a monoclonal anti-human HGF antibody (either A3.1.2 or 4H8.2) was added (100 μl/well; 1:2500) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. When required, either serial dilutions or a fixed concentration (100 ng/ml) of Met-IgG in HBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 was incubated (100 μl/well) in plates containing immobilized HGF for 2 h at room temperature with various screening conditions, as indicated in the figure legends. Plates were washed, and a monoclonal anti-human Met antibody (3D6) was added (100 μl/well; 1:2500) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. All plates were washed, as above, and subsequently incubated (100 μl/well; 1:2500) with a donkey anti-mouse HRP for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were again washed, and either HGF or Met-IgG binding was assessed by color detection with development buffer (0.4 mO-phenylenediamine in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm citric acid containing 0.03% H2O2, pH 5.0). The reaction was stopped with 2 m H2SO4 neutralizing acid (50 μl/well). Absorbance was determined at 490 and 630 nm.Gel-mobility Shift Assay—Aliquots (1 μg) of both HGF and NK1 were incubated separately in stabilizing buffer (20 mm Tris containing 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 2 h under various conditions. Conditions included either HGF or NK1 alone or with 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm copper(II), 1 mm copper(II) and 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm manganese(II), or 1 mm manganese(II) and 5 mm EDTA. Following incubation, either 50% sucrose sample buffer or 2× SDS sample buffer, containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, was added to the samples, in a 1:1 ratio, and subjected to 7% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis or 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Transferred proteins were subjected to Western blotting with the rabbit anti-human HGF antibody (H-145; 1:500) and donkey anti-rabbit HRP antibody (1:1000), followed by chemiluminescence detection (Western Lightning).Met-Tyrosine Phosphorylation Assay—SP1 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 8 h. In order to reduce endogenous activation of Met, media were removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and subsequently incubated in serum-free RPMI overnight. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and supplemented with 5 ml of serum-free RPMI containing appropriate conditions. RPMI was either added alone, with 100 ng HGF, with 1 mm copper(II), or with 100 ng HGF and 1 mm copper(II). Cells were then incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). Lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation (14,000 × g), and supernatant protein concentrations were determined by Micro BCA. The supernatants were adjusted, with lysis buffer, to equivalent protein concentrations. A 50-μl aliquot of a 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose was added to each supernatant, and samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Met antibody (SP260; 1:50) overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was then pelleted (14,000 × g) and washed twice with lysis buffer. A volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, was added to the pellets and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and were subsequently transferred to Immobilon P membrane. Western blotting was performed with mouse antimouse Met antibody (B2; 1:1000) or mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; 1:200), followed by donkey anti-mouse HRP antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning).Cell Scatter Assay—Scattering of MDCK cells has been described previously (37Stoker M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 565-569Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 6 × 103 cells/well in a 24-well plate and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 18 h. Medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were supplemented with 500 μl of serum-free DMEM alone, with 20 ng HGF, with 500 μm copper(II), with 20 ng HGF and 500 μm copper(II), with 100 nm TPA (38Johnson M.D. Torri J.A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 105-113Google Scholar), or with 100 nm TPA and 500 μm copper(II). Cells were incubated for 24 h and subsequently stained with Harris modified hematoxylin solution. Representative images were captured with an inverted phase contrast Leica microscope equipped with imaging software.RESULTSHGF/Met-IgG Binding Can Be Assessed by ELISA—Two ELISA methods were initially utilized to assess HGF binding to its receptor Met. The first method required that titrations of HGF be incubated with a fixed concentration (1 mg/ml) of either immobilized human IgG or immobilized Met-IgG. HGF binds specifically to immobilized Met-IgG in a hyperbolic manner over a broad HGF concentration range (up to 100 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). In comparison, HGF exhibits no binding affinity for immobilized human IgG. The second method required that titrations of Met-IgG be incubated with a fixed concentration (1 mg/ml) of either immobilized human IgG or immobilized HGF. Met-IgG binds specifically to immobilized HGF in a hyperbolic manner over a broad Met-IgG concentration range (up to 100 ng/ml) (Fig. 1B), whereas Met-IgG exhibits very little binding affinity for immobilized human IgG. Therefore, both ELISA methods can be used for detecting specific HGF/Met-IgG binding and can be useful in the screening of potential inhibitors/mediators of this interaction.Divalent Cations, Specifically Copper(II) and Zinc(II), Inhibit HGF/Met-IgG Interaction—Metal compounds are implicated in binding to HGF, specifically copper(II) which can be utilized in the purification of HGF (34Rahimi N. Etchells S. Elliott B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 329-333Google Scholar). Therefore we screened potential metal ion modulators of the HGF interaction with Met-IgG. HGF (100 ng/ml) was incubated with immobilized Met-IgG (1 mg/ml) alone or in the presence of various metal ion titrations. Copper(II) and zinc(II) almost completely inhibit HGF binding to immobilized Met-IgG over a broad divalent cation concentration range (500 μm-10 mm) (Fig. 2, A and C). HGF/Met-IgG binding is recovered at a lower concentration (125 μm) of copper(II) or zinc(II), each exhibiting an IC50 value of ∼250 μm. In contrast, a high concentration (100 mm) of manganese(II) inhibits HGF/Met-IgG binding only to 10% that of control levels, and binding is quickly recovered with decreasing concentrations of manganese(II) (Fig. 2B), with an IC50 value of 10 mm. A high concentration (100 mm) of magnesium(II) also reduces binding but only to 60% that of control levels, and binding is also quickly recovered upon decreasing concentrations of magnesium(II) (Fig. 2D), with an IC50 value of 50 mm. Thus, HGF interaction with Met-IgG appears to be mediated by divalent cations and is preferentially inhibited by copper(II) and zinc(II).Fig. 2Titrations of copper(II) and zinc(II) inhibit HGF binding to Met-IgG. Met-IgG (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. HGF (100 ng/ml) was then incubated at room temperature under the following conditions. A, HGF alone or in the presence of a concentration titration of copper(II). B, HGF alone or in the presence of a concentration titration of manganese(II); C, HGF alone or in the presence of a concentration titration of zinc(II); or D, HGF alone or in the presence of a concentration titration of magnesium(II). HGF binding was assessed by incubation with mouse antihuman HGF antibody, followed by donkey anti-mouse HRP and color detection. Results are expressed as percentages of mean absorbances ± S.D. for HGF binding in the presence of compounds relative to the mean absorbance for HGF binding alone. Experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because it was determined that a copper(II) concentration as low as 500 μm could effectively inhibit HGF binding to immobilized Met-IgG, we explored whether 500 μm copper(II) could also inhibit Met-IgG binding to immobilized HGF. HGF (100 ng/ml) was incubated with immobilized Met-IgG (1 mg/ml) alone or in the presence of 500 μm copper(II). Similar to the results of Fig. 2A, copper(II) at 500 μm almost completely inhibits binding (Fig. 3A). Alternatively, Met-IgG (100 ng/ml) was incubated with immobilized HGF (1 mg/ml) alone or in the presence of 500 μm copper(II). In this ELISA method, 500 μm copper(II) decreases the binding level to only 60% that of the uninhibited binding level (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that copper(II) inhibits the HGF/Met-IgG interaction to a greater extent when HGF is free in solution and Met-IgG is immobilized, compared with immobilized HGF and free Met-IgG.Fig. 3Copper(II) inhibits HGF binding to immobilized Met-IgG to a greater extent than copper(II) inhibits Met-IgG binding to immobilized HGF.A, Met-IgG (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on a 96-well ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C. HGF (100 ng/ml) was incubated alone or in the presence of 500 μm copper(II) for 2 h. HGF binding was assessed by incubation with mouse anti-human HGF antibody, followed by donkey anti-mouse HRP and color detection. B, HGF (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on a 96-well ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C. Met-IgG (100 ng/ml) was incubated alone or in the presence of 500 μm copper(II) for 2 h. Met-IgG binding was assessed by incubation with mouse anti-human Met antibody, followed by donkey anti-mouse HRP and color detection. Each bar represents the mean absorbance for triplicate wells ± S.D. standardized to the percentage of HGF or Met-IgG binding alone. Experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Copper(II) Causes Gel-mobility Shifts of Both HGF and NK1, and This Effect Is Reversed by EDTA—To explore further whether a direct interaction between HGF and copper(II) exists, we used a nondenaturing gel-mobility shift assay. HGF (1 μg) was incubated under various conditions, with or without copper(II), and subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (Fig. 4A). The presence of 1 mm copper(II) results in the upward mobility shift of HGF, which is reversed by 5 mm EDTA, whereas EDTA alone does not affect mobility of HGF. In contrast, the presence of 1 mm manganese(II) alone or combined with 5 mm EDTA does not result in any detectable mobility shift of HGF protein. To compare the effects of copper(II) on HGF and NK1, we utilized nonreducing SDS-PAGE. HGF and NK1 (1 μg each) were incubated separately under various conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 4, B and C). The presence of 1 mm copper(II) results in the emergence of new protein bands migrating approximately twice the size for both HGF and NK1 (∼175 and 40 kDa, respectively). These higher molecular size bands are negated by the presence of 5 mm EDTA, whereas EDTA alone shows no effect on either HGF or NK1. The presence of 1 mm manganese(II) alone or combined with 5 mm EDTA does not result in any change in HGF or NK1 banding patterns. These results indicate that both HGF and NK1 specifically bind copper(II), which may cause an alteration of their conformational properties.Fig. 4HGF gel-mobility is impeded by copper(II), and this effect is reversed by EDTA. HGF (1 μg) was incubated under various conditions at 37 °C for 2 h. Conditions included HGF alone or in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, or 1 mm copper(II), or 1 mm copper(II) and 5 mm EDTA, or 1 mm manganese(II), or 1 mm manganese(II) and 5 mm EDTA. A, HGF protein samples were run on 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. B, HGF protein samples were subjected to nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. C, HGF NK1 samples were subjected to nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a membrane, followed by Western blot analysis. The blot was probed with rabbit anti-human HGF antibody, followed by donkey anti-rabbit HRP and chemiluminescence detection. Experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)HGF-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Met Is Inhibited by Copper(II)—The spontaneous murine mammary carcinoma cell line SP1 expresses both HGF and Met, resulting in constitutively activated Met (6Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270Google Scholar). Under serum-free medium conditions, SP1 cells exhibit a low level of Met-tyrosine phosphorylation, which can be increased upon addition of exogenous HGF. Therefore, this system was utilized to assess the role of copper(II) on HGF-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Met. SP1 cells were incubated under various conditions, then lysed, and immunoprecipitated for Met. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to assess the level of Met-tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5, top panel).

https://openalex.org/W2093208160,"Aminoacylation of the minihelix mimicking the amino acid acceptor arm of tRNA has been demonstrated in more than 10 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase systems. Although Escherichia coli or Homo sapiens cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) is unable to charge the cognate minihelix or microhelix, we show here that minihelixLeu is efficiently charged by Aquifex aeolicus synthetase, the only known heterodimeric LeuRS (αβ-LeuRS). Aminoacylation of minihelices is strongly dependent on the presence of the A73 identity nucleotide and greatly stimulated by destabilization of the first base pair as reported for the E. coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and methionyl-tRNA synthetase systems. In the E. coli LeuRS system, the anticodon of tRNALeu is not important for recognition by the synthetase. However, the addition of RNA helices that mimic the anticodon domain stimulates minihelixLeu charging by αβ-LeuRS, indicating possible domain-domain communication within αβ-LeuRS. The leucine-specific domain of αβ-LeuRS is responsible for minihelix recognition. To ensure accurate translation of the genetic code, LeuRS functions to hydrolyze misactivated amino acids (pretransfer editing) and misaminoacylated tRNA (posttransfer editing). In contrast to tRNALeu, minihelixLeu is unable to induce posttransfer editing even upon the addition of the anticodon domain of tRNA. Therefore, the context of tRNA is crucial for the editing of mischarged products. However, the minihelixLeu cannot be misaminoacylated, perhaps because of the tRNA-independent pretransfer editing activity of αβ-LeuRS.

Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Google Scholar). Aminoacylation of tRNA catalyzed by aaRSs is a two-step reaction: (a) activation of amino acids with ATP by formation of aminoacyl adenylate and (b) transfer of the aminoacyl moiety from the aminoacyl adenylate to the cognate tRNA substrate. On the basis of the architecture of the conserved active site domain, aaRSs are divided into two groups (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Google Scholar). Class I enzymes have an active site based on the Rossmann fold, whereas the conserved active core of class II enzymes contains an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices. One hypothesis about the assembly of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is that the enzymes are assembled in a modular fashion, incorporating new domains around the conserved active site representing ancestral aaRS such as the tRNA-binding domain and editing domain (3Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 865-870Google Scholar). Interestingly, two domains of tRNA (specifically the amino acid-accepting stem (minihelix) and anticodon stem biloop (SBL)), which interact with the aminoacylation active site and tRNA-binding domain of aaRS, respectively, may have arisen independently (4Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4521-4522Google Scholar). Chargeable minihelices and smaller helices (e.g. microhelices of 7 bp) mimicking the acceptor stem have been identified in more than 10 aaRS systems (5Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6881-6884Google Scholar). Thus, whereas it is recognized that aaRS is in contact with the tRNA anticodon domain containing the genetic code, the acceptor stem often contains determinants sufficient for specific aminoacylation and constitutes an operational RNA code for amino acids (5Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6881-6884Google Scholar). To maintain the fidelity of protein biosynthesis, aaRSs must develop mechanisms to distinguish between amino acids that are structurally similar with reasonable accuracy. Fersht (6Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Google Scholar) proposed a “double sieve” model for two-step amino acid selection composed of a “coarse sieve” excluding amino acids with side chains larger than those of the cognate one and a second “fine sieve” hydrolyzing misactivated amino acids (pretransfer editing) or misaminoacylated tRNA (posttransfer editing). The net result of either editing pathway is an abortive cycle of non-cognate amino acid activation followed by tRNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. A number of aaRSs have evolved proofreading mechanisms, including the class I enzymes (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS), and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS)) and class II enzymes (threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS), alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), and prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS)) (7Sankaranarayanan R. Moras D. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 323-335Google Scholar). The class Ia enzymes (IleRS, ValRS, and LeuRS) are partially related and possess similar editing domains, specifically, an unusually large insertion splitting the ATP-binding fold (termed connective peptide 1) (8Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steize T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Google Scholar, 9Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Google Scholar, 10Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Google Scholar). LeuRS from the deep-rooted bacterium Aquifex aeolicus is the only known heterodimeric synthetase with a 634-amino acid α-chain and 289-amino acid β-subunit (thus denoted αβ-LeuRS) (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). All other known LeuRSs are monomeric in structure. Despite the relatively high sequence identity between A. aeolicus and Escherichia coli LeuRSs, significant differences are observed at the insertion domain (leucine-specific domain) corresponding to a split domain in αβ-LeuRS (see Fig. 1). Genes encoding αβ-LeuRS and the β-subunit alone were expressed in E. coli, and the β-subunit bound cognate or non-cognate tRNAs (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). Data from another study further indicate that the nonconserved leucine-specific domain of αβ-LeuRS may interact with the acceptor stem of tRNALeu (12Zhao M.W. Hao R. Chen J.F. Martin F. Erianin G. Wang E.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7694-7700Google Scholar). Previous attempts to charge the minihelix and microhelix of tRNALeu have been unsuccessful (13Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Google Scholar, 14Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rösch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Google Scholar). In this investigation, we show for the first time that αβ-LeuRS charges minihelices. We further confirm the effect of destabilization of the first base pair on the aminoacylation of minihelices and the communication between tRNA binding and aminoacylation active site domains of αβ-LeuRS induced by the binding of the second domain of tRNA. It is proposed that the tRNA-independent pretransfer editing activity of αβ-LeuRS prevents the synthesis of misaminoacylated minihelices. Additionally, possible evidence for the co-evolution of tRNALeu and the leucyl-tRNA synthetase is discussed. Materials—l-Leucine, l-isoleucine, l-norvaline, 5′-GMP, ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. DE81 filters were obtained from Whatman. l-[3H]Leucine (1 mCi/ml), l-[3H]isoleucine (1mCi/ml), [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol), and [32P]tetrasodium pyrophosphate are products of Amersham Biosciences. Kinase, ligase, ribonuclease inhibitor, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Sangon Company. T7 RNA polymerase was purified from an E. coli overproducing strain in our laboratory (15Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 355-388Google Scholar). A. aeolicus tRNALeu was isolated from an overproducing strain constructed in our group (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). E. coli LeuRS, αβ-LeuRS, β-subunit, SLeuRSαβ (the fusion of the two α and β peptides from A. aeolicus as a single chain analogous to canonical LeuRS), SLeuRSα′β (a fusion protein with an α-like subunit from E. coli LeuRS and the β-subunit of αβ-LeuRS), and DLeuRSα′β (a mixed heterodimer with an α-like subunit from E. coli LeuRS and the β-subunit of αβ-LeuRS) were purified to homogeneity in SDS-PAGE by two-step chromatography in our laboratory (12Zhao M.W. Hao R. Chen J.F. Martin F. Erianin G. Wang E.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7694-7700Google Scholar). Their domain structures are shown in Fig. 1. RNA Substrate Preparation—Plasmids containing A. aeolicus and E. coli tRNALeu genes were prepared using procedures described previously (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). T7 transcripts were generated in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm nucleotide triphosphates, 15 mm 5′-GMP, 0.5 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 2 mg/ml pure T7 RNA polymerase. Transcripts were purified by 15% (w/v) denaturing PAGE, annealed by heating for 2 min in 5 mm MgCl2 at 80 °C, and allowed to cool slowly to 30 °C. Minihelices derived from E. coli or A. aeolicus tRNALeu were synthesized by in vitro transcription of single-stranded synthetic templates (16Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Google Scholar, 17Korencic D. Söll D. Ambrogelly A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E105Google Scholar). The transcription system was similar to that described above, except that 4 mm nucleotide triphosphates and 2 mm spermidine were added. RNA helices were purified by 20% (w/v) denaturing PAGE, annealed by heating for 3 min in 2 mm MgCl2 at 85 °C, and allowed to cool slowly to 30 °C. The final concentration of each RNA product was calculated by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm using the appropriate extinction coefficients (18Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Google Scholar). Thermal melting curves for minihelices in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10 mm MgCl2 were obtained by monitoring the change in absorbance at 260 nm over a temperature range of 30–90 °C. This was performed using a Beckman DU 7400 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller. The thermal transition midpoint (Tm) was estimated from the first derivative of the melting profile. Aminoacylation Assays—ATP-PPi exchange activities of LeuRS were measured at 37 °C as described (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). The aminoacylation activity for tRNA was determined at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm tRNALeu, 70 μm14C-labeled amino acids, and enzyme (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined in the presence of 40 nm αβ-LeuRS and tRNA transcripts concentrations from 0.1 to 80 μm. The kinetic constants were derived from a Lineweaver-Burk plot and were the average data of at least two independent experiments. Aminoacylation assays for minihelices were performed in a 70-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1.3 μml-[3H]leucine (1 mCi/ml) or 1.2 μml-[3H]isoleucine (1 mCi/ml), 15 μm minihelix, 0.05 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 2 μm LeuRS. A low concentration of amino acid was used for maximum sensitivity as reported (19Francklyn C. Shi J.P. Schimmel P. Science. 1992; 255: 1121-1125Google Scholar). The aminoacylation of minihelices depended on the synthetase concentration, ionic strength, and pH value (data not shown). Under the optimized conditions, the aminoacylation of minihelices was determined. At time intervals, 9-μl aliquots were spotted on a Whatman DE81 filter for 5 min before washing with 6% trichloroacetic acid as described previously (20Frugier M. Florentz C. Giegé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3990-3994Google Scholar). Plateau experiments were performed at 37 °C with transcripts at 5 and 1 μm αβ-LeuRS. No RNA controls were employed to correct for background rates (less than 5% of the Aa-minihelixLeu charging). Measurement of ATP Consumption in Editing—Assays measuring overall tRNA-dependent editing were essentially performed as reported previously (21Du X. Wang E.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2865-2872Google Scholar). Assays with minihelices or tRNA were performed at 60 °Cina70-μl reaction mixture containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl ribonuclease inhibitor, 2 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (50–70 cpm/pmol), 15 mm norvaline, 15 μmAa-minihelix or A. aeolicus tRNALeu, and 1 μm αβ-LeuRS. Aliquots (10 μl) of the editing reaction mixture were mixed with 350 μl of quenching liquid containing 6% activated charcoal, 7% HClO4, and 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate. After centrifugation, the amount of inorganic phosphate (32P) in 50 μl of supernatant was quantified by scintillation counting. The amount of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the inorganic phosphate (32P) released in 50 μl of supernatant; the present values were the average from three independent determinations. Background ATP hydrolysis in the absence of RNA was performed for each determination. Design and Construction of RNA Substrates—The L-shaped tRNA comprises two domains, specifically, the acceptor-TψC minihelix with an amino acid attachment site at the 3′ terminus and the anticodon stem biloop with one of the loops encoding the anticodon triplets. The secondary structures of whole E. coli, A. aeolicus tRNALeu, and RNA molecules designed as minimalist substrates are shown in Fig. 2. The SBLs of E. coli and A. aeolicus tRNALeu are presented in Fig. 2, A and B. In Fig. 2B, AL and DL are the hairpin helices corresponding to the anticodon stem loop and D-stem loop of A. aeolicus tRNALeu, respectively. Mutations in tRNA and RNA molecules are specified by arrows. Eight minihelices were derived from the amino acid-accepting branches of E. coli and A. aeolicus tRNALeu and E. coli tRNASer (Fig. 2C). Of these, the first five were derived from A. aeolicus (denoted Aa-), and the last three were derived from E. coli (designated Ec-). These include Aa-minihelixLeu, Aa-G1-U72 minihelixLeu withaCtoU mutation at position 72, Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu missing the 5′-terminal guanine, Aa-A73G minihelixLeu with an A to G mutation at discriminator position 73, Aa-Δ1-C72 DNA minihelixLeu, Ec-minihelixLeu, Ec-minihelixSer derived from E. coli tRNASer (CAA), and Ec-G73A minihelixSer with a G to A mutation at discriminator position 73. Minihelices were prepared by in vitro transcription. The Ancient LeuRS, αβ-LeuRS, Charges MinihelixLeu—More than half of the aaRSs charge small RNA substrates composed of the amino acid acceptor stems of their cognate tRNAs or even smaller helices such as 7-bp microhelix hairpins (5Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6881-6884Google Scholar). As reported previously, E. coli and H. sapiens cytoplasmic LeuRSs cannot charge minihelix or microhelix tRNALeu (13Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Google Scholar, 14Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rösch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Google Scholar). For E. coli tRNALeu, minimal RNA is efficiently aminoacylated when the anticodon stem loop and variable arm stem loop (but not D-arm or T-arm) are deleted (13Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Google Scholar). In this study, we used a more sensitive method for detection (see under “Experimental Procedures”). However, E. coli LeuRS was unable to charge Ec-minihelixLeu, whereas αβ-LeuRS aminoacylated nonspecies-specific Ec-minihelixLeu at 25 °C (Fig. 3). Notably, aminoacylation of Ec-minihelixLeu by αβ-LeuRS was weak (Table I) compared with that in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) or seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) systems (22Frugier M. Florentz C. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2219-2226Google Scholar, 23Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2843-2849Google Scholar). Aa-minihelixLeu was additionally aminoacylated by αβ-LeuRS. However, Ec-minihelixLeu was generally a better substrate (Fig. 3). The first base pairs of the two above minihelices are different (Fig. 2C). Specifically, the base pair of Aa-minihelixLeu is “standard,” whereas that of Ec-minihelixLeu is “wobble.” It remains to be determined whether this difference is responsible for the variable aminoacylation levels of the two minihelices.Table ILeucylation of the wild-type and mutants of A. aeolicus tRNALeu and RNA helicesRNA transcriptskcatKmkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmaRelative kinetic specficity constants are defined as (kcat/Km)mutant /(kcat/Km)wild-type.Plateaus-1μmμm-1 s-1%Wild-type tRNALeu0.50.610.821100tRNALeu A35G0.311.20.260.3295tRNALeu A73G0.11110.010.01240Aa-minihelixLeuNDbND, not determined (extremely difficult to derive precise values of Km and kcat from a Michaelis analysis).NDNDND1.5Aa-G1-U72 minihelixLeuNDNDNDND5Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeuNDNDNDND5Aa-A73G minihelixLeuNDNDNDNDNDEc-minihelixLeuNDNDNDND3Ec-minihelixSerNDNDNDNDNDEc-G73A minihelixSerNDNDNDND1Aa-Δ1-C72 DNA minihelixLeuNDNDNDNDNDAa-SBLNDNDNDNDNDAa-DLNDNDNDNDNDAa-ALNDNDNDNDNDEc-SBLNDNDNDNDNDa Relative kinetic specficity constants are defined as (kcat/Km)mutant /(kcat/Km)wild-type.b ND, not determined (extremely difficult to derive precise values of Km and kcat from a Michaelis analysis). Open table in a new tab Destabilization of the First Base Pair of MinihelixLeu Increases the Aminoacylation Level—Upon the replacement of the first G-C pair of Aa-minihelixLeu with a G-U pair (Aa-G1-U72 minihelixLeu) or the deletion of 5′-terminal G-1 nucleotide (Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu), aminoacylation of the two minihelix mutants was significantly enhanced compared with that of the Aa-minihelixLeu or even the Ec-minihelixLeu (Fig. 4). The deletion and mismatch mutants in which the flexibility of the 3′-accepting end was increased had a similar stimulatory effect (about 8- and 7-fold higher than Aa-minihelixLeu) (Fig. 4). Higher aminoacylation plateau levels were also detected in Aa-G1-U72 minihelixLeu and Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu than in Aa-minihelixLeu (Table I). Effect of Temperature on Aminoacylation—Under the given conditions for the aminoacylation assays, the Tm values of various minihelices were all over 80 °C (data not shown), which are similar to the values of tRNA, suggesting that the overall structures of minihelices are very stable. A. aeolicus is one of the most thermophilic bacteria identified to date (24Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Google Scholar). We showed previously that αβ-LeuRS is stable up to 70 °C under the experimental conditions. The specific activities of amino acid activation and aminoacylation increased with temperature. At 75 °C, the two activities were 12- and 5-fold greater than those at 37 °C, respectively (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). Next, we determined the effect of increasing temperature on the rate of aminoacylation of the minihelix in vitro. The initial rate for Aa-minihelixLeu charge was increased at least 5-fold at 65 °C compared with the charge at 25 °C (Fig. 5). (For technical reasons, we were unable to investigate higher temperatures under long incubation periods.) The rate of minihelix charging with leucine at 40 °C was similar to the rate at 65 °C, whereas the aminoacylation rate of tRNALeu catalyzed by αβ-LeuRS increased linearly in the range of 30–70 °C (11Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar). The different effects of elevating temperature on various minihelices were observed. For the Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu, the initial aminoacylation rate was increased only 2-fold over a temperature range of 25–65 °C (data not shown). The activation effect by elevating temperature was counteracted by the destabilization of the first base pair of the minihelix. It is reasonable because the elevation of temperature and destabilization of the first base pair both induce a more flexible 3′-end of the minihelix, which fits more easily into the aminoacylation active site pocket on the enzyme. Aminoacylation of Minihelices Is Dependent on the Determinant Base A73—To assess the specificity of leucylation of the minihelixLeu, we synthesized Aa-A73G minihelixLeu (Fig. 2C) in which the base at the discriminator position was altered and subjected it to an aminoacylation assay. The Aa-A73G minihelixLeu was not charged at a detectable level even at 60 °C (Fig. 6). The same substitution in native tRNALeu led to an over 80-fold decrease in the kcat/Km value (Table I), suggesting similar recognition mechanisms between minihelices and tRNA. As shown above, although Ec-minihelixLeu is not a species-specific substrate for αβ-LeuRS, it is charged by this synthetase. Both tRNASer and tRNALeu belong to the type II tRNA family containing a large extra stem loop. By mutation of several nucleotides, one minimally altered tRNASer is an excellent in vitro substrate for E. coli LeuRS (25Tocchini-Valentini G. Saks M.E. Abelson J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 779-793Google Scholar). The Ec-minihelixSer was not charged by αβ-LeuRS even at 60 °C. However, the Ec-G73A minihelixSer (in which serine identity nucleotide G73 was replaced by A) was effectively charged under the same conditions (Fig. 6). The charging level of the G73A minihelixSer is less than that of the Aa-minihelixLeu although both contain a G-C first base pair (Table I). At a lower temperature (25 °C), only a very low leucylation signal of the Ec-G73A minihelixSer was detected (data not shown), suggesting that fine conformational differences of the enzyme at higher and lower temperatures may be important for minihelix recognition. DNA analogues serve as active substrates for RNase P or tRNA synthetases (26Perreault J.P. Altman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 399-409Google Scholar, 27Khan A.S. Roe B.A. Science. 1988; 241: 76-79Google Scholar). Moreover, the tDNA minihelix is recognized by a CCA-adding enzyme (28Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculated whether αβ-LeuRS recognizes the tDNA minihelix. To investigate this possibility, we constructed the DNA form of Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu (the best substrate among the minihelix variants) (Fig. 2C) and examined for aminoacylation. αβ-LeuRS did not aminoacylate the Aa-Δ1-C72 DNA minihelixLeu (data not shown). The data indicate that the A form of the helix is important for aminoacylation. Aminoacylation of tRNALeu Acceptor Minihelix by αβ-LeuRS in the Presence of Small RNA Helices—For ValRS and IleRS, which directly interact with the anticodon domain of tRNA, a weak stimulatory effect on minihelix charging was observed when an anticodon stem loop was added to the minihelix reaction (20Frugier M. Florentz C. Giegé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3990-3994Google Scholar, 29Nureki O. Niimi T. Muto Y. Kanno H. Kohno T. Muramatsu T. Kawai G. Miyazawa T. Giegé R. Florentz C. Yokoyama S. Nierhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramanian A.R. Erdmann V.A. Wittmann-Liebold B. The Translation Apparatus. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 59-66Google Scholar) as small RNA helices may induce the active conformation of enzymes. In contrast, E. coli LeuRS does not recognize the anticodon loop of tRNALeu, and the minimal RNA molecule required for leucylation is the minihelix structure with the D-stem loop (13Larkin D.C. Williams A.M. Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2103-2113Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the addition of the isolated SBL domain of tRNALeu into the reaction stimulated leucylation of the acceptor minihelix. Charging of the Ec-minihelixLeu by E. coli LeuRS was not detected even following the addition of Ec-SBL or its derivate containing mutations in the D-loop to enhance the hydrogen bond between TψC in the minihelix and D-loop in SBL (Fig. 2A and data not shown). However, the addition of the Aa-SBL (Fig. 2B) fragment of A. aeolicus tRNALeu slightly enhanced the charging of the Aa-minihelixLeu by αβ-LeuRS (Fig. 7). Leucylation of the acceptor minihelix was additionally stimulated after the addition of a hairpin helix mimicking the anticodon arm and loop (Aa-AL) (Fig. 2B) of A. aeolicus tRNALeu to the aminoacylation reaction (Fig. 7). This stimulatory effect seems to be sequence-specific because the replacement of anticodon nucleotide 35A with G (Aa-A35G SBL, Fig. 2B) eliminated the stimulatory effect of Aa-SBL (Fig. 7). Previous footprinting analyses using cytoplasmic LeuRS with Phaseolus vulgaris, yeast, and E. coli tRNALeu revealed that the D-arm and hinge region are in contact with the enzyme (30Dietrich A. Romby P. Marechal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Giegé R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2589-2597Google Scholar). However, our present data indicate that the D-loop alone (Aa-DL) is an inhibitor of minihelix charging (Fig. 7). The stimulatory effect of Aa-SBL on Aa-minihelixLeu charging was observed under specific conditions. The addition of SBL did not affect the charge either when the reaction temperature was at 60 °C or when the Aa-minihelixLeu was replaced with the Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu. To determine whether αβ-LeuRS recognizes the anticodon loop of tRNALeu similar to S. cerevisiae LeuRS, the conserved 35A of the anticodon in A. aeolicus tRNALeu was modified to G. Compared with the wild-type A. aeolicus tRNALeu, for A35G tRNALeu the kcat of αβ-LeuRS was reduced by about 40% and Km increased 2-fold (kcat/Km decreased 3-fold, Table I). In contrast, upon mutation of known identity elements (for example, the A73 discriminator) the aminoacylation efficiency of Aa-LeuRS decreased 83-fold (Table I). Therefore, the tRNALeu anticodon may not be the identity element in the αβ-LeuRS system. A Possible Role of the Leucine-specific Domain of αβ-LeuRS in Minihelix Recognition—According to the sequence alignment, one significant difference between the A. aeolicus and E. coli LeuRSs is an insertion domain designated “leucine-specific domain,” which corresponds to the split domain in A. aeolicus LeuRS (Fig. 1). Our previous data suggest that the leucine-specific domain interacts with the acceptor stem of tRNALeu at the aminoacylation step (12Zhao M.W. Hao R. Chen J.F. Martin F. Erianin G. Wang E.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7694-7700Google Scholar). Therefore, three enzymes were assembled with aminoacylation activity from αβ-LeuRS and E. coli LeuRS. Specifically, SLeuRSαβ, SLeuRSα′β, and DLeuRSα′β were tested for the ability to charge the Aa-Δ1-C72 minihelixLeu (the best substrate among the minihelices).
