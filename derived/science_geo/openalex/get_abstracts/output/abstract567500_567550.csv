Their state space reduction provides a computationally efficient solution for genotype imputation with no loss in imputation accuracy. Genotype imputation is a key component of genetic association studies, where it increases power, facilitates meta-analysis, and aids interpretation of signals. Genotype imputation is computationally demanding and, with current tools, typically requires access to a high-performance computing cluster and to a reference panel of sequenced genomes. Here we describe improvements to imputation machinery that reduce computational requirements by more than an order of magnitude with no loss of accuracy in comparison to standard imputation tools. We also describe a new web-based service for imputation that facilitates access to new reference panels and greatly improves user experience and productivity."

By employing machine learning for gene classification, we found that the plasma DNA read depth patterns from healthy donors reflected the expression signature of hematopoietic cells. In patients with cancer having metastatic disease, we were able to classify expressed cancer driver genes in regions with somatic copy number gains with high accuracy.

Pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, known as place cells, code for space by firing in a particular location in an environment called the place field (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J.

The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar), determined experimentally by correlating recorded spikes with position while an animal moves around. However, when the animal is at rest, place cells can be activated in temporally compressed population bursts that depict, on a faster timescale, behavioral trajectories through extended sequences of places. These events, often referred to as “replay,” are associated with fast (150–250 Hz) oscillatory events in the local field potential (LFP) known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs; Buzsáki, 1986Buzsáki G. Hippocampal sharp waves: their origin and significance.Brain Res. 1986; 398: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurkó A. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Fast network oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region of the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC20PubMed Google Scholar). SWR-associated replay was first reported in slow-wave sleep (Lee and Wilson, 2002Lee A.K. Wilson M.A. Memory of sequential experience in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) but later was found to also occur in the awake state whenever an animal pauses in an environment (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The latter study reported one further, surprising property of awake replay: it played behavioral sequences in reverse, starting with the current location of the animal and moving backward along the preceding, incoming trajectory. In the study, animals happened to pause mainly at rewarded locations so that these locations were where the reverse replay occurred. While this correspondence did not imply a relationship, it suggested a solution to the so-called “temporal credit assignment problem,” the fact that an animal must make decisions about its movements when far away from a reward and the reward by itself offers no perceptible guidance signal. In the classical place cell picture, there was no possibility of making direct associations between reward and cells whose place fields were far away, since when the animal is at the reward, these cells would be silent. Reverse replay at the reward offered a potential mechanism to associate place cells firing along the incoming route with estimates of future reward and so was interpreted as a learning mechanism (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Subsequently, reverse replay was replicated, but additionally, it was found that forward replay also occurred during awake immobility (Csicsvari et al., 2007Csicsvari J. O’Neill J. Allen K. Senior T.

Although forward replay is not as theoretically attractive for temporal credit assignment as reverse, it does offer a more intuitive notion of memory recall. Thus, several recent studies have reported awake replay effects that were interpreted as forward planning of upcoming behavior (Jadhav et al., 2012Jadhav S.P. Kemere C. German P.W. Frank L.M. Awake hippocampal sharp-wave ripples support spatial memory.Science. 2012; 336: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J.

Hippocampal SWR activity predicts correct decisions during the initial learning of an alternation task.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1163-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, replay directionality was not directly measured in these studies. So the important question remains: do reverse and forward replay have different functions? In particular, does reverse replay have a specific relationship to reward if it is involved in encoding recent paths to the reward? If so, is that relationship absent for forward replay if forward replay is, by contrast, involved in recalling memories of how to get to other locations? To address these questions, we designed two experiments, in which we varied reward magnitude, to determine the effect on hippocampal awake replays recorded during stopping periods. Previous studies that reported effects of reward and/or goal on SWRs or on replay have tended to utilize complex behaviors dependent on rather demanding learned tasks (Dupret et al., 2010Dupret D.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J.

Rewarded outcomes enhance reactivation of experience in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2009; 64: 910-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). By contrast, we used running up and down the linear track, a task chosen for its simplicity and its relative imperviousness to changes in reward. Animals were trained to run from one end to the other and did so regardless of whether the amount of reward was increased at one end, or even removed. Thus, we could examine the effects of reward manipulation against a relatively constant behavioral background. In this classic design, in which forward and reverse replay were first reported, we hoped to uncover differences in the response of these two types of replay to increases or decreases in reward. To test the effect of changing reward magnitude on SWRs and replay, we performed two experiments in which rats encountered varying reward while running on a linear track task (Figure 1A). The experimental approach was similar for the two experiments, with the difference that Experiment One tested the effect of increased reward and Experiment Two tested the effect of decreased reward. During each day of recording, rats were exposed to the same linear track in three successive epochs, during each of which rats completed 15–20 running laps (out and back) for liquid chocolate reward available at each end of the track. However, during epoch 2, the amount of reward available on each lap was changed at one end of the track only: in Experiment One, the rewarded was 4× larger, while in Experiment Two, no reward was provided. Thus, epochs 1 and 3 tested baseline activity with equal reward available at both track ends, while epoch 2 tested the effect of a change in reward magnitude at one end of the track. Running performance was relatively impervious to the manipulation of reward, with some differences in running speed for Experiment Two, but not for Experiment One (Figure S1). We tested five rats on both experiments for a total of seven sessions of Experiment One and eight sessions of Experiment Two. In order to characterize the effect of reward changes on SWR events and on replay, we implanted rats with 40-tetrode microdrives targeting the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and single unit and LFP data were recorded concurrently. 120 ± 10 simultaneously recorded units were isolated per run (Table S1). For each unit, we determined its place field on the track, and using Bayesian decoding methods on a coarse timescale (200 ms), we were able to make very accurate estimates of the rat’s actual position during running behavior (Figure 1B; Table S1). Then, during stopping periods at the track ends, we identified SWRs as peaks in ripple power (150–250 Hz) in the LFP, and we applied Bayesian decoding on a fine timescale (10 ms; see Experimental Procedures) to measure trajectory replay. On average, 15%–20% of SWRs were determined to contain significant trajectory replay (Figure 1C; Table S1). In the increased reward experiment (Experiment One), SWR occurrence began to peak within seconds of the rat’s arrival at the reward well area before tapering off for the duration of the stopping period (Figure 2A). In the equal reward epochs, the numbers of SWRs appeared similar at both ends of the track; however, in the unequal reward epoch, there appeared to be many more SWRs at the increased reward end. Although the rats stopped for significantly longer at the 4× reward than at the 1× reward (20.3 ± 2.8 s and 8.1 ± 1.3 s, respectively, p = 0.031, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), the increase in SWR number was not simply due to a greater amount of time stopped, but reflected an overall increase in the rate of SWRs (Figure 2B). Similarly to SWRs, the rate of replays increased at the increased reward end of the track (Figures 2D and 2E). To quantify these changes, we fit a Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate the rate of events, defined as the number of events per second, at both ends of the track and under the two reward conditions (see Experimental Procedures). The difference in SWR rate between ends of the track was much greater in the unequal reward condition (4× versus 1× reward) than when equal reward was present at both ends (Figure 2C, z = 5.24, p = 1.61 × 10−7; Table S2). Similarly, the difference in replay rate between ends of the track was greater in the unequal reward condition (Figure 2F, z = 3.45, p = 5.67 × 10−4; Table S2). Thus, both SWR rate and replay rate reflected the increase in reward during epoch 2. Interestingly, the difference in both SWR and replay rate between ends of track in the unequal reward condition was due to both an increase in rate at the changed end and a decrease in rate at the unchanged end (Figure S4A, black squares, SWRs/s; black circles, replays/s). This suggests that the rate of events adaptively coded relative reward magnitude rather than absolute reward. The simultaneous increase and decrease in rates at the increased and unchanged reward ends, respectively, meant that the overall rates of SWRs and replays were not sensitive to the increase in reward associated with epoch 2 (Figures S2A and S2B). Although we observed reward-related changes in bi-directional replay rate, the contribution of forward and reverse replay remained unclear. We therefore classified the previously identified replays by their directionality by calculating directional place fields for all units. Although some units had similar fields in both directions, the spatial representation of “up” and “down” heading trajectories were easily distinguishable (Figure 3A). Directional decoding accuracy was comparable to bi-directional decoding (Table S1). The original replays were re-decoded using directional place fields resulting in a posterior probability containing information on both position on track and heading direction (Figure 3B). Based on our criterion, 79% (581/738 replays in Experiment One) and 77% (314/409 replays in Experiment Two) of replays were classified as forward or reverse, and the remaining 21% (157/738) and 23% (95/409) were omitted from further analysis. Thus, forward and reverse replays were non-overlapping subsets of the total replays, which occurred concurrently during the experiment. Critically, in order to evaluate the rate of forward and reverse replay, it was necessary to observe both kinds of replay during the same stopping periods and independently of specific behaviors. It was previously reported on the linear track task that reverse replays occurred preferentially while rats faced away from the track at the end of the run and forward replays occurred preferentially after rats had turned around prior to running the next lap (Diba and Buzsáki, 2007Diba K. Buzsáki G. Forward and reverse hippocampal place-cell sequences during ripples.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1241-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, in neither orientation was the relationship exclusive. We analyzed times when the rat was at the well location, defined as a 10 cm radius around the well (Singer and Frank, 2009Singer A.C. Frank L.M. Rewarded outcomes enhance reactivation of experience in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2009; 64: 910-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), during which time the rat’s head direction was facing the well or within 90° to the left or right for 83% ± 1% of the time (mean ± SEM). In our data, replays occurred in an interspersed manner relative to the beginning of each stopping period and to the beginning of each lap (Figure S3). Unlike Diba and Buzsáki, we did not observe a tendency of forward replays to occur in greater frequency before the next lap. We found no difference between forward and reverse replays in either the first or second half of the stopping periods (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, first half/after lap: p = 0.56, second half/before lap: p = 0.59). Therefore, forward and reverse replay could be compared in our experiments independently during the same behavior. Forward replay rate was not affected by reward condition (Figure 3E, z = 0.305, p = 0.76; Table S2). The rate of forward replays was very similar on both ends of the track regardless of reward magnitude (Figures 3C and 3D). Reverse replays, on the other hand, showed a robust response to increased reward (Figure 3F). The difference between ends in the unequal reward condition was significantly greater than in the equal reward condition (Figures 3G and 3H, z = 3.57, p = 3.60 × 10−4; Table S2). These data suggested that reverse replays are sensitive to the magnitude of reward, while forward replays are not. Further, reverse replay rates decreased at the unchanged end in epoch 2, thus matching the relative reward effect observed in replays and SWRs (Figure S4A, green circles; Figure S2D). This adaptive coding was not evident in the rate of forward replay (Figure S4A, purple circles; Figure S2C). As in previous studies, the majority of forward and reverse replays were locally initiated, that is, the replayed trajectory began at the rat’s actual location (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J. Hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths to remembered goals.Nature. 2013; 497: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Local replays comprised 86% of all replays (497/581) in Experiment One and 78% of all replays (246/314) in Experiment Two. Our results held when considering only locally initiated forward and reverse replays (Figure S5; Table S2). Remote replays were too infrequent for conclusive analysis, averaging less than five forward or reverse replays per run. In Experiment Two, reward was removed at one end of the track to test the effect of a decrease in reward magnitude on replay. SWRs were dramatically decreased in the absence of reward (Figures 4A and 4B ), and the difference between reward conditions was significant (Figure 4C, z = −6.66, p = 2.67 × 10−11). Replays followed a similar pattern to SWRs (Figures 4D and 4E), with a significant difference between reward conditions (Figure 4F, z = −3.16, p = 0.0016; Table S3). An important caveat in this experiment is that removal of reward elicited a shift in the rats’ behavior. Instead of stopping to eat, the rats paused to scan and sniff the reward area for the missing reward. Overall, the rats spent less time stopped on the unrewarded end of the track (3.3 ± 0.5 s versus 8.5 ± 1.3 s at the rewarded end, p = 0.0078, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), although they continued to enter the unrewarded well area as required by the task. Due to these behavioral changes, very few forward and reverse replays occurred at the changed end in epoch 2 (Figures 5A and 5D ). Nevertheless, our comparison of reward conditions, which is sensitive to the relative difference between track ends, again revealed a divergence between forward and reverse replay. There was no significant difference between reward conditions for forward replays (Figures 5B and 5C, z = −1.83, p = 0.068; Table S3), while there was a significant difference in reverse replays (Figures 5E and 5F, z = −2.05, p = 0.041; Table S3). These results were replicated by analysis of local replays only (Figure S6; Table S3). Thus, the sensitivity of replay to the relative rather than absolute magnitude of reward revealed an effect of reward removal on reverse replay driven principally by increases in the rate of replay at the opposite end of the track, at which reward magnitude had not been changed, but for which the reward magnitude was now relatively greater (Figure S4). The relative reward effect results in stable overall rates of SWRs and replays across epochs (Figure S2). While we have demonstrated through independent analyses that forward and reverse replay respond differently to reward changes, a direct comparison of forward and reverse replay in each condition would allow us to establish whether or not the two types of replay diverge under varying reward. We therefore fit a Poisson GLM to estimate replay rate based on three variables: epoch, end of track, and replay directionality. This more complex design is a more rigorous test of the data, with its implicit correction for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, statistically significant differences between forward and reverse replay were observed in three conditions (Figure 6; Table S4). The weakest effect was an unexpected difference on one end of the track during epoch 1 of Experiment Two (Figure 6B, right). This track end did not correspond to a fixed physical location since location was randomized between sessions, but it may have corresponded to a predictive relationship between the end where the animal was initially placed at the beginning of epoch 1 and the end chosen to be manipulated in epoch 2. While both initial placement end and manipulated end were randomized between sessions, the pairing of the two variables was biased in Experiment Two, but not in Experiment One, matching the result. Thus, the unchanged reward end in Experiment Two frequently corresponded to the location where the rat encountered the first reward of the experiment session and was located opposite to the end where he was set down after a potentially stressful experience of being transferred on to the track. It is important to note that absolute levels of forward or reverse replay are difficult to relate to absolute reward levels because of behavioral biases and because of the more general issue that animals may find places rewarding for a number of reasons in addition to the location of specific reward introduced by the experimenter. In contrast to these baseline effects, the experimental manipulation of reward magnitude during each experimental day was hypothesized to have specific effects on the ratio of forward and reverse replay, and these account for the two stronger effects identified by the model. First, the rate of reverse replays was significantly greater than the rate of forward replays at the site of increased reward in epoch 2 of Experiment One (Figure 6A, z = 4.30, p = 0.0001). Second, the rate of reverse replays was significantly greater than the rate of forward replays at the site of decreased reward, not on epoch 2 but on epoch 3, when the baseline reward level was reinstated (Figure 6B, z = 3.35, p = 0.0049). Interestingly, the reward level in this epoch was the same at both ends of the track, but the change in reward from epoch 2 to epoch 3 corresponded to a large increase in reward, which may have accounted for the divergence between reverse and forward replay. Thus, this analysis identified a second form of relative response, sensitive to the change of reward magnitude with time. We hypothesized that forward and reverse replays across both ends of the track might reflect not only the magnitude of reward present, but relative changes in reward with time. Both experiments have an increasing phase and a decreasing phase (Figure 7A). We sought to determine whether the phases were related. We again used the three variable Poisson GLM, but instead of identifying significant effects, we considered the coefficients associated with different comparisons and asked whether, across the two experiments, those comparisons associated with relative reward increases produced similar coefficients. Thus, for each experiment, there were 12 coefficients describing changes in replay rate for the increasing and decreasing reward phases, which were adjusted for multiple comparisons. All 12 coefficients were plotted on a grid where each square represents the normalized change in replay rate from the condition on the x coordinate to the condition on the y coordinate (Figures 7B and 7D). In order to test the similarity of the two experiments’ increasing and decreasing phases, we identified hypothesized correspondences between the two experiments. For example, the coefficient describing the increase in reward from epoch 1 to epoch 2 at the changed end in Experiment One corresponded to the coefficient describing the increase in reward from epoch 2 to epoch 3 at the changed end in Experiment Two. All the other comparisons reflected similar hypothesized correspondences. Given the vector of coefficients for each experiment, aligned to reflect the hypothesized correspondences, we calculated the sum of squared differences (SSDs) between all corresponding coefficients. This value was then used as a test statistic. We performed a bootstrap analysis in which the 12 coefficients were randomly shuffled 10,000 times, generating a null distribution of the SSDs. The SSDs between the increasing phases were compared to the null distribution and were found to be smaller (i.e., coefficients were more related) than 99.5% of the shuffled data (one-sided test, p = 0.005, Figure 7C). The SSDs between the decreasing phases did not reach significance (Figure 7E, one-sided test, p = 0.107), in line with the general difficulty noted above of identifying robust decreases in replay rate as opposed to increases. Nevertheless, we report a robust effect of similar responses to relative increases in reward across both experiments. In a complementary analysis, we calculated the significance of the SSDs between opposite decreasing and increasing phases (Figure S7). As all of these phases changed in opposite directions, we expected that these coefficients might be less related than chance. This would result in SSDs, which are significantly greater than the mean of the null distribution. Indeed, for all four phase pairs, the SSDs were larger than the majority of the null distribution test statistics, and the difference between the decreasing phase of Experiment One and the increasing phase of Experiment Two reached significance (one-sided test, Figure S7D). Thus, we found that reward changes of the same valence are similarly coded by forward and reverse replays, while the encoding of opposite valence changes appear to be anti-correlated regardless of the absolute reward magnitudes involved. We observed a striking difference between forward and reverse replay response to reward. Rates of reverse replay increased in response to increased reward and decreased in response to decreased reward, while forward replays were unaffected. Moreover, reverse replays reflected relative reward amounts within an epoch, or the reward structure of the environment, as well as changes to reward between successive epochs. In Experiment One, the increase in reverse replay rate at the 4× reward end of the track was accompanied by a decrease on the opposite end of the track, and reverse replays were significantly more abundant than forward at the increased reward (Figures 3 and 6). Even though the rats did not spend much time at the unrewarded location in epoch 2, we were still able to observe an increase in reverse (and not forward) replay rate with the restoration of reward at the changed reward end in epoch 3 (Figures 6 and S4). Overall, we found a consistent pattern of rate changes across both experiments that reflected effects of both relative magnitude between track ends and change over time for a given track end across multiple instances (analysis of Figure 7). Our results relate to several earlier studies. Diba and Buzsáki first reported that both forward and reverse replays occurred during stopping periods in a linear track-running task (Diba and Buzsáki, 2007Diba K. Buzsáki G. Forward and reverse hippocampal place-cell sequences during ripples.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1241-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). They reported a tendency for reverse replays to occur while the animal was consuming reward with his back to the track, while forward replays were more common close to the onset of a new lap, presumably when the animal faced toward the center of the track. Mindful of this, we restricted our analysis to times when the rat’s head was within a 10 cm radius of the food well, which corresponded to the rat facing in the direction of the reward well over 80% of the time. Thus, most of the detected replays occurred while the rat was facing toward the well in the consistent behavioral state of eating or preparin"
https://openalex.org/W2516799295,"The meaning we derive from our experiences is not a simple static extraction of the elements but is largely based on the order in which those elements occur. Models propose that sequence encoding is supported by interactions between high- and low-frequency oscillations, such that elements within an experience are represented by neural cell assemblies firing at higher frequencies (gamma) and sequential order is encoded by the specific timing of firing with respect to a lower frequency oscillation (theta). During episodic sequence memory formation in humans, we provide evidence that items in different sequence positions exhibit greater gamma power along distinct phases of a theta oscillation. Furthermore, this segregation is related to successful temporal order memory. Our results provide compelling evidence that memory for order, a core component of an episodic memory, capitalizes on the ubiquitous physiological mechanism of theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2511823098,"Primary sensory neurons in the DRG play an essential role in initiating pain by detecting painful stimuli in the periphery. Tissue injury can sensitize DRG neurons, causing heightened pain sensitivity, often leading to chronic pain. Despite the functional importance, how DRG neurons function at a population level is unclear due to the lack of suitable tools. Here we developed an imaging technique that allowed us to simultaneously monitor the activities of >1,600 neurons/DRG in live mice and discovered a striking neuronal coupling phenomenon that adjacent neurons tend to activate together following tissue injury. This coupled activation occurs among various neurons and is mediated by an injury-induced upregulation of gap junctions in glial cells surrounding DRG neurons.

Parsing epileptic events using a Markov switching process model for correlated time series.in: Lawrence N. Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning. International Machine Learning Society, 2013: 1-15Google Scholar). The mechanisms that drive seizures through network states can inform neural control paradigms that aim to stop or contain propagation of seizure activity. Such a capability is vital clinically because epileptogenic regions cause symptoms not only through their own dysfunction, but also through their ability to recruit and disrupt healthy brain tissue (Kutsy et al., 1999Kutsy R.L.

Understanding and translating network mechanisms of seizure evolution to identify targets for therapy requires further intellectual dissection of functional epileptic network architecture. Conventional thinking divides epileptic brain into clinically defined regions where seizures presumably originate (Rosenow and Lüders, 2001Rosenow F. Lüders H. Presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.Brain. 2001; 124: 1683-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and surrounding regions in which seizures do not originate. Recent models describe connectivity between seizure-onset and surrounding brain regions in the framework of a broader, dysfunctional “epileptic network,” where network nodes are neural populations measured by intracranial sensors and network connections are statistical relationships between neural activation patterns (Burns et al., 2014Burns S.P.

In the extreme case, these seizures can generalize and eventually encompass the entire brain. Given the distributed nature of epileptic activity, it is critical to isolate underlying propagation mechanisms. Leading hypotheses suggest that either (1) seizure evolution is driven by strong, synchronizing activity from the seizure-generating network impinging outward on the surrounding tissue (Jiruska et al., 2013Jiruska P. de Curtis M.

Evolving functional network properties and synchronizability during human epileptic seizures.Chaos. 2008; 18: 033119Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or (2) seizure evolution is caused by a diminished ability of the surrounding tissue to regulate, or contain, abnormal activity (Bower et al., 2012Bower M.R. Stead M. Meyer F.B. Marsh W.R. Worrell G.A. Spatiotemporal neuronal correlates of seizure generation in focal epilepsy.Epilepsia. 2012; 53: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Nair et al., 2004Nair D.R. Mohamed A. Burgess R. Lüders H. A critical review of the different conceptual hypotheses framing human focal epilepsy.Epileptic Disord. 2004; 6: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). While little evidence exists to determine which of these hypotheses accurately reflect seizure dynamics, both mechanisms can be succinctly summarized as abnormalities of synchronizability, a description of how easily neural processes, such as rhythmic activity, can diffuse through a network. Fundamental work has demonstrated that the distance over which neural populations can synchronize is dependent upon the dominant rhythmic frequency of neural oscillations (Kopell et al., 2000Kopell N. Ermentrout G.B. Whittington M.A. Traub R.D. Gamma rhythms and beta rhythms have different synchronization properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 1867-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Gamma-band (30–70 Hz) activity tends to synchronize neural populations over shorter distances, while beta-band activity (12–29 Hz) tends to synchronize neural populations over longer distances. However, a direct relationship between frequency-dependent neural activity and the synchronization dynamics of seizure propagation has not been explored and may highlight critical mechanisms of how seizures spread. Theoretical work in the fields of physics and engineering demonstrates that diffusion of dynamics through the network can be regulated through a “push-pull control” mechanism, where desynchronizing and synchronizing nodes operate antagonistically in a “tug of war.” When synchronizing nodes exert greater push than desynchronizing nodes, synchronizability increases and dynamic processes may diffuse through the network more easily (He et al., 2014He Z. Wang X. Zhang G.-Y. Zhan M. Control for a synchronization-desynchronization switch.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2014; 90: 012909Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Such mechanisms are particularly successful in heterogeneous networks like the brain, where some regions are sparsely connected and other regions are densely connected (Wang and Chen, 2002Wang X.F. Chen G. Synchronization in scale-free dynamical networks: robustness and fragility.IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. I Fundam. Theory Appl. 2002; 49: 54-62Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Does the brain utilize such a control mechanism for seizure regulation? And, if so, what regions of the brain affect this control? To address these questions, we present a novel method we call “virtual cortical resection,” which offers a statistically robust means to pinpoint putative control regions in the epileptic network that may regulate seizure dynamics, based on the network’s response to simulated lesioning. Importantly, while other groups have studied the effects of removing structural brain regions and connections (also called virtual lesioning or virtual dissection) on dynamics of simulated neural processes (Alstott et al., 2009Alstott J. Breakspear M. Hagmann P. Cammoun L. Sporns O. Modeling the impact of lesions in the human brain.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000408Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Honey and Sporns, 2008Honey C.J. Sporns O. Dynamical consequences of lesions in cortical networks.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2008; 29: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and on probabilistic tractography (Rafal et al., 2015Rafal R.D. Koller K. Bultitude J.H. Mullins P. Ward R. Mitchell A.S. Bell A.H. Connectivity between the superior colliculus and the amygdala in humans and macaque monkeys: virtual dissection with probabilistic DTI tractography.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), our virtual cortical resection approach uniquely applies node removal to functional brain regions to uncover network control regions that regulate network properties of synchronization. We use this method to test the hypothesis that the epileptic network contains a native regulatory system (Figure 1C) whose connectivity to the seizure-generating area accounts for differential seizure dynamics, including (1) the constrained dynamics observed in partial seizures that remain focal (Figure 1D) and (2) the unconstrained dynamics observed in partial seizures that generalize to surrounding tissue (Figure 1E). More specifically, using electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded from ten patients diagnosed with drug-resistant neocortical epilepsy undergoing routine pre-surgical evaluation, we constructed time-evolving functional networks across “events,” each of which included a seizure epoch preceded by a pre-seizure epoch. The seizure epoch spanned the period between the clinically marked earliest electrographic change (Litt et al., 2001Litt B. Esteller R. Echauz J. D’Alessandro M. Shor R. Henry T. Pennell P. Epstein C. Bakay R. Dichter M. Vachtsevanos G. Epileptic seizures may begin hours in advance of clinical onset: a report of five patients.Neuron. 2001; 30: 51-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and seizure termination, while the pre-seizure epoch was identical in duration to the seizure and ended immediately prior to the earliest electrographic change. In each epoch, we divided the ECoG signal into 1 s non-overlapping time windows and estimated functional connectivity in α/θ (5–15 Hz), β (15–25 Hz), low-γ (30–40 Hz), and high-γ (95–105 Hz) frequency bands using multitaper coherence estimation (see Experimental Procedures). We implemented virtual cortical resection on this dynamic epileptic network by independently removing electrode sites from the network model. This was done to assess the synchronizability of (1) the distributed epileptic network in partial seizures that generalize to surrounding tissue versus (2) the focal epileptic network in seizures that do not generalize to surrounding tissue. By removing electrode sites from the network model, we were able to probe the importance of brain regions, in their presence and absence, to seizure generation and propagation. We first asked the question, how easily do seizures diffuse through the distributed or focal network? We hypothesized that seizure spread, the dynamical process whereby neural activity becomes increasingly synchronous, is facilitated by network topology. To relate network dynamics and network topology, we estimated the time-varying Laplacian matrix L(t), whose entries lij(t) quantify how easily information can diffuse between nodes i and j, from the time-varying functional connectivity matrix (see Experimental Procedures). Using the time-varying Laplacian matrix, we computed synchronizability, a dynamic network property that quantifies how easily neural activity, in our case seizures, can synchronize, or diffuse through, the network. Synchronizability measures the spread of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix through the ratio s(t)=λ2/λmax, where λ2 and λmax are the second smallest eigenvalue and the largest eigenvalue, respectively, of L(t) (see Barahona and Pecora, 2002Barahona M. Pecora L.M. Synchronization in small-world systems.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 89: 054101Crossref Scopus (1364) Google Scholar; Supplemental Information). Intuitively, greater network synchronizability results from a smaller spread between eigenvalues, which is caused by increases in the second smallest eigenvalue or decreases in the largest eigenvalue, and implies greater ease for neural populations to synchronize their dynamics, such as during seizures. We observed significantly greater synchronizability in the distributed network than in the focal network during the pre-seizure epoch, suggesting that high-γ networks have a greater potential to synchronize prior to seizures that spread than prior to seizures that do not spread (Figure 2A). In contrast, we observed that synchronizability in low-γ and β networks effectively captured spread through the distributed network after seizure onset (see Supplemental Information; Figure S1). We observed no differences in synchronizability between the focal and distributed networks before or during seizures in the α/θ band. For the remainder of our main analysis, we focus on high-γ networks because of their tendency to differentiate seizure spread before the seizure begins. Next, based on theoretical work in physics and engineering, we asked whether network synchronizability, or predisposition to seizure spread, might be explained by heterogeneity in network topology. That is, does heterogeneity in node strength weaken the network’s ability to synchronize? We expected that the distribution of node strengths would either widen or narrow the gap between the largest and second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and, consequently, decrease or increase the network synchronizability. To measure heterogeneity, we computed a log-scaled measure of node strength dispersion d(t) based on the standard deviation of node strengths in each time window t (see Experimental Procedures). More heterogeneous network topologies would incur greater node strength dispersion, suggesting that nodes might either be highly connected or highly isolated (whereas lower node strength dispersion suggests that nodes are more evenly connected in the network). Our results demonstrated a significant linear relationship between synchronizability and node strength dispersion (Pearson correlation coefficient; r=−0.964, p<10−16), where greater heterogeneity in node strength led to lower synchronizability (Figure 2B). More generally, our results suggest that seizure spread in the distributed network may result from a vulnerability to synchronize easily, a vulnerability that is not present in partial seizures that do not generalize to surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the heightened synchronizability of the distributed network may be driven by homogeneous distributions of connectivity among network nodes. Following our analysis demonstrating that synchronizability is related to the dispersion of node strengths (network topology), we asked, is synchronizability sensitive to the specific pattern of connections between nodes (network geometry)? That is, how might network geometry regulate synchronizability? Do a subset of nodes act as key controllers, or do all nodes contribute equally? To answer this question, we developed a novel method to assess the influence of a node on synchronizability. We define the “control centrality” ci of node i to be the fractional change in synchronizability following removal of node i from the network (Figure 3A): ci=(si−s)/s, where s is the original synchronizability and si is the synchronizability after node removal (see Experimental Procedures). The magnitude of ci can be interpreted as the overall strength of the node as a controller of synchronizability. If ci is positive, then synchronizability increases upon node removal, and the node is said to be a desynchronizing node. If ci is negative, then synchronizability decreases upon node removal, and the node is said to be a synchronizing node. As illustrated in Figure 3A, both desynchronizing and synchronizing network controllers are characteristic of heterogeneous networks. We expected that independently removing nodes from the network would affect node strength dispersion non-trivially, as node removal affects the overall distribution of node strengths in the network (see Supplemental Information). We observed a low correlation between control centrality and node strength (Pearson correlation coefficient; r=0.221,p<10−16), suggesting control centrality is sensitive to the network geometry, or the specific relationships between nodes rather than just the strength of a node (see Supplemental Information; Figure S2). We used control centrality to assess the presence of desynchronizing and synchronizing controllers in the epileptic network and to define their putative role in regulating synchronizability, a hallmark of seizure spread. To identify groups of statistically significant desynchronizing and synchronizing controllers in the network, we generated a null distribution of control centrality by randomly permuting connections between network nodes 100 times for each time window of the time-varying functional network and re-computing control centrality on each permuted network. Network nodes whose mean control centrality over the pre-seizure or seizure epoch was greater than 97.5% (or less than 2.5%) of the mean null control centrality values were considered desynchronizing (or synchronizing) nodes. Nodes with mean control centrality within the null distribution were considered bulk nodes. We identified desynchronizing and synchronizing brain regions, independently, for each focal and distributed functional network (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3). Next, we used the node controller type and magnitude control centrality to ask, how are synchronizing and desynchronizing regions distributed in the epileptic network? Furthermore, can the spatial and temporal distributions of control nodes differentially explain seizure spread? First, we tested whether the control centrality of synchronizing and desynchronizing regions differentiate focal and distributed seizures in high-γ functional networks. During pre-seizure epochs, we observed that: (1) desynchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than desynchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.86,p=4.18 × 10−3), (2) bulk regions exhibited similar magnitude control centrality between the focal and distributed networks (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=0.52,p=0.60), and (3) synchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than synchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.00,p=4.54 × 10−2) (Figure 4A). Similarly, during seizure epochs, we observed that: (1) desynchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than desynchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.97, p=3.00 × 10−3), (2) bulk regions exhibited similar magnitude control centrality between focal and distributed networks (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=0.517, p=0.60), and (3) synchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than synchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.10, p=3.53 × 10−2). These findings suggest that both desynchronizing and synchronizing controllers are stronger in the focal network than the distributed network. Moreover, the differential effect of synchronizing controllers on magnitude control centrality between seizure types increased during the transition from pre-seizure to seizure epochs. Next, we explored regional control of seizure spread in high-γ functional networks. To assign network regions, a team of neurologists successfully identified the sensors on the SOZ based on visual inspection of the intracranial recordings. Sensors within the SOZ were grouped as the seizure-onset region, while sensors outside the SOZ were labeled as the surrounding region. First, we compared magnitude control centrality of nodes within the seizure-onset region (Figure 5). Both before and during the seizure, we observed no significant difference in magnitude control centrality of synchronizing, desynchronizing, or bulk node types within the SOZ between the focal and distributed networks. Next, we compared magnitude control centrality of nodes outside the seizure-onset region. During pre-seizure epochs, we observed that: (1) desynchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited a greater magnitude control centrality than desynchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.72, p=6.42 × 10−3), (2) bulk regions exhibited similar magnitude control centrality between the focal and distributed networks (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=0.52, p=0.60), and (3) synchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than synchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.00, p=4.54 × 10−2). Similarly, during seizure epochs, we observed that: (1) desynchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than desynchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=3.07, p=2.13 × 10−3), (2) bulk regions exhibited similar magnitude control centrality between the focal and distributed networks (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=4.83, p=0.63), and (3) synchronizing regions of the focal network exhibited greater magnitude control centrality than the synchronizing regions of the distributed network (Wilcoxon rank-sum; z=2.59, p=9.67 × 10−3). These findings suggest that the focal and distributed networks are most differentiated in the magnitude"

Lichman B. et al.Identification of adult nephron progenitors capable of kidney regeneration in zebrafish.Nature. 2011; 470: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), mammalian NPCs are transient amplifying cells during development (Nishinakamura, 2016Nishinakamura R.

Nephrol. 2016; 12: 67-68Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and are not yet identified in the adult. Thus, alternative strategies to treat kidney failure are urgently needed, and one approach that holds great promise is the derivation of authentic nephron progenitor cell lines in vitro with intact generative capacity. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offer an attractive source toward the generation of NPCs. Recent studies have generated NPC-like cells from PSCs fulfilling several molecular and functional criteria such as NPC-specific marker gene expression and in vitro differentiation abilities (Araoka et al., 2014Araoka T.

Med. 2015; 4: 980-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, similar to embryogenesis, PSC differentiation only transiently passes through a nephron progenitor stage, and NPC-like cells do not persist long-term after the induction of nephron formation (Little, 2016Little M.H. Growing kidney tissue from stem cells: how far from “party trick” to medical application?.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, development of culture conditions promoting long-term self-renewal of NPCs is warranted. Kidney development has been extensively studied in mice, and various niche signals for the proper specification, proliferation, and differentiation of murine nephron progenitors have been identified (Costantini and Kopan, 2010Costantini F.

Mammalian kidney development: principles, progress, and projections.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a008300Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This accumulated knowledge has greatly facilitated efforts in extending the lifespan of primary murine NPCs in culture. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)7 and FGF2 could maintain NPCs for 2–4 days in a monolayer culture (Dudley et al., 1999Dudley A.T. Godin R.E. Robertson E.J. Interaction between FGF and BMP signaling pathways regulates development of metanephric mesenchyme.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Similarly, BMP7 together with FGF9/20 and heparin was able to maintain Six2+ NPCs for 5 days without losing nephrogenic potential (Barak et al., 2012Barak H. Huh S.H. Chen S. Jeanpierre C. Martinovic J. Parisot M. Bole-Feysot C. Nitschké P. Salomon R. Antignac C. et al.FGF9 and FGF20 maintain the stemness of nephron progenitors in mice and man.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 1191-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, further improvements significantly prolonged the survival of NPCs in culture: Brown et al. developed the nephron progenitor expansion medium (NPEM) that allowed for the in vitro expansion of murine NPCs up to ten passages (Brown et al., 2015Brown A.C. Muthukrishnan S.D. Oxburgh L. A synthetic niche for nephron progenitor cells.Dev. Cell. 2015; 34: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and Tanigawa et al. could culture mouse or rat NPCs for five passages using a different protocol (Tanigawa and Perantoni, 2016Tanigawa S. Perantoni A.O. Modeling renal progenitors: defining the niche.Differentiation. 2016; 91: 152-158Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Tanigawa et al., 2015Tanigawa S. Sharma N.

While these results have greatly advanced the field, there are still several notable limitations: (1) NPCs expanded in NPEM were unable to differentiate to glomeruli; (2) NPCs generated by both protocols suffered from molecular and functional heterogeneity and limited self-renewal in vitro; and (3) it remains unknown whether the cultured NPCs still retain an intact in vivo nephrogenic potential found in primary NPCs. With regard to humans, Brown et al. reported that human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived NPCs could be maintained in NPEM for no more than two passages and cultured human nephron progenitor cells (hNPCs) only gave rise to renal tubules, but not glomeruli, upon the second passage (Brown et al., 2015Brown A.C. Muthukrishnan S.D. Oxburgh L. A synthetic niche for nephron progenitor cells.Dev. Cell. 2015; 34: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Likewise, limited expansion (8 days) of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs was reported by Tanigawa et al. Thus, culture conditions for long-term self-renewal of NPCs have yet to be achieved (Tanigawa et al., 2016Tanigawa S. Taguchi A. Sharma N. Perantoni A.O. Nishinakamura R. Selective in vitro propagation of nephron progenitors derived from embryos and pluripotent stem cells.Cell Rep. 2016; (Published online April 13, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.1003.1076Crossref Google Scholar). Here, we describe a robust 3D culture system that enables the stable long-term in vitro propagation of functional murine and human nephron progenitors. Long-term cultured NPCs can be harnessed for rapid and efficient generation of nephron organoids, thereby providing an accessible system for modeling kidney development, renal toxicity testing, gene editing, and disease modeling (summarized in Tables S1 and S2). Lineage tracing experiments established Six2 as a specific NPC marker (Kobayashi et al., 2008Kobayashi A. Valerius M.T. Mugford J.W. Carroll T.J. Self M. Oliver G. McMahon A.P. Six2 defines and regulates a multipotent self-renewing nephron progenitor population throughout mammalian kidney development.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, Self et al., 2006Self M. Lagutin O.V. Bowling B. Hendrix J. Cai Y. Dressler G.R. Oliver G. Six2 is required for suppression of nephrogenesis and progenitor renewal in the developing kidney.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5214-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used an available mouse strain with a GFP cassette knocked in at the Six2 locus (Six2tm3(EGFP/cre/ERT2)Amc, Six2GCE for short hereafter) to facilitate purification of Six2-GFP+ NPCs from fetal or neonatal mouse kidneys by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and screened for conditions conducive to in vitro expansion of NPCs. We initially focused on isolated Six2-GFP+ cells from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) Six2GCE mice. Since in vivo NPCs are tightly packed together, we reasoned that cell-cell contact could play an important role in NPC survival and proliferation. Thus, to better preserve the native microenvironment, we cultured sorted Six2-GFP+ NPCs in 3D aggregates. Based on previous studies (Barak et al., 2012Barak H. Huh S.H. Chen S. Jeanpierre C. Martinovic J. Parisot M. Bole-Feysot C. Nitschké P. Salomon R. Antignac C. et al.FGF9 and FGF20 maintain the stemness of nephron progenitors in mice and man.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 1191-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Dudley et al., 1999Dudley A.T. Godin R.E. Robertson E.J. Interaction between FGF and BMP signaling pathways regulates development of metanephric mesenchyme.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we tested the combination of BMP7, FGF9 (or FGF2), heparin, and Y27631 (BFHY) for culturing Six2-GFP+ cells in a 3D format. Interestingly, in BFHY medium, we observed robust proliferation of Six2-GFP+ NPCs cultured as aggregates for up to 7 days, after which the GFP signal dramatically decreased. Based on the BFHY/3D culture, next we sought to identify condition to support long-term NPC self-renewal in vitro by screening additional growth factors and chemical inhibitors (Table S3). Cell viability, growth rate, and GFP signal were used among other criteria. Through successive testing, we established a culture condition containing a cocktail of BMP7, FGF2, heparin, Y27632, LIF, and CHIR99021 that supports long-term in vitro expansion of Six2-GFP+ NPCs with high purity (we designated this culture medium as NPC self-renewal [NPSR] medium) (Figure 1A). Of note is that, to date, isolated Six2-GFP+ NPCs have been propagated in NPSR/3D culture for more than 17 months and 110 passages. NPCs grow fast as aggregates in NPSR medium. Starting with 3,000 cells, after 4–5 days, the aggregate can grow to ∼1 mm in diameter containing ∼100,000 cells (Figures 1B and 1C). Additionally, this growth rate was stably maintained after long-term passages with a consistent five or six doublings per passage (Figure 1D). Importantly, even after 60 passages, we found that 98.44% of cultured NPCs were still GFP+, with the GFP signal intensities similar to that of freshly isolated primary NPCs (Figure 1E). Moreover, we obtained similar results when the expressions of SIX2 and other NPC markers were quantified by immunostaining (SIX2+, ∼96.2%; SALL1+, ∼99.1%; and CITED1+, ∼96.1%) (Figures 1F and 1G). These results show that highly pure NPCs with homogenous expression of NPC marker genes can be stably maintained in our NPSR/3D culture conditions. The expression of TWIST and VIMENTIN, but not E-CADHERIN (CDH1), in cultured NPCs further confirmed their mesenchymal identity (Figure 1H). By using the NPSR/3D culture system, we next tested the derivation of NPC lines from other developmental stages, including E11.5, E16.5, and postnatal day 1 (P1). Stable NPC lines could be easily derived from Six2-GFP+ cells isolated from all stages examined with a 100% success rate (Figure 1I). Similarly to E13.5-NPC lines, all E11.5-, E16.5-, and P1-derived NPC lines showed highly homogeneous GFP signal and NPC marker gene expression (Figures S1A and S1B). Subsequently, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of cultured NPCs and their in vivo counterparts from different developmental stages. Six2-GFP− and Six2-GFP+ cells sorted from E12.5 Six2GCE mouse kidneys were used as controls. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq data identified 1,218 differentially expressed genes between Six2-GFP− and Six2-GFP+ cells and were subsequently used as NPC signature genes for further analysis (Table S4). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the NPC signature genes revealed that primary NPCs are separated into two discrete groups according to their developmental stages: E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5 were clustered together, indicative of an early NPC identity, while E16.5 and P1 were found in the late NPC group. Interestingly, regardless of timing of derivation or passage number, all cultured NPCs are clustered together in a group much closer to the early NPC group than the late NPC group on both PC1 and PC3 axes (Figures 1J, S1C, and S1D). NPC lines expressed most of the known NPC marker genes (Six2, Cited1, Gdnf, and Hoxa11) and were expressed at levels similar to primary NPCs, while some other markers, including Eya1, Wt1, and Fgf9, showed varied gene expression among NPC lines (Figure S1E). Ureteric bud (UB) and stromal progenitor cell-specific genes were expressed at low levels in all NPC lines examined. Also, the same expression pattern of ITGA8+/PDGFRA−, two surface markers characteristic of primary murine NPCs (Taguchi et al., 2014Taguchi A. Kaku Y. Ohmori T. Sharmin S. Ogawa M. Sasaki H. Nishinakamura R. Redefining the in vivo origin of metanephric nephron progenitors enables generation of complex kidney structures from pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), was also maintained in cultured NPCs (Figure S1E). Of note is that even after 80 passages, the global gene expression pattern of cultured NPCs was still very similar to that of early passage NPC lines, demonstrating the robustness of the NPSR/3D culture system for stable NPC self-renewal in vitro. Karyotyping analysis demonstrated genomic stability in long-term cultured NPCs (Figure S1F). To gain mechanistic insights underlying NPC self-renewal in the NPSR/3D condition, we subtracted each of the six factors (FGF2, heparin, Y27632, LIF, BMP7, and CHIR99021) from the NPSR medium and evaluated the effects on cultured NPCs. We found that all six factors were indispensable for optimal propagation of NPCs in 3D culture. Removal of each component for as short as 4 days resulted in slower cell growth (FGF2, heparin, or Y27632), a decrease in Six2-GFP signal (LIF), or both (BMP7 or CHIR99021) (Figure S1G), and these effects became more pronounced when a longer time point was examined (Figure S1H). Of note is that NPCs cultured without FGF2 exhibited massive cell death after 2 days (Figures S1G and S1H), suggesting FGF2 has pro-survival role for NPSR/3D cultured NPCs. Consistently, global gene expression analysis supported the necessity of all six factors in maintaining self-renewal of cultured NPCs (Figure S1I). To evaluate the nephrogenic potential of cultured NPCs in vitro, we first used spinal cord induction assay and co-cultured E13.5-derived NPCs (P60) with embryonic dorsal spinal cords in an air-liquid interface. We observed many tubular structures formed on day 3; between day 3 and day 7, their number increased (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). On day 7, by immunocytochemistry, we observed positive staining for glomerulus markers podocalyxin (PODXL), synaptopodin (SYNPO), and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2B); proximal tubule markers Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) and aquaporin 1 (AQP1) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C); and Henle’s loop/distal tubule markers E-cadherin (CDH1), distal tubule markers, PAX2, and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) (Figures 2C, 2E, S2D, and S2E), suggesting proper differentiation of cultured NPCs to major segments of nephrons. Moreover, we found numerous PODXL+ glomeruli were adjacent to LTL+ proximal tubules, LTL+ proximal tubules were connected with CDH1+ Henle’s loop/distal tubules, and CDH1+/DBA− Henle’s loop were joined with CDH1+/DBA+ distal tubules (Figures 2C and S2E), indicating a proper glomerulus→proximal tubule→Henle’s loop→distal tubule organization. NPC lines derived from E11.5, E16.5, and P1 kidneys exhibited similar differentiation potential upon spinal cord induction (Figures S2F and S2G). Of note is that even after 100 passages (>15 months and 10139-fold expansion in culture), the nephrogenic potential of NPC lines obtained from different developmental stages was still intact (summarized in Figure 2F). During normal kidney development, reciprocal interactions between UB tips and NPCs underlie kidney morphogenesis. To test if cultured NPCs could interact with UB and commit to nephron formation, we devised a “complementary reaggregation assay.” To this end, we dissociated E11.5 kidneys from Six2GCE mice and depleted the Six2-GFP+ NPCs by FACS. The remaining Six2-GFP− population was mixed with mCherry-labeled NPCs to form aggregates and then transferred to an air-liquid interface to test if nephrogenesis could occur ex vivo (Figure S2H). Six2-GFP− cells reaggregated with primary Six2-GFP+ NPCs, or reaggregated unfractionated E11.5 kidney cells were used as positive controls. As shown in Figure S2I, time-lapse imaging revealed a dynamic nephrogenic process in reaggregates formed by Six2-GFP− cells and mCherry-labeled NPCs, which was indistinguishable from positive controls. In vivo, NPCs form condensed cap structure known as the cap mesenchyme surrounding each UB tip. Interestingly, in day 2 reaggregates, we found most if not all mCherry-labeled NPCs formed cap structures (Figure 2G). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed SIX2 expression in mCherry+ cells in all cap structures examined (Figure 2H) and the expression of SOX9 in the ureteric epithelia tip cells adjacent to SIX2+ NPCs, suggesting normal interactions between UB and nephron progenitors were maintained (Reginensi et al., 2011Reginensi A. Clarkson M. Neirijnck Y. Lu B. Ohyama T. Groves A.K. Sock E. Wegner M. Costantini F. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. SOX9 controls epithelial branching by activating RET effector genes during kidney development.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Figure S2J). Furthermore, following a 7-day course of morphogenesis (Figure S2K), day 7 aggregates displayed formation of major nephron segments from mCherry+ cells (Figures 2I, S2L, and S2M). To evaluate whether our cultured NPCs are functionally homogenous, we tested clonal derivation from single Six2-GFP+ cells. We observed that single Six2-GFP+ cells from either fetal kidneys or long-term cultured NPCs could not survive and died within 2 days under NPSR/3D condition, suggesting that cell-cell contact in an aggregate format and/or paracrine factors are essential for the survival and self-renewal of NPCs. To circumvent this problem, we developed a methodology to allow clonal expansion from single NPCs by using helper NPCs. For proof of concept, we first established an NPC line stably expressing mCherry and puromycin-resistance genes (mCherry/Puro-NPC). A single mCherry/Puro-NPC was mixed with 300–500 wild-type helper NPCs to form an aggregate, which allowed the single mCherry/Puro-NPC to proliferate (Figure S2N). Puromycin was then added to selectively kill the wild-type NPCs, leaving only mCherry/Puro-NPCs with homogeneous mCherry expression (Figure S2O). By using this method, we derived 50 single-cell clones from NPCs expressing puromycin-resistance gene (Puro-NPCs). Nine of the clones were randomly selected for further analysis. All the NPC marker genes examined were expressed in all nine clones; Six2, Osr1, and Hoxd11 were expressed at comparable levels, while expression levels of Eya1 and Wt1 varied among clones (Figures S2P and S2Q). More importantly, all the single clones (nine out of nine) examined efficiently differentiated to nephron structures upon spinal cord induction (Figure S2R). These results demonstrate an intact nephrogenic potential appear to be homogenously and stably retained in cultured murine NPCs. To relieve the spinal cord dependency, next we sought to establish a chemically defined method for nephron formation. Wnt signaling pathway is known to trigger the initiation of NPC differentiation (Carroll et al., 2005Carroll T.J. Park J.S. Hayashi S. Majumdar A. McMahon A.P.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates nephron induction during mouse kidney development.Development. 2007; 134: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We thus started by treating cultured NPCs with a GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (CH), which activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. CH treatment led to limited differentiation in cultured NPCs accompanied by cell death. Considering that FGF2 (F2) has a pro-survival effect on cultured NPCs, we next tested the combination of CH/F2 for differentiation and found that 2-day treatment is sufficient to faithfully reproduce the nephrogenesis induction conferred by the embryonic spinal cord (Figure 3A). We designated CH/F2-induced NPCs as fate-specified NPCs (FS-NPCs). Once induced, FS-NPCs could autonomously differentiate further in basal medium alone to form nephron organoids marked by numerous tubular formations (Figure 3B). Whole-mount staining of obtained nephron organoids identified major nephron segments (Figures 3C). In vivo, NPCs first differentiate to pretubular aggregates (PTA) and renal vesicles (RV) before further maturing into segmented nephron structures. qPCR analysis indicated that PTA and RV markers Lhx1 and Pax8 were strongly upregulated, while NPC markers such as Six2, Wt1, and Osr1 were maintained at similar levels in FS-NPCs and cultured NPCs (Figure 3D). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed protein expression of both PTA/RV markers (LHX1 and PAX8) and NPC markers (SIX2 and SALL1) in FS-NPCs (Figures S3A and S3B). These results suggest that FS-NPCs resemble more closely the PTA than RV stage. To further investigate to what degree the in vitro nephron organoid formation mimics the normal nephrogenesis after transitioning to the PTA-like stage (FS-NPC), from day 2 to 7, we used DAPT to inhibit Notch signaling, which is indispensable for proximal tubule and glomerulus formation (Cheng et al., 2003Cheng H.T. Miner J.H. Lin M. Tansey M.G. Roth K. Kopan R. Gamma-secretase activity is dispensable for mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition but required for podocyte and proximal tubule formation in developing mouse kidney.Development. 2003; 130: 5031-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Upon DAPT treatment, both proximal tubule and glomerulus differentiation were inhibited in formed organoids (Figure 3E), providing additional evidence that nephron organoid formation from cultured NPCs might be a valid in vitro platform toward partially recapitulating in vivo nephrogenesis. Next, we studied the utility of NPC-derived organoids for renal toxicity testing. To this end, we treated day 7 organoids with gentamicin, which selectively elicits proximal tubule injury (Morizane et al., 2015Morizane R. Lam A.Q. Freedman B.S. Kishi S. Valerius M.T. Bonventre J.V. Nephron organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells model kidney development and injury.Nat.

The relationship between enzymuria and kidney enzyme activities in experimental gentamicin nephrotoxicity.Ren. Fail. 1996; 18: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Massive cell death was observed in LTL+ proximal tubules as evidenced by active caspase-3 (CASP3) staining and severely disrupted LTL+ tubules. In contrast, PODXL+ glomeruli remained intact with virtually no CASP3 staining and a normal morphology (Figures S3C and S3D). These results indicate that the nephron organoids generated from long-term cultured NPCs are suitable for nephrotoxicity testing. To date, various transgenic mouse strains have been generated for studying kidney development and disease modeling. We envision that efficient NPC line derivation and organoid formation methodologies like the one here described could be further expanded into existing mouse models for a better understanding of kidney morphogenesis and disease progression. Toward achieving these goals, we first need to liberate NPC line derivation from relying on the Six2-GFP reporter. To this end, we developed a culture-dependent purification (CDP) method for the transgene-independent derivation of NPC lines (Figure 3F). We found that after plating cells dissociated from whole E12.5 Six2GCE kidney onto laminin-coated plates, but not gelatin or Matrigel-coated plates, some cells detach and form aggregates after 4 days of culture (Figure S3E). These floating aggregates"

Contrary to previous studies, results show patch/exo-patch and matrix neurons receive both limbic and sensorimotor information. A novel inhibitory projection from bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to patch/exo-patch neurons was revealed. Projections to SNc were found to originate from patch/exo-patch and matrix neurons. These findings redefine patch/matrix beyond traditional neurochemical topography and reveal new principles about their input-output connectivity, providing a foundation for future functional studies."

Whether and how this process is regulated at the level of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) remains unclear. Here, we report that CPR5, which plays a key inhibitory role in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and programmed cell death (PCD) in plants, is a novel transmembrane nucleoporin. CPR5 associates with anchors of the NPC selective barrier to constrain nuclear access of signaling cargos and sequesters cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) involved in ETI signal transduction. Upon activation by immunoreceptors, CPR5 undergoes an oligomer to monomer conformational switch, which coordinates CKI release for ETI signaling and reconfigures the selective barrier to allow significant influx of nuclear signaling cargos through the NPC. Consequently, these coordinated NPC actions result in simultaneous activation of diverse stress-related signaling pathways and constitute an essential regulatory mechanism specific for ETI/PCD induction.

Consequently, these coordinated NPC actions result in simultaneous activation of diverse stress-related signaling pathways and constitute an essential regulatory mechanism specific for ETI/PCD induction. Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a vital mechanism for host recognition of pathogen virulence effectors to trigger defense (Jones and Dangl, 2006Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. The plant immune system.Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (7095) Google Scholar, Stuart et al., 2013Stuart L.M. Paquette N. Boyer L. Effector-triggered versus pattern-triggered immunity: how animals sense pathogens.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In plants, ETI is activated by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptors, which are divided into two major classes based on the presence of an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain or a Toll-interlukin1 receptor (TIR) domain. NB-LRRs have been found to localize in various subcellular compartments, where they can detect activities of different pathogen effectors (Elmore et al., 2011Elmore J.M. Lin Z.J. Coaker G. Plant NB-LRR signaling: upstreams and downstreams.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2011; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although quantitative differences exist in outcomes of ETI mediated by different NB-LRRs, they all result in similar transcriptional reprogramming of the infected cells, which leads to restriction of pathogen growth and rapid programmed cell death (PCD). This suggests a common cellular regulatory mechanism connecting distinct NB-LRR activation events to a unified transcriptional response in the nucleus. Genetic and molecular studies have shown that changes in the nucleocytoplasmic dynamics of NB-LRR receptor complexes, signal transducers, and immune-related transcriptional regulators are crucial for defense gene expression and resistance during ETI (García and Parker, 2009García A.V.

Screens for suppressors of an autoactivated TIR-NB-LRR protein mutant, snc1, led to the identification of mos (modifiers of snc1) mutants, including two (mos3 and mos7) in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and one (mos6) in a nuclear transport receptor (NTR) (Cheng et al., 2009Cheng Y.T. Germain H. Wiermer M. Bi D. Xu F. García A.V. Wirthmueller L. Després C. Parker J.E. Zhang Y. Li X.

This and other evidence suggests that the NPC- and NTR-directed nucleocytoplasmic transport is involved in subcellular defense coordination triggered by NB-LRRs (Wirthmueller et al., 2013Wirthmueller L. Roth C. Banfield M.J. Wiermer M. Hop-on hop-off: importin-α-guided tours to the nucleus in innate immune signaling.Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 149Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, because these mos and other nucleoporin mutants are also compromised in resistance independent of NB-LRRs (Wiermer et al., 2012Wiermer M. Cheng Y.T. Imkampe J. Li M. Wang D. Lipka V. Li X. Putative members of the Arabidopsis Nup107-160 nuclear pore sub-complex contribute to pathogen defense.Plant J. 2012; 70: 796-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whether the NPC plays a generic role in mediating transport of defense signals or a specific regulatory role for distinct immune mechanisms remains unclear. In contrast to the mos mutants, which block immune responses, loss-of-function mutations in the putative nuclear envelope (NE) protein constitutive expresser of PR genes 5 (CPR5) result in an ETI-like transcriptome and PCD (Wang et al., 2014Wang S. Gu Y. Zebell S.G. Anderson L.K. Wang W. Mohan R. Dong X. A noncanonical role for the CKI-RB-E2F cell-cycle signaling pathway in plant effector-triggered immunity.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consequently, these mutants show resistance against multiple pathogens carrying effectors independent of cognate NB-LRR receptors (Boch et al., 1998Boch J. Verbsky M.L. Robertson T.L. Larkin J.C.

The cpr5 mutant of Arabidopsis expresses both NPR1-dependent and NPR1-independent resistance.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that CPR5 regulates an essential downstream inhibitory mechanism of ETI/PCD, possibly at the nucleocytoplasmic barrier. We previously showed that two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), SIAMESE (SIM), and SIAMESE-related 1 (SMR1), are redundantly required for downstream ETI/PCD signaling in the cpr5 mutant. CPR5 sequesters CKIs in the NE and specifically releases them in response to NB-LRR activation to engage the retinoblastoma (Rb) and the E2F-mediated cell-cycle pathway to regulate defense gene expression and PCD (Wang et al., 2014Wang S. Gu Y. Zebell S.G. Anderson L.K. Wang W. Mohan R. Dong X. A noncanonical role for the CKI-RB-E2F cell-cycle signaling pathway in plant effector-triggered immunity.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, how CKIs are released remains unknown. Moreover, whether redirection of the cell-cycle pathway is sufficient for cpr5-mediated ETI/PCD needs further investigation. In this study, we report that CPR5 is a plant transmembrane nucleoporin that physically associates with the NPC core scaffold. CPR5 resides in the NPC as a homomeric complex, which is specifically disrupted in response to NB-LRR activation. This conformational change in the NPC plays a dual role during ETI/PCD activation: it enables dissociation of CKIs from the NPC to engage cell-cycle regulators for defense gene expression and reconfigures the NPC selective barrier to allow massive nuclear influx of diverse stress-related signaling cargos. These CPR5-coordinated actions of the NPC are required for ETI/PCD induction and constitute a downstream regulatory mechanism specific for NB-LRR-mediated ETI/PCD. To define the molecular role of CPR5, we first determined its precise subcellular localization using a fusion to the GFP (GFP-CPR5), which we have previously shown to be functional (Wang et al., 2014Wang S. Gu Y. Zebell S.G. Anderson L.K. Wang W. Mohan R. Dong X. A noncanonical role for the CKI-RB-E2F cell-cycle signaling pathway in plant effector-triggered immunity.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using both transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and stable expression in Arabidopsis, we found that CPR5 was exclusively associated with the endomembrane system, including the nuclear envelope (NE) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated large granules (Figures 1A, 1B , S1A, and S1B). We next investigated its membrane targeting mechanism by first verifying its predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs). Using trypsin digestion followed by shotgun sequencing with mass spectrometry (MS), we found a highly biased peptide coverage pattern. In the conserved C-terminal region of AtCPR5, no peptide was detected within the predicted TMDs (Figures 1C and S1C), consistent with the MS profiling patterns found in other integral membrane proteins (Washburn et al., 2001Washburn M.P.

Individual peptides detected by LC-MS/MS are labeled in brown and listed below the reference sequence. Three-dimensional image reconstruction of the nuclear surface revealed that CPR5 was not distributed evenly in the NE, but was enriched in punctate structures (Figures 1E and S1A, right panel). Distinct from the large mobile granules associated with the ER, these static puncta are smaller in size and densely distributed in the NE, resembling nuclear pores. Subsequent immunogold labeling of GFP-CPR5 followed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tomography analyses confirmed that CPR5 is indeed associated with the NPC (Figures 1F and 1G). Structural integrity of the NPC is known to play a role in maintaining NE stability (Alber et al., 2007Alber F. Dokudovskaya S. Veenhoff L.M. Zhang W. Kipper J. Devos D. Suprapto A. Karni-Schmidt O. Williams R. Chait B.T. et al.The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2007; 450: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and changes in levels of a number of NPC components (nucleoporins) cause NE membrane deformation (Jevtić et al., 2014Jevtić P. Edens L.J. Vuković L.D. Levy D.L. Sizing and shaping the nucleus: mechanisms and significance.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 28: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that prolonged overexpression of CPR5 could indeed elicit hypolobulated nuclei and inner nuclear speckles (Figure 1H), whereas loss of CPR5 resulted in abnormal spherical nuclei (Figures 1I and 1J), consistent with the NE morphology observed in multiple nucleoporin mutants (Parry, 2014Parry G.

Identification and characterization of nuclear pore complex components in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 4084-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to its NE localization, which clearly has a functional impact, CPR5-associated ER granules are distinct from any of the known membrane structures tested (Figures 1D and S1B). We hypothesize that this pool of CPR5 may represent a non-specific membrane association due to overexpression. Proteomic analysis of the affinity-purified YFP-CPR5 protein complex identified a total of 28 potential binding partners of CPR5 (Figures S2A and S2B), which contain two functional groups that support our hypothesis of CPR5 being a membrane-bound nucleoporin (Figure 2A). The first group contains proteins that function in membrane protein synthesis and maturation. These interactors were likely captured by newly synthesized CPR5 protein in the ER on route to the NE. The second group consists of two proteins, nucleoporin 155 (Nup155), a core scaffold component of NPC, and a putative cell-cycle controlling phosphatase, both of which were previously identified as associated with the NPC in plants (Tamura et al., 2010Tamura K.

Identification and characterization of nuclear pore complex components in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 4084-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We subsequently verified that CPR5 and Nup155 interact specifically in the NPC using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (Figure 2B). In addition, a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay indicated that CPR5 is anchored in the NE with low mobility and thus likely forms a stable complex with Nup155 in the NPC (Figure 2C).Figure 2CPR5 Physically and Genetically Interacts with Nucleoporins as a Component of the NPCShow full caption(A) CPR5 interactors identified by protein complex purification followed by LC-MS/MS.

To gain further insight into the position of CPR5 within the NPC, we mapped the interactions of CPR5 with nucleoporins of different NPC subcomplexes. The core NPC contains eight copies of symmetric spokes, each consisting of interconnected subcomplexes: the outer ring complex (ORC) that coats the pore membrane, the inner ring complex (IRC) that forms the NPC core scaffold together with the ORC, the transmembrane ring (MR) that anchors the core scaffold to the pore membrane, and the linker nucleoporins that bridge the core scaffold and Phe-Gly (FG) proteins, which form the selective barrier for cargo transport (Alber et al., 2007Alber F. Dokudovskaya S. Veenhoff L.M. Zhang W. Kipper J. Devos D. Suprapto A. Karni-Schmidt O. Williams R. Chait B.T. et al.The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2007; 450: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Using both BiFC in planta and an in vitro pull-down assay, we found that CPR5 interacts with not only Nup155 in the IRC but also the IRC-associated linker nucleoporin Nup93a through its N terminus (Figures 2D and 2E). However, no robust interaction was detected with FG proteins, ORC components, or other NPC accessory proteins tested (Figure 2D). Based on these observations, we propose that CPR5 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that is anchored at the equatorial plane of the NPC in the nuclear pore membrane by its C-terminal TMDs and physically interacts with the NPC core scaffold as well as an associated linker nucleoporin through its soluble N terminus (Figure 2F). Consistent with the notion of CPR5 being a nucleoporin, CPR5 displays strong genetic interactions with the ORC nucleoporins Nup85, Nup96, and Nup160, but not Nup133. Whereas the nup85, nup96, and nup160 single mutants did not exhibit obvious aberrations in early seedling development, double mutants with cpr5 all resulted in embryonic or seedling lethality (Figure 2G). This synergistic genetic relationship is likely due to a cooperative role between CPR5 and ORC components in maintaining the structural integrity of the NPC. We were unable to assess genetic interactions between CPR5 and IRC nucleoporins due to seedling or embryonic lethality of the single mutants (Parry, 2014Parry G. Components of the Arabidopsis nuclear pore complex play multiple diverse roles in control of plant growth.J. Exp. Bot. 2014; 65: 6057-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plants have sequence-homologs of almost all the vertebrate nucleoporins (Tamura et al., 2010Tamura K. Fukao Y. Iwamoto M. Haraguchi T. Hara-Nishimura I. Identification and characterization of nuclear pore complex components in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 4084-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, because transmembrane nucleoporins are not evolutionarily conserved (Mans et al., 2004Mans B.J. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Comparative genomics, evolution and origins of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1612-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), functional analogs of vertebrate transmembrane nucleoporins that interact with the IRC and anchor the NPC to the pore membrane have not been identified in plants. Our study suggests that CPR5 is a plant-specific transmembrane nucleoporin that physically associates with the IRC and may contribute to the stability of the NPC core scaffold even though it is not required for NPC anchoring (Figure S2C). Besides its potential structural role in the NPC, the cpr5 mutant phenotype suggests that this plant transmembrane nucleoporin may have evolved distinct functions, such as regulation of ETI/PCD. The NPC is a platform for multiple nuclear activities, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, genome maintenance, and regulation of gene expression (Strambio-De-Castillia et al., 2010Strambio-De-Castillia C. Niepel M. Rout M.P. The nuclear pore complex: bridging nuclear transport and gene regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To understand how CPR5 regulates ETI in the NPC, we first investigated the cellular processes controlled by this nucleoporin using transcriptome profiling. To avoid the indirect effects of the stable cpr5 mutation, which is known to activate ETI as well as the downstream signaling pathways mediated by the immune signal salicylic acid (SA) (Bowling et al., 1997Bowling S.A. Clarke J.D. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Dong X.

Because of the low turnover rate of nucleoporins (Toyama et al., 2013Toyama B.H. Savas J.N. Park S.K. Harris M.S. Ingolia N.T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hetzer M.W. Identification of long-lived proteins reveals exceptional stability of essential cellular structures.Cell. 2013; 154: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we designed a protein interference strategy that involved dexamethasone (dex)-inducible expression of the C-terminal half (275–564 aa) of CPR5 (CPR5-C). Although CPR5-C is not functional (Figure S3A), it is targeted to the NPC (Figure S3B) and therefore might compete with the wild-type (WT) protein (Figure 3A). We first tested the system using a transient expression assay performed in N. benthamiana. We found that overexpression of CPR5-C led to tissue collapse similar to ETI-associated PCD induced by NB-LRR activation, whereas overexpression of the full-length CPR5 or CPR5-N had no such an effect (Figure S3C). This CPR5-C-induced PCD was likely due to interference with the function of endogenous CPR5 because it was suppressible by simultaneous overexpression of full-length CPR5, but not CPR5-N (Figure S3D). We subsequently validated the interference activity of YFP-CPR5-C in Arabidopsis, where constitutive or inducible expression of YFP-CPR5-C in the WT background resulted in the cpr5 mutant phenotypes, including growth arrest, PCD and increased expression of defense genes (Figures S3E–S3G).Figure 3Transient Interference with CPR5 Function Simultaneously Activates Diverse Nuclear Signaling PathwaysShow full caption(A) A proposed cellular mechanism for transient interference of CPR5 function by overexpression (OE) of CPR5-C.

Notably, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and therapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) harbor characteristic splicing factor mutations, suggesting that the accumulation of DNA mutations over time is a major determinant of lifetime leukemia risk (McKerrell et al., 2015McKerrell T.

However, these observations do not completely explain the exponential increase in leukemia incidence with advanced age (Adams et al., 2015Adams P.D. Jasper H. Rudolph K.L.

With regard to the functional impact of RNA processing alterations on therapeutic resistance, we discovered that malignant reprogramming of human pre-leukemic progenitors into self-renewing LSC was enhanced by missplicing of a stem cell regulatory transcript, GSK3β (Abrahamsson et al., 2009Abrahamsson A.E.

Moreover, reversion to an embryonic splicing program by MBNL3 downregulation also promoted acute leukemic transformation (Holm et al., 2015Holm F. Hellqvist E. Mason C.N. Ali S.A. Delos-Santos N. Barrett C.L. Chun H.J. Minden M.D. Moore R.A. Marra M.A. et al.Reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program enhances leukemia stem cell self-renewal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) studies demonstrate that differential exon usage in epigenetic modifier and tumor suppressor transcripts contributes to myeloid malignancy pathogenesis. However, whether differences exist in alternative splicing regulation between aged human HSPCs and LSCs, and whether RNA splicing alterations selectively sensitize LSCs to anti-tumor splicing modulator therapy (Bonnal et al., 2012Bonnal S. Vigevani L. Valcárcel J. The spliceosome as a target of novel antitumour drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), had not been determined. Thus, we sought to identify RNA processing signatures of malignant versus benign HSPC aging and to evaluate the LSC-selective efficacy of a pharmacological splicing modulator, 17S-FD-895, a member of the pladienolide family of splicing modulatory compounds. Mutations in various components of the human RNA splicing machinery (Figure 1A) have been associated with age-related hematopoietic malignancies. However, whether normal aging sets the stage for RNA processing deregulation in cancer and whether non-mutation-based splicing alterations are associated with human stem cell aging or malignant stem cell generation have not been established. To generate a comprehensive transcriptome expression map of human HSPC aging, we performed RNA-seq of highly purified normal young and aged HSCs (CD34+CD38−Lin−) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) (CD34+CD38+Lin−) from human bone marrow (Figure S1A) followed by whole-gene, splice isoform, transcription factor, and lncRNA analyses. In fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified HSCs from aged versus young adults, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) revealed disruption of vital stem cell regulatory pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, DNA replication, and proteostasis (Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B; Table S2). In aged versus young HPCs, deregulation of DNA mismatch repair and recombination and inflammation-associated pathways was observed (Figure S1C). Genes encoding signal transduction molecules such as protein phosphatases (DUSP1) were commonly upregulated during human HSC and HPC aging. Additionally, in aging human HPC, expression of DNA damage (GADD45A, GADD45B) and pro-inflammatory genes (CXCL2) was increased (Figures S1D and S1E; Table S3). Notably, spliceosome pathway genes from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed distinctive expression changes between young and aged HSCs and HPCs suggestive of differential splicing regulation during aging (Figure 1B; Table S2). Next, we evaluated splice isoform profiles of aged versus young human HSCs and HPCs. Utilizing an isoform-specific alignment algorithm that incorporates all known transcript sequences from Ensembl (GRCh37) (Barrett et al., 2015Barrett C.L. DeBoever C. Jepsen K. Saenz C.C. Carson D.A. Frazer K.A. Systematic transcriptome analysis reveals tumor-specific isoforms for ovarian cancer diagnosis and therapy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2013; 110: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and a false discovery rate (FDR) of <5% (Table S4), we identified splice isoform signatures of human HSC and HPC aging (Figures 1C–1E) that were distinct from normal young and cord blood (CB) progenitors (Figures 1E and S1F). Commonly upregulated transcripts during HSC and HPC aging included isoforms of transcription factors and histone regulatory gene products (Figure 1F), indicative of a prominent epigenetic contribution to HSPC aging. These transcripts were abundant in both aged HSCs and HPCs, as confirmed in validation cohorts of additional young and aged HSCs and HPCs (Figure S1G). To investigate the mechanisms governing cell fate commitment during human HSC and HPC aging, we utilized a human transcription factor database (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) to analyze RNA-seq data. Significantly upregulated transcription factors distinguished both aged HSCs and aged HPCs from their younger counterparts (Figure 1G; Table S3). Consistent with a role for inflammation in human aging and myeloid lineage skewing of hematopoiesis, we found increased expression of inflammation-responsive (NFIL3, IRF1) and myeloid lineage-directing (ETV3, CEBPB) transcription factors in the HPC compartment. LncRNAs have emerged as key determinants of mouse HSC cell fate commitment (Luo et al., 2015Luo M. Jeong M. Sun D. Park H.J. Rodriguez B.A. Xia Z. Yang L. Zhang X. Sheng K. Darlington G.J. et al.Long non-coding RNAs control hematopoietic stem cell function.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 426-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and alternative splicing. LncRNA profiling revealed upregulation of the nuclear transcriptional regulator NEAT1 in HSCs and HPCs, along with HPC-specific upregulation of MALAT1 (also known as NEAT2; Figure 1H), which influences alternative splicing through regulation of serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors (Tripathi et al., 2010Tripathi V. Ellis J.D. Shen Z. Song D.Y. Pan Q. Watt A.T. Freier S.M. Bennett C.F. Sharma A. Bubulya P.A. et al.The nuclear-retained noncoding RNA MALAT1 regulates alternative splicing by modulating SR splicing factor phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 925-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Together, these whole-gene and splice isoform expression signatures of human HSC and HPC aging identify pathways that are deregulated during stem cell aging. To determine if sAML evolves as a result of splicing deregulation in aged and MDS progenitors, we performed whole-transcriptome analyses of FACS-purified progenitors (CD34+CD38+Lin−) isolated from sAML samples along with de novo AML and MDS samples (Table S1). Comparative RNA-seq and GSEA of purified sAML progenitors revealed that the spliceosome was the top disrupted KEGG gene set compared with age-matched progenitors (Figure 2A; Table S2). Additionally, in sAML there was enrichment of genes involved in hematopoiesis, cell adhesion, and signal transduction (Figures S2A and S2B; Tables S2 and S3). Similar to our previous findings of inflammatory mediator upregulation in CML LSCs (Jiang et al., 2013Jiang Q. Crews L.A. Barrett C.L. Chun H.J. Court A.C. Isquith J.M. Zipeto M.A. Goff D.J. Minden M. Sadarangani A. et al.ADAR1 promotes malignant progenitor reprogramming in chronic myeloid leukemia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), GSEA (FDR < 25%) of sAML LSCs showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling and anti-viral response pathways (Figure S2B; Table S2). Together, these results suggest that deregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine signal transduction mechanisms represents a common feature of HSPC aging and LSC generation. While mutations in splicing factor genes have been associated with transformation to sAML, the role of non-mutation-driven splicing alterations has been less extensively studied. Thus, we further examined spliceosome components in sAML LSCs. Single-nucleotide resolution analysis of our RNA-seq datasets for known mutations in MDS/sAML-associated loci in splicing regulatory genes (Lindsley et al., 2015Lindsley R.C. Mar B.G. Mazzola E. Grauman P.V. Shareef S. Allen S.L. Pigneux A. Wetzler M. Stuart R.K.

Nagasaki M. et al.Frequent pathway mutations of splicing machinery in myelodysplasia.Nature. 2011; 478: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) revealed only one sAML sample harboring a heterozygous mutation in the U2 splicing factor SF3B1, as validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Figure S2C; Table S5). Real-time qPCR analysis of a subset of wild-type SF3B1 samples showed increased SF3B1 expression in AML LSCs (Figure S2C), suggesting that splicing factor gene expression alterations in MDS/sAML may occur in a mutation-independent manner. Interestingly, GSEA of purified progenitors from MDS samples revealed similar disruption of the spliceosome compared with normal age-matched controls (Figure S3A). Pathway-specific analyses of RNA-seq data revealed significant alterations in gene expression of many splicing factors in sAML, including upregulation of PRPF6, SF3B2, and ACIN1, and downregulation of the SRSF family of splicing regulatory gene products (Figure 2B). Among the upregulated transcripts, SF3B2 is a component of the U2 complex that promotes splicing, and ACIN1 participates in the exon junction complex (EJC), where it regulates production of the pro-survival splice isoform of the BCL2 family member BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) (Michelle et al., 2012Michelle L. Cloutier A. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Thibault P. Durand M. Garneau D. Gendron D. Lapointe E.

Together, these data suggest that spliceosome disruption is prevalent in sAML and may drive splicing alterations of stem cell regulatory genes contributing to LSC generation. A splice isoform signature of sAML LSC was identified by ranking all significantly differentially expressed transcripts (log 2 fold change [L2FC] > 1, FDR < 5 %) from greatest to least distance from the origin on a volcano plot (Figure 2C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). A complete list of all significantly differentially expressed transcripts is provided in Table S4. The top 75 splice isoform signature of sAML LSCs was typified by several alternatively spliced signal transduction (PTPN6, PTK2B) and cell adhesion gene products (e.g., CD44 and ITGB2; Figures 2C, 2D, and S2D; Table S4). Notably, misspliced gene products of the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6 (also known as SHP-1) and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-related tyrosine kinase PTK2B (PYK2) have been associated with AML (Beghini et al., 2000Beghini A.

ESR1 engages enhancers upon estrogen stimulation to establish an oncogenic expression program. Somatic copy number alterations involving the ESR1 gene occur in approximately 1% of ESR1-positive breast cancers, suggesting that other mechanisms underlie the persistent expression of ESR1. We report significant enrichment of somatic mutations within the set of regulatory elements (SRE) regulating ESR1 in 7% of ESR1-positive breast cancers. These mutations regulate ESR1 expression by modulating transcription factor binding to the DNA. The SRE includes a recurrently mutated enhancer whose activity is also affected by rs9383590, a functional inherited single-nucleotide variant (SNV) that accounts for several breast cancer risk-associated loci. Our work highlights the importance of considering the combinatorial activity of regulatory elements as a single unit to delineate the impact of noncoding genetic alterations on single genes in cancer."

Regions of interest were drawn on ADC maps corresponding to the contrast enhancing parts of the tumors. Biopsies from all 21 patients were histologically analyzed. Nuclei count, total nuclei area and average nuclei area were measured. The proliferation index was estimated as Ki-67 positive nuclei divided by total number of nuclei. Correlations of ADC values and histopathologic parameters were determined statistically.Ki-67 staining revealed a statistically significant correlation with ADCmin (r = -0.454, p = 0.038), ADCmean (r = -0.546, p = 0.010) and ADCmax (r = -0.515, p = 0.017). Furthermore, ADCmean correlated in a statistically significant manner with total nucleic area (r = -0.500, p = 0.021).Low ADCmin, ADCmean and ADCmax values reflect a high proliferative activity of primary cental nervous system lymphoma. Low ADCmean values-in concordance with several previously published studies-indicate an increased cellularity within the tumor."

Elucidating the roles that protein-nucleic acid complexes play in the regulation of transcription, translation, DNA replication, repair and recombination, and RNA processing continues to be a crucial aspect of understanding of cell biology and the mechanisms of disease. In addition, proteins have been demonstrated to interact with antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics in a sequence and chemistry dependent manner, influencing ASO potency and distribution in cells and in vivo. While many assays have been developed to measure protein-nucleic acid interactions, many suffer from lack of throughput and sensitivity, or challenges with protein purification and scalability. In this report we present a new BRET assay for the analysis of DNA-protein interactions which makes use of an extremely bright luciferase as a tag for the binding protein, along with a long-wavelength fluorophore conjugated to the nucleic acid. The resulting assay is high throughput, sensitive, does not require protein purification, and even allows for quantitative characterization of these interactions within the biologically relevant context of whole cells."
https://openalex.org/W2514592417,"Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is a fatty acid chaperone, which is induced during adipocyte differentiation. Previously we have shown that FABP4 in endothelial cells is induced by the NOTCH1 signalling pathway, the latter of which is involved in mechanisms of resistance to antiangiogenic tumour therapy. Here, we investigated the role of FABP4 in endothelial fatty acid metabolism and tumour angiogenesis. We analysed the effect of transient FABP4 knockdown in human umbilical vein endothelial cells on fatty acid metabolism, viability and angiogenesis. Through therapeutic delivery of siRNA targeting mouse FABP4, we investigated the effect of endothelial FABP4 knockdown on tumour growth and blood vessel formation. In vitro, siRNA-mediated FABP4 knockdown in endothelial cells led to a marked increase of endothelial fatty acid oxidation, an increase of reactive oxygen species and decreased angiogenesis. In vivo, we found that increased NOTCH1 signalling in tumour xenografts led to increased expression of endothelial FABP4 that decreased when NOTCH1 and VEGFA inhibitors were used in combination. Angiogenesis, growth and metastasis in ovarian tumour xenografts were markedly inhibited by therapeutic siRNA delivery targeting mouse endothelial FABP4. Therapeutic targeting of endothelial FABP4 by siRNA in vivo has antiangiogenic and antitumour effects with minimal toxicity and should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2516873920,"Introduction The strength of evidence underpinning care and treatment recommendations in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is low. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has been proposed as a framework to provide evidence for optimal care for TBI patients. The first step in CER is to map the existing variation. The aim of current study is to quantify variation in general structural and process characteristics among centers participating in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. Methods We designed a set of 11 provider profiling questionnaires with 321 questions about various aspects of TBI care, chosen based on literature and expert opinion. After pilot testing, questionnaires were disseminated to 71 centers from 20 countries participating in the CENTER-TBI study. Reliability of questionnaires was estimated by calculating a concordance rate among 5% duplicate questions. Results All 71 centers completed the questionnaires. Median concordance rate among duplicate questions was 0.85. The majority of centers were academic hospitals (n = 65, 92%), designated as a level I trauma center (n = 48, 68%) and situated in an urban location (n = 70, 99%). The availability of facilities for neuro-trauma care varied across centers; e.g. 40 (57%) had a dedicated neuro-intensive care unit (ICU), 36 (51%) had an in-hospital rehabilitation unit and the organization of the ICU was closed in 64% (n = 45) of the centers. In addition, we found wide variation in processes of care, such as the ICU admission policy and intracranial pressure monitoring policy among centers. Conclusion Even among high-volume, specialized neurotrauma centers there is substantial variation in structures and processes of TBI care. This variation provides an opportunity to study effectiveness of specific aspects of TBI care and to identify best practices with CER approaches."

However, the apoptotic effect of vitamin K2 on bladder cancer cells has not been evaluated. The aim of this study is to examine the apoptotic activity of Vitamin K2 in bladder cancer cells and investigate the underlying mechanism. In this study, Vitamin K2 induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells through mitochondria pathway including loss of mitochondria membrane potential, cytochrome C release and caspase-3 cascade. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK was detected in Vitamin K2-treated cells and both SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) and SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK) completely abolished the Vitamin K2-induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondria membrane potential. Moreover, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in bladder cancer cells, upon treatment of vitamin K2 and the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) almost blocked the Vitamin K2-triggered apoptosis, loss of mitochondria membrane potential and activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these findings revealed that Vitamin K2 induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via ROS-mediated JNK/p38 MAPK and Mitochondrial pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2511388043,"Background There is a paucity of studies that focus on the economic burden in daily care in China using electronic health data. The aim of this study is to describe the development of the economic burden of diabetic patients in a sample city in China from 2009 to 2011 using electronic data of patients’ claims records. Methods This study is a retrospective, longitudinal study in an open cohort of Chinese patients with diabetes. The patient population consisted of people living in a provincial capital city in east China, covered by the provincial urban employee basic medical insurance (UEBMI). We included any patient who had at least one explicit diabetes diagnosis or received blood glucose lowering medication in at least one registered outpatient visit or hospitalization during a calendar year in the years 2009–2011. Cross-sectional descriptions of different types of costs, prevalence of diabetic complications and related diseases, medication use were performed for each year separately and differences between three years were compared using a chi-square test or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results Our results showed an increasing trend in total medical cost (from 2,383 to 2,780 USD, p = 0.032) and diabetes related cost (from 1,655 to 1,857 USD) for those diabetic patients during the study period. The diabetes related economic burden was significantly related to the prevalence of complications and related diseases (p<0.001). The overall medication cost during diabetes related visits also increased (from 1,335 to 1,383 USD, p = 0.021). But the use pattern and cost of diabetes-related medication did not show significant changes during the study period. Conclusion The economic burden of diabetes increased significantly in urban China. It is important to improve the prevention and treatment of diabetes to contribute to the sustainability of the Chinese health-care system."

Hyperinsulinemia, a key factor in obesity, pre-diabetes and T2D, has been associated with decreased breast cancer survival. In this study, a mouse model of pre-diabetes (MKR mouse) was used to investigate the mechanisms through which endogenous hyperinsulinemia promotes mammary tumor metastases. The MKR mice developed larger primary tumors and greater number of pulmonary metastases compared with wild-type (WT) mice after injection with c-Myc/Vegf overexpressing MVT-1 cells. Analysis of the primary tumors showed significant increase in vimentin protein expression in the MKR mice compared with WT. We hypothesized that vimentin was an important mediator in the effect of hyperinsulinemia on breast cancer metastasis. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA knockdown of vimentin led to a significant decrease in invasion of the MVT-1 cells and abrogated the increase in cell invasion in response to insulin. In the pre-diabetic MKR mouse, vimentin knockdown led to a decrease in pulmonary metastases. In vitro, we found that insulin increased pAKT, prevented caspase 3 activation, and increased vimentin. Inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT pathway, using NVP-BKM120, increased active caspase 3 and decreased vimentin levels. This study is the first to show that vimentin has an important role in tumor metastasis in vivo in the setting of pre-diabetes and endogenous hyperinsulinemia. Vimentin targeting may be an important therapeutic strategy to reduce metastases in patients with obesity, pre-diabetes or T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2517933970,"The clustering of neurons sharing similar functional properties and connectivity is a common organizational feature of vertebrate nervous systems. Within motor networks, spinal motor neurons (MNs) segregate into longitudinally arrayed subtypes, establishing a central somatotopic map of peripheral target innervation. MN organization and connectivity relies on Hox transcription factors expressed along the rostrocaudal axis; however, the developmental mechanisms governing the orderly arrangement of MNs are largely unknown. We show that Pbx genes, which encode Hox cofactors, are essential for the segregation and clustering of neurons within motor columns. In the absence of Pbx1 and Pbx3 function, Hox-dependent programs are lost and the remaining MN subtypes are unclustered and disordered. Identification of Pbx gene targets revealed an unexpected and apparently Hox-independent role in defining molecular features of dorsally projecting medial motor column (MMC) neurons. These results indicate Pbx genes act in parallel genetic pathways to orchestrate neuronal subtype differentiation, connectivity, and organization."
https://openalex.org/W2515583289,"Age-related gait changes may be due to the loss of complexity in the neuromuscular system. This theory is disputed due to inconsistent results from single-scale analyses. Also, behavioral adaptations may confound these changes. We examined whether EMG dynamics during gait is less complex in older adults over a range of timescales using the multiscale entropy method, and whether slower walking attenuates this effect. Surface EMG was measured from the left vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GA), and tibialis anterior (TA) in 17 young and 18 older adults as they walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 0.8x-1.2x of preferred speed. Sample entropy (SE) and the complexity index (CI) of the EMG signals were calculated after successive coarse-graining to extract dynamics at timescales of 27 to 270 Hz, with m = 2 and r = 0.15 SD. SE and CI were lower across the timescales in older adults in VL and BF, but higher in GA (all p<0.001); these results held for VL and GA even after accounting for longer EMG burst durations in older adults. CI was higher during slower walking speed in VL and BF (p<0.001). Results were mostly similar for m = 3 and r = 0.01-0.35. Smaller r was more sensitive to age-related differences. The decrease in complexity with aging in the timescales studied was limited to proximal muscles, particularly VL. The increase in GA may be driven by other factors. Walking slower may reflect a behavioral adaptation that allows the nervous system to function with greater complexity."

https://openalex.org/W2516024337,"Drosophila melanogaster is a popular research model organism thanks to its’ powerful genetic tools that allow spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The inducible GeneSwitch Gal4 system (GS) system is a modified version of the classic UAS/GAL4 system which allows inducible regulation of gene expression and eliminates background effects. It is widely acknowledged that the GS system is leaky, with low level expression of UAS transgenes in absence of the inducer RU-486 (the progesterone analog that activates the modified GAL4 protein). However, in the course of our experiments, we have observed that the extent of this leak depends on the nature of the transgene being expressed. In the absence of RU-486, when strong drivers are used to express protein coding transgenes, leaky expression is low or negligible, however expression of RNA interference (RNAi) transgenes results in complete depletion of protein levels. The majority of published studies, using the GS system and RNAi transgenes validate knock-down efficiency by comparing target gene mRNA levels between induced and non-induced groups. Here, we demonstrate that this approach is lacking and that both additional control groups and further validation is required at the protein level. Unfortunately, this experimental limitation of the GS system eliminates “the background advantage”, but does offer the possibility of performing more complex experiments (e.g. studying depletion and overexpression of different proteins in the same genetic background). The limitations and new possible applications of the GS system are discussed in detail."

https://openalex.org/W2513808607,"The re-measurement of permanent forest inventories offers a unique opportunity to assess the occurrence and impact of forest disturbances. The present study aims at exploring the main forest damages in Norway based on the extensive data of several consecutive national forest inventories during the period 1995-2014. Five of the most common disturbance agents in Norway are selected for analysis: wind, snow, browsing, fungus and insect damage. The analyses focuses on the frequency and variation along time, the average damage at stand level and the spatial patterns of damage occurrence, resulting in a characterization of the damage produced by disturbances in Norway. The highest damage occurrences by disturbance agent are due to browsing, snow and wind. Snow presents a decreasing temporally trend in damage frequency in the studied period. By forest type, mature and intermediate birch forest are found to be more affected by snow damage, whereas mature spruce forest is by wind damage. The results from this study provide support to the hypothesis that damages by autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) on birch are more common in mature stands. No major attacks from bark beetle (Ips typographus) are found, probably related to the lack of major storm damages in the period. Forest types susceptibility to fungus has no apparent variation over time except in the last years, as increased occurrence is observed on mature spruce stands probably correlated with warmer than average periods. Browsing damage causes the most severe losses, as expected, in young stands, and is allocated mainly on the most productive forests. Although some of the disturbances present locally moderate effects, the results show no major disturbances threatening Norwegian forests in the studied period. Finally, the Norwegian national forest inventory demonstrates its reliability as a basis to understand the occurrence and effects of major natural disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2517478820,"For the treatment of foliar diseases of cereals, fungicides may be applied as foliar sprays or systemic seed treatments which are translocated to leaves. Little research has been done to assess the resistance risks associated with foliar-acting systemic seed treatments when used alone or in combination with foliar sprays, even though both types of treatment may share the same mode of action. It is therefore unknown to what extent adding a systemic seed treatment to a foliar spray programme poses an additional resistance risk and whether in the presence of a seed treatment additional resistance management strategies (such as limiting the total number of treatments) are necessary to limit the evolution of fungicide-resistance. A mathematical model was developed to simulate an epidemic and the resistance evolution of Zymoseptoria tritici on winter wheat, which was used to compare different combinations of seed and foliar treatments by calculating the fungicide effective life, i.e. the number of years before effective disease control is lost to resistance. A range of parameterizations for the seed treatment fungicide and different fungicide uptake models were compared. Despite the different parameterizations, the model consistently predicted the same trends in that i) similar levels of efficacy delivered either by a foliar-acting seed treatment, or a foliar application, resulted in broadly similar resistance selection, ii) adding a foliar-acting seed treatment to a foliar spray programme increased resistance selection and usually decreased effective life, and iii) splitting a given total dose—by adding a seed treatment to foliar treatments, but decreasing dose per treatment—gave effective lives that were the same as, or shorter than those given by the spray programme alone. For our chosen plant-pathogen-fungicide system, the model results suggest that to effectively manage selection for fungicide-resistance, foliar acting systemic seed treatments should be included as one of the maximum number of permitted fungicide applications."

The objective of this study was to assess the use of a PCR-based assay for detection of staphylococci directly from blood obtained through the catheter to diagnose CRB caused by these microorganisms and to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. A total of 92 patients with suspected CRB were included in the study. Samples were obtained through the catheter. Paired blood cultures were processed by standard culture methods and 4 ml blood samples were processed by GeneXpert-MRSA assay for the detection of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS). Sixteen CRB caused by staphylococci were diagnosed among 92 suspected patients. GeneXpert detected 14 out of 16 cases (87.5%), including 4 MSSA and 10 MR-CoNS in approximately 1 hour after specimen receipt. The sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert were 87.5% (CI 95%: 60.4-97.8) and 92.1% (CI 95%: 83-96.7), respectively, compared with standard culture methods. The sensitivity of GeneXpert for S. aureus was 100%. Regarding a cost-effectiveness analysis, the incremental cost of using GeneXpert was of 31.1€ per patient while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GeneXpert compared with blood culture alones was about 180€ per life year gained. In conclusion, GeneXpert can be used directly with blood samples obtained through infected catheters to detect S. aureus and MR-CoNS in approximately 1h after sampling. In addition, it is cost-effective especially in areas with high prevalence of staphylococcal CRB."
https://openalex.org/W2509546824,"Variability in mesoscale nearshore oceanographic conditions plays an important role in the distribution of primary production and food availability for intertidal consumers. Advection of nutrient rich waters by upwelling usually allows the proliferation of diatoms, later replaced by dinoflagellates. We examined upwelling effects on the fatty acid (FA) signature of a benthic intertidal filter feeder to identify its response to pulsed variability in food availability. The study took place in two contrasting seasons and at two upwelling and two non-upwelling sites interspersed within the southern Benguela upwelling system of South Africa. We investigated the FA composition of the adductor muscles and gonads of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to assess how FA are apportioned to the different tissues and whether this changes between upwelling and non-upwelling conditions. In situ temperature loggers used to identify upwelling conditions at the four sites indicated that such events occurred only at the upwelling centres and only in summer. Tissues differed strongly, with gonads presenting a higher proportion of essential FAs. This could reflect the faster turnover rate of gonad tissue or preferential retention of specific FA for reproductive purposes. FA composition did not vary as a direct function of upwelling, but there were strong dissimilarities among sites. Upwelling influenced mussel diets at one upwelling site while at the other, the expected signature of upwelling was displaced downstream of the core of upwelling. Condition Index (CI) and Gonad Index (GI) differed among sites and were not influenced by upwelling, with GI being comparable among sites. In addition, FA proportions were consistent among sites, indicating similar food quality and quantity over time and under upwelling and non-upwelling conditions. This suggests that the influence of upwelling on the west coast of South Africa is pervasive and diffuse, rather than discrete; while nearshore retention or advection of upwelled water is critical and site-specific so that the effects of upwelling differ even among sites categorised as upwelling centres."

Truncation mutants lacking the motor region failed to localize to filopodial tips but still bound transiently at the plasma membrane. Deletion of the single α-helical and anti-parallel coiled-coil forming regions, which lie between the motor and pleckstrin homology domains, reduced the instantaneous velocity of intrafilopodial movement but did not affect the number of substrate adherent filopodia. Deletion of the anti-parallel coiled-coil forming region, but not the EKR-rich region of the single α-helical domain, restored intrafilopodial trafficking, suggesting this region is important in determining myosin 10 motility. We propose a model by which myosin 10 rapidly targets to the filopodial tip via a sequential reduction in dimensionality. Molecules first undergo rapid diffusion within the three-dimensional volume of the cell body. They then exhibit periods of slower two-dimensional diffusion in the plane of the plasma membrane. Finally, they move in a unidimensional, highly directed manner along the polarized actin filament bundle within the filopodium becoming confined to a single point at the tip. Here we have observed directly each phase of the trafficking process using single molecule fluorescence imaging of live cells and have quantified our observations using single particle tracking, autocorrelation analysis, and kymographs."
https://openalex.org/W2518378049,"HtrA2(Omi) protease controls protein quality in mitochondria and plays a major role in apoptosis. Its HtrA2S306A mutant (with the catalytic serine routinely disabled for an X-ray study to avoid self-degradation) is a homotrimer whose subunits contain the serine protease domain (PD) and the regulatory PDZ domain. In the inactive state, a tight interdomain interface limits penetration of both PDZ-activating ligands and PD substrates into their respective target sites. We successfully crystalized HtrA2V226K/S306A, whose active counterpart HtrA2V226K has had higher proteolytic activity, suggesting higher propensity to opening the PD-PDZ interface than that of the wild type HtrA2. Yet, the crystal structure revealed the HtrA2V226K/S306A architecture typical of the inactive protein. To get a consistent interpretation of crystallographic data in the light of kinetic results, we employed molecular dynamics (MD). V325D inactivating mutant was used as a reference. Our simulations demonstrated that upon binding of a specific peptide ligand NH2-GWTMFWV-COOH, the PDZ domains open more dynamically in the wild type protease compared to the V226K mutant, whereas the movement is not observed in the V325D mutant. The movement relies on a PDZ vs. PD rotation which opens the PD-PDZ interface in a lid-like (budding flower-like in trimer) fashion. The noncovalent hinges A and B are provided by two clusters of interfacing residues, harboring V325D and V226K in the C- and N-terminal PD barrels, respectively. The opening of the subunit interfaces progresses in a sequential manner during the 50 ns MD simulation. In the systems without the ligand only minor PDZ shifts relative to PD are observed, but the interface does not open. Further activation-associated events, e.g. PDZ-L3 positional swap seen in any active HtrA protein (vs. HtrA2), were not observed. In summary, this study provides hints on the mechanism of activation of wtHtrA2, the dynamics of the inactive HtrA2V325D, but does not allow to explain an increased activity of HtrA2V226K."

Despite many promising predictions of its progress, microfluidics has not reached its full potential yet. To unleash this potential, we propose the use of intrinsically active hydrogels, which work as sensors and actuators at the same time, in microfluidic channel networks. These materials transfer a chemical input signal such as a substance concentration into a mechanical output. This way chemical information is processed and analyzed on the spot without the need for an external control unit. Inspired by the development electronics, our approach focuses on the development of single transistor-like components, which have the potential to be used in an integrated circuit technology. Here, we present membrane isolated chemical volume phase transition transistor (MIS-CVPT). The device is characterized in terms of the flow rate from source to drain, depending on the chemical concentration in the control channel, the source-drain pressure drop and the operating temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2508824002,"In 1983 the sentinel laboratory network was established because of the need to describe the epidemiological evolution of infectious diseases. During the study period of 30 years (1983-2013), microbiology laboratories reported on weekly basis the laboratory diagnosed cases for a selection of infectious diseases. This resulted in a large longitudinal laboratory based database allowing to provide trends over time and distribution by person and place. During this period, adaptations to data collection were made due to changes in diagnostic methods and public health priorities, introduction and application of digital revolution, and multiple reorganizations of the laboratories. Since the surveillance network is dynamic, it necessitates a continuous evaluation to ensure that, over time, it continues to be representative of the general epidemiological trends in the country. Secondly the aim is to examine the robustness and stability of this surveillance system. Here we demonstrated that the flexibility of the data collection methodology by the sentinel laboratory network is unique and that adaptations do not affect the capacity of the system to follow trends. Therefore, the surveillance by this network is representative of the current epidemiological situation in Belgium. To our knowledge, no such surveillance network with such a long-term follow-up and demonstrated stability for multiple infectious diseases in the general population was earlier described. Furthermore, expected trends due to the implementation of vaccination or other events were accurately detected. The collected data obtained from this network allows interesting comparisons with other national and international information sources."
https://openalex.org/W2510917362,"C4BP (C4b-binding protein) is a polymer of seven identical α chains and one unique β chain synthesized in liver and pancreas. We showed previously that C4BP enhances islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibril formation in vitro. Now we report that polymeric C4BP strongly inhibited lysis of human erythrocytes incubated with monomeric IAPP, whereas no lysis was observed after incubation with preformed IAPP fibrils. In contrast, incubation with the monomeric α-chain of C4BP was less effective. These data indicate that polymeric C4BP with multiple binding sites for IAPP neutralizes lytic activity of IAPP. Furthermore, addition of monomeric IAPP to a rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1) resulted in decreased cell viability, which was restored in the presence of physiological concentrations of C4BP. Treatment of INS-1 cells and primary rat islets with IAPP also diminished their ability to secrete insulin upon stimulation with glucose, which was reversed in the presence of C4BP. Further, C4BP was internalized together with IAPP into INS-1 cells. Pathway analyses of mRNA expression microarray data indicated that cells exposed to C4BP and IAPP in comparison with IAPP alone increased expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Depletion of cholesterol through methyl-β-cyclodextrin or cholesterol oxidase abolished the protective effect of C4BP on IAPP cytotoxicity of INS-1 cells. Also, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase but not NF-κB had a similar effect.

So far, C4BP has been characterized in detail as a complement inhibitor and is often employed by bacterial pathogens as a form of evasion strategy leading to decreased opsonization and phagocytosis (6Blom A.M. Hallström T. Riesbeck K. Complement evasion strategies of pathogens-acquisition of inhibitors and beyond.Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 2808-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).

In type 2 diabetes amyloid deposits are localized to the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and mainly formed by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). IAPP deposits are present in 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes and can cause apoptosis of β-cells (13Jurgens C.A. Toukatly M.N. Fligner C.L. Udayasankar J. Subramanian S.L. Zraika S. Aston-Mourney K. Carr D.B. Westermark P. Westermark G.T. Kahn S.E. Hull R.L. β-Cell loss and β-cell apoptosis in human type 2 diabetes are related to islet amyloid deposition.Am. J. Pathol. 2011; 178: 2632-2640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Apart from this cytotoxic effect IAPP also has a physiological role in regulating and stabilizing blood glucose levels. When insulin resistance develops in type 2 diabetes, so does the production and release of insulin and concomitantly IAPP in the β-cell (14Kahn S.E. D'Alessio D.A. Schwartz M.W. Fujimoto W.Y.

Invest. 2000; 106: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Once IAPP reaches a critical concentration, it starts to aggregate. The small aggregates form β-sheet-rich proto-filaments that interact with each other and eventually form mature fibrils. Even though the exact cytotoxic form of IAPP (monomers, oligomers, or fibrils) is still discussed, there is a growing consensus that small oligomers rather than the mature fibrils are responsible for the cytotoxic effect, similarly to Alzheimer's β-amyloid. It has also been suggested that it is the process of amyloid fibril formation in the membranes itself and not the presence of a particular IAPP species that is responsible for cytotoxicity (16Haataja L.

Membrane damage by human islet amyloid polypeptide through fibril growth at the membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6033-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We showed previously that C4BP enhances the kinetics of fibril formation (12Sjölander J. Westermark G.T. Renström E. Blom A.M. Islet amyloid polypeptide triggers limited complement activation and binds complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, which enhances fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and we found C4BP to be co-localized with IAPP in human pancreatic islets, suggesting a beneficial role of C4BP in counteracting β-cell death in type 2 diabetes. Based on this hypothesis we now investigated the ability of C4BP to protect against IAPP-induced cytotoxicity in living cells and the molecular mechanism of this effect. We hypothesized that because of the previously observed binding of IAPP, C4BP would have cytoprotective effect. Indeed, we found that the addition of IAPP fibrils (51 μm counted as monomer equivalents) to erythrocytes caused no significant cell lysis in comparison with 1% DMSO, which was present in all samples with IAPP (Fig. 1A), whereas addition of 51 μm monomeric IAPP to erythrocytes caused significant cell lysis (Fig. 1A) similar to maximal cell lysis obtained in water. Supplementing the monomeric IAPP solution (51 μm) with C4BP (0.6 μm) almost entirely abolished the lytic effect. Furthermore, addition of C4BP to the IAPP fibril solution had no effect on the already low degree of cell lysis (Fig. 1A). The effect was dependent on the concentration of C4BP (Fig. 1B), whereas transthyretin (5.5 μm) had no effect on lysis mediated by monomeric IAPP. Furthermore, we found that neither transthyretin alone (5.5 μm) nor C4BP alone (0.6 μm) had any effect on background erythrocyte lysis (Fig. 1B). We also verified that the observed effect of IAPP on erythrocyte lysis was specific for human IAPP because rat IAPP, which has not been observed to form oligomers and fibrils, caused no lysis (Fig. 1B). To further explore the mechanism whereby C4BP impairs IAPP-induced erythrocyte lysis, we utilized mutants of C4BP lacking either CCP2 or CCP8, which are the specific domains binding to IAPP (Fig. 1C) (12Sjölander J. Westermark G.T. Renström E. Blom A.M. Islet amyloid polypeptide triggers limited complement activation and binds complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, which enhances fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and found that both mutants inhibited IAPP-mediated lysis at similar concentrations as wild type C4BP (Fig. 1D). We also tested a monomeric α-chain of C4BP and found that it was 20-fold less efficient in inhibiting monomeric IAPP-induced erythrocyte lysis as compared with wild type polymeric C4BP (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, C1q, which also binds IAPP (12Sjölander J. Westermark G.T. Renström E. Blom A.M. Islet amyloid polypeptide triggers limited complement activation and binds complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, which enhances fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and has polymeric structure, did not affect IAPP-induced lysis. The cytoprotective effect of C4BP was then evaluated using a rat pancreatic β-cell line INS-1. To obtain a significant effect of IAPP on INS-1 cell viability, the cells were challenged with 102 μm monomeric IAPP for 22 h. Under these conditions, cells exhibited an altered morphology, becoming more spherical (Fig. 2B) compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 2A). When 102 μm IAPP solution was supplemented with either 0.3 or 0.6 μm C4BP, the cells did not drastically change their morphology, compared with cells without IAPP (Fig. 2, C and D). However, when adding only 0.15 μm of C4BP together with 102 μm monomeric IAPP, the protective effect of C4BP was no longer present (Fig. 2E), and the morphological alteration was as prominent as for cells challenged with IAPP alone. Predominately spherical, dying cells were also observed in wells challenged with 102 μm IAPP in the presence of various control proteins such as DAF (2 μm, not shown), IgG (2 μm, not shown), or transthyretin (5.5 μm; Fig. 2F). Cell viability was then quantified using the alamarBlue® assay. The cells challenged with 102 μm monomeric IAPP alone had very low viability compared with cells exposed to co-solvent (DMSO) alone (Fig. 2G). Cells exposed to 102 μm monomeric IAPP in the presence of 0.3 or 0.6 μm C4BP were significantly more viable (Fig. 2G). Addition of 0.15 μm C4BP or any of the control proteins (2 μm DAF, 2 μm IgG, or 5.5 μm transthyretin) had no significant effect on IAPP-induced cell death. Similar results were observed with cell viability measurements by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin V-APC and Via-Probe. The cells were gated into Annexin V and Via-Probe negative (live cells), Annexin V positive and Via-Probe negative (early apoptotic cells), and Annexin V and Via-Probe positive (late apoptotic cells) (Fig. 2H). Cells treated with only medium contained over 95% live cells (Fig. 2H, left panel), whereas the majority of cells treated with 102 μm monomeric IAPP bound both Annexin V and Via-Probe (Fig. 2H, middle panel). The cytotoxic effect of 102 μm IAPP was significantly reduced by the presence of 0.6 μm C4BP (Fig. 2, H, right panel; I; and J). INS-1 cells incubated with 102 μm IAPP and control proteins DAF (2 μm) and IgG (2 μm) did not show any increase in cell viability compared with IAPP alone. DMSO alone slightly decreased cell viability, and this effect was not attenuated by 0.6 μm C4BP, indicating that its protective effect is specific for IAPP-mediated cell death (Fig. 2I). Importantly, recombinant C4BP had a similar effect to that purified from plasma (Fig. 2J), whereas C1q, which also binds IAPP but does not enhance its polymerization, had no effect (Fig. 2J). Furthermore, INS-1 cells incubated with 51 μm IAPP did not respond with insulin secretion after incubation with 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 2K). This functional defect was reverted in the presence of 0.6 μm C4BP but not control proteins: 0.6 μm C1q, 2 μm DAF, and 2 μm IgG. We first examined mRNA levels for C4BPA and C4BPB in isolated rat islets incubated in low and high glucose conditions. Although C4BPB expression remained stable under all conditions tested (Fig. 3A), C4BPA was highly up-regulated after 72 h of incubation. Glucose concentration did not affect expression of either of the genes. Further, we examine effect of IAPP on the ability of isolated rat islets to secrete insulin upon stimulation with 16.7 mm glucose. As expected, insulin secretion was impaired by incubation with 51 μm IAPP, likely because of decreased viability of the cells (Fig. 3B). This effect was largely rescued in the presence of 0.6 μm C4BP but not 0.6 μm C1q. The protective effect of C4BP is likely in part because of its effect on fibril formation by IAPP. This should result in a decrease in cytotoxic oligomers, which otherwise are lytic for membranes. We further questioned whether C4BP may have additional intracellular effects. To investigate how IAPP alone or together with C4BP might interact with INS-1 cells, cells were treated with IAPP labeled with Rhodamine B and C4BP labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. IAPP (blue) and C4BP (red) together form large extracellular aggregates, some of which appeared to be localized to cell membranes (Fig. 4A). Complexes containing both IAPP and C4BP were also taken up into the INS-1 cells. We estimated that 52% of IAPP found intracellularly was in complexes with C4BP, whereas the remaining 48% was free (Fig. 4C). Cells treated with C4BP alone do not show any aggregates or intracellular staining (Fig. 4B). When IAPP (blue) was incubated with INS-1 cells in the presence or absence of C4BP followed by detection of mitochondria (red) and lysosomes (green), we observed that IAPP co-localizes with both organelles (Fig. 4, D and E), and although there appears to be a tendency toward more IAPP present in cells in absence of C4BP (Fig. 4G), there did not seem to be any quantifiable difference in its distribution to the two organelles (Fig. 4F). Because C4BP is taken up by INS-1 cells together with IAPP, we hypothesized that it may affect cellular responses and mRNA expression levels of some targets, resulting in protection of cells from IAPP cytotoxicity. The global transcriptional response to 77 μm monomeric IAPP was therefore examined in INS-1 cells after 10 h of incubation in the presence or absence of 0.6 μm C4BP using the Affymetrix RaGene 2.0 array. Using linear models and empirical Bayesian moderation of p values, we identified 453 genes responding to IAPP in absence of C4BP (false discovery rate (FDR) q value < 0.05; Fig. 5A). Top scoring genes were among others JUN and DDIT3 coding for proteins jun proto-oncogene and DNA-damage inducible transcript 3, classical stress induced genes that were both up-regulated in response to IAPP. Gene ontology enrichment identified genes important for “response to organic substance,” “regulation of programmed cell death,” and “cellular lipid metabolism” as most affected, compatible with effects seen previously in IAPP treated cells (18Ritzel R.A.

Furthermore, 227 genes were found differentially expressed in response to IAPP in the presence of C4BP, of which 76 were identified also with IAPP alone and 151 were found to be regulated only in presence of both IAPP and C4BP. Sterol biosynthesis was the dominant Gene Ontology term in genes differentially expressed in the presence of C4BP (Fig. 5B; eight genes showed increased expression, p < 10−6), suggesting that membrane remodeling might be an important mechanism underlying protective effect of C4BP in IAPP treated cells. Prominent genes up-regulated included HMGCR (coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, p = 5.1 × 10−5), the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, and mevalonate (diphospho) decarboxylase that catalyzes mevalonate pyrophosphate into isopentenyl pyrophosphate in one of the early steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, enrichment of cell death-associated genes found in cells stimulated with IAPP alone was no longer observed in C4BP co-treated cells, indicating that the protective effect of C4BP occurs also on the transcriptional level. Ingenuity Pathway analysis confirmed the effects seen using Gene Ontology enrichment with “Superpathway of Cholesterol Biosynthesis” as the top scoring pathway (p < 10−6). To verify the importance of cholesterol in the protective effect of C4BP, INS-1 cells were partially depleted from cholesterol using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) or cholesterol oxidase (CHOD). The depleting effect of MβCD was confirmed by labeling of INS-1 cells with cholesterol binding molecule Filipin III (green) (Fig. 6, A and B). A similar effect was observed for CHOD-treated cells (Fig. 6J). The cell viability of INS-1 cells was then measured after depletion of cholesterol by MβCD and stimulation with 51 μm monomeric IAPP in the presence or absence of 0.3 μm C4BP. An increased binding of Annexin V was observed after incubation of INS-1 cells with IAPP (Fig. 6D), and this effect was diminished in the presence of C4BP as expected (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, the rescuing effect of C4BP was diminished when cells were preincubated with MβCD (Fig. 6, H and I). Cholesterol depletion with MβCD by itself did not affect cell viability in INS-1 cells (Fig. 5, C and F). Similar experiments were performed using CHOD to deplete cholesterol (Fig. 6, J and K), and there was a significantly higher ratio of Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells after IAPP + C4BP/IAPP treatment in CHOD-depleted cells compared with untreated cells with intact cholesterol content (Fig. 6L). These results indicate that membrane-bound cholesterol is important for the rescuing effect of C4BP in IAPP-treated cells. To test the potential signaling pathways involved in the protective mechanism of C4BP, the INS-1 cells were treated with two signaling inhibitors, PI3K inhibitor (Ly29402 hydrochloride) and NF-κΒ inhibitor (BAY112085). Although the NF-κΒ inhibitor did not affect the ratio of apoptotic cells in IAPP + C4BP- versus IAPP-treated cells, the PI3K inhibitor significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 6M). This indicates that the protective effect of C4BP is at least in part elicited by signaling through the PI3K pathway. C4BP was previously demonstrated to bind IAPP (12Sjölander J. Westermark G.T.

Chem. 2012; 287: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and we now show that the presence of C4BP results in attenuation of cytotoxic effects of IAPP. Further, we identified several mechanisms underlying the protective effect of C4BP. First, by modulating fibrillation of IAPP, C4BP may cause a decrease in concentration of IAPP oligomers, which are otherwise able to cause lysis of eukaryotic cells such as erythrocytes. Further, C4BP also protects INS-1 cells from the cytotoxic effect of IAPP. This is likely in part due to lower oligomer concentration in the presence of C4BP. Furthermore, C4BP is also internalized by the INS-1 cells and affects their transcriptional activity. mRNA expression array analyses implicated that C4BP increased cholesterol synthesis, and the importance of cholesterol for the effect of C4BP was confirmed using two cholesterol-depleting reagents. It is well established that incubation of human IAPP with cells results in formation of IAPP oligomers that are cytotoxic (21Caillon L. Hoffmann A.R. Botz A. Khemtemourian L. Molecular structure, membrane interactions, and toxicity of the islet amyloid polypeptide in type 2 diabetes mellitus.J. Diabetes Res. 2016; 2016: 5639875Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is at least in part mediated by direct cell membrane disruption by the oligomers, because the effect was also observed with cell-free lipid bilayers (22Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. The mechanism of islet amyloid polypeptide toxicity is membrane disruption by intermediate-sized toxic amyloid particles.Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We used human erythrocytes as a model to study membrane disruption during incubation with IAPP monomers. No lysis was observed when cells were incubated with IAPP fibrils, and the lytic effect of monomers was abolished in the presence of polymeric C4BP, which contains multiple binding sites for IAPP and thus is able to efficiently cross-link and co-aggregate with IAPP. We previously established that the binding site for IAPP is localized to CCP2 and CCP8 of C4BP, but polymeric mutants lacking one of these domains at a time had the same effect as wt C4BP. This can be explained by the fact that these mutants are still capable of multivalent interactions with IAPP (each mutant has six identical α-chains, each with one binding site for IAPP). Importantly, a C4BP monomer containing all domains except for the C-terminal polymerization fragment but having only two binding sites for IAPP (CCP2 and CCP8) largely lost protective activity. This indicates that the polymeric nature of C4BP containing multiple binding sites for IAPP (theoretically up to 12 simultaneous sites per one molecule of C4BP) is necessary for its protective effect. Interestingly, another large polymeric molecule that binds IAPP but does not cause increased fibril formation (12Sjölander J. Westermark G.T. Renström E. Blom A.M. Islet amyloid polypeptide triggers limited complement activation and binds complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein, which enhances fibril formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), C1q, showed no protective effect on erythrocyte lysis or INS-1 cell viability, indicating that the effect of C4BP is specific. One interesting aspect that requires further studies is that C4BP used in this study was purified from plasma and thus to a large degree is complexed with protein S, which is able to interact with negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine. This ability of C4BP-protein S complex may be involved in its protective role because IAPP aggregation is enhanced in the presence of such lipids (23Knight J.D. Miranker A.D. Phospholipid catalysis of diabetic amyloid assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 24Lopes D.H. Meister A. Gohlke A. Hauser A. Blume A. Winter R. Mechanism of islet amyloid polypeptide fibrillation at lipid interfaces studied by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 3132-3141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The C4BP-protein S complex may therefore interact with both phosphatidylserine and IAPP at the site of fibril formation. However, even recombinant wt C4BP, lacking the ability to bind protein S, had a cytoprotective effect when used in this study, showing that protein S is not necessary for the observed effect. It may, however, have modifying effects in the presence of phosphatidylserine, which will be studied in the future. Interestingly, C4BP has capacity to bind heparan sulfate (25Blom A.M. Webb J. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. A cluster of positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal modules of the C4BP a-chain is crucial for C4b binding and factor I cofactor function.J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2509892519,"We describe the centile trends of the blood pressure, glycemia and lipid profiles as well as renal function of a representative population who participated in the Singapore National Health Survey in 2010. Representative survey population was sampled in two phases, first using geographical/ residential dwelling type stratification, followed up ethnicity. 2,407 survey participants without any self-reported medical or medication history for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia were included in this analysis. All biochemistry analyses were performed on Roche platforms. After excluding outliers using Tukey's criteria, the results of the remaining participants were subjected to lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) analysis. In men, systolic blood pressure increased linearly with age. By contrast, an upward inflection around late 40s was seen in women. The diastolic blood pressure was highest in men in the late 30s-50s age group, and in women in the late 50s-60s age group. All glycemia-related parameters, i.e. fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and HbA1c concentrations increased with age, although the rate of increase differed between the tests. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations increased with age, which became attenuated between the early 30s and late 50s in men, and declined thereafter. In women, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations gradually increased with age until late 30s, when there is an upward inflection, plateauing after late 50s. Our findings indicate that diagnostic performance of laboratory tests for diabetes may be age-sensitive. Unfavourable age-related cardiovascular risk profiles suggest that the burden of cardiovascular disease in this population will increase with aging population."
https://openalex.org/W2517410960,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by occlusion of pulmonary arteries by organized chronic thrombi. Persistent hypoxemia and residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) following successful pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) are clinically important problems; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We have previously reported that residual PH is closely related to severe pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypothesize that this arteriopathy might also be involved in impaired gas exchange. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between hypoxemia and pulmonary arteriopathy after PEA.Between December 2011 and November 2014, 23 CTEPH patients underwent PEA and lung biopsy. The extent of pulmonary arteriopathy was quantified pathologically in lung biopsy specimens. We then analyzed the relationship between the severity of pulmonary arteriopathy and gas exchange after PEA. We observed that the severity of pulmonary arteriopathy was negatively correlated with postoperative and follow-up PaO2 (postoperative PaO2: r = -0.73, p = 0.0004; follow-up PaO2: r = -0.66, p = 0.001), but not with preoperative PaO2 (r = -0.373, p = 0.08). Multivariate analysis revealed that the obstruction ratio and patient age were determinants of PaO2 one month after PEA (R2 = 0.651, p = 0.00009). Furthermore, the obstruction ratio and improvement of pulmonary vascular resistance were determinants of PaO2 at follow-up (R2 = 0.545, p = 0.0002). Severe pulmonary arteriopathy might increase the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and impair diffusion capacity, resulting in hypoxemia following PEA.The severity of pulmonary arteriopathy was closely associated with postoperative and follow-up hypoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2511091720,"Introduction Some Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients die without ever developing cognitively impaired basic activities of daily living (basic ADL), which may reflect slower disease progression or better compensatory mechanisms. Although impaired basic ADL is related to disease severity, it may exert an independent risk for death. This study examined the association between impaired basic ADL and survival of AD patients, and proposed a multistate approach for modeling the time to death for patients who demonstrate different patterns of progression of AD that do or do not include basic ADL impairment. Methods 1029 patients with probable AD at the Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimer’s Disease and Memory Disorders Center met the criteria for this study. Two complementary definitions were used to define development of basic ADL impairment using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale score. A weighted Cox regression model, including a time-dependent covariate (development of basic ADL impairment), and a multistate survival model were applied to examine the effect of basic ADL impairment on survival. Results As expected decreased ability to perform basic ADL at baseline, age at initial visit, years of education, and sex were all associated with significantly higher mortality risk. In those unimpaired at baseline, the development of basic ADL impairment was also associated with a much greater risk of death (hazard ratios 1.77–4.06) over and above the risk conferred by loss of MMSE points. A multi-state Cox model, controlling for those other variables quantified the substantive increase in hazard ratios for death conferred by the development of basic ADL impairment by two definitions and can be applied to calculate the short term risk of mortality in individual patients. Conclusions The current study demonstrates that the presence of basic ADL impairment or the development of such impairments are important predictors of death in AD patients, regardless of severity."
https://openalex.org/W2510862022,"Exposure of murine and human tissues to ionizing radiation (IR) induces the expression of p16INK4a, a tumor suppressor gene and senescence/aging biomarker. Increased p16INK4a expression is often delayed several weeks post exposure to IR. In this context, it remains unclear if it occurs to suppress aberrant cellular growth of potentially transformed cells or is simply a result of IR-induced loss of tissue homeostasis. To address this question, we used a conditional p16INK4a null mouse model and determined the impact of p16INK4a inactivation long-term post exposure to IR. We found that, in vitro, bone marrow stromal cells exposed to IR enter DNA replication following p16INK4a inactivation. However, these cells did not resume growth; instead, they mostly underwent cell cycle arrest in G2. Similarly, delayed inactivation of p16INK4a in mice several weeks post exposure to IR resulted in increased BrdU incorporation and cancer incidence. In fact, we found that the onset of tumorigenesis was similar whether p16INK4a was inactivated before or after exposure to IR. Overall, our results suggest that IR-induced p16INK4a dependent growth arrest is reversible in mice and that sustained p16INK4a expression is necessary to protect against tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2517078262,"GRK2, a G protein-coupled receptor kinase, plays a critical role in cardiac physiology. Adrenergic receptors are the primary target for GRK2 activity in the heart; phosphorylation by GRK2 leads to desensitization of these receptors. As such, levels of GRK2 activity in the heart directly correlate with cardiac contractile function. Furthermore, increased expression of GRK2 after cardiac insult exacerbates injury and speeds progression to heart failure. Despite the importance of this kinase in both the physiology and pathophysiology of the heart, relatively little is known about the role of GRK2 in skeletal muscle function and disease. In this study we generated a novel skeletal muscle-specific GRK2 knock-out (KO) mouse (MLC-Cre:GRK2fl/fl) to gain a better understanding of the role of GRK2 in skeletal muscle physiology. In isolated muscle mechanics testing, GRK2 ablation caused a significant decrease in the specific force of contraction of the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscle yet had no effect on the slow-twitch soleus muscle. Despite these effects in isolated muscle, exercise capacity was not altered in MLC-Cre:GRK2fl/fl mice compared with wild-type controls. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy stimulated by clenbuterol, a β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) agonist, was significantly enhanced in MLC-Cre:GRK2fl/fl mice; mechanistically, this seems to be due to increased clenbuterol-stimulated pro-hypertrophic Akt signaling in the GRK2 KO skeletal muscle. In summary, our study provides the first insights into the role of GRK2 in skeletal muscle physiology and points to a role for GRK2 as a modulator of contractile properties in skeletal muscle as well as β2AR-induced hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2511600960,"To obtain breast vascular map and to assess correlation between predominant feeding vessel and tumor location with a semi-automatic method compared to conventional radiologic reading.148 malignant and 75 benign breast lesions were included. All patients underwent bilateral MR imaging. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before MRI. The local ethics committee granted approval for this study. Semi-automatic breast vascular map and predominant vessel detection was performed on MRI, for each patient. Semi-automatic detection (depending on grey levels threshold manually chosen by radiologist) was compared with results of two expert radiologists; inter-observer variability and reliability of semi-automatic approach were assessed.Anatomic analysis of breast lesions revealed that 20% of patients had masses in internal half, 50% in external half and the 30% in subareolar/central area. As regards the 44 tumors in internal half, based on radiologic consensus, 40 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (61% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 14% by lateral thoracic vessels, 16% by both thoracic vessels and 9% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 38 tumors demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (66% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 11% by lateral thoracic vessels, 9% by both thoracic vessels and 14% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). As regards the 111 tumors in external half, based on radiologic consensus, 91 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (25% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 39% by lateral thoracic vessels, 18% by both thoracic vessels and 18% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 94 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (27% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 45% by lateral thoracic vessels, 4% by both thoracic vessels and 24% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). An excellent agreement between two radiologic assessments (k = 0.81) and between radiologic consensus and semi-automatic assessment (k = 0.80) was found to identify origin of predominant feeding vessel. An excellent reliability for semi-automatic assessment (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96) was reported.Predominant feeding vessel location was correlated with breast lesion location: internal thoracic artery supplied the highest proportion of breasts with tumor in internal half and lateral thoracic artery supplied the highest proportion of breasts with lateral tumor."

https://openalex.org/W2510044011,"The eyes of an individual act as an indispensable communication medium during human social interactions. Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed that several brain regions are activated in response to eyes and eye gaze direction changes. However, it remains unclear whether the temporal pole is one of these regions. Furthermore, if the temporal pole is activated by these stimuli, the timing and manner in which it is activated also remain unclear. To investigate these issues, we analyzed intracranial electroencephalographic data from the temporal pole that were obtained during the presentation of eyes and mosaics in averted or straight directions and their directional changes. Time-frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that the bilateral temporal poles exhibited greater gamma-band activation beginning at 215 ms in response to eyes compared with mosaics, irrespective of the direction. Additionally, the right temporal pole showed greater gamma-band activation beginning at 197 ms in response to directional changes of the eyes compared with mosaics. These results suggest that gamma-band oscillations in the temporal pole were involved in the processing of the presence of eyes and changes in eye gaze direction at a relatively late temporal stage compared with the posterior cortices."

Public exhibitions of scientific instruments can provide hands-on experience with technical advances and their applications in the life sciences. The software of such devices, however, is oftentimes not appropriate for this purpose. In this study, we describe a software framework and the necessary computer configuration that is well suited for exposing a complex self-built and software-controlled instrument such as a microscope to laymen under limited supervision, e.g. in museums or schools. We identify several aspects that must be met by such software, and we describe a design that can simultaneously be used to control either (i) a fully functional instrument in a robust and fail-safe manner, (ii) an instrument that has low-cost or only partially working hardware attached for illustration purposes or (iii) a completely virtual instrument without hardware attached. We describe how to assess the educational success of such a device, how to monitor its operation and how to facilitate its maintenance. The introduced concepts are illustrated using our software to control eduSPIM, a fluorescent light sheet microscope that we are currently exhibiting in a technical museum."
