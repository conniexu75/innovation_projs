https://openalex.org/W2060207881,"Homologous or agonist-specific desensitization of β-adrenergic receptors is thought to be mediated by a specific kinase, the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK). However, recent data suggest that a cofactor is required for this kinase to inhibit receptor function. The complementary DNA for such a cofactor was cloned and found to encode a 418-amino acid protein homologous to the retinal protein arrestin. The protein, termed β-arrestin, was expressed and partially purified. It inhibited the signaling function of βARK-phosphorylated β-adrenergic receptors by more than 75 percent, but not that of rhodopsin. It is proposed that β-arrestin in concert with βARK effects homologous desensitization of β-adrenergic receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2099985524,"The growth-suppressive function of the retinoblastoma gene product, RB, has been ascribed to the underphosphorylated RB form that prevails during G1 phase in the cell cycle. We show that addition of the paracrine growth inhibitor transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) to Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells in mid to late G1 prevents phosphorylation of RB scheduled for this cell cycle stage and arrests cells in late G1. Expression of SV40 T antigen, a transforming protein that binds underphosphorylated RB, does not block the effect of TGF-beta 1 on RB phosphorylation but greatly reduces the growth-inhibitory response to TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 and RB appear to function in a common growth-inhibitory pathway in which TGF-beta 1 acts to retain RB in the underphosphorylated, growth-suppressive state."

https://openalex.org/W2089686093,"A protein kinase characterized by its ability to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), is thought to be an early intermediate in an insulin-stimulated phosphorylation cascade and in a variety of other mammalian cell responses to extracellular signals. A complementary DNA that encodes this protein serine-threonine kinase has been cloned, and the protein designated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1). ERK1 has striking similarity to two protein kinases, KSS1 and FUS3, from yeast. The yeast kinases function in an antagonistic manner to regulate the cell cycle in response to mating factors. Thus, ERK1 and the two yeast kinases constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes involved in regulating the response of eukaryotic cells to extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W2009787193,"We previously used a retroviral vector to mark clones in the postnatal rodent retina and showed that at least two types of neurons and Müller glia can arise from a common progenitor. Here we describe the use of exo utero surgery to introduce a marker retrovirus into the proliferative zone of the retinas of embryonic day 13 and 14 mice. Analysis of marked clones in the resulting adult retinas shows that almost all progenitor cells that continued mitosis were multipotential and that a single progenitor can generate most retinal cell types. The size of marked clones indicates that retinal cells do not employ a stem cell mode of division, but instead, both daughter cells of a progenitor can continue to divide. These results suggest that cell type determination in the rodent retina is independent of lineage. We propose a model for the generation of retinal cell types in which the cessation of mitosis and cell type determination are independent events, controlled by environmental interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2081924229,"We have recently described the isolation of a candidate for the Wilms' tumor susceptibility gene mapping to band p13 of human chromosome 11. This gene, primarily expressed in fetal kidney, appears to encode a DNA binding protein. We now describe a sporadic, unilateral Wilms' tumor in which one allele of this gene contains a 25 bp deletion spanning an exon-intron junction and leading to aberrant mRNA splicing and loss of one of the four zinc finger consensus domains in the protein. The mutation is absent in the affected individual's germline, consistent with the somatic inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. In addition to this intragenic deletion affecting one allele, loss of heterozygosity at loci along the entire chromosome 11 points to an earlier chromosomal nondisjunction and reduplication. We conclude that inactivation of this gene, which we call WT1, is part of a series of events leading to the development of Wilms' tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2057479447,"SV40 early pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced by utilization of two different 5' splice sites and a shared 3' splice site to produce large T and small t mRNAs. The ratio of small t to large T mRNAs produced in human embryonic kidney 293 cells is 10- to 20-fold greater than in other mammalian cells, suggesting the existence of a 293 cell-specific factor that modulates alternative splicing. Here we show that nuclear extracts from 293 cells give rise to significantly more small t splicing than do extracts from HeLa cells. Using an in vitro complementation assay, we have characterized and extensively purified a factor from 293 extracts that brings about striking increases in small t splicing with concomitant decreases in large T splicing. The factor is heat sensitive and micrococcal nuclease resistant, suggesting that it is a protein lacking an accessible RNA component. Purification of the alternative splicing factor indicates that the activity is contained in one of several possibly related polypeptides of 30-35 kd."

https://openalex.org/W2021893003,"One gene activator protein may interfere with the effects of another in eukaryotic cells. We report here that a hybrid yeast-herpes gene activator protein inhibits transcriptional activation by a thymidine-rich DNA element in yeast. This example of activator interference can be faithfully reproduced in vitro. Interference is reversed by a partially purified yeast component, but not by RNA polymerase II or various polymerase II transcription factors. We conclude that the partially purified yeast component is a novel factor, and we suggest this factor mediates the transcriptional activation process."
https://openalex.org/W2078837666,"Cultured hippocampal neurons were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and a wild-type strain of the avian influenza fowl plague virus (FPV). The intracellular distribution of viral glycoproteins was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy. In mature, fully polarized neurons the VSV glycoprotein (a basolateral protein in epithelial MDCK cells) moved from the Golgi complex to the dendritic domain, whereas the hemagglutinin protein of FPV (an apically sorted protein in MDCK cells) was targeted preferentially, but not exclusively, to the axon. The VSV glycoprotein appeared in clusters on the dendritic surface, while the hemagglutinin was distributed uniformly along the axonal membrane. Based on the finding that the same viral glycoproteins are sorted in a polarized fashion in both neuronal and epithelial cells, we propose that the molecular mechanisms of surface protein sorting share common features in the two cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2024905961,"Soluble and hydrophobic lipid breakdown products have a variety of important signaling roles in cells. Here sphingoid bases derived in cells from sphingolipid breakdown are shown to have a potent and direct effect in mediating calcium release from intracellular stores. Sphingosine must be enzymically converted within the cell to a product believed to be sphingosine-1-phosphate, which thereafter effects calcium release from a pool including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium pool. The sensitivity, molecular specificity, and reversibility of the effect on calcium movements closely parallel sphingoid base-mediated inhibition of protein kinase C. Generation of sphingoid bases in cells may activate a dual signaling pathway involving regulation of calcium and protein kinase C, comparable perhaps to the phosphatidylinositol and calcium signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1977347668,"The interaction between the chimeric activator GAL4-VP16, consisting of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and the acidic activation domain of VP16, and its target in the transcriptional machinery was studied in vitro. GAL4-VP16 stimulated transcription from a promoter bearing GAL4 sites, and greatly inhibited transcription from a promoter bearing binding sites for the dA:dT activator and from a basal promoter bearing only a TATA box. Mutations in the acidic domain that reduced activation from the GAL4 site promoter also reduced inhibition from the dA:dT promoter, indicating a similar interaction between VP16 and its target in both processes. Strikingly, if the DNA binding domain of GAL4-VP16 was occupied by a GAL4 site oligonucleotide, the protein inhibited activation by the dA:dT activator but did not inhibit basal transcription. We propose that, under these conditions, GAL4-VP16 acted to titrate an “adaptor” that bridges an interaction between the upstream activator and the basic transcriptional machinery at the TATA box."
https://openalex.org/W1980751552,"We have identified a mitochondrial outer membrane protein of 72 kd (MOM72) that exhibits the properties of an import receptor for the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), the most abundant mitochondrial protein. Monospecific antibodies and Fab fragments against MOM72 selectively inhibit import of AAC at the level of specific binding to the mitochondria. AAC bound to the mitochondrial surface is coprecipitated with antibodies against MOM72 after lysis of mitochondria with detergent. MOM72 thus has a complementary function to that of MOM19, which acts as an import receptor for the majority of mitochondrial proteins studied so far but not for the AAC. The import pathway of the precursor of MOM72 appears to involve MOM19 as receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2094136880,"Monoclonal antibodies that recognize the alpha 2 delta subunits of calcium channels from skeletal muscle immunoprecipitate a complex of alpha 1, alpha 2 delta, beta, and gamma subunits. They also immunoprecipitate 64% of rabbit brain dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. Iodination of partially purified brain calcium channels followed by immunoprecipitation reveals alpha 1-, alpha 2 delta-, and beta-like subunits that have apparent molecular masses of 175, 142, and 57 kd, respectively. A polypeptide of 100 kd is also specifically immunoprecipitated. Immunocytochemical studies identify dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels in neuronal somata and proximal dendrites in rat brain, spinal cord, and retina. Staining of many neuronal somata is uneven, revealing relatively high densities of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels at the base of major dendrites. L-type calcium channels in this location may serve to mediate long-lasting increases in intracellular calcium in the cell body in response to excitatory inputs to the dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W1965586307,"Myocardial ischemia causes heart injury that is characterized by an increase in circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the local production of superoxide anions, the loss of coronary vasodilation (relaxation) in response to agents that release endothelial cell relaxation factor, and cardiac tissue damage. Ischemic injury can be mimicked by TNF. When given before or immediately after ischemic injury, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) reduced the amount of superoxide anions in the coronary circulation, maintained endothelial-dependent coronary relaxation, and reduced injury mediated by exogenous TNF. Thus, TGF-beta prevented severe cardiac injury, perhaps by alleviating damage mediated by increases in circulating TNF."
https://openalex.org/W1514986543,"Polyphosphate kinase (PPK) polymerizes the terminal phosphate of ATP to a long chain polyphosphate (poly(P) or (Pi)n) in a freely reversible reaction (Kornberg, S. R. (1957) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 26, 294-300), nATP in equilibrium nADP + (Pi)n, PPK, now purified to homogeneity, is a tetramer of 69-kDa subunits. Addition of a primer in the synthetic reaction is not required, nor does ATP or inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) serve in this role. PPK is autophosphorylated under the conditions of poly(P) synthesis; Pi is linked by a nitrogen-phosphate bond as judged by its acid lability and alkali stability. Incorporation of phosphate from the isolated phosphoenzyme into poly(P) upon the addition of ATP in the synthetic reaction and its incorporation into ATP upon the addition of ADP indicate phosphoenzyme to be an intermediate in the reaction. At an ATP level of 5 microM, well below its Km of 2 mM, a pronounced lag in poly(P) synthesis can be removed by tetrapolyphosphate but not by Pi, PPi, or tripolyphosphate. The basis for this stimulatory effect is not clear inasmuch as tetrapolyphosphate does not promote the dephosphorylation of the presumed phosphoenzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2126737200,"We mapped the distribution and expression of wild-type and deleted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules in skeletal muscle fibers of patients with mitochondrial disease. We show that ragged red fiber segments, which are characteristic histological features of these myopathies, represent focal accumulations of mitochondria containing predominantly deleted mtDNAs and that the mutant genomes are absent or extremely rare in normal fiber segments. This suggests that the mtDNA mutations play a direct role in focal mitochondrial accumulation. Although levels of wild-type mtDNAs and mRNAs in ragged red fiber segments are near normal, mitochondrial function, as revealed by cytochrome oxidase cytochemistry, is severely impaired. This suggests that the presence of mutant mtDNAs interferes with the expression of coexisting wild-type mtDNAs in these segments at a posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1979315375,"The presence of endothelin, a vasoconstrictor peptide, in the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary suggests that it also regulates neural and other nonvascular target cells. In pituitary gonadotrophs, low doses of endothelin evoked oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration, and high doses induced a biphasic calcium response. Mobilization of intracellular calcium predominated during the spike phase of the calcium response to endothelin, whereas calcium entry through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels contributed to both the spike and plateau phases of the calcium response. Endothelin was a potent as hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in stimulation of gonadotropin release in perifused pituitary cells. Endothelin bound specifically to pituitary cells with a dissociation constant of 70 picomolar, and induced rapid formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacyglycerol. Although intracellular calcium concentration and gonadotropin secretory responses to endothelin were independent to the GnRH receptor, endothelin and GnRH appeared to have a common signal transduction mechanism. These observations suggest that endothelin can act as a neuropeptide to regulate anterior pituitary function."

https://openalex.org/W2046547573,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induction of DNA synthesis is believed to involve activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [I(1,4,5)P3], increase in intracellular Ca2+, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and receptor down regulation. Generation of these events is triggered by the tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity of the PDGF receptor. The TPK inhibitor genistein blocked PDGF induction of these events, including DNA synthesis, with the exception of receptor down regulation. PDGF-induced phosphotyrosine phosphorylations, including receptor autophosphorylation, were inhibited by genistein. Removal of genistein and PDGF resulted in DNA synthesis without the occurrence of PLC activation. These findings indicate that these early events, with the exception of receptor down regulation, are not necessary for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2041816583,"Bacteriophage T4 DNA topoisomerase gene 60 contains a 50 nucleotide untranslated region within the coding sequence of its mRNA. Translational bypass of this sequence by elongating ribosomes has been postulated for the mode of synthesis of an 18 kd polypeptide specified by the split coding segments. Ribosome bypass of the untranslated region also occurs when a segment of gene 60 is fused to lacZ and expressed in E. coli. The efficiency of bypass in these gene 60-lacZ fusions approaches 100%. Here, mutations that delete, insert, or substitute nucleotides from gene 60-lacZ fusions are examined. Essential features necessary for high level gap bypass emerging from this analysis are a cis-acting nascent peptide sequence, a short duplication bordering the gap, and a stop codon contained in a stem-loop structure at the 5' junction of the gap."
https://openalex.org/W1524917676,"We report CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) as another target enzyme of sphingosine actions in addition to the well-characterized protein kinase C. Effects of sphingosine and lysophingolipids were studied on the activity of purified cytidylyltransferase prepared by the method of Weinhold et al. (Weinhold, P. A., Rounsifer, M.E., and Feldman, D.A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5104-5110). The sphingolipids were tested as components of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles, 25 mol% sphingosine inhibited the CT activity by about 50%. The inhibition of CT by sphingosine and lysosphingolipids was reversible. Sphingosine was found to be a reversible inhibitor of CT with respect to the activating lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and fatty acid:phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Egg PC vesicles containing sphingosine, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), glucopsychosine (glucosylsphingosine), and lysosphingomyelin (sphingosylphosphorylcholine) suppressed the activation by PC/oleic acid vesicles, whereas the parent sphingolipids did not. Egg PC vesicles containing oleylamine and hexadecyltrimethylamine inhibited CT activity, whereas egg PC-octylamine vesicles did not alter the enzyme activity. This indicates the importance of an amino group and long alkyl chain. LysoPC, a known detergent, did not inhibit the enzyme activity under the same assay conditions in which sphingosine inhibited. These results are the first report of a lipid inhibitor of purified CT."
https://openalex.org/W1560495619,"The reaction between reduced Pseudomonas nitrite reductase and nitrite has been studied by stopped-flow and rapid-freezing EPR spectroscopy. The interpretation of the kinetics at pH 8.0 is consistent with the following reaction mechanism (where k1 and k3 much greater than k2). [formula: see text] The bimolecular step (Step 1) is very fast, being lost in the dead time of a rapid mixing apparatus; the stoichiometry of the complex has been estimated to correspond to one NO2- molecule/heme d1. The final species is the fully reduced enzyme with NO bound to heme d1; and at all concentrations of nitrite, there is no evidence for dissociation of NO or for further reduction of NO to N2O. Step 2 is assigned to an internal electron transfer from heme c to reduced NO-bound heme d1 occurring with a rate constant of 1 s-1; this rate is comparable to the rate of internal electron transfer previously determined when reducing the oxidized enzyme with azurin or cytochrome c551. When heme d1 is NO-bound, the rate at which heme c can accept electrons from ascorbate is remarkably increased as compared to the oxidized enzyme, suggesting an increase in the redox potential of the latter heme."
https://openalex.org/W1571104445,"In bullfrog (Rana catesbiana) rods the activity of cyclic GMP (cGMP) phosphodiesterase was stimulated 10 times by washing disc membranes with an isotonic, GTP-containing buffer. This stimulation was maintained following hydrolysis of GTP and after removal of guanine nucleotides. At least 60-70% of the inhibitory gamma subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (P gamma) was physically released from membranes by these washing procedures. When cGMP phosphodiesterase was activated by a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue, P gamma was found in the supernatant complexed with the transducin alpha subunit (T alpha) using three chromatography systems. When GTP was used to activate cGMP phosphodiesterase, P gamma was also found in the supernatant complexed with GDP.T alpha. This complex was also isolated using the same three chromatography systems, indicating that P gamma remained tightly bound to T alpha even after bound GTP was hydrolyzed. Interaction with the beta,gamma subunits of transducin, which remained associated with disc membranes, was required for the release of P gamma from the GDP.T alpha complex, which resulted in the deactivation of active cGMP phosphodiesterase. We conclude that during activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase, P gamma is complexed with T alpha (both GTP and GDP forms) in the supernatant and that, following GTP hydrolysis, beta,gamma subunits of transducin are necessary for the release of P gamma from the complex and the resulting inactivation of cGMP phosphodiesterase in frog photoreceptors."

https://openalex.org/W1521436470,"RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, and RNA (guanine-7)-methyltransferase activities are associated with the vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme, a heterodimeric protein containing polypeptides of Mr 95,000 and Mr 31,000. The genes encoding the large and small subunits (corresponding to the D1 and the D12 ORFs, respectively, of the viral genome) were coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Guanylyltransferase activity (assayed as the formation of a covalent enzyme-guanylate complex) was detected in soluble lysates of these bacteria. A 1000-fold purification of the guanylyltransferase was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography using phosphocellulose and SP5PW columns. Partially purified guanylytransferase synthesized GpppA caps when provided with 5'-triphosphate-terminated poly(A) as a cap acceptor. In the presence of AdoMet the enzyme catalyzed concomitant cap methylation with 99% efficiency. Inclusion of S-adenosyl methionine increased both the rate and extent of RNA capping, permitting quantitative modification of RNA 5' ends. Guanylyltransferase sedimented as a single component of 6.5 S during further purification in a glycerol gradient; this S value is identical with that of the heterodimeric capping enzyme from vaccinia virions. Electrophoretic analysis showed a major polypeptide of Mr 95,000 cosedimenting with the guanylyltransferase. RNA triphosphatase activity cosedimented exactly with guanylyltransferase. Methyltransferase activity was associated with guanylyltransferase and was also present in less rapidly sedimenting fractions. The methyltransferase activity profile correlated with the presence of a Mr 31,000 polypeptide. These results indicate that the D1 and D12 gene products are together sufficient to catalyze all three enzymatic steps in cap synthesis. A model for the domain structure of this enzyme is proposed."

Here, we show that a cell-free extract prepared from developing embryos of the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides catalyzes accurate and efficient SL addition to a synthetic pre-mRNA at an authentic trans splice acceptor site. SL addition occurs via a trans splicing reaction that proceeds through Y-branched intermediates. The branchpoint is located at either of two adenosine residues located 18 and 19 nucleotides upstream of the splice acceptor site."
https://openalex.org/W1558027963,"The archaebacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus, is a strict anaerobe that grows optimally at 100 degrees C by a fermentative-type metabolism in which H2 and CO2 are the only detectable products. Tungsten is known to stimulate the growth of this organism. A red-colored tungsten-containing protein (abbreviated RTP) that is redox-active and extremely thermostable has been purified. RTP is a monomer of Mr = 85,000 and contains approximately 6 iron, 1 tungsten, and 4 acid-labile sulfide atoms/molecule. Titrations using visible spectroscopy were consistent with the oxidation and reduction of the protein each requiring two electrons/molecule, suggesting that these metals and the sulfide are arranged in two redox active centers. P. furiosus ferredoxin served as an electron acceptor for the protein. Dithionite-reduced RTP exhibited a remarkable and complex EPR spectrum at 6 K with g values ranging from 1.3 to 10.0. This was shown to arise from the spin-coupling interaction of two paramagnetic centers. One (center A) has a S = 3/2 spin system (effective g values: gx = 3.33, gy = 4.75, and gz = 1.92, where D = 4.3 cm-1 and lambda = 0.135), whereas the EPR properties of the other (center B) could not be deduced. Nevertheless, theoretical analyses show how the redox properties of both centers may be determined using EPR spectroscopy. Their midpoint potentials (Em) at 20 degrees C and pH 8.0 are -410 mV (center A) and -500 mV (center B) with an effective potential for the spin coupled system (Em, A + B) of -505 mV. The Em values are dependent on temperature (delta Em/delta T = -2 mV/degrees C between 20 and 70 degrees C) and pH with pK alpha values of 8.0 (A) and approximately 8.5 (B). The Em values at 100 degrees C, the growth temperature, were estimated at -590, -650, and -660 mV for centers A, B, and A + B, respectively. These data indicate that RTP catalyzes a dehydrogenase-type reaction of extremely low potential, which involves the transfer of two protons and of two electrons, to and from two adjacent and interacting but nonidentical metal centers."
https://openalex.org/W2063529080,"The ability of transposable elements (TEs) to insert into or excise out of a genetic locus can be regulated by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Tissue- or organ-specific activity of TEs is a frequent and well-characterized example of spatial, developmental regulation. Regulation of the timing of TE activity during ontogeny is less well understood. To analyze timing, TE-induced variegation was quantified in the aleurone of maize kernels, a tissue composed of only a single layer of cells, and sector sizes were assigned to specific cell divisions in aleurone development. Three TE families, Mu, Spm, and Ac/Ds, were studied at two genetic loci. It was found that the frequency of transposon excision changes drastically (up to 30-fold increase or equivalent decrease) during the proliferation of the aleurone. Moreover, these changes occur at the same cell divisions in all three TE families. These results suggest that the timing of TE excision during maize development can be controlled by the host."
https://openalex.org/W1545482900,"The influence of intracellular sodium concentration ( [Na+]i) on the number of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase pumps was examined in cortical collecting tubules (CCD) of kidneys from rabbits in different aldosterone conditions. Specific [3H]ouabain binding was measured in isolated CCD with various [Na+]i. Experiments were performed on adrenalectomized rabbits receiving only a substitutive dose of dexamethasone and on adrenalectomized rabbits replete with aldosterone. In aldosterone-replete rabbits, the number of binding sites increased linearly with [Na+]i, from 16 fmol/nl tubular volume at 15 mM Na+i to 39 fmol/nl tubular volume at 140 mM Na+i. Neither actinomycin D (5 microM) nor cycloheximide (10 microM) prevented this [Na+]i-dependent increase. In adrenalectomized rabbits, the number of ouabain-binding sites was reduced and did not increase with [Na+]i. These results are in favor of the presence of a latent pool of pumps in CCD, rapidly recruited under [Na+]i influence. Aldosterone appears to be required for the constitution and/or activation of this pool."
https://openalex.org/W1493777980,"Prolonged exposure (40 h) of Swiss 3T3 cells to bombesin induced homologous desensitization to bombesin and structurally related peptides including mammalian gastrin releasing peptide (GRP). The ability of bombesin to mobilize intracellular Ca2+, inhibit epidermal growth factor binding, and stimulate DNA synthesis was profoundly and selectively inhibited. In contrast, Ca2+ mobilization by either vasopressin or bradykinin was unaffected, indicating that chronic desensitization is mechanistically distinct from acute desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization. Prolonged (24 or 40 h) pretreatment with bombesin also induced a 78 +/- 5% loss of bombesin receptor binding sites in both intact and plasma membrane preparations of Swiss 3T3 cells without an apparent change in receptor affinity (Kd = 1.9 +/- 0.1 x 10(-9) M and Kd = 1.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(-9) M for control and pretreated cells, respectively). Loss of 125I-GRP binding was slow and progressive with half-maximal loss of binding occurring after 7 h and maximal after approximately 14 h. Cross-linking of 125I-GRP to intact cultures and membrane preparations revealed an identical time-dependent loss of the Mr = 75,000-85,000 cross-linked band, previously identified as the bombesin receptor. Prolonged exposure of the cells to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, epidermal growth factor, cholera toxin, or mitogenic combinations of these agents did not alter 125I-GRP binding. Receptor down-regulation and loss of mitogenic responsiveness to bombesin were: (a) induced in a parallel dose-dependent manner by bombesin (ED50 = 1 nM), GRP (ED50 = 2 nM), and neuromedin B (ED50 = 20 nM), but not by the biologically inactive fragment GRP (1-16); (b) inhibited by the specific bombesin antagonist [Leu13-psi(CH2NH)-Leu14] bombesin, and (c) reversed upon removal of bombesin with a similar time course (full recovery after 15 h). On the basis of these observations, we propose that prolonged pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin induces homologous desensitization to peptides of the bombesin family by down-regulation of cell surface bombesin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2020140262,"Human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a connective tissue cell mitogen comprised of two related chains encoded by distinct genes. The B chain is the homolog of the v-sis oncogene product. Properties that distinguish these ligands include greater transforming potency of the B chain and more efficient secretion of the A chain. By a strategy involving the generation of PDGF A and B chimeras, these properties were mapped to distinct domains of the respective molecules. Increased transforming efficiency segregated with the ability to activate both α and β PDGF receptors. These findings genetically map PDGF B residues 105 to 144 as responsible for conformational alterations critical to β PDGF receptor interaction and provide a mechanistic basis for the greater transforming potency of the PDGF B chain."
https://openalex.org/W2079628786,"Mannose 6-phosphate receptors carry newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to prelysosomes and then return to the TGN to carry out another round of lysosomal enzyme delivery. Although clathrin-coated vesicles mediate the export of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from the TGN, nothing is known about the transport vesicles used to carry these receptors back to the TGN. Two different in vitro assays used in this study show that an antibody that interferes with clathrin assembly blocks receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but has no effect on the recycling of the 300-kilodalton mannose 6-phosphate receptor from prelysosomes to the TGN. These results suggest that the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from prelysosomes to the TGN does not involve clathrin."
https://openalex.org/W1580707289,"Ten spontaneous and four in vitro constructed mutations in the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae display very different phenotypes. The DNA nucleotide sequence of each spontaneous mutation was determined. Mutations were found in both the cAMP-binding domains and proximal to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site. The latter mutations exhibited dominant traits when gene dosage was increased. The variation of phenotypes of sra1 mutations was examined. Many aspects of growth are affected, including growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, accumulation of glycogen, ability to sporulate, and ability to survive starvation. The null mutations affect all these traits. None of the spontaneous mutations confer the null phenotype. Instead, these mutations can be placed into groups of increasing severity based on the number of traits affected. These traits reflect the functions of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase substrates and ranking of sra1 phenotypes probably reflects a progressive defect in one or more aspects of the regulatory subunit function."
https://openalex.org/W1489769917,"The D1 gene encoding the large subunit of vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Guanylyltransferase activity (assayed as the formation of a covalent enzyme-guanylate complex) was detected in soluble lysates of these bacteria. Two major species of protein-GMP complex were formed, one of Mr 95,000 (corresponding in size to the D1 gene product) and one of Mr 60,000. Partial purification of the guanylyltransferase was effected by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The expressed large subunit synthesized GpppA caps when provided with 5'-triphosphate-terminated poly(A) as a cap acceptor, but was unable to catalyze cap methylation in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. Thus, the small capping enzyme subunit was shown to be dispensable for guanylylation, but required for cap methylation of RNA. The Mr 95,000 and Mr 60,000 protein-GMP forming activities were resolved during centrifugation in a glycerol gradient; the two forms sedimented at 5.5 S and 4.4 S, respectively, consistent with each enzyme form being a monomer. Either species catalyzed GMP transfer to an RNA acceptor. The isolated Mr 95,000 guanylyltransferase could be converted to an active Mr 60,000 form in vitro by limited proteolysis with trypsin. Expression of carboxyl-deleted forms of the D1 gene product in E. of carboxyl-deleted forms of the D1 gene product in E. coli further localized the guanylyltransferase domain to the amino two-thirds of the Mr 95,000 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1598521429,"A rabbit skeletal muscle dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor can be purified as an alpha 1-alpha 2-delta-beta-gamma complex, of which alpha 2 and delta are disulfide bonded. This complex has Ca2+ channel activity when incorporated into lipid bilayers. We reported recently that expression of alpha 1 in murine L cells (LCa cells) leads to appearance of both DHP binding and Ca2+ currents, and that we failed to detect alpha 2 by immunoblotting. LCa cell Ca2+ channel currents resembled those in rabbit skeletal muscle in their sensitivity to both voltage and the DHP agonist Bay K 8644, but differed in that they responded to depolarization much more slowly. We now report details of the molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding the 1857-amino acid long alpha 1 transfected into the L cells and results from studies on expression of beta, as well as, on allosteric regulation of DHP binding to these cells. The alpha 1 cDNA was cloned by a combination of cDNA library screening (5355 base pairs) and chemical synthesis (508 base pairs). Using rabbit labeled beta cDNA, which cross-reacts with murine beta mRNA, we failed to observe cross-hybridizing beta mRNA in LCa cells. Using a labeled single stranded 200-base long rabbit alpha 2 cDNA that cross-reacts with mouse alpha 2 mRNA, we likewise failed to observe cross-hybridizing alpha 2 mRNA in LCa cells and hence confirmed the absence of an endogenous murine alpha 2 in these cells. Using LCa cell membranes as DHP receptor source we found the binding of the DHP antagonist (+)-[3H]PN200-110 to be regulated by both verapamil and diltiazem as it is in rabbit skeletal muscle membranes. However, we noted a difference; at concentrations above 10(-6) M, verapamil inhibited residual DHP binding in LCa but not in skeletal muscle membranes. We conclude that neither alpha 2 nor beta are essential for expression of alpha 1 on the cell surface, or for its functioning as a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, or for its allosteric regulation of DHP binding by Ca2+ channel antagonists. The studies neither exclude roles for gamma and delta, nor for alpha 2 or beta in determining more subtle properties of this channel."
https://openalex.org/W1508595877,"Cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is the major excreted protein of transformed mouse NIH 3T3 cells. Previous studies have shown that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides associated with the secreted hydrolase contain mannose 6-phosphate (Man 6-P), the recognition marker for transport of newly synthesized acid hydrolases to lysosomes. To investigate the mechanism by which cathepsin L evades targeting to lysosomes, we determined the structure of the enzyme's oligosaccharides and analyzed its interaction with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate (Man 6-PCl) receptor. Oligosaccharides associated with procathepsin L isolated from the medium of [3H]mannose-labeled J774 cells were remarkably homogeneous; all of the radiolabeled structures were high mannose-type units that contained two phosphomonoesters and 7 mannose residues. Both the alpha 1,3- and alpha 1,6-branches of the oligosaccharides were phosphorylated. Oligosaccharides released by endoglycosidase H from [3H]mannose-labeled procathepsin L bound to a Man 6-PCl receptor affinity column. Despite the high affinity binding of these oligosaccharides, the intact glycoprotein was not a good ligand for the Man 6-PCl receptor. Procathepsin L was internalized poorly by Man 6-P receptor-mediated endocytosis and the purified acid protease interacted weakly with a Man 6-PCl affinity column. In contrast, pro-beta-glucuronidase (another acid hydrolase produced by J774 cells) was an excellent ligand for the Man 6-PCl receptor as judged by the endocytosis and affinity chromatographic assays. Phosphorylated oligosaccharides associated with the J774-secreted pro-beta-glucuronidase were heterogeneous and contained both mono- and diphosphorylated species. Tryptic glycopeptides generated from [3H]mannose-labeled procathepsin L, unlike the intact protein, were excellent ligands for the Man 6-PCl receptor. The results indicate that oligosaccharides associated with procathepsin L are processed uniformly to diphosphorylated species that bind with high affinity to the Man 6-PCl receptor. Protein determinants inherent within the intact acid hydrolase, however, inhibit the high affinity binding of these oligosaccharides and, as a result, impair the interaction of procathepsin L with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W143943708,"Deglycosylation of thyrotropin (TSH) and gonadotropins by chemical methods virtually abolishes their biological activity without impairing receptor binding activity. Recent reports have suggested that enzymatic deglycosylation, using endoglycosidases caused a much smaller decrease, if any, in the potency of the glycoprotein hormones without altering the Vmax. However, in these studies complete removal of the carbohydrate chains from the hormones was not unequivocally documented. We have prepared completely deglycosylated bovine TSH by endoglycosidase F digestion of its subunits, which were more readily deglycosylated than the intact hormone. The deglycosylated subunits were separated from any incompletely digested subunits by concanavalin A affinity chromatography. Carbohydrate compositional analysis, using a highly sensitive pulsed amperometric detection method coupled to ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, was performed to ascertain the complete removal of the glycan moieties from the subunits. The deglycosylated subunits thus prepared were recombined to obtain deglycosylated TSH dimer. Receptor binding activity of bTSH was minimally affected by the carbohydrate removal. In an in vitro bioassay using stimulation of cyclic AMP production in FRTL-5 cells, deglycosylated bTSH showed reduced activity with a potency 5-10-fold lower than that of control, although the Vmax remained unaltered. In contrast, the deglycosylated bTSH showed a reduction in Vmax, when assayed for its adenylyl cyclase stimulating activity in bovine thyroid membranes. Previous reports using chemical methods have apparently overestimated the effects of deglycosylation, probably because of altered protein conformation, while those using endoglycosidases have apparently underestimated these effects, probably because of incomplete deglycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1501146346,"2',3'-Cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP1 and CNP2 with Mr of 46,000 and 48,000, respectively) is the major enzyme of central nervous system myelin. It is associated with oligodendroglial plasma membrane and uncompacted myelin (myelin-like fraction), which are in contact with glial cytoplasm. Proteins of the myelin-like fraction were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid in brain slices from 17-day-old rats and immunoprecipitated with anti-CNP antiserum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of immunoprecipitated material revealed intense acylation of CNP1 and CNP2, and radioactivity was released by hydroxylamine. Palmitic acid was covalently bound to CNP because radioactivity was not removed by extraction of immunoprecipitated CNP with organic solvent or by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol. However, treatment of immunoprecipitated CNP with (a) hydroxylamine-released palmitohydroxamate and palmitic acid, (b) sodium borohydride-released hexadecanol, and (c) methanolic-KOH-released methyl palmitate. Synthesis, acylation, or transport of CNP was not affected by monensin or colchicine. However, acylation of CNP was inhibited 24-32% by cycloheximide. These results provide conclusive evidence that CNP1 and CNP2 are fatty acid acylated with palmitate through a thioester linkage and is posttranslationally modified sometime after synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1556861001,"We have constructed novel chimeric receptors consisting of the activation region of the herpes simplex virus transcription factor VP16 inserted into the amino-terminal region of the human estrogen receptor containing or lacking the hormone-binding region. By gene transfer into mammalian cells, these chimeric receptors behave in a hormone-dependent or hormone-independent manner, respectively, and are more efficient activators of gene expression than wild-type estrogen receptor. These studies indicate that a potent activation region from a viral transcription factor can be placed under hormonal control when introduced into a steroid receptor molecule and can enhance the receptor's potency (approximately 10-fold) in activating specific gene expression. It is likely that such chimeric molecules could be designed to increase selected target gene responses to any intracellular receptor in the course of cellular transfection, transformation, or transgenic animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1611622104,"Changes of the apparent Mr values and the circular dichroism patterns suggest the existence of three relatively stable conformers of rabbit muscle adenylate kinase (RMAK). The effects of dithiothreitol (DTT) which stimulates activity, pH, the substrates, and ATP on the Mr value and the Stokes radius of RMAK were determined from gel filtration data, and apparent Mr values near 22,000, 26,000, and 29,000 resulted. Substrates generated multiple Mr values, suggesting the presence of multiple conformers of RMAK. The higher apparent Mr values were obtained in the presence of DTT and at the higher substrate concentrations, indicating more open conformations. The effect of the substrates on the conformation of RMAK is discussed in relation to the kinetic mechanism of this random bireactant system. Circular dichroism studies were undertaken in order to observe any changes in the secondary structures of RMAK in relation to changes of the Mr values. The secondary structure composition of RMAK, determined under our conditions, does not agree with results determined from crystallographic studies. The gel filtration and the CD studies suggest that above pH 7 a more open conformation of RMAK obtains in the presence of DTT. The results of these studies are discussed with reference to the location of the active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1599448345,"The mini-P1 plasmid origin of replication is contained on a 246 base pair (bp) piece of DNA. At one end there are five 19-bp binding sites for the P1 initiator protein, RepA, and near the other end there are two 9-bp DnaA protein-binding sites. To further define the limits of the origin, we cloned the origin region in M13 and constructed deletions of either end. We sequenced the DNA and tested the replicative form I DNA of the deletion phages for their ability to support RepA-dependent DNA replication in an in vitro system. The origin that is functional in vitro could be reduced to 202 bp. It includes three intact and one incomplete RepA-binding sites at one end and the two DnaA-binding sites at the other end. When the two naturally occurring DnaA-binding sites were replaced with one or two synthetic sites, only the construction containing two sites was active in vitro. We found that the minimal origin that is functional in vivo contains all of the five RepA and the two DnaA-binding sites. Mini-P1 plasmid replication both in vivo and in vitro requires two initiator proteins, the Escherichia coli DnaA protein and the P1 RepA protein. We have found that the ADP form of DnaA is as active as the ATP form of the protein in the in vitro replication of mini-P1. In contrast, only the ATP form is active for in vitro replication of plasmids carrying the E. coli origin (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 52, 743-755)."
https://openalex.org/W1528353143,"Fresh chicken breast and beef incubated in water were found to contain no o-Tyr at the current levels of detection (0.1 ppm) by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and selective ion monitoring. In contrast, samples incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of ethanol, benzene, or carbon tetrachloride (used in fat extraction) contained large quantities (2.5-5.1 ppm) of o-Tyr. No o-Tyr was detected in the water-insoluble fraction of meat treated with carbon tetrachloride after triple extraction by water. However, reaction of radiation generated .OH in gamma-irradiated fresh chicken tissue with endogenous phenylalanine yields o-Tyr with a linear yield-dose response in both water-soluble and -insoluble tissue fractions. Nonradiolytically generated .OH is suggested to be formed through a mitochondrion-mediated Haber-Weiss reaction in association with water-soluble proteins since the yields of o-Tyr in beef, a tissue with a higher mitochondrial content, are four times greater than in the chicken breast tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1479756876,"Radical production from 3,5-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-4-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1,4- dihydropyridine (DDEP) in rat liver microsomes has been attributed to one-electron oxidation via cytochrome P-450 followed by extrusion of an ethyl radical. In the presence of the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl 1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN), this radical was detected as the 4-POBN/ethyl radical adduct by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The addition of catalase resulted in over a 50% decrease in radical production. The concentration of the 4-POBN/ethyl radical adduct increased about 9-fold in the presence of EDTA and approximately 2-fold in the presence of either diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or deferoxamine mesylate. When DDEP was incubated with deferoxamine mesylate-washed microsomes and NADPH in Chelex-treated incubation buffer, much less 4-POBN/ethyl radical formation occurred. Addition of either DTPA, EDTA, or the ferric complexes of these chelators greatly stimulated production of the 4-POBN/ethyl radical adduct in this system. These results suggest that the ethyl radicals produced from DDEP in a microsomal system arise via trace transition metal-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1564021566,"Addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) to intact Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39) depolarized by high K+ concentrations results in activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) (at GTP gamma S concentrations greater than 0.1 mM), inhibition of adenylate cyclase (between 10 microM and 0.5 mM), and activation of adenylate cyclase (above 0.5 mM). Since GTP gamma S-induced activation of PLC is dramatically enhanced upon receptor-mediated stimulation of PLC by alpha-thrombin, we conclude that in depolarized CCL39 cells GTP gamma S directly activates various guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) coupled to PLC (Gp(s)) and to adenylate cyclase (Gi and Gs). Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin strongly inhibits GTP gamma S-induced activation of PLC and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. GTP gamma S cannot be replaced by other nucleotides, except by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), which mimics after a lag period of 15-20 min all the effects of GTP gamma S, with the same concentration dependence and the same sensitivity to pertussis toxin. We suggest that GDP beta S is converted in cells into GTP beta S, which acts as GTP gamma S. Since cell viability is not affected by a transient depolarization, these observations provide a simple method to examine long-term effects of G protein activation on DNA synthesis. We show that a transient exposure of G0-arrested CCL39 cells to GTP gamma S or GDP beta S under depolarizing conditions is not sufficient by itself to induce a significant mitogenic response, but markedly potentiates the mitogenic action of fibroblast growth factor, a mitogen known to activate a receptor-tyrosine kinase. The potentiating effect is maximal after 60 min of pretreatment with 2 mM GTP gamma S. GDP beta S is equally efficient but only after a lag period of 15-20 min. Mitogenic effects of both guanine nucleotide analogs are suppressed by pertussis toxin. Since the activation of G proteins by GTP gamma S under these conditions vanishes after a few hours, we conclude that a transient activation of G proteins facilitates the transition G0----G1 in CCL39 cells, whereas tyrosine kinase-induced signals are sufficient to mediate the progression into S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1597962186,"The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine causes marked reductions in the amounts of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) molecular forms in primary tissue cultures of avian pectoral muscle. These reductions are time-dependent, requiring passage of 3 h prior to any observable response, dose-dependent, with principal actions occurring in the 1-100 nM range, are greater on the 7 S and 19 S forms than on the 11.4 S form, and, based on susceptibility of AchE to irreversible inhibition by a cationic inhibitor, occur almost exclusively with intracellular AchE coincident with a 2-fold reduction in the rate of secretion. The effects are markedly more pronounced in skeletal muscle than in neurons and differ from those observed for verapamil, diltiazem, and the calcium ionophore A23187. These reductions are incompatible with accelerated protein degradation, alterations in posttranslational processing and assembly in the Golgi complex, or enhanced loss of enzyme to the medium, but instead indicate that nifedipine causes a reduction in AchE biosynthesis. Since AchE forms are thought to arise from a single gene, these findings imply a linkage in skeletal muscle between transcription and posttranscriptional processing of mRNA and ligand occupation of the dihydropyridine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1655061882,"Abstract The crk oncogene product, P47gag-crk, was expressed and purified using a baculovirus expression system. Approximately 2-10 mg of P47gag-crk was produced in 10(9) insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus. Partially purified P47gag-crk was obtained by precipitation in a low salt buffer and gel filtration. A better purification of P47gag-crk was achieved by immunoaffinity chromatography, resulting in a single band by Coomassie Blue staining. The insect cells expressing P47gag-crk showed an increase in protein-phosphotyrosine content, which is a characteristic feature of crk-transformed cells. Moreover, like P47gag-crk produced in chicken or rat cells, P47gag-crk produced in insect cells associated in vitro with a tyrosine kinase and its substrates from Crk-3Y1 cells. Peptide mapping of P47gag-crk expressed in insect, rat, and chicken cells showed that similar sites were phosphorylated in these proteins. These data suggest that P47gag-crk expressed in insect cells is functional and will be useful for the further analysis of this protein."
