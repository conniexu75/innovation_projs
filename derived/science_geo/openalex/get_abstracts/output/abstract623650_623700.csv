https://openalex.org/W2902652978,"Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data."
https://openalex.org/W2904975846,"Proteins and RNA functionally and physically intersect in multiple biological processes, however, currently no universal method is available to purify protein-RNA complexes. Here, we introduce XRNAX, a method for the generic purification of protein-crosslinked RNA, and demonstrate its versatility to study the composition and dynamics of protein-RNA interactions by various transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. We show that XRNAX captures all RNA biotypes and use this to characterize the sub-proteomes that interact with coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and to identify hundreds of protein-RNA interfaces. Exploiting the quantitative nature of XRNAX, we observe drastic remodeling of the RNA-bound proteome during arsenite-induced stress, distinct from autophagy-related changes in the total proteome. In addition, we combine XRNAX with crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) to validate the interaction of ncRNA with lamin B1 and EXOSC2. Thus, XRNAX is a resourceful approach to study structural and compositional aspects of protein-RNA interactions to address fundamental questions in RNA-biology."

Although mRNA m6A modifications have been extensively studied and shown to play critical roles in many cellular processes, the identity of m6A methyltransferases for rRNAs and the function of rRNA m6A modifications are unknown. Here we report a new m6A methyltransferase, ZCCHC4, which primarily methylates human 28S rRNA and also interacts with a subset of mRNAs. ZCCHC4 knockout eliminates m6A4220 modification in 28S rRNA, reduces global translation, and inhibits cell proliferation. We also find that ZCCHC4 protein is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors, and ZCCHC4 knockout significantly reduces tumor size in a xenograft mouse model. Our results highlight the functional significance of an rRNA m6A modification in translation and in tumor biology."
https://openalex.org/W2903050755,"Chemotherapy results in a frequent yet poorly understood syndrome of long-term neurological deficits. Neural precursor cell dysfunction and white matter dysfunction are thought to contribute to this debilitating syndrome. Here, we demonstrate persistent depletion of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in humans who received chemotherapy. Developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapy-induced neurological dysfunction, we find a similar depletion of white matter OPCs, increased but incomplete OPC differentiation, and a persistent deficit in myelination. OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy. These findings indicate that methotrexate chemotherapy exposure is associated with persistent tri-glial dysregulation and identify inflammatory microglia as a therapeutic target to abrogate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

https://openalex.org/W2952766192,"Deep catalogs of genetic variation from thousands of humans enable the detection of intraspecies constraint by identifying coding regions with a scarcity of variation. While existing techniques summarize constraint for entire genes, single gene-wide metrics conceal regional constraint variability within each gene. Therefore, we have created a detailed map of constrained coding regions (CCRs) by leveraging variation observed among 123,136 humans from the Genome Aggregation Database. The most constrained CCRs are enriched for pathogenic variants in ClinVar and mutations underlying developmental disorders. CCRs highlight protein domain families under high constraint and suggest unannotated or incomplete protein domains. The highest-percentile CCRs complement existing variant prioritization methods when evaluating de novo mutations in studies of autosomal dominant disease. Finally, we identify highly constrained CCRs within genes lacking known disease associations. This observation suggests that CCRs may identify regions under strong purifying selection that, when mutated, cause severe developmental phenotypes or embryonic lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2903023353,"Accumulation of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) on immune-related gene promoters underlies robust transcription during trained immunity. However, the molecular basis for this remains unknown. Here we show three-dimensional chromatin topology enables immune genes to engage in chromosomal contacts with a subset of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) we have defined as immune gene-priming lncRNAs (IPLs). We show that the prototypical IPL, UMLILO, acts in cis to direct the WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5)-mixed lineage leukemia protein 1 (MLL1) complex across the chemokine promoters, facilitating their H3K4me3 epigenetic priming. This mechanism is shared amongst several trained immune genes. Training mediated by β-glucan epigenetically reprograms immune genes by upregulating IPLs in manner dependent on nuclear factor of activated T cells. The murine chemokine topologically associating domain lacks an IPL, and the Cxcl genes are not trained. Strikingly, the insertion of UMLILO into the chemokine topologically associating domain in mouse macrophages resulted in training of Cxcl genes. This provides strong evidence that lncRNA-mediated regulation is central to the establishment of trained immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2904345154,"Animals and humans display two types of response to noxious stimuli. The first includes reflexive defensive responses that prevent or limit injury; a well-known example of these responses is the quick withdrawal of one’s hand upon touching a hot object. When the first-line response fails to prevent tissue damage (for example, a finger is burnt), the resulting pain invokes a second-line coping response—such as licking the injured area to soothe suffering. However, the underlying neural circuits that drive these two strings of behaviour remain poorly understood. Here we show in mice that spinal neurons marked by coexpression of TAC1Cre and LBX1Flpo drive coping responses associated with pain. Ablation of these spinal neurons led to the loss of both persistent licking and conditioned aversion evoked by stimuli (including skin pinching and burn injury) that—in humans—produce sustained pain, without affecting any of the reflexive defensive reactions that we tested. This selective indifference to sustained pain resembles the phenotype seen in humans with lesions of medial thalamic nuclei1–3. Consistently, spinal TAC1-lineage neurons are connected to medial thalamic nuclei by direct projections and via indirect routes through the superior lateral parabrachial nuclei. Furthermore, the anatomical and functional segregation observed at the spinal level also applies to primary sensory neurons. For example, in response to noxious mechanical stimuli, MRGPRD- and TRPV1-positive nociceptors are required to elicit reflexive and coping responses, respectively. Our study therefore reveals a fundamental subdivision within the cutaneous somatosensory system, and challenges the validity of using reflexive defensive responses to measure sustained pain. In mice, the ablation of spinal neurons that co-express TAC1 and LBX1 leads to the loss of coping responses to sustained pain without affecting reflexive defensive reactions to external threats."
https://openalex.org/W2903143832,"Seventy percent of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER), and agents that target the ER are the mainstay of treatment. However, virtually all people with ER+ breast cancer develop resistance to ER-directed agents in the metastatic setting. Beyond mutations in the ER itself, which occur in 25-30% of people treated with aromatase inhibitors1-4, knowledge about clinical resistance mechanisms remains incomplete. We identified activating HER2 mutations in metastatic biopsies from eight patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer who had developed resistance to aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen or fulvestrant. Examination of treatment-naive primary tumors in five patients showed no evidence of pre-existing mutations in four of five patients, suggesting that these mutations were acquired under the selective pressure of ER-directed therapy. The HER2 mutations and ER mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting a distinct mechanism of acquired resistance to ER-directed therapies. In vitro analysis confirmed that the HER2 mutations conferred estrogen independence as well as-in contrast to ER mutations-resistance to tamoxifen, fulvestrant and the CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib. Resistance was overcome by combining ER-directed therapy with the irreversible HER2 kinase inhibitor neratinib."
https://openalex.org/W2804114237,"The electric field induced quantum phase transition from topological to conventional insulator has been proposed as the basis of a topological field effect transistor [1-4]. In this scheme an electric field can switch 'on' the ballistic flow of charge and spin along dissipationless edges of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulator [5-9], and when 'off' is a conventional insulator with no conductive channels. Such as topological transistor is promising for low-energy logic circuits [4], which would necessitate electric field-switched materials with conventional and topological bandgaps much greater than room temperature, significantly greater than proposed to date [6-8]. Topological Dirac semimetals(TDS) are promising systems in which to look for topological field-effect switching, as they lie at the boundary between conventional and topological phases [3,10-16]. Here we use scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to show that mono- and bilayer films of TDS Na3Bi [3,17] are 2D topological insulators with bulk bandgaps >400 meV in the absence of electric field. Upon application of electric field by doping with potassium or by close approach of the STM tip, the bandgap can be completely closed then re-opened with conventional gap greater than 100 meV. The large bandgaps in both the conventional and quantum spin Hall phases, much greater than the thermal energy kT = 25 meV at room temperature, suggest that ultrathin Na3Bi is suitable for room temperature topological transistor operation."
https://openalex.org/W2903497964,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome in which glioma is one of the prevalent tumors. Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations. Thus, the profiling of NF1-glioma defined a distinct landscape that recapitulates a subset of sporadic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2904588797,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for many cellular processes. However, transient PPIs are difficult to measure at high throughput or in complex biological fluids using existing methods. We engineered a genetically encoded sensor for real-time sampling of transient PPIs at single-molecule resolution. Our sensor comprises a truncated outer membrane protein pore, a flexible tether, a protein receptor and a peptide adaptor. When a protein ligand present in solution binds to the receptor, reversible capture and release events of the receptor can be measured as current transitions between two open substates of the pore. Notably, the binding and release of the receptor by a protein ligand can be unambiguously discriminated in a complex sample containing fetal bovine serum. Our selective nanopore sensor could be applied for single-molecule protein detection, could form the basis for a nanoproteomics platform or might be adapted to build tools for protein profiling and biomarker discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2904869563,"p53, circRNAs and miRNAs are important components of the regulatory network that activates the EMT program in cancer metastasis. In prostate cancer (PCa), however, it has not been investigated whether and how p53 regulates EMT by circRNAs and miRNAs. Here we show that a Amotl1-derived circRNA, termed circAMOTL1L, is downregulated in human PCa, and that decreased circAMOTL1L facilitates PCa cell migration and invasion through downregulating E-cadherin and upregulating vimentin, thus leading to EMT and PCa progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that circAMOTL1L serves as a sponge for binding miR-193a-5p in PCa cells, relieving miR-193a-5p repression of Pcdha gene cluster (a subset of the cadherin superfamily members). Accordingly, dysregulation of the circAMOTL1L-miR-193a-5p-Pcdha8 regulatory pathway mediated by circAMOTL1L downregulation contributes to PCa growth in vivo. Further, we show that RBM25 binds directly to circAMOTL1L and induces its biogenesis, whereas p53 regulates EMT via direct activation of RBM25 gene. These findings have linked p53/RBM25-mediated circAMOTL1L-miR-193a-5p-Pcdha regulatory axis to EMT in metastatic progression of PCa. Targeting this newly identified regulatory axis provides a potential therapeutic strategy for aggressive PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2902888941,"Cellular signal transduction is predominantly based on protein interactions and their post-translational modifications, which enable a fast response to input signals. Owing to difficulties in designing new unique protein–protein interactions, designed cellular logic has focused on transcriptional regulation; however, that process has a substantially slower response, because it requires transcription and translation. Here, we present de novo design of modular, scalable signaling pathways based on proteolysis and designed coiled coils (CC) and implemented in mammalian cells. A set of split proteases with highly specific orthogonal cleavage motifs was constructed and combined with strategically positioned cleavage sites and designed orthogonal CC dimerizing domains with tunable affinity for competitive displacement after proteolytic cleavage. This framework enabled the implementation of Boolean logic functions and signaling cascades in mammalian cells. The designed split-protease-cleavable orthogonal-CC-based (SPOC) logic circuits enable response to chemical or biological signals within minutes rather than hours and should be useful for diverse medical and nonmedical applications. Protease-cleavable orthogonal-coiled-coil-based (SPOC) systems, in which split viral proteases are activated by small molecules and cleave coiled-coil protease substrates, reprogram signaling with rapid kinetics in mammalian cells."

To identify genes whose loss makes tumor cells hypersensitive to ATR inhibition, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-based whole-genome screens in 3 independent cell lines treated with a highly selective ATR inhibitor, AZD6738. These screens uncovered a comprehensive genome-wide profile of ATR inhibitor sensitivity. From the candidate genes, we demonstrated that RNASEH2 deficiency is synthetic lethal with ATR inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. RNASEH2-deficient cells exhibited elevated levels of DNA damage and, when treated with AZD6738, underwent apoptosis (short-time treated) or senescence (long-time treated). Notably, RNASEH2 deficiency is frequently found in prostate adenocarcinoma; we found decreased RNASEH2B protein levels in prostate adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples. Our findings suggest that ATR inhibition may be beneficial for cancer patients with reduced levels of RNASEH2 and that RNASEH2 merits further exploration as a potential biomarker for ATR inhibitor-based therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2904124790,"The 9p21.3 cardiovascular disease locus is the most influential common genetic risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), accounting for ∼10%-15% of disease in non-African populations. The ∼60 kb risk haplotype is human-specific and lacks coding genes, hindering efforts to decipher its function. Here, we produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from risk and non-risk individuals, delete each haplotype using genome editing, and generate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Risk VSMCs exhibit globally altered transcriptional networks that intersect with previously identified CAD risk genes and pathways, concomitant with aberrant adhesion, contraction, and proliferation. Unexpectedly, deleting the risk haplotype rescues VSMC stability, while expressing the 9p21.3-associated long non-coding RNA ANRIL induces risk phenotypes in non-risk VSMCs. This study shows that the risk haplotype selectively predisposes VSMCs to adopt a cell state associated with CAD phenotypes, defines new VSMC-based networks of CAD risk genes, and establishes haplotype-edited iPSCs as powerful tools for functionally annotating the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2903802773,"Tumor recurrence is attributable to cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), the metabolic mechanisms of which currently remain obscure. Here, we uncovered the critical role of folate-mediated one-carbon (1C) metabolism involving mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) and its downstream purine synthesis pathway. MTHFD2 knockdown greatly reduced tumorigenesis and stem-like properties, which were associated with purine nucleotide deficiency, and caused marked accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)-the final intermediate of the purine synthesis pathway. Lung cancer cells with acquired resistance to the targeted drug gefitinib, caused by elevated expression of components of the β-catenin pathway, exhibited increased stem-like properties and enhanced expression of MTHFD2. MTHFD2 knockdown or treatment with AICAR reduced the stem-like properties and restored gefitinib sensitivity in these gefitinib-resistant cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of MTHFD2 in gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cells conferred resistance to gefitinib. Thus, MTHFD2-mediated mitochondrial 1C metabolism appears critical for cancer stem-like properties and resistance to drugs including gefitinib through consumption of AICAR, leading to depletion of the intracellular pool of AICAR. Because CSCs are dependent on MTHFD2, therapies targeting MTHFD2 may eradicate tumors and prevent recurrence."

Phospholipid flippases (P4-ATPases) transport lipids across the membrane bilayer and are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and vesicular transport. Mutations in flippase genes cause or contribute to a host of diseases, such as cholestasis, neurological deficits, immunological dysfunction, and metabolic disorders. Genome-wide association studies have shown that ATP10A and ATP10D variants are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis. Moreover, ATP10D SNPs are associated with elevated levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in plasma from diverse European populations. Although sphingolipids strongly contribute to metabolic disease, little is known about how GlcCer is transported across cell membranes.

Further, we establish structural determinants necessary for recognition of this sphingolipid substrate. Using enzyme chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis, we observed that residues in transmembrane (TM) segments 1, 4, and 6 contribute to GlcCer selection, with a conserved glutamine in the center of TM4 playing an essential role.

https://openalex.org/W2902634583,"Phagocytes destroy pathogens by trapping them in a transient organelle called the phagosome, where they are bombarded with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Imaging reactive species within the phagosome would directly reveal the chemical dynamics underlying pathogen destruction. Here we introduce a fluorescent, DNA-based combination reporter, cHOClate, which simultaneously images hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and pH quantitatively. Using cHOClate targeted to phagosomes in live cells, we successfully map phagosomal production of a specific ROS, HOCl, as a function of phagosome maturation. We found that phagosomal acidification was gradual in macrophages and upon completion, HOCl was released in a burst. This revealed that phagosome-lysosome fusion was essential not only for phagosome acidification, but also for providing the chloride necessary for myeloperoxidase activity. This method can be expanded to image several kinds of ROS and RNS and be readily applied to identify how resistant pathogens evade phagosomal killing."
https://openalex.org/W2885313085,"Terpene synthases typically form complex molecular scaffolds by concerted activation and cyclization of linear starting materials in a single enzyme active site. Here we show that iridoid synthase, an atypical reductive terpene synthase, catalyzes the activation of its substrate 8-oxogeranial into a reactive enol intermediate, but does not catalyze the subsequent cyclization into nepetalactol. This discovery led us to identify a class of nepetalactol-related short-chain dehydrogenase enzymes (NEPS) from catmint (Nepeta mussinii) that capture this reactive intermediate and catalyze the stereoselective cyclisation into distinct nepetalactol stereoisomers. Subsequent oxidation of nepetalactols by NEPS1 provides nepetalactones, metabolites that are well known for both insect-repellent activity and euphoric effects in cats. Structural characterization of the NEPS3 cyclase reveals that it binds to NAD+ yet does not utilize it chemically for a non-oxidoreductive formal [4 + 2] cyclization. These discoveries will complement metabolic reconstructions of iridoid and monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis.

Given the rate at which drugs targeting energy metabolism are discovered, the investigation of their interaction with classical first- and second-line anti-TB drugs becomes essential. This is particularly important in light of an emerging model that links antibiotic-induced death in bacteria to a pathway involving dysregulation of central metabolism and energetic pathways (21Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130 (17803904): 797-81010.1016/j.cell.2007.06.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 22Lobritz M.A. Belenky P.

Mounting evidence supports the involvement of the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway in inducing bacterial death (21Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130 (17803904): 797-81010.1016/j.cell.2007.06.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 22Lobritz M.A. Belenky P.

In this study, we demonstrated that subinhibitory doses of drugs targeting energy metabolism inhibit the bactericidal potency of isoniazid and moxifloxacin. Protection against isoniazid- and moxifloxacin-induced mycobacterial death was achieved with drugs targeting the F1F0 ATP synthase, the terminal oxidases, or the maintenance of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The bactericidal potency of isoniazid and moxifloxacin correlated with a transient increase in intracellular ATP that was abrogated by drugs targeting energy metabolism. This study highlights the complexity of antibiotic-induced death in mycobacteria and advocates for a better understanding of this fundamental aspect to aid the development of rational drug combination for the treatment of tuberculosis. We chose to study the interaction between inhibitors of energy metabolism with isoniazid and moxifloxacin, which are key drugs for the management of pan-susceptible and MDR tuberculosis, respectively. The bactericidal activity of both isoniazid and moxifloxacin is well-described. Here, we confirmed that isoniazid and moxifloxacin induce a time- and concentration-dependent killing in Mycobacterium bovis BCG, a surrogate nonpathogenic mycobacterium classically used for anti-TB drug testing or drug screening (23Altaf M. Miller C.H. Bellows D.S. O'Toole R. Evaluation of the Mycobacterium smegmatis and BCG models for the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibitors.Tuberculosis. 2010; 90 (20933470): 333-33710.1016/j.tube.2010.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Isoniazid and moxifloxacin reduced bacterial number by several orders of magnitude in 3 days (Fig. 1). To test the role inhibitors of energy metabolism play in the cell death pathway triggered by the administration of these classical antibiotics, co-treatment experiments were performed. Bedaquiline was supplemented into cultures treated with isoniazid or moxifloxacin, and treatment efficacy was compared. We observed that the killing efficacy of isoniazid or moxifloxacin was affected by the presence of bedaquiline. When bedaquiline was used at approximately a concentration giving half-maximal inhibition (MIC50; 125 nm), a concentration at which the drug alone had limited effect on mycobacterial growth (Fig. 1, A and B), it drastically inhibited the bactericidal potency of isoniazid and moxifloxacin by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 1, A and B). Even the presence of a low concentration of bedaquiline (20 nm; ∼1/5 its MIC50) lowered the killing efficacy of isoniazid and moxifloxacin (Fig. 1, A and B). This rescue effect by bedaquiline was unexpected because the mechanism of action of isoniazid (drug targeting mycolic acid synthesis) and moxifloxacin (drug targeting DNA gyrase) are unrelated. Their only commonality, their bactericidal effect in mycobacteria, is thus brought into the limelight, suggesting that the OxPhos pathway may play a role in antibiotic-induced cell death. Similar results were obtained in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1, C and D), showing that results obtained in M. bovis BCG are translatable to pathogenic M. tuberculosis. Next, we tested whether the rescue effect caused by bedaquiline could be replicated using other drugs targeting the OxPhos pathway. We selected Q203, which is a clinical-stage drug candidate targeting the terminal respiratory oxidase cytochrome bc1:aa3 (11Pethe K. Bifani P. Jang J. Kang S. Park S. Ahn S. Jiricek J. Jung J. Jeon H.K. Cechetto J. Christophe T. Lee H. Kempf M. Jackson M. Lenaerts A.J. et al.Discovery of Q203, a potent clinical candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19 (23913123): 1157-116010.1038/nm.3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Unlike bedaquiline, which is bactericidal at high dose, Q203 is bacteriostatic because of the presence of the alternate cytochrome bd oxidase (24Kalia N.P. Hasenoehrl E.J. Ab Rahman N.B. Koh V.H. Ang M.L.T. Sajorda D.R. Hards K. Grüber G. Alonso S. Cook G.M. Berney M. Pethe K.

When tested at 1–6-fold its MIC50, Q203 protected M. bovis BCG (Fig. 2, A and B) and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 2, C and D) against the lethal action of isoniazid and moxifloxacin as well. We have previously shown that Q203 is bactericidal at low dose against mycobacteria strains deficient for the expression of the cytochrome bd oxidase (24Kalia N.P. Hasenoehrl E.J. Ab Rahman N.B. Koh V.H. Ang M.L.T. Sajorda D.R. Hards K. Grüber G. Alonso S. Cook G.M. Berney M. Pethe K.

Q203 protected M. bovis BCG from isoniazid and moxifloxacin-induced death even in a cydAB knockout background (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting that the rescue effect of Q203 is unrelated to its bacteriostatic effect. Furthermore, it was observed that even the unspecific protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) inhibits the bactericidal potency of isoniazid and moxifloxacin at subinhibitory concentrations (Fig. 2, G and H), reinforcing the notion that OxPhos inhibition and uncoupling protect mycobacteria from antibiotic-induced cell death. Conversely, a subinhibitory concentration of para-aminosalicylic acid, a bacteriostatic anti-TB drug targeting folate synthesis (25Zheng J. Rubin E.J. Bifani P. Mathys V. Lim V. Au M. Jang J. Nam J. Dick T. Walker J.R. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. para-Aminosalicylic acid is a prodrug targeting dihydrofolate reductase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

This result suggests that only inhibitors of energy metabolism have the capacity to interfere with the process of bacterial killing induced by antibiotics. To determine whether this rescue effect persists over a length of time, kill kinetic assays were performed. Consistent with other reports, isoniazid and moxifloxacin are fast-acting bactericidal drugs, triggering more than 99.9% reduction in live bacteria count by day 5 post-antibiotic treatment (Fig. 3). The number of viable cells dropped steadily across 10 days in cultures treated with moxifloxacin (Fig. 3, A and B). Co-treatment experiments revealed that bedaquiline delayed moxifloxacin-induced death but did not prevent it. Indeed, protection was maximal after 3 days of co-incubation but diminished over time to be no longer significant after 10 days (Fig. 3A). Co-treatment with Q203 followed a similar trend, even though a significant degree of protection was still observed after 10 days of co-incubation (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the protective effect of OxPhos inhibitors on INH-induced bacterial death persisted at least up to day 5, with no drop in cfu counts compared with day 0 observed at this time point (Fig. 3, C and D). Later time points could not be analyzed because of the rapid emergence of INH resistance as reported before (26Gumbo T. Louie A. Liu W. Ambrose P.G. Bhavnani S.M. Brown D. Drusano G.L. Isoniazid's bactericidal activity ceases because of the emergence of resistance, not depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the log phase of growth.J. Infect.

Chemother. 2010; 65 (20947621): 2582-258910.1093/jac/dkq374Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test whether the mycobacterial death induced by isoniazid and moxifloxacin involved a deregulation of energy metabolism that could be inhibited by bedaquiline or Q203, we analyzed the early cellular response to drug treatment by quantifying intracellular ATP levels. An increase in intracellular ATP level was observed as early as 24 h post-treatment in isoniazid- and moxifloxacin-treated mycobacteria. Isoniazid triggered an ATP spike in a pattern that was inversely proportional to its MIC curve (Fig. 4A), whereas the ATP response induced by moxifloxacin treatment followed a bell curve centered on the MIC50 of the drug (Fig. 4B). The increase in ATP level was higher in isoniazid-treated compared with moxifloxacin-treated mycobacteria. In both cases, the ATP burst could be dissipated by co-incubation with the F1F0 ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline in BCG (Fig. 4, C and D) and in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 4, E and F). It was also noted that the intensity of ATP deregulation was more pronounced in M. tuberculosis H37Rv compared with M. bovis BCG. The dose-dependent intracellular ATP responses induced by isoniazid and moxifloxacin were sustained for at least 3 days (Fig. 4, G and H), suggesting that the deregulation of energy metabolism is more than a transient survival response but may also be involved in a cellular response leading to bacterial death. Interestingly, the bactericidal drug rifampicin did not trigger an ATP burst in mycobacteria (Fig. 5A), and inhibitors of energy metabolism did not protect against rifampicin-induced bacterial death (Fig. 5, B–D), showing that a putative cell-death pathway induced by mycobactericidal drugs is not universal.Figure 5.Effect of respiratory inhibitors on rifampicin activity in M. bovis BCG.

Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2012Google Scholar). However, a growing body of evidence suggests that target engagement cannot be the sole explanation of antibiotics' bactericidal action, and there is a gap in our understanding of the downstream pathways induced by bactericides that eventually lead to bacterial death (21Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130 (17803904): 797-81010.1016/j.cell.2007.06.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Here we showed that an operative central energetics metabolism is an essential part of a pathway involved in bacterial death induced by some antibacterial drugs in mycobacteria. This is consistent with findings in Escherichia coli, which highlighted the role of the respiratory chain in producing reactive oxygen species in antibiotic-induced bacterial death (21Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. A common mechanism of cellular death induced by bactericidal antibiotics.Cell. 2007; 130 (17803904): 797-81010.1016/j.cell.2007.06.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both isoniazid and moxifloxacin treatment induced a response resulting in a significant increase in intracellular ATP levels, an early cellular response suggesting an up-regulation of metabolic fluxes and deregulation of bioenergetics homeostasis that correlates with bacterial death. Co-incubation of such antimicrobials with energy metabolism inhibitors abolished the spike in ATP and prevented the bactericidal effect of isoniazid and moxifloxacin. Our data demonstrate that the respiratory chain, whose effect can be manipulated using respiratory inhibitors such as bedaquiline and Q203, plays a crucial role in a pathway leading to bacterial death. It has been well-established that isoniazid and moxifloxacin are only bactericidal against actively replicating mycobacteria but are less effective against nonreplicating subpopulation (29Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Evaluation of a nutrient starvation model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence by gene and protein expression profiling.Mol.

This phenomenon is in agreement with the viewpoint that the impairment in cell wall biosynthesis or DNA replication is detrimental when bacteria undergo cell division. Although one could reason that respiratory inhibitors like Q203 prevented isoniazid or moxifloxacin-induced death by inhibiting replication and mimicking the dormant state of mycobacteria, it appears that this is not the case because bedaquiline and Q203 were protective at concentrations that were insufficient to inhibit growth. Furthermore, para-aminosalicylic acid, a bacteriostatic anti-TB agent, does not confer said protection, thus clarifying that a bacteriostatic effect alone is not sufficient to protect mycobacteria from isoniazid- and moxifloxacin-induced death. These points combined suggest that energetics inhibitor-mediated rescue from cell death is more intricate than merely blocking bacteria replication. Although there is strong evidence showing the key involvement of central metabolism and bioenergetics in antibiotic-induced cell death, the truth remains that our understanding of the mechanisms induced by antibiotics are largely incomplete. Our data set with rifampicin revealed the complexity of this topic, because the absence of effect of respiratory inhibitors suggests that rifampicin-induced death is independent of bioenergetics deregulation. This could be due to the presence of multiple cascades regulating stress response, and rifampicin-induced death might be regulated by another pathway which does not involve the participation of the respiratory chain. Furthermore, the deregulation of ATP homeostasis triggered by isoniazid and moxifloxacin are distinct in their profile, suggesting that their mechanisms of cell death are overlapping yet distinct. Not only do the observations reported here contribute to the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in antibiotic-induced death, it also unveils possible implications for combination therapies for tuberculosis. Although the presence of respiratory inhibitors such as bedaquiline and Q203 affect the early bactericidal activity of isoniazid and moxifloxacin in vitro, it is important to note that the outcome of this study does not invalidate the strategy of combining respiratory inhibitors with traditional antituberculars. First, it remains to be demonstrated that our in vitro observations are translatable in vivo and ultimately in man. As long as the concentration of the energy metabolism inhibitors are above their growth inhibitory concentrations and administered for a sufficient period of time, inhibition of antibiotic-induced bacterial death may not be seen. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that drugs targeting the oxidative phosphorylation pathway have the potential to be incorporated in a rational drug combination for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (32Chahine E.B. Karaoui L.R. Mansour H. Bedaquiline: a novel diarylquinoline for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.Ann.

For instance, it has been demonstrated in a phase 2 clinical study that the addition of bedaquiline to the standard drug regimen for the treatment of pulmonary MDR-TB resulted in a faster, higher culture conversion rate, suggesting bedaquiline's treatment compatibility with drugs such as kanamycin, ofloxacin, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine (32Chahine E.B.

Nevertheless, significant work remains to be done to optimize dosing regimens with antibiotics having contrasting pharmacokinetics properties. The mechanism of antibiotic-induced death is far from resolved, and the link between antibiotic action and bioenergetics remains to be deciphered at the molecular level. This presents an exciting field of research because the implication of resolving key components of a pathway triggering mycobacterial death is significant. From a practical standpoint, it gives rise to opportunities to manipulate the system and opens up a target space of great potential for drug development. By exploiting the pathogen's fundamental vulnerability, drugs targeting this pathway would promise high killing efficacy, thus improving treatment strategies against this deadly disease. M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis BCG, and derivative strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80, and 10% ADS supplement.

https://openalex.org/W2904975871,"The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation often contributes to tumorigenesis. Extensive studies have shown that the Hippo pathway inhibits cell proliferation, and survival in a cell-autonomous manner. We examined the function of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2) in cancer cells. As expected, loss of LATS1/2 promotes cancer cell growth in most cell lines. Surprisingly, however, LATS1/2 deletion inhibits the growth of murine MC38 colon cancer cells, especially under detachment conditions. This growth inhibitory effect caused by LATS1/2 deletion is due to uncontrolled activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), the key downstream transcriptional coactivators inhibited by LATS1/2. We identified Wnt inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (Wisp2) and coiled-coil domain containing 80 (Ccdc80) as direct targets of YAP/TAZ. Their expression is selectively induced by LATS1/2 deletion in MC38 cells. Furthermore, deletion of WISP2 and CCDC80 prevents the growth inhibitory effect of LATS1/2 loss in MC38 cells. Our study demonstrates that the function of LATS1/2 in cell growth is cell context dependent, suggesting that LATS1/2 inhibition can be a therapeutic approach for some cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2905025160,"Tumor progression is regulated by a complex interplay between neoplastic cells and the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages have been shown to promote breast cancer progression in advanced disease and more recently, in early stage cancers. However, little is known about the macrophage-derived factors that promote tumor progression in early stage lesions. Using a p53-null model of early stage mammary tumor progression, we found that Gas6 is highly expressed in pre-invasive lesions associated with increased infiltrating macrophages, as compared with those with few recruited macrophages. We show that F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages produce Gas6 in premalignant lesions in vivo, and that macrophage-derived Gas6 induces a tumor-like phenotype ex vivo. Using a 3-D co-culture system, we show that macrophage-derived Gas6 activates its receptor Axl and downstream survival signals including Akt and STAT3, which was accompanied by altered E-cadherin expression to induce a malignant morphology. In vivo studies demonstrated that deletion of stromal Gas6 delays early stage progression and decreases tumor formation, while tumor growth in established tumors remains unaffected. These studies suggest that macrophage-derived Gas6 is a critical regulator of the transition from premalignant to invasive cancer, and may lead to the development of unique biomarkers of neoplastic progression for patients with early stage breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2903646337,"Neuronal signals in the prefrontal cortex have been reported to predict upcoming decisions. Such activity patterns are often coupled to perceptual cues indicating correct choices or values of different options. How does the prefrontal cortex signal future decisions when no cues are present but when decisions are made based on internal valuations of past experiences with stochastic outcomes? We trained rats to perform a two-arm bandit-task, successfully adjusting choices between certain-small or possible-big rewards with changing long-term advantages. We discovered specialized prefrontal neurons, whose firing during the encounter of no-reward predicted the subsequent choice of animals, even for unlikely or uncertain decisions and several seconds before choice execution. Optogenetic silencing of the prelimbic cortex exclusively timed to encounters of no reward, provoked animals to excessive gambling for large rewards. Firing of prefrontal neurons during outcome evaluation signals subsequent choices during gambling and is essential for dynamically adjusting decisions based on internal valuations."
https://openalex.org/W2905309444,"Ribosomal (r)-proteins are generally viewed as ubiquitous, constitutive proteins that simply function to maintain ribosome integrity. However, findings in the past decade have led to the idea that r-proteins have evolved specialized functions beyond the ribosome. For example, the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) is known to form an extraribosomal complex with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT3 that is conserved from fission yeast to humans. However, the full scope of uS5's extraribosomal functions, including whether uS5 interacts with any other proteins, is not known. In this study, we identify the conserved zinc finger protein 277 (ZNF277) as a new uS5-associated protein by using quantitative proteomics approaches in human cells. As previously shown for PRMT3, we found that ZNF277 uses a C2H2-type zinc finger domain to recognize uS5. Analysis of protein–protein interactions in living cells indicated that the ZNF277–uS5 complex is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Furthermore, we show that ZNF277 and PRMT3 compete for uS5 binding, because overexpression of PRMT3 inhibited the formation of the ZNF277–uS5 complex, whereas depletion of cellular ZNF277 resulted in increased levels of uS5-PRMT3. Notably, our results reveal that ZNF277 recognizes nascent uS5 in the course of mRNA translation, suggesting cotranslational assembly of the ZNF277–uS5 complex. Our findings thus unveil an intricate network of evolutionarily conserved protein–protein interactions involving extraribosomal uS5, suggesting a key role for uS5 beyond the ribosome.

However, Cu's chemical properties also make it toxic, requiring specific cellular mechanisms for Cu uptake and handling, mediated by Cu chaperones. CCS1, the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) Cu chaperone for Cu–zinc (Zn) superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activates by directly promoting both Cu delivery and disulfide formation in SOD1. The complete mechanistic details of this transaction along with recently proposed molecular chaperone-like functions for CCS1 remain undefined. Here, we present combined structural, spectroscopic, kinetic, and thermodynamic data that suggest a multifunctional chaperoning role(s) for CCS1 during SOD1 activation. We observed that CCS1 preferentially binds a completely immature form of SOD1 and that the SOD1·CCS1 interaction promotes high-affinity Zn(II) binding in SOD1. Conserved aromatic residues within the CCS1 C-terminal domain are integral in these processes. Previously, we have shown that CCS1 delivers Cu(I) to an entry site at the SOD1·CCS1 interface upon binding. We show here that Cu(I) is transferred from CCS1 to the entry site and then to the SOD1 active site by a thermodynamically driven affinity gradient. We also noted that efficient transfer from the entry site to the active site is entirely dependent upon the oxidation of the conserved intrasubunit disulfide bond in SOD1.

https://openalex.org/W2904248981,"All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and it is a promising agent also in solid tumors. The pharmacological activity of ATRA is mediated by the ligand-activated RAR and RXR transcription factors. In the present study, we define the basal and ATRA dependent RARα interactome in a RARα-overexpressing breast cancer cellular model, identifying 28 nuclear proteins. We focus our attention on the S100A3 calcium-binding protein, which interacts with RARα constitutively. In ATRA-sensitive breast cancer cells, S100A3 binds to RARα in basal conditions and binding is reduced by the retinoid. The interaction of S100A3 with RARα is direct and in lung cancer, APL and acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) cells. In APL, S100A3 interacts not only with RARα, but also with PML-RARα. The interaction surface maps to the RARα ligand-binding domain, where the I396 residue plays a crucial role. Binding of S100A3 to RARα/PML-RARα controls the constitutive and ATRA-dependent degradation of these receptors. S100A3 knockdown decreases the amounts of RARα in breast- and lung cancer cells, inducing resistance to ATRA-dependent anti-proliferative/differentiating effects. Conversely, S100A3 knockdown in PML-RARα+ APL and PML-RARα- AML cells reduces the amounts of RARα/PML-RARα and increases basal and ATRA-induced differentiation. In this cellular context, opposite effects on RARα/PML-RARα levels and ATRA-induced differentiation are observed upon S100A3 overexpression. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling RARα activity and have practical implications, as S100A3 represents a novel target for rational drug combinations aimed at potentiating the activity of ATRA."

Here, we set out to determine the function of human family with sequence similarity 173 member B (FAM173B), a mitochondrial methyltransferase (MTase) reported to promote chronic pain. Using bioinformatics analyses and biochemical assays, we found that FAM173B contains an atypical, noncleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence responsible for its localization to mitochondria. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of FAM173B in mammalian cells abrogated trimethylation of Lys-43 in ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc), a modification previously reported as ubiquitous among metazoans. ATPSc methylation was restored by complementing the KO cells with enzymatically active human FAM173B or with a putative FAM173B orthologue from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Interestingly, lack of Lys-43 methylation caused aberrant incorporation of ATPSc into the ATP synthase complex and resulted in decreased ATP-generating ability of the complex, as well as decreased mitochondrial respiration. In summary, we have identified FAM173B as the long-sought KMT responsible for methylation of ATPSc, a key protein in cellular ATP production, and have demonstrated functional significance of ATPSc methylation.

The mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPS) is responsible for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate in the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), which utilizes the proton-motive force, generated during flow of electrons through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to molecular oxygen (30Walker J.E.

ATPS is a ∼600-kDa multiprotein complex (Complex V), and consists of two major parts: the oligomycin-binding domain (FO), which resides in the inner membrane, and the catalytic domain (F1), which faces the mitochondrial matrix. In metazoans, the central part of FO consists of a membrane-embedded ring of eight c-subunits that, together with proteins of the so-called “central stalk,” form the rotary element of the ATPS (31Watt I.N.

During the return of protons from the intermembrane space back to the matrix, this rotary element is propelled, inducing recurrent conformational changes within the stationary F1 domain, enabling ATP synthesis (32Abrahams J.P.

Structure at 2.8 Å resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370 (8065448): 621-62810.1038/370621a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). ATPSc is highly conserved throughout evolution, and humans have three distinct ATPSc-encoding genes. These encode an identical, 75-amino-acid-long, mature ATPSc protein but differ with respect to the encoded N-terminal presequence, which is cleaved off during mitochondrial import (33Yan W.L.

During our efforts to identify novel human KMTs, we became interested in family with sequence similarity 173 member B (FAM173B), which, together with its close paralogue FAM173A, represent the closest human homologues of a broad-specificity KMT found in some archaea (denoted aKMT) (7Falnes P.Ø.

A genome-wide association study implicated FAM173B in chronic pain in humans (37Peters M.J. Broer L. Willemen H.L. Eiriksdottir G. Hocking L.J. Holliday K.L. Horan M.A. Meulenbelt I. Neogi T.

Kavelaars A. Prado J. Maas M. Versteeg S. Nellissen L.J.J. Tromp J. Gonzalez Cano R. Zhou W. Jakobsson M.E. Małecki J. Posthuma G. Habib A.M. Heijnen C.J. Falnes P.Ø. Eijkelkamp N. Identification of FAM173B as a protein methyltransferase promoting chronic pain.PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 (29444090): e200345210.1371/journal.pbio.2003452Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also found that FAM173B localized to mitochondria and that the recombinant enzyme displayed weak, nonspecific KMT activity on a lysine homopolymer (38Willemen H.L.D.M. Kavelaars A. Prado J. Maas M. Versteeg S. Nellissen L.J.J. Tromp J. Gonzalez Cano R. Zhou W. Jakobsson M.E. Małecki J. Posthuma G. Habib A.M. Heijnen C.J. Falnes P.Ø. Eijkelkamp N. Identification of FAM173B as a protein methyltransferase promoting chronic pain.PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 (29444090): e200345210.1371/journal.pbio.2003452Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the actual biochemical function of FAM173B has remained obscure. In the present study, we set out to identify the in vivo substrate(s) of FAM173B. Using FAM173B KO cells, we identified Lys-43 in ATPSc as target of FAM173B, and a FAM173B homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans showed the same activity. Moreover, lack of Lys-43 methylation decreased the efficiency of assembly of the ATPS complex and reduced its ATP-synthesizing activity. In addition to the previously mentioned FAM173A and aKMT proteins, homologues of human FAM173B are found in nonvertebrate animals, such as insects and nematodes, as well as in some bacteria (Table S1). To investigate the sequence similarity between FAM173B and these related proteins, we generated a sequence alignment of representative proteins, and a phylogram was constructed from the alignment (Fig. 1A). Clearly, the five categories of proteins (vertebrate FAM173A, vertebrate FAM173B, nonvertebrate FAM173-like, archaeal aKMT, and bacterial aKMT-like) clustered as five distinct groups in the phylogram. The archaeal and bacterial proteins located closely together at one end of the phylogram, whereas the FAM173B, FAM173A, and nonvertebrate FAM173-like proteins were found at the other end, with the nonvertebrate FAM173-like proteins localized closer to the FAM173B group than to the FAM173A group. This indicates that the nonvertebrate FAM173-like proteins may represent functional orthologues of FAM173B. In a previous study, we found that mouse Fam173b is localized to mitochondria (38Willemen H.L.D.M. Kavelaars A. Prado J. Maas M. Versteeg S. Nellissen L.J.J. Tromp J. Gonzalez Cano R. Zhou W.

Proteins that are targeted to mitochondria commonly contain a classic N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), which is amphiphilic and α-helical (39Bolender N. Sickmann A. Wagner R. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Multiple pathways for sorting mitochondrial precursor proteins.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 (18174896): 42-4910.1038/sj.embor.7401126Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These classic MTS-containing proteins utilize a specific import machinery, and the MTS is cleaved off during the import process. However, more than half of all proteins targeted to mitochondria do not contain a classic MTS but use alternative mechanisms (39Bolender N. Sickmann A. Wagner R. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Multiple pathways for sorting mitochondrial precursor proteins.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 (18174896): 42-4910.1038/sj.embor.7401126Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To elucidate the targeting of FAM173B, we set out to identify sequence determinants required for its mitochondrial import. In addition to the C-terminal MTase domain, human FAM173B contains ∼90 residues of N-terminal sequence, but no typical MTS was detected by algorithms such as MitoProt (40Claros M.G. Vincens P. Computational method to predict mitochondrially imported proteins and their targeting sequences.Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241 (8944766): 779-78610.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00779.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). However, various algorithms for prediction of α-helical hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) (e.g. TMpred, Phobius, and TMHMM, available at www.expasy.org), predicted the presence of a TMD in the N-terminal portion of FAM173 homologues from various animals (Fig. 1B and Table S2). This TMD was located between a stretch of nonconserved N-terminal sequence (NTS) and a segment of conserved sequence that precedes the annotated MTase domain (preMT) (Fig. 1B). We set out to investigate the role of the conserved TMD and preMT domains in targeting FAM173B to mitochondria. As previously observed (38Willemen H.L.D.M. Kavelaars A. Prado J. Maas M. Versteeg S. Nellissen L.J.J. Tromp J. Gonzalez Cano R. Zhou W. Jakobsson M.E. Małecki J. Posthuma G. Habib A.M. Heijnen C.J. Falnes P.Ø. Eijkelkamp N. Identification of FAM173B as a protein methyltransferase promoting chronic pain.PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 (29444090): e200345210.1371/journal.pbio.2003452Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a fusion protein between FAM173B and GFP was efficiently targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 1C), as shown by extensive co-localization with cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV). Interestingly, deletion of the first 55 amino acids, encompassing the NTS and TMD, did not abrogate mitochondrial targeting, suggesting that targeting may be provided by the preMT domain. Indeed, a fusion protein between the preMT domain and GFP was efficiently targeted to the mitochondria (Fig. 1C), indicating that the preMT domain can act as an autonomous MTS and likely is responsible for mitochondrial targeting of FAM173B. Moreover, Western blot analysis of mitoplasts from cells expressing C-terminally FLAG-tagged FAM173B (FAM173B-FLAG) revealed a single species of FLAG-tagged protein, with an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (Fig. S1), corresponding to the predicted mass of FAM173B-FLAG (29.2 kDa). Thus, our results indicate that FAM173B is not processed during mitochondrial import and that the preMT domain of FAM173B encompasses an atypical MTS, which is retained in the mature protein. To functionally characterize human FAM173B, the corresponding gene was disrupted in the haploid cell line HAP1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, with guide RNAs designed to target a sequence located upstream of motif “Post I,” which contains a catalytically critical acidic residue (i.e. Glu-117 in FAM173B) required for AdoMet binding to 7BS MTases (17Jakobsson M.E.

Ketogenesis is controlled by a signaling network of hepatic lipid metabolism. However, how Sirt6 functions in ketogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Sirt6 functions as a mediator of ketogenesis in response to a fasting and ketogenic diet (KD). The KD-fed hepatocyte-specific Sirt6 deficiency (HKO) mice exhibited impaired ketogenesis, which was due to enhanced Fsp27 (fat-specific induction of protein 27), a protein known to regulate lipid metabolism. In contrast, overexpression of Sirt6 in mouse primary hepatocytes promoted ketogenesis. Mechanistically, Sirt6 repressed Fsp27β expression by interacting with Crebh (cAMP response element–binding protein H) and preventing its recruitment to the Fsp27β gene promoter. The KD-fed HKO mice also showed exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Finally, Fsp27 silencing rescued hypoketonemia and other metabolic phenotypes in KD-fed HKO mice. Our data suggest that the Sirt6–Crebh–Fsp27 axis is pivotal for hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. Sirt6 may be a pharmacological target to remedy metabolic diseases.

Hepatic ketogenesis is governed by an orchestrated series of metabolic processes. First, fatty acids are metabolized to acetyl-CoA via mitochondrial β-oxidation.

Glimcher L.H. Lee A.H. The transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein H regulates triglyceride metabolism.Nat. Med. 2011; 17 (21666694): 812-81510.1038/nm.2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Crebh can transcriptionally activate Fsp27 expression and also stimulate LD growth and triglyceride accumulation in the liver (12Xu X. Park J.G. So J.S. Lee A.H. Transcriptional activation of Fsp27 by the liver-enriched transcription factor CREBH promotes lipid droplet growth and hepatic steatosis.Hepatology. 2015; 61 (25125366): 857-86910.1002/hep.27371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sirt6 is a NADH (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase (14Tasselli L. Zheng W. Chua K.F. SIRT6: novel mechanisms and links to aging And Disease.Trends Endocrinol.

Sirt6 was initially characterized as an NAD+-dependent deacetylase of histone (15Jiang H. Khan S. Wang Y. Charron G. He B. Sebastian C. Du J. Kim R. Ge E. Mostoslavsky R. Hang H.C. Hao Q. Lin H.

Accordingly, Sirt6 acts primarily as a transcriptional repressor of several transcription factors, especially those implicated in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Sirt6 deacetylates histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 56 (H3K56) on the promoters of Srebp1/2 (sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1/2) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 to control cholesterol metabolism (16Elhanati S.

However, whether Sirt6 has a direct role in regulating ketogenesis remains unknown. In this report, we show that hepatocyte-specific Sirt6 deficiency impairs fasting- and ketogenic diet (KD)–induced ketogenesis in mice. Conversely, overexpression of Sirt6 in mouse primary hepatocytes promoted ketogenesis. Further investigation revealed that Fsp27 mediated the ketogenesis by Sirt6. Knockdown of Fsp27 alleviated the impaired ketogenesis observed in Sirt6-deficient mice. Mechanistically, Sirt6 repressed Fsp27β expression by interacting with Crebh and preventing its recruitment to the Fsp27β gene promoter. Our data reveal an essential role for Sirt6 in ketogenesis and elucidate the underlying mechanism of Sirt6-regulated ketogenesis. Sirt6 controls metabolic homeostasis and is regulated by nutrient availability (26Kuang J. Zhang Y. Liu Q. Shen J. Pu S. Cheng S. Chen L. Li H. Wu T. Li R. Li Y. Zou M. Zhang Z. Jiang W. Xu G. Qu A.

To investigate whether Sirt6 plays a role in ketogenesis, we measured the hepatic Sirt6 expression in mouse models of ketogenesis. Fasting or KD feeding are known to promote ketone body production (3Fukao T. Mitchell G. Sass J.O. Hori T. Orii K. Aoyama Y. Ketone body metabolism and its defects.J. Inherit. Metab.

A 24-h fasting induced the hepatic expression of Sirt6 in C57BL6/J mice (Fig. 1A), which was consistent with a previous report (21Kim H.S. Xiao C. Wang R.H. Lahusen T. Xu X. Vassilopoulos A. Vazquez-Ortiz G. Jeong W.I. Park O. Ki S.H. Gao B. Deng C.X. Hepatic-specific disruption of SIRT6 in mice results in fatty liver formation due to enhanced glycolysis and triglyceride synthesis.Cell Metab. 2010; 12 (20816089): 224-23610.1016/j.cmet.2010.06.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Similarly, KD feeding significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of Sirt6 in the liver (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). In primary hepatocytes, Sirt6 expression was increased after incubation in ketogenic medium (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B), which is known to induce ketogenesis (29Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Oh S. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 controls fasting-induced ketogenesis and its modulation by ageing.Nature. 2010; 468 (21179166): 1100-110410.1038/nature09584Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Sirt6 may function as a ketogenic regulator in response to fasting and ketogenic conditions in mice. Ketone bodies are primarily produced in the liver (1Newman J.C. Verdin E. Ketone bodies as signaling metabolites.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 25 (24140022): 42-5210.1016/j.tem.2013.09.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To further investigate the function of Sirt6 in ketogenesis, hepatocyte-specific Sirt6 deficiency (HKO) mice were generated by cross-breeding Sirt6Loxp/Loxp mice (LoxP) with the hepatocyte-specific albumin-Cre mice. The expression of Sirt6 was efficiently knocked down in liver and isolated hepatocytes but not in other tissues (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2, A and B). β-Hydroxybutyrate is the most abundant circulating ketone body (78%) (30Qiao Y. Gao Z. Liu Y. Cheng Y. Yu M. Zhao L. Duan Y. Liu Y. Breath ketone testing: a new biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of diabetic ketosis.BioMed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 (24900994): 869186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is usually used to directly reflect blood levels of ketone bodies (31Shimazu T. Hirschey M.D. Hua L. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Schwer B. Lombard D.B. Li Y. Bunkenborg J. Alt F.W. Denu J.M. Jacobson M.P. Verdin E. SIRT3 deacetylates mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase 2 and regulates ketone body production.Cell Metab. 2010; 12 (21109197): 654-66110.1016/j.cmet.2010.11.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We next tested the serum levels of β-hydroxybutyrate under ad libitum feeding, fasting, and KD-fed HKO mice and the Loxp control mice. In the ad libitum state, the serum level of β-hydroxybutyrate was low and not different between the two genotypes (Fig. 2B). After 24-h fasting, the serum level of β-hydroxybutyrate was greatly increased in Loxp mice. However, the fasting-induced β-hydroxybutyrate level was significantly impaired in HKO mice (Fig. 2C). KD feeding induced ketogenesis in the Loxp mice as expected, but the serum β-hydroxybutyrate level was significantly lower in HKO mice (Fig. 2D). Under CD and KD, the body weight, fat mass, and lean mass was comparable between Loxp and HKO mice (Fig. 2E). The serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) were significantly higher in HKO than Loxp mice under ad libitum feeding, but not in the fasting or KD feeding state (Fig. 2, B–D). These results suggested that Sirt6 plays a role in ketogenesis. To understand the mechanism of Sirt6-regulated ketogenesis, we first measured the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in the mouse livers (32Grabacka M. Pierzchalska M. Dean M. Reiss K. Regulation of ketone body metabolism and the role of PPARα.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17 (27983603): E2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation genes (Cpt-1α (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α), Cpt-2α, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Mcad)) and ketone body synthetic genes (Hmgcs2 and Hmgcl) were similar between the HKO and Loxp mice under both KD and CD (Fig. S3, A and B). Consistent with mRNA expression, functional analysis of isolated mitochondria from liver of HKO mice did not differ between two genotypes in the presence of respiratory chain complex I or II substrates (Fig. S4, A–D). In hepatocytes, the mitochondria respiration was also similar (Fig. S4, E and F). Taken together, these results suggest that impaired ketogenesis in HKO mice was unlikely because of the dysregulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In addition to fatty acid oxidation, sufficient fatty acid substrates for mitochondrial utilization is another key factor in ketogenesis (4Langhi C. Baldán Á CIDEC/FSP27 is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and plays a critical role in fasting- and diet-induced hepatosteatosis.Hepatology. 2015; 61 (25418138): 1227-123810.1002/hep.27607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fsp27, a lipid-coating protein, acts as a barrier of fatty acid oxidation by restricting lipid utilization (4Langhi C.

We suspected that Fsp27 may be involved in the hypoketonemia seen in HKO mice. Under the CD, hepatic Fsp27 expression was comparable between HKO and Loxp mice as shown in Fig. 3A). However, under the KD, Fsp27 expression was increased, and the increase was more pronounced in HKO than Loxp livers (Fig. 3, A and B). The expression of Fsp27β, a predominant isoform of Fsp27 in the liver was similarly higher in HKO than Loxp livers on the KD (Fig. 3A). In addition, HKO livers showed an increased expression of G0s2, a hepatic lipolysis inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Perilipin-1, another lipid droplet coating protein, was slightly increased in HKO mice (Fig. S5A, upper panel). The expression of Atgl was not changed in the liver of HKO mice (Fig. S5A, lower panel). These in vivo results were further confirmed in primary hepatocytes that bear the knockout or overexpression of Sirt6. In Sirt6-kncokout hepatocytes, the mRNA expression of Fsp27, Fsp27β, and G0s2 was increased (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the mRNA level, the protein level of Fsp27 was significantly elevated in Sirt6 knockout hepatocytes (Fig. 3D). Conversely, overexpression of Sirt6 suppressed the mRNA expression of Fsp27, Fsp27β, and G0s2 (Fig. 3E and Fig. S5B). Consistent with the results in HKO mice, Sirt6 overexpression promoted ketone body production and decreased cellular triglyceride level in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3F and Fig. S5C). Together, these data indicate that Sirt6 might regulate ketogenesis by modulating Fsp27 expression. To directly confirm the effect of Fsp27 on ketogenesis, we overexpressed Fsp27 in primary hepatocytes and monitored the ketone body production by the β-hydroxybutyrate level. Fsp27 overexpression significantly attenuated β-hydroxybutyrate level in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). To further validate whether elevated Fsp27 mediated the impaired ketogenesis seen in HKO mice, we injected Ad-shFsp27 in HKO mice to knock down Fsp27 expression under the KD. Ad-shFsp27 injection effectively reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of Fsp27 (Fig. 4, C and D). Notably, Fsp27 silencing increased the serum level of ketone bodies in KD-fed HKO mice (Fig. 4E), with no changes in serum triglycerides, cholesterol, or NEFA level in Ad-shFsp27–injected mice (Fig. 4E). The expression of hepatic genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (Cpt-2α and Mcad) and ketone body biosynthesis (Hmgcs2 and Hmgcl) was slightly increased with Fsp27 knockdown (Fig. S6A), probably because of a compensatory increase of lipolysis. Consistent with a previous report (4Langhi C. Baldán Á CIDEC/FSP27 is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and plays a critical role in fasting- and diet-induced hepatosteatosis.Hepatology. 2015; 61 (25418138): 1227-123810.1002/hep.27607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the expression of lipogenic genes was not changed by Fsp27 silencing (Fig. S6B) (4Langhi C.

Fsp27 is closely linked to inflammation (12Xu X. Park J.G. So J.S. Lee A.H. Transcriptional activation of Fsp27 by the liver-enriched transcription factor CREBH promotes lipid droplet growth and hepatic steatosis.Hepatology. 2015; 61 (25125366): 857-86910.1002/hep.27371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Xu M.J.

As expected, levels of macrophage markers (F4/80 and Cd68 (cluster of differentiation 68)) and the proinflammation cytokine IL-1β were decreased in Ad-shFsp27–infected mice (Fig. 4F). The result was verified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of liver sections with reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in Ad-shFsp27–injected mice (Fig. S6C), and the H&E also showed lower vacuolated hepatocytes in Ad-shFsp27–injected mice. Collectively, these results suggest that Fsp27 knockdown ameliorates the impaired ketogenesis in HKO mice. We went on to determine the mechanism of Sirt6-regulated Fsp27 expression. Fsp27 and G0s2 are direct target genes of Crebh (13Lee J.H. Giannikopoulos P. Duncan S.A. Wang J. Johansen C.T. Brown J.D. Plutzky J. Hegele R.A. Glimcher L.H. Lee A.H.

Intriguingly, their potential as cAMP-dependent signal transducers remains uncharacterized. We recently reported that type I PKA regulatory subunits (RIα) interact with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate–dependent Rac exchange factor 1 (P-REX1), a chemotactic Rac guanine exchange factor (RacGEF). Because P-REX1 is known to be phosphorylated and inhibited by PKA, its interaction with RIα suggests that PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits may fine-tune P-REX1 activity or those of its target pools. Here, we tested whether RIα acts as a cAMP-dependent factor promoting P-REX1–mediated Rac activation and cell migration. We observed that Gs-coupled EP2 receptors indeed promote endothelial cell migration via RIα-activated P-REX1. Expression of the P-REX1–PDZ1 domain prevented RIα/P–REX1 interaction, P-REX1 activation, and EP2-dependent cell migration, and P-REX1 silencing abrogated RIα-dependent Rac activation. RIα-specific cAMP analogs activated P-REX1, but lost this activity in RIα-knockdown cells, and cAMP pulldown assays revealed that P-REX1 preferentially interacts with free RIα. Moreover, purified RIα directly activated P-REX1 in vitro. We also found that the RIα CNB-B domain is critical for the interaction with P-REX1, which was increased in RIα mutants, such as the acrodysostosis-associated mutant, that activate P-REX1 at basal cAMP levels. RIα and Cα PKA subunits targeted distinct P-REX1 molecules, indicated by an absence of phosphorylation in the active fraction of P-REX1.

https://openalex.org/W2905084011,"Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death and clarification of its molecular pathology is highly prioritized. The physiological importance of mRNA degradation through the CCR4-NOT deadenylase has recently been highlighted. For example, mutation in CNOT3, a gene coding for CNOT3 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, is found to be associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-ALL, though its contribution to other cancers has not been reported. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that CNOT3 is required for the growth of non-small cell lung cancer. Depletion of CNOT3 suppresses proliferation of A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with enhanced mRNA stability and subsequent elevated expression of p21. In addition, we identified the mRNA for Krüppel-like factor 2 transcription factor, an inducer of p21, as a novel mRNA degradation target of CNOT3 in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Aberrant up-regulation of Krüppel-like factor 2 by CNOT3 depletion leads to impairment in the proliferation of A549 cells. Consistent with these findings, elevated mRNA expression of CNOT3 in non-small cell lung cancer in comparison with the paired normal lung epithelium was confirmed through scrutinization of the RNA-sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between CNOT3 and CDKN1A (encoding p21) mRNA expression using the combined datasets of normal lung epithelium and non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, we propose that the up-regulation of CNOT3 facilitates the development of non-small cell lung cancer through down-regulation of Krüppel-like factor 2 and p21, contrary to tumor suppressive functions of CNOT3 in T-ALL."

Importantly, the low intrinsic reactivity of UBE2A Q93E was not overcome by a cognate ubiquitin E3 ligase, RAD18, with the UBE2A target PCNA. However, UBE2A Q93E was reactive at high pH or with a low-pKa amine as the nucleophile, thus providing the first evidence of reversion of a defective UBE2A mutation. We propose that Q93E substitution perturbs the UBE2A catalytic microenvironment essential for lysine deprotonation during ubiquitin transfer, thus generating an enzyme that is disabled but not dead."
https://openalex.org/W2903771234,"There is increasing evidence that genomic instability is a prerequisite for cancer progression. Here we show that SIM2s, a member of the bHLH/PAS family of transcription factors, regulates DNA damage repair through enhancement of homologous recombination (HR), and prevents epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in an Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that SIM2s interacts with ATM and is stabilized through ATM-dependent phosphorylation in response to IR. Once stabilized, SIM2s interacts with BRCA1 and supports RAD51 recruitment to the site of DNA damage. Loss of SIM2s through the introduction of shSIM2 or the mutation of SIM2s at one of the predicted ATM phosphorylation sites (S115) reduces HR efficiency through disruption of RAD51 recruitment, resulting in genomic instability and induction of EMT. The EMT induced by the mutation of S115 is characterized by a decrease in E-cadherin and an induction of the basal marker, K14, resulting in increased invasion and metastasis. Together, these results identify a novel player in the DNA damage repair pathway and provides a link in ductal carcinoma in situ progression to invasive ductal carcinoma through loss of SIM2s, increased genomic instability, EMT, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2950325309,"Indole-3-acetic acid is a ubiquitous small molecule found in all domains of life. It is the predominant and most active auxin in seed plants, where it coordinates a variety of complex growth and development processes. The potential origin of auxin signaling in algae remains a matter of some controversy. In order to clarify the evolutionary context of algal auxin signaling, we undertook a genomic survey to assess whether auxin acts as a signaling molecule in the emerging model chlorophyte Chlorella sorokiniana UTEX 1230. C. sorokiniana produces the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which was present in both the cell pellet and in the supernatant at a concentration of ~ 1 nM, and its genome encodes orthologs of genes related to auxin synthesis, transport, and signaling in higher plants. Candidate orthologs for the canonical AUX/IAA signaling pathway were not found; however, auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1), an alternate auxin receptor, is present and highly conserved at essential auxin binding and zinc coordinating residues. Additionally, candidate orthologs for PIN proteins, responsible for intercellular, vectorial auxin transport in higher plants, were not found, but PILs (PIN-Like) proteins, a recently discovered family that mediates intracellular auxin transport, were identified. The distribution of auxin related gene in this unicellular chlorophyte demonstrates that a core suite of auxin signaling components was present early in the evolution of plants. Understanding the simplified auxin signaling pathways in chlorophytes will aid in understanding phytohormone signaling and crosstalk in seed plants, and in understanding the diversification and integration of developmental signals during the evolution of multicellular plants."
https://openalex.org/W2904506131,"Few therapy options exist for patients with advanced papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer. We and others have previously identified c-Src as a key mediator of thyroid cancer pro-tumorigenic processes and a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer. To increase the efficacy of targeting Src in the clinic, we sought to define mechanisms of resistance to the Src inhibitor, dasatinib, to identify key pathways to target in combination. Using a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing clinically relevant mutations in BRAF or RAS, which were previously developed to be resistant to dasatinib, we identified a switch to a more invasive phenotype in the BRAF-mutant cells as a potential therapy escape mechanism. This phenotype switch is driven by FAK kinase activity, and signaling through the p130Cas>c-Jun signaling axis. We have further shown this more invasive phenotype is accompanied by alterations in the secretome through the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, and the pro-invasive metalloprotease, MMP-9. Furthermore, IL-1β signals via a feedforward autocrine loop to promote invasion through a FAK>p130Cas>c-Jun>MMP-9 signaling axis. We further demonstrate that upfront combined inhibition of FAK and Src synergistically inhibits growth and invasion, and induces apoptosis in a panel of BRAF- and RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. Together our data demonstrate that acquired resistance to single-agent Src inhibition promotes a more invasive phenotype through an IL-1β>FAK>p130Cas>c-Jun >MMP signaling axis, and that combined inhibition of FAK and Src has the potential to block this inhibitor-induced phenotype switch."
https://openalex.org/W2905305914,"Purines are essential molecules for all forms of life. In addition to constituting a backbone of DNA and RNA, purines play roles in many metabolic pathways, such as energy utilization, regulation of enzyme activity, and cell signaling. The supply of purines is provided by two pathways: the salvage pathway and de novo synthesis. Although purine de novo synthesis (PDNS) activity varies during the cell cycle, this pathway represents an important source of purines, especially for rapidly dividing cells. A method for the detailed study of PDNS is lacking for analytical reasons (sensitivity) and because of the commercial unavailability of the compounds. The aim was to fully describe the mass spectrometric fragmentation behavior of newly synthesized PDNS-related metabolites and develop an analytical method. Except for four initial ribotide PDNS intermediates that preferentially lost water or phosphate or cleaved the forming base of the purine ring, all the other metabolites studied cleaved the glycosidic bond in the first fragmentation stage. Fragmentation was possible in the third to sixth stages. A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometric method was developed and applied in the analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited HeLa cells deficient in the individual enzymatic steps of PDNS and the salvage pathway. The identities of the newly synthesized intermediates of PDNS were confirmed by comparing the fragmentation patterns of the synthesized metabolites with those produced by cells (formed under pathological conditions of known and theoretically possible defects of PDNS). The use of stable isotope incorporation allowed the confirmation of fragmentation mechanisms and provided data for future fluxomic experiments. This method may find uses in the diagnosis of PDNS disorders, the investigation of purinosome formation, cancer research, enzyme inhibition studies, and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2904730875,"Mitochondria play a significant role in human diseases. However, disease associations with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) SNPs have proven difficult to replicate. An analysis of eight schizophrenia-associated mtDNA SNPs, in 23,743 Danes without a psychiatric diagnosis and 2,538 schizophrenia patients, revealed marked inter-allelic differences in mitochondrial haplogroup affiliation and nuclear ancestry. This bi-genomic dependence could entail population stratification. Only two mitochondrial SNPs, m.15043A and m.15218G, were significantly associated with schizophrenia. However, these associations disappeared when corrected for haplogroup affiliation and nuclear ancestry. The extensive bi-genomic dependence documented here is a major concern when interpreting historic, as well as designing future, mtDNA association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2904891272,"La proteins are RNA chaperones that perform various functions depending on distinct RNA-binding modes and their subcellular localization. In the nucleus, they help process UUU-3′OH–tailed nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as pre-tRNAs, whereas in the cytoplasm they contribute to translation of poly(A)-tailed mRNAs. La accumulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm is controlled by several trafficking elements, including a canonical nuclear localization signal in the extreme C terminus and a nuclear retention element (NRE) in the RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) domain. Previous findings indicate that cytoplasmic export of La due to mutation of the NRE can be suppressed by mutations in RRM1, but the mechanism by which the RRM1 and RRM2 domains functionally cooperate is poorly understood. In this work, we use electromobility shift assays (EMSA) to show that mutations in the NRE and RRM1 affect binding of human La to pre-tRNAs but not UUU-3′OH or poly(A) sequences, and we present compensatory mutagenesis data supporting a direct interaction between the RRM1 and RRM2 domains. Moreover, we use collision-induced unfolding and time-resolved hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS analyses to study the conformational dynamics that occur when this interaction is intact or disrupted. Our results suggest that the intracellular distribution of La may be linked to its RNA-binding modes and provide the first evidence for a direct protein–protein interdomain interaction in La proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2905121710,"The risk of thromboembolisms during the post-cardioversion period is high. For patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 2.0~3.0) is recommended for at least three weeks prior and four weeks after cardioversion. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of apixaban in preventing thromboembolic events during post-cardioversion. We enrolled 127 consecutive persistent AF patients (83 persistent, 44 longstanding persistent AF), scheduled to undergo cardioversion and were pretreated with apixaban. All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to rule out thrombi in the left atrium (LA) or LA appendage (LAA) after anticoagulation with apixaban. The median duration of anticoagulation before the TEE was 37 (interquartile range [IQR] 34, 50) days. There were 7 patients (5.5%) with visible thrombi in the LAA. A spontaneous echo contrast was noted in 24 (18.9%) patients. Cardioversion was attempted in 117 patients, and they were prescribed amiodarone before the elective DC cardioversion. Sinus rhythm was achieved in 37 patients (31.6%) by amiodarone itself. DC cardioversion was attempted in 80 patients and was successful in 73 (91.3%). None of the cardioverted patients had any thromboembolic events within one month. Transient ischemic attacks were observed in one patient during a median follow up period of 202 days (IQR 143, 294). In conclusion, apixaban could be used as an anticoagulant for patients scheduled for cardioversion. However, the incidence of thrombi was not negligible. TEE or other imaging modalities should be considered before cardioversion or other invasive procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2904163034,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prognosis remains poor even after complete resection owing to no valuable biomarkers for recurrence and chemosensitivity. Tumors not expressing MSH3 show elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST). EMAST reportedly occurs in several tumors. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMAST was reportedly correlated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitivity. However, EMAST prevalence in PDAC and its significance as a prognostic biomarker are unknown. This study aimed to investigate EMAST prevalence in PDAC and the associations between EMAST and pathological factors, EMAST and prognosis, and EMAST and MSH3 expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC). We assessed 40 PDAC patients undergoing surgery. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumors and normal tissues. EMAST and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) were analyzed using five polymorphic tetranucleotide markers and five mononucleotide markers, respectively. Tumor sections were stained for MSH3, and staining intensity was evaluated via the Histoscore (H-score). Eighteen of 40 (45%) PDAC patients were EMAST-positive; however, none were MSI-H-positive. Clinicopathological characteristics including overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were not significantly different between EMAST-positive and EMAST-negative patients (P = 0.45, 0.98 respectively). IHC was performed to evaluate MSH3 protein expression levels for the PDAC tissue specimens. H-scores of EMAST-positive patients ranged from 0 to 300 (median, 40) and those of EMAST-negative patients ranged from 0 to 300 (median, 170). MSH3 protein was not significantly downregulated in EMAST-positive patients (P = 0.07). This study is a preliminary study and the number of cases investigated was small, and thus, study of a larger cohort will reveal the clinical implication of EMAST."
https://openalex.org/W2905263967,"Digestion of food and metabolism of frogs are little studied at the moment, and such processes could be very particular in the case of amphibians, given their ectothermic and carnivorous nature which may lead them to use nutrients through specific biochemical pathways. In the present study, 24 adult Xenopus laevis (six replicates with two frogs per treatment) were randomly assigned to two diets with different carbohydrate:fat ratio (4.5:1 and 2.1:1), changing the dietary glucogenic and lipogenic proportions. Food intake (FI) per unit metabolic body weight (MBW) as well as macronutrient digestibility were calculated, and circulating blood acylcarnitines and amino acids measured, in order to evaluate the effect of the diet treatments. Results demonstrated that food intake regulated most of the changes in the parameters evaluated; significant differences were obtained in crude protein and fat digestibilities through the effect of FI/MBW (p<0.05), whereas diet treatment had a significant effect on the levels of malonyl-CoA. Food intake also significantly impacted malonyl, isovaleryl, hydroxyisovaleryl and long chain fatty acid concentrations; significant (p<0.05) interactions between those metabolites were detected owing to diet. The findings obtained suggest that food intake was the main factor controlling digestion and metabolism in X. laevis, with frogs preferring to utilise protein and fat as primary sources for energy production in the citric acid cycle, reflecting characteristics of a strict carnivore physiological model."
https://openalex.org/W2903946057,"The periplasmic small heat shock protein HdeA from Escherichia coli is inactive under normal growth conditions (at pH 7) and activated only when E. coli cells are subjected to a sudden decrease in pH, converting HdeA into an acid-denatured active state. Here, using in vitro fibrillation assays, transmission EM, atomic-force microscopy, and CD analyses, we found that when HdeA is active as a chaperone, it is also capable of forming inactive aggregates that, at first glance, resemble amyloid fibrils. We noted that the activity of HdeA takes precedence over fibrillogenesis under acidic conditions, as the presence of denatured substrate protein was sufficient to suppress HdeA fibril formation. Further experiments suggested that the secondary structure of HdeA fibrils deviates somewhat from typical amyloid fibrils and contains α-helices. Strikingly, HdeA fibrils that formed at pH 2 were immediately resolubilized by a simple shift to pH 7 and from there could regain activity upon a return to pH 1. HdeA, therefore, provides an unusual example of a reversible form of protein fibrillation with an atypical secondary structure composition. The competition between active assistance of denatured polypeptides (its molecular chaperone activity) and the formation of inactive fibrillary deposits (its fibrillogenic activity) provides a unique opportunity to probe the relationship among protein function, structure, and aggregation in detail."

https://openalex.org/W2904541791,"Many national (US) and International guidelines for physical activity provide guidance that under-active and sedentary adults can begin by accumulating moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in bouts as brief as 10 minutes. This guidance fits well with Goal Setting theory in that goals should be realistic and achievable, and is also consistent with Social Cognitive theory since achieving small goals should boost self-efficacy and thus, encourage continued physical activity. In contrast, Behavioral Economics might suggest that fewer, longer bouts would be more conducive to the adoption of physical activity due to the costs incurred with each separate bout of MVPA. This paper examines patterns of MVPA adoption among a sample of under-active adults from the perspective of goal setting theory and behavioral economics to explore specific strategies to help people who are in the early stages of PA activity adoption. Under-active men and women (N = 225; mean age = 46 ± 10; mean BMI = 28 ± 4.48) who enrolled in a PA intervention participated in a single goal setting session at enrollment. Participants were encouraged to set realistic goals and to increase their activity to meet national recommendations (150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) by the 6-month follow up. This process included identifying a specific frequency goal (days/week) and session duration goal (minutes/day). At baseline, participants reported average weekly MVPA of 14.59 min (± 24), which increased to an average of 140.52 (± 143.55) at 6 months. MVPA goals at baseline averaged 33.24 min/day (± 18.08) and 3.85 days/week (± 1.31). Analyses showed that longer session duration goals set at baseline were associated with more weekly minutes of MVPA at 6 months (b = 1.26, SE = 0.58, t = 2.17, p = 0.03). There was no significant association between goals for number of days per week (frequency) or total minutes of weekly MVPA (minutes x frequency) and MVPA at 6 months. Widely promoted guidelines for uptake of physical activity recommend accumulating physical activity in bouts as short as 10 minutes. This recommendation may ultimately hinder the adoption of physical activity among under-active and sedentary individuals. For the purposes of behavioral adoption of MVPA, more ambitious session duration goals appear to result in higher levels of physical activity participation."

The interpretations of such screens are however complex and more examples with inhibitors of known targets are needed. Here two T-cell lines were treated with an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase and analyzed with untargeted GC-MS. The interpretation of the data was enhanced by the use of two different cell-lines and supports aspartate aminotransferase as a target. In addition, the data suggest an unexpected off-target effect on glutamate decarboxylase. The results exemplify the potency of metabolomics to provide insight into both mode of action and off-target effects of drug candidates."
