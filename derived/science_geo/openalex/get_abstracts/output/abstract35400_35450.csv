https://openalex.org/W2066215499,"The mouse albumin gene promoter has six closely spaced binding sites for nuclear proteins that are located between the TATA motif and nucleotide position -170. In vitro transcription with liver or spleen nuclear extracts of templates containing either mutated or polymerized albumin promoter elements establishes a hierarchy of the different protein binding sites for tissue-specific albumin gene transcription. The HNF-1 and C/EBP binding sites strongly activate transcription in a tissue-specific manner. The NF-Y binding site has a lower activation potential and is less specific, being equally efficient in liver and spleen nuclear extracts. The remaining elements are relatively weak activator sites."
https://openalex.org/W1551563523,"Abstract The energy requirements for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into isolated chloroplasts have been reinvestigated. We have shown that, in contrast to protein import into mitochondria, the translocation of the precursors to ferredoxin, plastocyanin (prPC) and the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (prSS) across all chloroplastic membranes is independent of a protonmotive force and requires only ATP. This extends previous works in which investigations were limited to prSS and demonstrates that our results are probably general to all chloroplastic protein precursors. Our results are particularly interesting for the import of prPC, since in addition to the two envelope membranes, this protein must traverse the energy-transducing thylakoid membranes en route to its proper location in the thylakoid lumen. This lack of involvement of a protonmotive force, specifically of a transmembrane electric potential, demonstrates that separate mechanisms operate during the import of proteins into chloroplasts and mitochondria. We also examined the question of whether ATP is utilized inside or outside of chloroplasts during protein import. Previous attempts to resolve this question have resulted in conflicting answers. We found, by two independent approaches, that ATP for protein import is utilized inside chloroplasts. The implications of these results on the possible mechanisms of protein import into chloroplasts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1579297624,"Comparison of the amino acid sequence of rat liver NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase with that of flavoproteins of known three-dimensional structure suggested that residues Tyr-140 and Tyr-178 are involved in binding of FMN to the protein. To test this hypothesis, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase was expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression-secretion vector pIN-III-ompA3, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to selectively alter these residues and demonstrate that they are major determinants of the FMN-binding site. Bacterial expression produced a membrane-bound 80-kDa protein containing 1 mol each of FMN and FAD per mol of enzyme, which reduced cytochrome c at a rate of 51.5 mumol/min/mg of protein and had absorption spectra and kinetic properties very similar to those of the rat liver enzyme. Replacement of Tyr-178 with aspartate abolished FMN binding and cytochrome c reductase activity. Incubation with FMN increased catalytic activity to a maximum of 8.6 mumol/min/mg of protein. Replacement of Tyr-140 with aspartate did not eliminate FMN binding, but reduced cytochrome c reductase activity about 5-fold, suggesting that FMN may be bound in a conformation which does not permit efficient electron transfer. Substitution of phenylalanine at either position 140 or 178 had no effect on FMN content or catalytic activity. The FAD level in the Asp-178 mutant was also decreased, suggesting that FAD binding is dependent upon FMN; FAD incorporation may occur co-translationally and require prior formation of an intact FMN domain."
https://openalex.org/W1484049504,"Two distinct regions of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 promoter are responsive to autoregulation. Sequences located between nucleotides -454 to -323 and between the two major transcriptional start sites have positive regulatory activities and are induced by TGF-beta 1 in A-549 cells. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the upstream human TGF-beta 1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene is increased 8- to 10-fold by treatment of cells with TGF-beta 1, whereas that of the second promoter is increased approximately 3- to 4-fold. Using an S1 nuclease protection assay of chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase mRNA, we found that the steady-state expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA also is markedly increased. Seven distinct factors present in nuclear extracts from A-549 cells interact with the sequences between -454 and -323, strongly supporting the involvement of sequence-specific transcription factors in the transcriptional autoactivation of the human TGF-beta 1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1598858252,"In the Gram-negative anaerobe, Oxalobacter formigenes, the generation of metabolic energy depends on the transport and decarboxylation of oxalate. We have now used assays of reconstitution to study the movements of oxalate and to characterize the exchange of oxalate with formate, its immediate metabolic derivative. Membranes of O. formigenes were solubilized with octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 20% glycerol and Escherichia coli phospholipid, and detergent extracts were reconstituted by detergent dilution. [14C]Oxalate was taken up by proteoliposomes loaded with unlabeled oxalate, but not by similarly loaded liposomes or by proteoliposomes containing sulfate in place of oxalate. Oxalate transport did not depend on the presence of sodium or potassium, nor was it affected by valinomycin (1 microM), nigericin (1 microM), or a proton conductor, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 microM) when potassium was at equal concentration on either side of the membrane. Such data suggest the presence of an overall neutral oxalate self-exchange, independent of common cations or anions. Kinetic analysis of the reaction in proteoliposomes gave a Michaelis constant (Kt) for oxalate transport of 0.24 mM and a maximal velocity (Vmax) of 99 mumol/min/mg of protein. A direct exchange of oxalate and formate was indicated by the observations that formate inhibited oxalate transport and that delayed addition of formate released [14C]oxalate accumulated during oxalate exchange. Moreover, [14C]formate was taken up by oxalate-loaded proteoliposomes (but not liposomes), and this heterologous reaction could be blocked by external oxalate. Further studies, using formate-loaded proteoliposomes, suggested that the heterologous exchange was electrogenic. Thus, for assays in which N-methylglucamine served as both internal and external cation, formate-loaded particles took up oxalate at a rate of 2.4 mumol/min/mg of protein. When external or internal N-methylglucamine was replaced by potassium in the presence of valinomycin, there was, respectively, a 7-fold stimulation or an 8-fold inhibition of oxalate accumulation, demonstrating that net negative charge moved in parallel with oxalate during the heterologous exchange. The work summarized here suggests the presence of an unusually rapid and electrogenic oxalate2-:formate1- antiport in membranes of O. formigenes. Since a proton is consumed during the intracellular decarboxylation that converts oxalate into formate plus CO2, antiport of oxalate and formate would play a central role in a biochemical cycle consisting of (a) oxalate influx, (b) oxalate decarboxylation, and (c) formate efflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1959117053,"Acid proteinase activity is associated with the major surface glycoprotein (gp63) of both extracellular promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of the parasitic protozoan, Leishmania mexicana. The enzyme purified by monoclonal affinity chromatography from promastigotes is strongly inhibited by metal ion chelators, which is reversible by the addition of Zn(II). This proteinase loses its activity after dialysis against 1,10-phenanthroline. The apoenzyme thus prepared is reactivated substantially by Zn(II) and partially by Cu(II), Cd(II), Co(II), or Ni(II). From the recently published structure of the gene encoding gp63, we identify hitherto unrecognized sequences, which can be aligned to the consensus zinc-binding sites of other known metalloproteinases. Anti-gp63 polyclonal antibodies, but not the monoclonals, precipitate similar molecules from amastigotes. These molecules differ slightly from gp63 in electrophoretic mobility but have similar endopeptidase activity. Phagolysosomal degradation by macrophages of proteins entrapped in liposomes is prevented by coating them with native gp63. This protection is lost with heat denaturation of gp63 to kill its enzymatic activity. The proteolytic activity of the metalloenzyme on the surface of these parasites may thus protect their membrane from cytolytic damages during their survival, differentiation, and multiplication in the phagolysosomes of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1495202351,"One of the first steps in the transport of nuclear-encoded, cytoplasmically synthesized precursor proteins into chloroplasts is a specific binding interaction between precursor proteins and the surface of the organelle. Although protein translocation into chloroplasts requires ATP hydrolysis, binding is generally thought to be energy independent. A more detailed investigation of precursor binding to the surface of chloroplasts showed that ATP was required for efficient binding. Protein translocation is known to require relatively high levels (1 mM or more) of ATP. As little as 50-100 microM ATP caused significant stimulation of precursor binding over controls with no ATP. Several different precursors were tested and all showed increased binding upon addition of low levels of ATP. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP did not substitute for ATP, indicating that ATP hydrolysis was required for binding. A protonmotive force was not involved in the energy requirement for binding. Other (hydrolyzable) nucleotides could substitute for ATP but were less effective at stimulating binding. Binding was stimulated by ATP generated inside chloroplasts even when an ATP trap was present to destroy external ATP. We conclude that internal ATP is required for stimulation of precursor binding to chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1482405769,"We have tested the effects of serum-stimulated growth of quiescent WI38 human lung fibroblasts on cellular casein kinase II (CK-II) activity. Using the casein kinase II synthetic substrate RRREEETEEE we find a transient 6-fold elevation in CK-II activity in cell homogenates within 30 min following serum stimulation. Additional cycles of CK-II activation and inactivation are seen at 12 and 24 h after stimulation. The oscillations in CK-II activity are largely independent of de novo protein synthesis, and, thus, are likely to reflect cycles of post-translational activation and inhibition of the cellular kinase pool. In contrast to the activity profile of CK-II, we find that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is rapidly inhibited upon serum-stimulation of WI38 cells. These results demonstrate that CK-II activity is subject to unique cellular regulation during proliferation and are consistent with the postulate that CK-II plays an important role in cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W11767146,"We have isolated caldesmon (Mr = 145,000), by immunoprecipitation, from [32P]orthophosphate-loaded porcine carotid arteries. In resting muscles, caldesmon was phosphorylated to 0.45 mol of PO4/mol protein, while the 20,000-dalton myosin regulatory light chain (LC20) was phosphorylated to less than 0.05 mol/mol. After stimulation by KCl (110 mM) for 75 min and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, 1 microM) for 60 min, caldesmon phosphorylation levels rose to 0.96 and 1.1 mol/mol, respectively. LC20 phosphorylation increased to 0.49 mol/mol at 1 min of stimulation by KCl and decreased to 0.17 mol/mol at 60 min. With PDBu, phosphate incorporation into LC20 rose only slightly, reaching 0.09 mol/mol after 90 min. Muscles contracted with histamine (10 microM) or ouabain (1 microM) also demonstrated elevated levels of phosphate incorporation into caldesmon. In these muscles, LC20 phosphorylation levels were less than 0.05 mol/mol. Three major phosphopeptides of indistinguishable mobility were identified on maps of caldesmon from resting, KCl-stimulated, and PDBu-stimulated muscles. There was, however, little similarity between the phosphopeptide maps of caldesmon phosphorylated in intact tissue and maps of purified caldesmon phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) or Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1625171252,"Abstract The phosphosaccharide-inositol core of the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani was generated by treatment of the glycoconjugate with mild acid and digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The core was purified and examined by one- and two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR and by methylation analysis. From the results, the carbohydrate core was elucidated as a phosphosaccharide attached to the inositol residue of the lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol anchor of lipophosphoglycan as follows: PO4----6GalP(alpha 1----6)GalP(alpha 1----3)Galf(alpha 1----3)ManP(alpha 1----3)ManP(alpha 1----4)GlcNP(alpha 1----6)myo-inositol. The presence of an internal galactofuranose residue is highly unusual and the ManP(alpha 1----4)GlcNP(alpha 1----6)myo-inositol sequence is homologous to the respective portion of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors reported for both the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein and the rat brain Thy-1 glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1520746855,"Psoralens produce DNA interstrand cross-links which are thought to be repaired via a sequential excision and recombination mechanism in Escherichia coli. The first round of incision by UvrABC has been characterized: it results in 11-base oligonucleotide cross-linked to an intact DNA strand (Van Houten, B., Gamper, B., Holbrook, S.R., Hearst, J.E., and Sancar, A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 8077-8081). In the present work, DNA substrates containing 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT) cross-links in defined positions are constructed and used to analyze the other steps in repair. It is shown that RecA protein mediates strand transfer past an oligonucleotide cross-linked to a single-stranded DNA circle and that the resulting heteroduplex is a substrate for the UvrABC complex: it excises a double-stranded oligonucleotide which contains the HMT cross-link. It is also found that the first round of UvrABC incision does not lead directly to strand exchange but that an intervening step is needed. That step is carried out in vitro by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (pol I) which creates a single-stranded DNA region (a gap) at an incised cross-link such that RecA can initiate strand exchange. Studies using cross-linked oligonucleotides showed that the gap produced by pol I results from the inability of the polymerase to add nucleotides to a 3'-OH end two to three nucleotides away from the furan side of an HMT cross-link. Pol I can, however, extend a 3'-OH end next to the pyrone side of the cross-link. Since UvrABC incises predominantly the furan side of psoralen cross-links in duplex DNA, this discrepancy has important consequences for repair."
https://openalex.org/W1559053359,"Abstract Resonance Raman data are reported for the redox-activated form of galactose oxidase from Dactylium dendroides. Excitation within the red (659 nm) and blue (457.9 nm) absorption bands leads to strong resonance enhancement of ligated tyrosine vibrational modes at 550, 1170, 1247, 1484, and 1595 cm-1. The ring mode frequencies are unusually low, indicating a decreased bond order in the ring. The spectra clearly differ in both frequencies and relative intensities from those characteristic of known aromatic pi-radicals. Enhancement of tyrosine ring modes on excitation within absorption bands previously associated with the presence of the radical in the active site suggests that the ligated tyrosine residue is present in the radical site and may stabilize this radical species through formation of a charge transfer complex. A dramatically different Raman spectrum is observed for the N3- adduct of galactose oxidase, exhibiting a single strong 1483 cm-1 feature. The intense visible-near IR absorption bands for galactose oxidase may derive from transitions within a charge transfer complex between an aromatic free radical and a tyrosine-copper complex."
https://openalex.org/W1552571969,"Hepatic regulatory oxysterols were analyzed to determine which oxysterols were present in livers of mice fed a cholesterol-free diet and whether repression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase following cholesterol feeding was accompanied by an increase in one or more oxysterols. Analysis of free and esterified sterols from mice fed a cholesterol-free diet resulted in the identification and quantitation of six regulatory oxysterols: 24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 26-hydroxycholesterol, 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol. Following the addition of cholesterol to the diet for 1 or 2 nights, hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity declined and the levels of oxysterols, especially those of the side-chain-hydroxylated sterols, increased. Total 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase repressor units attributable to identified free oxysterols increased 2.5- and 6-fold after 1 and 2 nights, respectively, of cholesterol feeding. The amounts of esterified 24-, 25-, and 26-hydroxycholesterol also increased, with the increase in esterified 24-hydroxycholesterol being the greatest. The 24-hydroxycholesterol was predominantly the 24S epimer and the 26-hydroxycholesterol was predominantly the 25R epimer, indicating enzymatic catalysis of their formation. The observed correlation between increased levels of regulatory oxysterols and repression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in cholesterol-fed mice is consistent with a hypothesis that intracellular oxysterol metabolites regulate the level of the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1597336164,"Abstract Ferritin H and L subunits present cell-specific features of structure, function, and transcriptional regulation. Mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells offer an interesting model to analyze the erythroid-specific expression of ferritin genes for comparison with the liver, an iron-storing tissue. cDNA clones for mouse ferritin H and L subunits have been isolated and sequenced. The two subunits have very similar calculated masses, 20.9 and 20.6 kDa for H and L, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of the subunits encoded by the cDNA 1) allows unambiguous identification of mouse ferritin subunits; 2) clearly shows that mouse H and L chains can make heteropolymers in vitro; and 3) demonstrates that, at least in vitro, free subunits can coexist with subunits polymerized into complete shells. The mouse ferritin gene family displays a variable degree of complexity, ranging from three homologous sequences for the H genes to 10-14 homologous loci for the L genes. Transcription of ferritin genes exhibits tissue-specific difference. Nuclear transcriptional run-off experiments show that the L gene is more actively transcribed in the liver than in Friend erythroleukemia cells at different stages of maturation. The accumulation of the H subunit mRNA which results from dimethyl sulfoxide induction of Friend cells is the consequence of an increase in the transcription rate of the H gene. However, the H gene mRNA is transcribed at a similar rate in the liver and in induced Friend cells although 5-fold more mRNA accumulates in these cells. Therefore, there is a tissue-specific regulation of mouse ferritin expression at both the transcription and mRNA stability levels."
https://openalex.org/W1550970695,"The C-terminal domain of mammalian RNA polymerase subunit IIa consists of 52-tandem repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. This C-terminal domain is essentially unmodified in RNA polymerase IIA and extensively phosphorylated in RNA polymerase IIO. A monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal domain was shown by kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to have a 10-fold higher reactivity with RNA polymerase IIA than with RNA polymerase IIO. The ability of increasing concentrations of this monoclonal antibody to inhibit the initiation and elongation phase of transcription was determined. Although both phases of the transcription reaction were inhibited, a 10-fold higher concentration of antibody was required to inhibit elongation than was required to inhibit initiation. These results support the hypothesis that RNA polymerase IIA, containing an unphosphorylated C-terminal domain, is involved in the formation of an initiated complex, whereas elongation is catalyzed by RNA polymerase IIO, containing a phosphorylated C-terminal domain. Further indication that the C-terminal domain undergoes a structural change during the transcription cycle results from the observation that this domain is 3-fold more sensitive to clostripain cleavage in the elongation enzyme than in the free enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1593406565,"The energy dependence of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes, using electroinjected [14C]lactose as an autophagy probe and atractyloside to alter intracellular ATP levels. Since autophagocytosed lactose is hydrolyzed in lysosomes, several steps in the pathway could be analyzed. The following observations were made. 1) The overall autophagic degradation of electroinjected [14C]lactose was strongly energy-dependent. More than 85% inhibition was obtained when the ATP content decreased from the control value of 10 µmol/g dry weight to 4 µmol/g dry weight. 2) The initial step, i.e. the autophagic sequestration of [14C]lactose, measured in the presence of vinblastine to prevent transfer of lactose to lysosomes, was as sensitive to small changes in ATP as was the overall lactose degradation. 3) The steady state level of sequestered [14C]lactose remained constant as ATP decreased from 10 to 4 µmol/g dry weight, indicating that the sequestration step and some postsequestrational process were inhibited to a similar extent by ATP depletion. 4) The final step in the pathway, intralysosomal hydrolysis, was measured by allowing [14C]lactose to preaccumulate intralysosomally in the presence of the reversible lysosome inhibitor propylamine. Following propylamine removal and inhibition of further sequestration by 3-methyladenine, ATP-dependent hydrolysis of the intralysosomal [14C]lactose could be demonstrated. However, this hydrolysis step was not as sensitive to small changes in ATP as was the sequestration step or the overall autophagic lactose degradation. Control of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway in response to energy deprivation would therefore not seem to occur at the lysosomal level, but may be exerted both at the sequestration step and at a postsequestrational, prelysosomal step."
https://openalex.org/W114544868,"Glutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone, tyrosylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone, and phenylalanylprolylarginyl chloromethyl ketone have been labeled at their amino termini using fluorescein, rhodamine-X, lissamine-rhodamine, pyrene, and the 1,5-, 2,5-, and 2,6-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl moieties. These peptidyl chloromethyl ketones have also been modified by incorporation of biotin and epsilon-amino caproyl biotin. The ability of these various chloromethyl ketones to be incorporated into a collection of zymogen-enzyme pairs has been evaluated using a variety of coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins. All labeled chloromethyl ketones were efficiently incorporated into the proteases tested, with the exception of urokinase which was refractory to inhibition by phenylalanylprolylarginyl chloromethyl ketone derivatives. No modification of any zymogen species was observed even under conditions designed to detect minimal reactivity. When enzymes were modified using chloromethyl ketones labeled with epsilon-amino caproyl biotin, the modified proteins readily reacted with avidin under a variety of different conditions. The observed reactivity with avidin was used in enzyme blotting following electrophoretic resolution of polypeptide chains and to remove active enzyme present in enzyme-zymogen mixtures. These reagents have been used to evaluate the potential for active site expression by the single-chain human factor VII molecule. Studies conducted with tissue factor, phospholipids, and calcium using factor X as substrate demonstrate that no activity can be obtained without initial activation of either factor X to factor Xa or factor VII to factor VIIa by an external source. We thus conclude that factor VII is a true zymogen, inert in the blood clotting process prior to its cleavage to factor VIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1538987641,"We have cloned and characterized eight members of the kallikrein gene family from rat genomic DNA. Three of the cloned genes correspond to the previously characterized kallikrein family mRNAs PS, S2, and P1, which encode true kallikrein, tonin, and a novel kallikrein-like enzyme, respectively. In two cases, two kallikrein family genes are located on single genomic clones, suggesting close linkage of this family in the rat genome. Based on the total number of cloned genes and mRNAs, the minimum size of the rat family is 11 genes. Comparisons between the rat genes demonstrate a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity (greater than 80%) in exonic, intronic, and nearby flanking regions. This extensive sequence conservation not limited to clearly functional domains suggests that concerted evolution of this gene family has occurred. Despite the high overall sequence conservation among the rat family members, several discrete regions of high variability exist in the coding regions. We have defined the tissue-specific expression of the PS (true kallikrein), S2 (tonin), and S3 mRNAs with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes derived from these variant regions. PS is expressed in a wide range of tissues, while S2 mRNA is restricted to the submaxillary gland and S3 mRNA to the submaxillary and prostate glands. The high sequence conservation within the upstream flanking regions of these genes suggests that a small number of nucleotide differences determines the disparate transcriptional specificity of individual family members."
https://openalex.org/W2411648781,"Abstract Prothymosin alpha and thymosin alpha 1 are believed to be thymus-derived, hormone-like materials with immunomodulatory functions performed outside the cell. These functions are inconsistent with the existence of a full length cDNA clone that does not encode an amino-terminal signal peptide or several consecutive hydrophobic residues. A study of the prothymosin alpha mRNAs and genes was undertaken in search of evidence for secreted forms of the protein. Prothymosin alpha mRNA was localized exclusively on free, rather than membrane-bound, polysomes. Upon screening cosmid and plasmid libraries totaling 2 X 10(6) clones, a gene family consisting of six members was identified. Sequence information from the 5'-ends of all the genes indicated that none encodes an amino-terminal signal peptide. One of the genes, apparently by means of alternate splicing, gives rise to two prothymosin alpha mRNAs, one of which has an additional internal glutamic acid codon with respect to the other. Comparison of the translated nucleic acid sequences of the five remaining genes with those encoded in the mRNAs revealed 30-98% homology in the first 50 amino acids. These five genes appear to be processed genes and/or pseudogenes. The localization of prothymosin alpha mRNAs on free polysomes, together with the partial nucleotide sequences of the genes, strongly suggest an intracellular function for prothymosin alpha. Therefore, the possibility must be raised that prothymosin alpha and its peptide derivatives act as xenobiotics when introduced into assays of immune function."
https://openalex.org/W1571172000,"Lamin B is reversibly methyl-esterified and phosphorylated during the mammalian cell cycle. In order to study the role of methylation in lamin B function, we isolated mitotic cells in the presence of the microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole. Following removal of nocodazole, methylation of mitotic lamin B was found to precede its assembly into the nuclear envelope as cells exited mitosis. Very little additional methylation took place on assembled lamins. We were able to slow the rate of lamin B methylation with methylthioadenosine (MTA). A delay in lamin B methylation was accompanied by a corresponding delay in assembly of lamin B into the envelope. The delay was approximately 20-30 min beyond the typical 60-70 min usually required. Assembly of lamins A and C, which are not methylated, was also delayed by MTA, although to a lesser degree, suggesting that an interaction between the lamins is necessary for formation of the nuclear envelope. Chromatin decondensation was also slowed in the presence of MTA. Other inhibitors of methylation which had no inhibitory effect on the methyl esterification of lamin B were tested and found to have no effect on envelope assembly or chromatin decondensation. These results were obtained with Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as with the stem cell line, PC 13. Dephosphorylation of lamin B normally follows a time course similar to that of nuclear envelope assembly. In the presence of MTA, however, lamin B assembly was slowed with little effect on dephosphorylation. This resulted in a large population of dephosphorylated, but unassembled, lamin B protein, demonstrating that dephosphorylation is not sufficient for envelope assembly. The lack of effect on the time course of dephosphorylation also suggests that MTA is not acting upstream of the methylation event."
https://openalex.org/W1536993231,"Abstract Heparin was previously reported to potentiate the mitogenic activity of endothelial cell mitogens in a crude extract of bovine hypothalami (Thornton, S. C., Mueller, S. N., and Levine, E. M. (1983) Science 222, 623-625). We and others (Gospodarowicz, D., and Cheng, J. (1986) J. Cell. Physiol. 128, 475-484) have reported that the growth stimulatory effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) are potentiated in a similar manner. We have used these observations as the basis of an assay to characterize the importance of size, sulfation, and anticoagulant activity of heparin in mediating this effect. Partial nitrous acid depolymerization of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa resulted in a mixture of heparin fragments, containing oligosaccharides ranging from disaccharides to polysaccharides of about 40 monosaccharides in length. This mixture was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography and gel permeation chromatography to obtain size-homogeneous oligosaccharides with different degrees of sulfation. Assay of these heparin-derived saccharides in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of aFGF revealed that a minimum chain length and a certain degree of sulfation is required in order to potentiate the action of aFGF. Low sulfate oligosaccharides (4-16 units) were unable to potentiate aFGF, whereas medium sulfate fractions of octadecasaccharides and larger were able to moderately potentiate aFGF. The potentiation of aFGF by the high sulfate fraction correlated with the saccharide size: 12 or more monosaccharide units were necessary to achieve potentiation equivalent to whole heparin, octa- and decasaccharides were mildly stimulatory, and hexasaccharides were without effect. In the absence of aFGF, intact heparin as well as all the oligosaccharides examined, inhibited the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells to approximately the same degree, between 20 and 50% inhibition. When a tetradecasaccharide was separated into a binding and a nonbinding fraction on matrix-bound antithrombin III, no difference was seen for these fractions in the endothelial cell proliferation assay. These results indicate that both size and sulfation of a heparin-derived oligosaccharide contribute to its ability to interact with aFGF and/or endothelial cells and that this interaction is independent of anticoagulant activity. In addition, our findings suggest that the inhibitory and potentiating effects of heparin on capillary endothelial cells have different structural requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1605214441,"Abstract The role of the adenovirus major late upstream transcription factor (MLTF) in transcription from the adenovirus major late and the IVa2 promoters was studied. The transcription initiation site of the IVa2 promoter is located 210 nucleotides upstream from the CAP site of the major late promoter. Transcription from these two promoters occurs on different DNA strands. Thus, this divergent transcription suggests that the same factor could simultaneously regulate the expression of two different genes. This was investigated utilizing a reconstituted transcription system in vitro. The addition of MLTF to reaction mixtures containing the purified general transcription factors and the major late promoter resulted in a 10-12-fold stimulation of transcription. This stimulation was because of an increase of the stability of the preinitiation complex. MLTF allowed DNA template molecules to undergo multiple rounds of transcription. MLTF also stimulated transcription from the adenovirus-encoded IVa2 promoter. Surprisingly, reconstitution experiments indicated that transcription from the IVa2 promoter which does not have a TATA sequence required all the previously described general transcription factors, including TFIID, the TATA binding protein. The requirement for TFIID was demonstrated by reconstitution experiments as well as by oligonucleotide competition experiments. The implications of this observation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1660497171,"Abstract Transferrin (Tf), the iron transport protein of vertebrate serum, is mainly synthesized in the liver. cis-Acting DNA elements required for liver-specific expression of the human Tf gene were identified by transient and stable expression assays in human hepatoma (HepG2 and Hep3B) and epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines. Deletion analysis of the 5' DNA sequences of the gene have defined four functionally different regions: (a) A cell type-specific promoter located between positions -125 and -45 which interacts with two nuclear factors and is sufficient for liver-specific expression. (b) A distal promoter region from -620 to -125 base pairs containing positive and negative cis-acting elements which regulate the promoter activity. (c) A negative-acting region between -1.0 and -0.6 kilobase pairs which down-regulates transcription from the Tf promoter. (d) An enhancer located between -4.0 and -3.3 kilobase pairs which is more active in hepatoma than in HeLa cells. Thus, Tf gene expression is modulated by a combination of multiple positive and negative cis-acting elements.

https://openalex.org/W1592886695,"Abstract Human progesterone receptors (PR) are structurally complex. At basal states there are two forms: A-receptors of approximately 94 kDa and B-receptors which are triplets of approximately 114, 117, and 120 kDa. All the proteins bind hormone and are phosphorylated. By using PR-rich T47Dco human breast cancer cells, pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine, and receptor immunopurification with anti-PR monoclonal antibodies, we show that PR are synthesized as single B-proteins of 114 kDa and single A-proteins of 94 kDa. The mature B-triplets form 6-10 h later by post-translational phosphorylation at sites restricted to the B-proteins. This slow maturation is not required for PR activation to hormone binding states, however, since A- and B-receptors that are less than 15 min old respond to progestins by undergoing transformation and nuclear binding accompanied by a rapid secondary phosphorylation common to both proteins. These studies explain the complex structure of the mature human B-receptors and the transformed A- and B-receptors, and address issues dealing with A- and B-proreceptor synthesis and receptor activation rates."
https://openalex.org/W1574175573,"Lysosomal enzymes require a mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker, constructed on asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains, for targeting to lysosomes. We have identified the glycosylation sites of human beta-hexosaminidase B and have determined the influence of individual oligosaccharides on the phosphorylation, lysosomal targeting, and catalytic activity of the enzyme. The five potential glycosylation sites of the hexosaminidase beta-chain were modified individually by site-directed mutagenesis, and the constructs were expressed in COS 1 cells. By this analysis, we determined that four of the five potential sites were glycosylated. Two of the four oligosaccharides were preferentially phosphorylated. The absence of these two preferentially phosphorylated oligosaccharides resulted in greatly reduced amounts of the lysosomal form of the enzyme with increased secretion into the medium. The catalytic activity of beta-hexosaminidase B was not significantly altered by the absence of individual oligosaccharides suggesting the folding and assembly of the enzyme was not disrupted."
https://openalex.org/W2412407793,"Biosynthetic incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into proteins was assessed in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. A single predominant labeled protein of about 50 kDa was observed following electrophoresis of cell extracts on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Subcellular fractionation showed this protein to distribute similarly to a 46-kDa [3H]ethanolamine-labeled protein reported previously (Tisdale, E. J., and Tartakoff, A. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8244-8252). In particular, the protein was enriched in cytosolic and microsomal fractions relative to plasma membrane and thus did not appear to correspond to the class of proteins with glycoinositol phospholipid anchors, the only post-translational protein modification involving ethanolamine that had been described previously. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis involving isoelectric focusing followed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the protein was very basic, and nitrocellulose blots of one- and two-dimensional gels subjected to 3H autoradiography and immunostaining with antisera to purified rabbit elongation factor (EF) 1 alpha revealed that the protein was EF-1 alpha. Copurification of rabbit EF-1 alpha and the [3H]ethanolamine-labeled protein from K562 cells further supported this identification. Analysis of tryptic fragments produced from the copurified proteins by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography showed two radiolabeled peptides. Amino acid analysis demonstrated 1 residue of ethanolamine in each peptide, and peptide sequencing revealed that the ethanolamine-containing component(s) was attached to Glu301 and Glu374 in the EF-1 alpha protein sequence deduced from a human EF-1 alpha cDNA. These data confirm a new class of post-translational protein modifications involving ethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1503344811,"Proteolysis by trypsin of gizzard myosin light chain kinase (MLC kinase) in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin produced a 64,000-dalton inactive fragment which was converted to a 61,000-dalton Ca2+-calmodulin-independent active fragment. This confirmed previous results (Ikebe, M., Stepinska, M., Kemp, B. E., Means, A. R., and Hartshorne, D. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13828-13834). On the other hand, proteolysis of MLC kinase in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin initially produced a 66,000-dalton Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent active fragment which was converted to a 61,000-dalton Ca2+-calmodulin-independent active fragment with further proteolysis. The amino acid sequences from the N terminus of the 66,000-dalton, 64,000-dalton, and 61,000-dalton fragments were determined. The sequence was not found in the reported partial amino acid sequence of MLC kinase (C-terminal 60% of whole sequence) (Guerriero, V., Jr., Russo, M. A., Olson, N. J., Putkey, J. A., and Means, A. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 8372-8381), and, therefore, the cleavage sites are in the remaining 40% N-terminal portion of the sequence of MLC kinase. The C terminus of these MLC kinase fragments was determined by employing the carboxypeptidases A, B, and Y digestion followed by the amino acid analysis of the released amino acids. As a result, it was concluded that the C terminus of the 66,000-dalton, 64,000-dalton, and 61,000-dalton MLC kinase fragments are arginine 522, lysine 490 and arginine 494, and lysine 473, respectively. These results show that the inhibitory domain is in the amino acid sequence of 474-490, and that the amino acid sequence 494-522 confers the calmodulin-dependent kinase activity."

Purple membrane was solubilized in Triton X-100 and BR was purified by size exclusion chromatography using 3-[cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPSO) detergent at pH 5. Molar ratios of phospholipid/BR ranged from 0.4 to 0.05 corresponding to 94-98% phospholipid removal. Purified BR has an absorbance ratio (A280nm/A548nm) of 1.5-1.6 in the dark-adapted state which is the highest purified BR/protein ratio reported to date. The purified BR in CHAPSO shows maximum stability in the pH range 5.0-5.5. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of native purple membrane and solubilized BR from most Halobacterium halobium JW-3 cultures show 3 higher molecular weight bands in addition to BR. Immunological staining and amino acid sequencing indicates that these additional proteins are partially processed forms of the BR precursor protein. The BR preprotein contains 13 additional amino acids on the NH2 terminus which are removed by post-translational processing in at least four steps. Isoelectric focusing separated most delipidated and non-delipidated BR samples into 8 bands. Incomplete BR post-translational processing BR is thought to be largely responsible for the multiplicity of isoelectric BR species. The principal components have pI values of 5.20 and 5.24 and both have absorption maxima at 550 nm, characteristic of detergent-solubilized BR. BR in Triton X-100 or nonylglucoside, delipidated BR in CHAPSO, and BR in intact purple membrane all have a dark-adapted ratio of 13-cis to all-trans-retinal of 1.9:1."
https://openalex.org/W1488396924,"The crystal structure of the binary complex of nonactivated ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum and a transition state analogue, 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate has been determined to 2.6 A resolution with x-ray crystallographic methods. The transition state analogue binds in a rather extended conformation at the active site. The orientation of the transition state analogue within the active site could be determined from the electron density maps. The P1 phosphate group of the analogue binds at a site built up of residues from loops 5 and 6 of the alpha/beta-barrel. The phosphate group interacts with the side chains of the conserved residues Arg-288, His-321, and Ser-368 and with main chain nitrogens from residues Thr-322 and Gly-323. The second phosphate group of the transition state analogue binds at the opposite side of the barrel close to loops 1 and 8. Significant differences for the positions and interactions of the P2 phosphate group with the enzyme are found in the two subunits of the dimer. The different mode of binding for this phosphate group in the two subunits is interpreted as a consequence of different conformations of the polypeptide chain observed in loops 6 and 8. The P2 phosphate group interacts with the sidechains of Lys-166 and Lys-329. Loop 6, which is disordered in the nonactivated, nonliganded enzyme is considerably more ordered in one of the subunits, probably due to the interaction of the side chain of Lys-329 with the P2 phosphate group. Almost all oxygen atoms are hydrogen bonded to groups on the enzyme. The carboxyl group forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of the conserved Asn-111. The binding of the transition state analogue to the nonactivated enzyme is different from the binding of the analogue to activated spinach ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1507453253,"Abstract Isocolchicine is a structurally related isomer of colchicine altered in the methoxytropone C ring. In spite of virtual structural homology of colchicine and isocolchicine, isocolchicine is commonly believed to be inactive in binding to tubulin and inhibiting microtubule assembly. We have found that isocolchicine does indeed bind to the colchicine site on tubulin, as demonstrated by its ability to competitively inhibit [3H]colchicine binding to tubulin with a KI approximately 400 microM. Isocolchicine inhibits tubulin assembly into microtubules with an I50 of about 1 mM, but the affinity of isocolchicine for the colchicine receptor site, 5.5 +/- 0.9 x 10(3) M-1 at 23 degrees C, is much less (approximately 500-fold) than that of colchicine. Unlike colchicine, isocolchicine binds rapidly, and the absorption and fluorescence properties of the complex are only modestly altered compared to free ligand. It is proposed that the binding of isocolchicine to tubulin may be rationalized either in terms of conformational states of colchicinoids when liganded to tubulin or by the structural requirements for C-10 substituents for high affinity binding to the colchicine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1602883095,"Abstract Synthesis of mRNA in trypanosomes involves an apparent trans-splicing reaction whereby a common 39-nucleotide mini-exon sequence is joined to the protein-coding exon of a mRNA precursor. We have previously shown (Muhich, M. L., and Boothroyd, J. C. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3837-3846) that the trans-splicing pathway of Trypanosoma brucei is sensitive to disruption by severe heat shock. Here we demonstrate that the synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) mRNA in T. brucei is apparently resistant to the heat-induced disruption of splicing. The 5'-ends of hsp 70 mRNAs are shown to be identical for molecules synthesized at either normal or heat shock temperatures, and in both cases, the 5'-terminal mini-exon sequence is present. These results suggest that T. brucei has evolved a mechanism which directly compensates for the deleterious effects of heat shock on trans-splicing, one which allows for the continued mini-exon-dependent trans-splicing of selected pre-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W129345003,"We describe the purification of an actin regulatory protein from bovine adrenal medulla. This protein caused a dose-dependent decrease of the specific viscosity of actin solution within 30 s of its addition in a Ca2+-sensitive way. Sedimentation assays and the observation by electron microscopy showed that this effect was ascribable to the fragmentation of actin filaments. This protein apparently promoted nucleation of actin polymerization and increased the critical concentration of actin for polymerization nearly 5-fold, suggesting its binding to the barbed end of actin filaments. The inhibitory effect of this protein on the elongation of actin from the barbed end of the myosin subfragment S1-labeled actin seeds confirmed this suggestion. These properties are similar to those of gelsolin. However, the physicochemical properties of this protein having a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 74,000, a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm, a sedimentation coefficient (s0(20),w) of 4.5 S, and an immunological characterization showed that this protein is different from gelsolin."
https://openalex.org/W1504519388,"Abstract Bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein is an essential component of the T7 DNA replication system, acting as both a primase and a helicase. The gene 4 protein has been shown to translocate along single-stranded DNA in the 5'----3' direction, using an energy source for this movement the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, preferably dTTP. Thus, measuring the rate and extent of dTTP hydrolysis provides a means to directly measure translocation. We have determined that the hydrolysis of dTTP by the gene 4 protein is strongly inhibited by the presence of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) adducts on the DNA. Time course experiments on adduct-containing DNA show that after an initial burst of hydrolysis, which parallels what is observed on unmodified DNA, further hydrolysis abruptly ceases. Addition of excess unmodified DNA does not restore the hydrolysis activity. These data suggest that the gene 4 protein is blocked and sequestered on the DNA at the site of the adduct. This was confirmed by experiments in which gene 4 protein preferentially protected the radiolabeled adduct-containing DNA but not randomly labeled M13 DNA. The gene 4 protein bound to the B[a]P-modified DNA was isolated, and the complex was found only to contain dTTP. These results have been used to formulate a model for gene 4 protein translocation in which we speculate that the power stroke for unidirectional movement along the single-stranded DNA is the displacement of dTDP by dTTP. Finally, we observe a constant ratio of DNA synthesis to dTTP hydrolysis regardless of the number of B[a]P adducts in the template suggesting that a significant portion of the inhibition of DNA synthesis is a direct consequence of the inhibition of gene 4 translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1489143173,"Abstract The existence of a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-like gene family in rat has been demonstrated through isolation and sequencing of the N-terminal domain exons of presumably five discrete genes (rnCGM1-5). This finding will allow for the first time the study of functional and clinical aspects of the tumor marker CEA and related antigens in an animal model. Sequence comparison with the corresponding regions of members of the human CEA gene family revealed a relatively low similarity at the amino acid level, which indicates rapid divergence of the CEA gene family during evolution and explains the lack of cross-reactivity of rat CEA-like antigens with antibodies directed against human CEA. The N-terminal domains of the rat CEA-like proteins show structural similarity to immunoglobulin variable domains, including the presence of hypervariable regions, which points to a possible receptor function of the CEA family members. Although so far only one of the five rat CEA-like genes could be shown to be transcriptionally active, multiple mRNA species derived from other members of the rat CEA-like gene family have been found to be differentially expressed in rat placenta and liver."

Preliminary crystallization experiments using the recombinant propeptide lectin yield crystals in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 64.8 A, b = 73.8 A, and c = 109.0 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) that diffract to 2.8-A resolution.

https://openalex.org/W82212858,"Abstract Nitric oxide reductase of Paracoccus denitrificans was purified, with the use of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO) detergent, as membrane vesicles of apparent Mr = 2-3 x 10(6). Fifty percent of the protein was a peptide of Mr = 34,000. Further fractionation with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) resulted in vesicles in which the peptide constituted 90-95% of the protein. This peptide, which is rich in Ala, Gly, Ser, Asx, and Glx, is considered to be the peptide of nitric oxide reductase. The CHAPSO- and SDS-fractionated preparations lost activity at 4 degrees C, pH 7.4, with half-times, respectively, of about 6 days and 4 h. Specific activities at 32 degrees C, pH 7.4, of about 0.33 mumol of NO x min-1 x mg-1 were realized after fractionation with CHAPSO in a phenazine methosulfate/ascorbate-based assay. The Km(NO) was less than or equal to 17 microM at pH 7.4. Rates decreased substantially below pH 5 and above pH 7.6. The preparations were free or almost free of cytochromes, exhibited otherwise no absorption bands in the visible region, contained no redox metals except for very small amounts of iron, were not inhibited by EDTA or some other common inhibitors of redox-metal enzymes, and were not observed to catalyze the reduction of nitrate, nitrite, or N2O. An absorption band at 274 nm in both the CHAPSO- and SDS-fractionated preparations was attributed to the presence of a solvent-soluble chromophore. N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) inactivated the enzyme and bleached the chromophore both in the enzyme preparation and, after its purification, in 95% ethanol. NBS-inactivated enzyme could be reconstituted with purified chromophore, which alone seemed to have no nitric oxide reductase activity, but not with purified chromophore that had been reacted with NBS. Spectral changes interpretable as due to changes in redox state were not observed when enzyme was exposed to NO or certain reducing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1507448443,"Abstract The mammalian 85-90-kDa heat shock protein(s) (hsp) have been shown to exist as two species of 84 and 86 kDa (Ullrich, S. J., Robinson, E. A., Law, L. W., Willingham, M., and Appella, E. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 3121-3125). Two cDNA clones corresponding to the two forms have been isolated which specifically hybridize to either a 2.85- or a 3.0-kilobase pair transcript corresponding to hsp 84 and 86, respectively (Moore, S. K., Kozak, C., Robinson, E. A., Ullrich, S. J., and Appella, E. (1987) Gene (Amst.) 56, 29-40, and this paper). The regulation of these hsp were examined in nontransformed NIH-3T3 and chemically transformed Meth A cells. The basal level of the hsp 84 mRNA transcript was approximately 2.5-fold greater than the hsp 86 transcript, with a corresponding ratio of hsp 84 to hsp 86 protein synthesis of approximately 2.5:1. After a transient heat shock (10 min, 44 degrees C), the rate of transcription of hsp 84 and 86 increased approximately 4.5- and approximately 7-fold, respectively, within 0.5 h and remained elevated for approximately 2 h. Northern blot analysis performed on NIH-3T3 and Meth A cells, during recovery from a transient heat shock, indicated that in both cells mRNA levels of both hsp increased rapidly, peaking at 5 h post-heat shock; hsp 84 and 86 transcripts were 1.5- and 2-fold higher than in non-heat-shocked cells, respectively. The increased rate of hsp synthesis after heat shock correlated with the increased levels of each transcript in both cell lines. In the transformed Meth A cells the basal mRNA, hsp synthesis, and steady state levels of each hsp in vitro were 2-3-fold higher than in the nontransformed NIH-3T3 cells. In Meth A tumors in vivo, the steady state level of hsp 84 was reduced compared to in vitro levels. Thus, in normal and in transformed murine cells, both hsp are heat-inducible, transcriptionally and translationally, with the transformed cells expressing higher levels of synthesis of both hsp 84 and 86. The data suggest that hsp 84 and 86 syntheses are primarily transcriptionally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1526543038,"Previous studies have established that mature neutrophils from the peritoneal cavity, blood, and bone marrow of beige (Chediak-Higashi syndrome) mice essentially lack activities of two lysosomal proteinases: elastase and cathepsin G. There are, however, significant levels of each enzyme in early neutrophil precursors in bone marrow. In the present experiments, it was found that the addition of extracts from mature beige neutrophils to extracts of normal neutrophils or to purified human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G resulted in a significant inhibition of elastase and cathepsin G G activities. 125I-Labeled human neutrophil elastase formed high molecular mass complexes at 64 and 52 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when added to beige neutrophil extracts. The molecular masses of the inhibitor-125I-elastase complexes suggested that the molecular masses of the inhibitors are approximately 36 and 24 kDa, respectively. These results were confirmed by gel filtration on Superose 12 under nondenaturing conditions. Cathepsin G was inhibited only by the 36-kDa component. The inhibitors formed a covalent complex with the active sites of elastase and cathepsin G. No inhibitory activity was present in mature neutrophil extracts of genetically normal mice or in extracts of bone marrow of beige mice. These results thus represent an unusual example of an enzyme deficiency state caused by the presence of excess inhibitors. Inactivation of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in mature circulating and tissue neutrophils may contribute to the increased susceptibility of Chediak-Higashi patients to infection."

Analysis of linker-scanning mutants of lactate dehydrogenase A subunit promoter fragments by DNA binding assay identified DNA binding activity selective for the 11-nucleotide sequence 5' TCTGACGTCAG 3' located between positions -51 and -41 relative to the transcription initiation site. This sequence contains the previously identified CRE 5' TGACGTCA 3'. Probing of protein blots with radioactive promoter fragments containing the CRE demonstrated that ovarian nuclear extracts contain a protein of relative molecular mass 47,000 (Mr 47,000) which exhibits selective binding affinity for the CRE. The 47-kDa CRE binding protein was found to be present in comparable levels in the ovaries of normal and hypophysectomized rats. Furthermore, our data suggest the presence of a 37,000-dalton (Mr 37,000) protein which possesses selective binding affinity for part of the CRE sequence. The binding activity/level of the 37-kDa CRE binding protein appeared to be modulated by short-term hypophysectomy/follicle-stimulating hormone administration. These results provide evidence for the presence of CRE binding factors in rat ovarian nuclei, which may be involved in the molecular events responsible for transcriptional regulation of ovarian cAMP-inducible genes."
https://openalex.org/W1962795647,"Abstract We previously reported (Lambeth, J. D., Xu, X. X., and Glover, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9181-9188) that exogenously added cholesterol sulfate inhibits the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in isolated adrenal mitochondria, and does so by affecting intramitochondrial cholesterol movement but not its subsequent metabolism to pregnenolone by cytochrome P-450scc. We now report that a major kinetic component of the inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to cholesterol, consistent with an allosteric effect at a site other than the substrate binding site of cytochrome P-450scc. We now also report that cholesterol sulfate is present as an endogenous compound in preparations of adrenal mitochondria. Its content varied from 0.05 to 0.8 nmol/mg protein. Cholesterol sulfate level correlated inversely with the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity. Endogenous cholesterol sulfate thus appeared to account for the variable rates of pregnenolone synthesis which were seen in different mitochondrial preparations. Cholesterol sulfate was metabolized to pregnenolone sulfate by a mitochondrial side-chain cleavage system, but proved to be a relatively poor substrate for an extramitochondrial steroid sulfatase activity present in adrenal cortex. Confirming a role as a naturally occurring inhibitor, removal of endogenous mitochondrial cholesterol sulfate by metabolism to pregnenolone sulfate correlated with a 3-fold activation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage. We suggest that cholesterol sulfate functions in steroidogenic tissues to regulate the magnitude of the steroidogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1808128713,"Abstract The rat cytochrome P-450IIB gene family consists of at least 10 members, 2 of which, P-450b and P-450e, have been well characterized and are activated transcriptionally by phenobarbital (PB) in the liver. The remaining genes in this family have not been studied extensively. In this report, data are presented that provide additional characterization of a P-450IIB gene, termed gene IV. The complete gene IV and flanking regions were isolated from a rat liver Charon 4A genomic library and subjected to a variety of analyses. Structural homology to the P-450b gene was confirmed by comparative restriction mapping and high stringency hybridization of gene IV fragments to probes comprising the entire cDNA for P-450b. The 5'-portion of gene IV, including its flanking region, was sequenced and contained an open reading frame for 58 amino acids which were 62% related to exon 1 of the P-450b/e genes. Typical TATA and CAAT promoter elements, as well as two Sp1 core sequences and a site related to a glucocorticoid responsive element were found in gene IV. Northern blot studies with an oligomer probe specific to gene IV sequence indicated a 4.3-kilobase pair polyadenylated transcript present at low levels in untreated rat liver and inducible approximately 6-fold by PB treatment. Primer extension experiments indicated that the transcription initiation site mapped to a position on gene IV that was analogous to that reported for the structurally similar P-450e gene. Due to the low levels of hepatic RNA expression, we employed the polymerase chain reaction to facilitate characterization of gene IV transcripts. The polymerase chain reaction data verified that gene IV transcripts were elevated after PB treatment. Significantly, the polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated that gene IV transcripts were associated with hepatic polysome fractions, indicating their active utilization in this tissue. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA also indicated constitutive expression of gene IV transcripts in rat lung, kidney, and testis, as well as fetal rat liver. Together, these data show that gene IV is a transcribed member of the P-450IIB gene family and, like the well characterized P-450b and P-450e genes, is positively regulated by PB in rat liver."

Evidence of bis-ligand coordination is obtained from the x-ray absorption, optical, and resonance Raman spectral characterization of F430 and its 12,13-diepimeric isomer in the presence of a large excess of cyanide, pyridine, or 1-methylimidazole. Significant broadening and 5-10-nm red shifts of the main 430-nm optical absorption band and shifts of up to 30 cm-1 for the high-frequency Raman lines are observed upon coordination of these axial ligands. The Raman spectra of native F430 and the diepimer with a particular axial ligand are nearly identical. Nickel x-ray absorption edge spectra of the diepimer in the absence and presence of these exogenous ligands are indicative of conversion from a square-planar to a tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry. Analyses of the nickel extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for the ligated diepimer complexes yield detailed structural information for these complexes. Implications of these data with respect to the enzymatic mechanism and the structure of the enzyme-bound factor are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1506157981,"Abstract Administration of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to rats in vivo resulted in the induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity in the liver which could be blocked by preinjection of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. In vitro administration of PMA to primary cultures of rat parenchymal cells did not lead to an induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity. It was investigated to what extent non-parenchymal liver cells could play an intermediary role in the expression of the PMA effect on ornithine decarboxylase activity in parenchymal liver cells. Addition of conditioned medium from PMA-activated Kupffer cells to cultured parenchymal cells led to the induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity in parenchymal cells. This effect was not observed with conditioned medium from untreated Kupffer cells or from Kupffer cells treated with PMA plus indomethacin. Conditioned media from PMA-treated or untreated endothelial liver cells were ineffective in the induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity in parenchymal liver cells. Prostaglandin D2, the main eicosanoid produced by Kupffer cells, was able to stimulate the synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase in parenchymal liver cells (up to 40-fold) in a dose-dependent way. Prostaglandin (PG) D2 appeared to be a more potent inducer of ornithine decarboxylase activity in parenchymal cells than PGE1 and PGE2. It is concluded that intercellular communication inside the liver mediated by prostaglandins derived from activated Kupffer cells may form a mechanism to induce synthesis of specific proteins in parenchymal cells."

In the presence of an aromatase inhibitor (4-hydroxyandrostenedione), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were accumulated. Aromatization of testosterone and androstenedione occurred via stereospecific loss of the 1 beta, 2 beta hydrogen atoms and was inhibited by MgCl2, KCl, and EDTA. The Km of estrogen synthetase from equine corpus luteum for testosterone was 18.5 +/- 2.7 nM and for androstenedione was 11.5 +/- 1.5 nM. 19-Norandrogens were aromatized with a slightly higher efficiency than were androgens, but the affinity of the aromatase was lower for 19-norandrogens than for androgens. Our results suggest that aromatases from equine testis and corpus luteum are closely related enzymes. On the other hand, the question arises as to the relationship among the cell origin, the synthetizing abilities, and in vivo production of the corpus luteum in different mammalian species."

The capacity for covalent attachment of actinomycin D will aid greatly in the study of target-site specificities and the correlations of biological effects with biophysical DNA interactions. Through chemical modification of the parent actinomycin D molecule with a photoreactive azido substituent, a functional analog of the parent actinomycin D is generated having equilibrium binding properties identical to those of the parent molecule yet with the capacity to form a covalent attachment to DNA upon photolysis. The results presented here describe the noncovalent interactions of this photoreactive probe to DNA (absence of light) and compares the binding properties observed to those of the parent actinomycin D and 7-aminoactinomycin D analog. These studies demonstrate that the DNA binding properties (i.e. binding affinity, binding site size, and sequence specificity) retained by the 7-azidoactinomycin D, thus providing a suitable probe for examining actinomycin D-DNA interactions."

The sequence shows this protein to consist of 149 amino acids with an N-acetylated N terminus. The protein has a molecular weight of 16,894 and is homologous to calmodulin, which is also present in squid optic lobe (Head, J. F., Spielberg, S., and Kaminer, B. (1983) Biochem. J. 209, 797-802). When the sequences of squid CaBP and bovine brain calmodulin are appropriately aligned, the proteins are found to share 68% identity, with a single residue insertion in squid CaBP, between domains III and IV. The four-domain structure of calmodulin appears to be retained in squid CaBP, which is consistent with the previously reported presence of four calcium-binding sites per molecule (Sheldon, A., and Head, J. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14384-14389). The two tyrosines of squid CaBP are located in different halves of the molecule, one at the position corresponding to Tyr-138 in calmodulin, the other in an equivalent position in domain II. In addition, squid CaBP exhibits several differences in the region corresponding to the long central helix of calmodulin. These differences include the replacement of Lys-77 by glycine, Asp-78 by proline, and Ser-81 by proline. The sequence of this portion of the squid CaBP molecule suggests the protein is unlikely to possess the continuous long central helix found in calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1592637465,"Abstract Incubating ribosomes and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 with an inosine-substituted mRNA (where the mRNA secondary structure is strongly reduced) in the absence of ATP and other protein synthesis factors produces a 40 S ribosome.mRNA complex. When Met-tRNAMeti and eIF2 are added, a 60 S ribosome subunit attaches forming an 80 S ribosome.mRNA complex. ATP and the three mRNA factors, eIF4B, cap-site factor, and eIF4A, strongly stimulate the attachment of the 60 S subunit. In the absence of Met-tRNAMeti, the 60-S subunit does not attach, and adding ATP and the mRNA factors inhibits the accumulation of 40 S ribosome.inosine mRNA complexes. These results indicate that a 40 S ribosome, probably in a complex with eIF3, has an intrinsic capacity to attach to mRNA. Further, they suggest that Met-tRNAMeti may interact in a subsequent step to stabilize the 40 S ribosome.mRNA complex and allow the attachment of a 60 S ribosome subunit. Although seen most clearly with the inosine-substituted mRNAs, the 40 S ribosome reaction is also obtained with mRNA. A 40 S ribosome attaches to guanosine mRNA without ATP and mRNA factors when an incubation mixture containing ribosomes, eIF3, and mRNA is fixed with glutaraldehyde. In addition, a 40 S ribosome.guanosine mRNA complex can be obtained without glutaraldehyde in incubations containing ATP and the three mRNA factors in the absence of Met-tRNAMeti. The latter reaction is limited because of the instability of the 40 S ribosome.mRNA complex in the absence of Met-tRNA. Nevertheless, its authenticity is indicated by its full dependence upon ATP and the three mRNA factors. The lack of factor requirement for the formation of 40 S ribosome complexes with inosine-substituted mRNAs indicates that ATP and the three mRNA factors function primarily to unwind the secondary structure of a guanosine mRNA. Data relevant to a role for ATP in facilitating ribosome migration on an mRNA are also discussed."

However, electrophoresis showed that a substantial proportion of the enzyme had not been digested. The component of the preparation of ornithine aminotransferase that was insusceptible to trypsin contained a naturally occurring but enzymically inactive form of the enzyme, and when this had been removed, the remaining fully active enzyme was completely digested. Irreversible inactivation with a substrate analogue made all of the enzyme insusceptible to trypsin. The hydrolyzed enzyme still underwent a very slow half-reaction with ornithine. Sequence analysis of the truncated protein, prepared by blotting from electrophoretic gels, showed that hydrolysis had occurred at peptide bond Lys26-Tyr27."
