https://openalex.org/W2080452140,"Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site, resulting in loss of the enzyme’s ability to catalyse conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumours, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyse the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when arginine 132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumours in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harbouring IDH1 mutations, we find markedly elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and indicate that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas. A high percentage of human glioblastomas has been found to harbour mutations in the metabolic enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). The predominant R132H mutation is now shown to act as a gain-of-function mutation, enabling IDH1 to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Human glioblastoma samples with IDH1 mutations indeed contain elevated levels of 2-HG. Future work will be directed at understanding the mechanisms by which 2-HG can contribute to tumorigenesis. Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are commonly found in glioblastomas, a major subset of primary human brain cancers. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated, suggesting that the mutation does not result in a simple loss of function. Here, IDH1 mutations are shown to act in a gain-of-function manner, resulting in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyse α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate, an onco-metabolite."

https://openalex.org/W1975937841,"Declining serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D seen in the fall and winter as distance increases from the equator may be a factor in the seasonal increased prevalence of influenza and other viral infections. This study was done to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations correlated with the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections.In this prospective cohort study serial monthly concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured over the fall and winter 2009-2010 in 198 healthy adults, blinded to the nature of the substance being measured. The participants were evaluated for the development of any acute respiratory tract infections by investigators blinded to the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The incidence of infection in participants with different concentrations of vitamin D was determined. One hundred ninety-five (98.5%) of the enrolled participants completed the study. Light skin pigmentation, lean body mass, and supplementation with vitamin D were found to correlate with higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Concentrations of 38 ng/ml or more were associated with a significant (p<0.0001) two-fold reduction in the risk of developing acute respiratory tract infections and with a marked reduction in the percentages of days ill.Maintenance of a 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration of 38 ng/ml or higher should significantly reduce the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections and the burden of illness caused thereby, at least during the fall and winter in temperate zones. The findings of the present study provide direction for and call for future interventional studies examining the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence and severity of specific viral infections, including influenza, in the general population and in subpopulations with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, such as pregnant women, dark skinned individuals, and the obese."

https://openalex.org/W2137274211,"Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, regimens used to treat many such conditions cannot maintain disease control in the majority of SLE patients and more aggressive approaches such as high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy are used to provide transient reductions in disease activity. The primary anti-inflammatory mechanism of glucocorticoids is thought to be NF-kappaB inhibition. Recognition of self nucleic acids by toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9 on B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) is an important step in the pathogenesis of SLE, promoting anti-nuclear antibodies and the production of type I interferon (IFN), both correlated with the severity of disease. Following their activation by self-nucleic acid-associated immune complexes, PDCs migrate to the tissues. We demonstrate, in vitro and in vivo, that stimulation of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 can account for the reduced activity of glucocorticoids to inhibit the IFN pathway in SLE patients and in two lupus-prone mouse strains. The triggering of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 by nucleic acid-containing immune complexes or by synthetic ligands activates the NF-kappaB pathway essential for PDC survival. Glucocorticoids do not affect NF-kappaB activation in PDCs, preventing glucocorticoid induction of PDC death and the consequent reduction of systemic IFN-alpha levels. These findings unveil a new role for self nucleic acid recognition by TLRs and indicate that inhibitors of TLR7 and 9 signalling could prove to be effective corticosteroid-sparing drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2001716460,"In order to build a proper and stable representation of the auditory world, neonatal rodents exhibit a significant degree of circuit plasticity, allowing for sensitivity to the pattern of sensory inputs. During this time, neurons construct a receptive field, one that relies upon a particular balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, yet it is unknown as to how this balance is formed. Two studies published in this issue of Nature reveal contrasting views as to how the mature system develops. Excitation and inhibition were found to be equally strong upon hearing onset in each study. But whereas Dorrn et al. find evidence for an experience-dependent refinement of inhibition as the receptive fields develop, Sun et al. observed a fine adjustment in the excitatory input strength to produce a shifted balance. Nevertheless, taken together, both studies point towards a fine adjustment of synaptic inputs as the force behind the production of mature receptive fields, as opposed to more radical changes such as input pruning. To build a representation of the auditory world, neuronal circuits in neonatal rodents exhibit plasticity, allowing sensitivity to the pattern of sensory inputs. At this time, neurons construct a receptive field, which relies on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Here, excitation and inhibition were found to be co-tuned upon hearing onset, but an experience-dependent refinement of inhibition later occurred. Thus a fine adjustment in synaptic inputs, rather than more radical changes such as input pruning, may refine mature receptive fields. Early in life, neural circuits are highly susceptible to outside influences. The organization of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in particular is governed by acoustic experience during the critical period, an epoch near the beginning of postnatal development throughout which cortical synapses and networks are especially plastic1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This neonatal sensitivity to the pattern of sensory inputs is believed to be essential for constructing stable and adequately adapted representations of the auditory world and for the acquisition of language skills by children5,9,10. One important principle of synaptic organization in mature brains is the balance between excitation and inhibition, which controls receptive field structure and spatiotemporal flow of neural activity11,12,13,14,15, but it is unknown how and when this excitatory–inhibitory balance is initially established and calibrated. Here we use whole-cell recording to determine the processes underlying the development of synaptic receptive fields in rat A1. We find that, immediately after the onset of hearing, sensory-evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses are equally strong, although inhibition is less stimulus-selective and mismatched with excitation. However, during the third week of postnatal development, excitation and inhibition become highly correlated. Patterned sensory stimulation drives coordinated synaptic changes across receptive fields, rapidly improves excitatory–inhibitory coupling and prevents further exposure-induced modifications. Thus, the pace of cortical synaptic receptive field development is set by progressive, experience-dependent refinement of intracortical inhibition."

In yeast pathogens, these vesicles have been implicated in the transport of proteins, lipids, polysaccharide and pigments to the extracellular space. Cellular pathways required for the biogenesis of yeast extracellular vesicles are largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized extracellular vesicle production in wild type (WT) and mutant strains of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transmission electron microscopy in combination with light scattering analysis, lipid extraction and proteomics. WT cells and mutants with defective expression of Sec4p, a secretory vesicle-associated Rab GTPase essential for Golgi-derived exocytosis, or Snf7p, which is involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation, were analyzed in parallel. Bilayered vesicles with diameters at the 100–300 nm range were found in extracellular fractions from yeast cultures. Proteomic analysis of vesicular fractions from the cells aforementioned and additional mutants with defects in conventional secretion pathways (sec1-1, fusion of Golgi-derived exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane; bos1-1, vesicle targeting to the Golgi complex) or MVB functionality (vps23, late endosomal trafficking) revealed a complex and interrelated protein collection. Semi-quantitative analysis of protein abundance revealed that mutations in both MVB- and Golgi-derived pathways affected the composition of yeast extracellular vesicles, but none abrogated vesicle production. Lipid analysis revealed that mutants with defects in Golgi-related components of the secretory pathway had slower vesicle release kinetics, as inferred from intracellular accumulation of sterols and reduced detection of these lipids in vesicle fractions in comparison with WT cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that both conventional and unconventional pathways of secretion are required for biogenesis of extracellular vesicles, which demonstrate the complexity of this process in the biology of yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076558529,"Archaeal and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 contain a unique post-translationally modified histidine residue called diphthamide, which is the target of diphtheria toxin. The biosynthesis of diphthamide was proposed to involve three steps, with the first being the formation of a C–C bond between the histidine residue and the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). However, further details of the biosynthesis remain unknown. Here we present structural and biochemical evidence showing that the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis in the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii uses a novel iron–sulphur-cluster enzyme, Dph2. Dph2 is a homodimer and each of its monomers can bind a [4Fe–4S] cluster. Biochemical data suggest that unlike the enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily, Dph2 does not form the canonical 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Instead, it breaks the Cγ,Met–S bond of SAM and generates a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical. Our results suggest that P. horikoshii Dph2 represents a previously unknown, SAM-dependent, [4Fe–4S]-containing enzyme that catalyses unprecedented chemistry. Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin, is a post-translationally modified histidine residue in archaeal and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). It has been studied for more than three decades, but some aspects of its mechanism of biosynthesis remain elusive. The process is thought to involve three steps, the first being the formation of a C–C bond between the histidine residue and the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). A study of the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii now shows that in this organism at least, the first step in diphthamide biosynthesis requires an unusual iron–sulphur cluster enzyme, Dph2. Biochemical data suggest that — in contrast to the mechanism in other radical SAM enzymes — Dph2 breaks the CγMet–S bond of the SAM cofactor. The enzyme then transfers the 3-amino-3-carboxylpropyl group to EF2, possibly via a radical mechanism. Translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) from archaea and eukaryotes contains a unique, post-translationally modified histidine residue called diphthamide, which is the target of diphtheria toxin. The biosynthesis of diphthamide involves three steps; here it is shown that the first step in the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii requires an unusual iron–sulphur-cluster enzyme, Dph2. It catalyses unprecedented chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1967721763,"Functional receptive fields of neurons in sensory cortices undergo progressive refinement during development. Such refinement may be attributed to the pruning of non-optimal excitatory inputs, reshaping of the excitatory tuning profile through modifying the strengths of individual inputs, or strengthening of cortical inhibition. These models have not been directly tested because of the technical difficulties in assaying the spatiotemporal patterns of functional synaptic inputs during development. Here we apply in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to the recipient layer 4 neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) to determine the developmental changes in the frequency-intensity tonal receptive fields (TRFs) of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Surprisingly, we observe co-tuned excitation and inhibition immediately after the onset of hearing, suggesting that a tripartite thalamocortical circuit with relatively strong feedforward inhibition is formed independently of auditory experience. The frequency ranges of tone-driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs first expand within a few days of the onset of hearing and then persist into adulthood. The latter phase is accompanied by a sharpening of the excitatory but not inhibitory frequency tuning profile, which results in relatively broader inhibitory tuning in adult A1 neurons. Thus the development of cortical synaptic TRFs after the onset of hearing is marked by a slight breakdown of previously formed excitation-inhibition balance. Our results suggest that functional refinement of cortical TRFs does not require a selective pruning of inputs, but may depend more on a fine adjustment of excitatory input strengths."
https://openalex.org/W2090005130,"Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in both physiological cell signaling processes and numerous pathological states, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease. While mitochondria are considered the major cellular source of ROS, their role in ROS removal remains largely unknown. Using polarographic methods for real-time detection of steady-state H2O2 levels, we were able to quantitatively measure the contributions of potential systems toward H2O2 removal by brain mitochondria. Isolated rat brain mitochondria showed significant rates of exogenous H2O2 removal (9–12 nmol/min/mg of protein) in the presence of substrates, indicating a respiration-dependent process. Glutathione systems showed only minimal contributions: 25% decrease with glutathione reductase inhibition and no effect by glutathione peroxidase inhibition. In contrast, inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase, including auranofin and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, attenuated H2O2 removal rates in mitochondria by 80%. Furthermore, a 50% decrease in H2O2 removal was observed following oxidation of peroxiredoxin. Differential oxidation of glutathione or thioredoxin proteins by copper (II) or arsenite, respectively, provided further support for the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system as the major contributor to mitochondrial H2O2 removal. Inhibition of the thioredoxin system exacerbated mitochondrial H2O2 production by the redox cycling agent, paraquat. Additionally, decreases in H2O2 removal were observed in intact dopaminergic neurons with thioredoxin reductase inhibition, implicating this mechanism in whole cell systems. Therefore, in addition to their recognized role in ROS production, mitochondria also remove ROS.

The vast majority of studies related to ROS metabolism have focused on mitochondria as a source of ROS. Detoxification of mitochondrial ROS has largely focused on manganese superoxide dismutase, a critically important antioxidant enzyme that scavenges O2̇̄. Mitochondria also possess a multilevel network of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems for the detoxification of H2O2. However, the one or more mechanisms and enzymatic systems involved in mitochondrial H2O2 detoxification are poorly understood. Rare attempts to address this issue have produced intriguing results that demonstrate the removal of exogenous ROS by actively respiring mitochondria (10Guidot D.M. Repine J.E. Kitlowski A.D.

The expression and contributions of enzymatic systems for H2O2 detoxification vary widely between tissues. Catalase, for example, is highly expressed in mitochondria from liver and heart (12Radi R.

Meanwhile, catalase in the brain is confined to peroxisomes, and there is little, if any, expression in mitochondria (14Sinet P.M. Heikkila R.E. Cohen G. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The major enzymes believed to be responsible for H2O2 detoxification in the brain are peroxidase systems: GSH/glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Trx2/peroxiredoxin 3 and 5 (Prx3 and Prx5). Zoccarato et al. (11Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that brain mitochondria removed exogenously added H2O2 in a respiration-dependent manner, implicating GPx as the major enzymatic pathway in the process. However, a quantitative analysis to determine the involvement of potential enzymatic pathways and particularly the role of the Trx/Prx system in mitochondrial H2O2 detoxification remains to be examined. Identifying the enzymatic pathways by which mitochondrial H2O2 detoxification occurs is critical given the important physiological and pathological roles of H2O2. In this study, we used a novel, polarographic method to quantitatively measure the ability of mitochondria to remove exogenously added H2O2. Because H2O2 is freely permeable to cell membranes, this method of addition was hypothesized to reflect mitochondrial metabolism of H2O2 arising from various cellular sources, both intra- and extramitochondrial. Here, we demonstrate that rat brain mitochondria remove H2O2 in a unique respiration-dependent manner primarily via the Trx/Prx system. Auranofin (S-triethylphosphinegold (I)-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-thio-β-d-glucopyranoside) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals unless otherwise noted were obtained from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). N27 cells were obtained from Drs. Kedar Prasad and Wenbo Zhou at the University of Colorado Denver. Brain mitochondria were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old) using Percoll density gradient centrifugation (15Sims N.R. Anderson M.F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1228-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with slight modification (16Castello P.R. Drechsel D.A. Patel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14186-14193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For liver-derived mitochondria, crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared (13Salvi M. Battaglia V. Brunati A.M. La Rocca N. Tibaldi E. Pietrangeli P. Marcocci L. Mondovì B. Rossi C.A. Toninello A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24407-24415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), then applied to Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described for brain mitochondria for further purification. Purity and viability of mitochondrial fractions were assessed via Western blot analysis and oxygen consumption rates, respectively (17Castello P.R. Drechsel D.A. Day B.J. Patel M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 324: 970-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Coupled mitochondria with respiratory control ratios greater than 5 were used in all experiments. For assays of enzymatic activity, isolated mitochondria were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain supernatant. At least three independent mitochondrial preparations were used in all experiments. The T-antigen-immortalized N27 cell line described previously (18Prasad K.N. Carvalho E. Kentroti S. Edwards-Prasad J. Freed C. Vernadakis A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30A: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Mitochondrial H2O2 removal was measured using an Apollo 4000 Free Radical Analyzer equipped with a 100-μm Clark-type H2O2 electrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated in an open, thermostatted chamber at 30 °C in incubation buffer (100 mm KCl, 75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 50 μm EDTA, and 600 μm MgCl2, pH 7.4). After obtaining a stable signal baseline, 2–3 μm (except where indicated) H2O2 was added exogenously, followed by the reagent or inhibitor under study (titrated to achieve maximal response), isolated mitochondria, and lastly respiration substrates (2.5 mm malate plus 10 mm glutamate, or 10 mm succinate) at 1-min intervals (see Fig. 1). This 1-min interval was necessary to allow the polarographic signal to stabilize between additions and achieve accurate measurements. H2O2 removal rates were calculated based on the linear signal decay for 1–2 min following the addition of substrates. Values were converted to nanomoles of H2O2/min/mg of protein using a predetermined H2O2 standard curve. The addition of some reagents/inhibitors to the incubation buffer caused spiking or baseline shifts in signal current that were typically attributed to minute differences in pH or temperature. Such changes were taken into consideration when calculating removal rates. The addition of exogenous catalase (40 units/ml) caused a rapid and complete decrease in signal to initial baseline levels, whereas superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml) had no effect (data not shown). This demonstrated that the electrode was specific for H2O2 and not other species, namely O2̇̄. To decrease oxygen (O2) tension in the system for select experiments, nitrogen (N2) gas was bubbled through a side-port into the open, thermostatted incubation chamber. O2 levels were measured using a 2-mm Clark-type O2 electrode (WPI, Inc.). Using this method, experiments involving low O2 tension were conducted in ∼2% O2. During these experiments, O2 and H2O2 levels were measured simultaneously to ensure that decreased O2 levels were maintained throughout. N27 cells were collected via trypsin and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) containing 1000 mg/liter d-glucose and 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate. Following stabilization of H2O2 electrode in D-PBS, 1 × 106 N27 cells were added, followed by vehicle (DMSO) or any inhibitor under study. 3 μm exogenous H2O2 was added last, and removal rates were measured as described above. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity was measured using an insulin-reduction assay in the presence of Escherichia coli recombinant thioredoxin (19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Reduced thiols were measured using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) at an absorbance of 412 nm on a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The coupled activities of glutathione reductase (GR)/GPx or TrxR/Prx were assessed by following the decrease of NADPH absorbance at 340 nm (20Wendel A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 21Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The reaction was supplemented with glutathione (GSH, 2 mm) or E. coli recombinant Trx (5 μm), respectively, and initiated by the addition of H2O2 (500 μm). Mitochondrial ROS production was assessed using a fluorometric method. Extramitochondrial release of H2O2 from isolated mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) incubated with PQ and/or auranofin was measured using horseradish peroxidase-linked Amplex Red fluorescence (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (22Drechsel D.A. Patel M. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 456: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). A polarographic method that quantitatively measures steady-state H2O2 levels in real-time was utilized to determine whether exogenous H2O2 removal occurs in isolated brain mitochondria under various respiration states and conditions. The results are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows a representative polarographic trace obtained during the measurement of exogenous H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria in the presence of vehicle (thick line) or inhibitor (thin line). Under resting conditions with no added substrates (state 1), brain mitochondria consumed H2O2 at a slow rate, which increased 10-fold with the addition of respiration substrates (malate plus glutamate; state 2 conditions). Heat inactivation (90 °C for 2 min) completely abolished H2O2 removal by respiring mitochondria, whereas the state 1 rate was unaffected. This indicates that a small proportion of H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria occurs via non-enzymatic scavenging. Highest rates of removal occurred upon addition of malate/glutamate, which feeds electrons to Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain. The presence of ADP (state 3 conditions) caused a slight increase in malate/glutamate-dependent removal rates. H2O2 removal under succinate-supported respiration was slightly decreased compared with malate/glutamate. Succinate, which feeds electrons to the respiratory chain via Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), also produces H2O2 via reverse electron transport through Complex I (23Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Using rotenone as a Complex I inhibitor to block this effect caused an increase in H2O2 removal rate (9.7 ± 0.5 versus 8.3 ± 0.7; p < 0.05). These data suggest that intrinsic succinate-supported H2O2 production may compete with exogenous H2O2 in these experiments and lead to lower observed rates of net H2O2 removal. Addition of an uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1 μm), significantly decreased malate/glutamate-stimulated removal rates by 20%. Further exploration into the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics revealed small, but insignificant decreases (∼5–15%) in H2O2 removal rates following inhibition of the respiratory chain or TCA cycle enzymes, such as aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase (data not shown). With some minor exceptions, these results agree with previous studies examining the active, enzymatic removal of H2O2 in respiring mitochondria using a fluorometric method (11Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).TABLE 1H2O2 removal by brain mitochondria under varying respiration states and conditionsSubstrate/conditions (respiration state)H2O2 removalnmol/min/mg proteinNone (state 1)1.0 ± 0.2Low O2, none1.2 ± 0.4Heat-inactivated mitochondria, none0.8 ± 0.04Malate/glutamate (state 2)11.1 ± 0.2Low O2, malate/glutamate7.0 ± 1.3Heat-inactivated mitochondria + malate/glutamate1.7 ± 0.2Malate/glutamate + ADP (state 3)11.8 ± 0.2Malate/glutamate + FCCP (uncoupled)9.0 ± 0.7Succinate8.3 ± 0.7Succinate + rotenone9.7 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab To determine if similar responses occurred at biologically relevant O2 concentrations encountered by mitochondria, N2 gas was utilized to decrease O2 tension to ∼2% in the system for subsequent experiments. Under these low O2 conditions, state 1 H2O2 removal rates were unchanged. Malate/glutamate stimulation caused a significant increase in rates (7.0 ± 1.3 versus 1.2 ± 0.4; p < 0.05), indicating that respiration-dependent H2O2 removal occurs in brain mitochondria under these more physiological O2 conditions. However, state 2 rates were decreased by 37% compared with brain mitochondria under atmospheric (∼21%) O2 conditions (Table 1). The generation of mitochondrial H2O2 is thought to primarily occur through a combination of spontaneous and superoxide dismutase-catalyzed dismutation of O2̇̄ produced in the matrix, intermembrane space, and outer membrane (24Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5153) Google Scholar). As a result, mitochondria possess multiple enzymatic systems for the detoxification of H2O2 that vary widely between different tissues. Because brain mitochondria are not believed to express catalase, GSH- and/or Trx-based peroxidases are anticipated to act as the major H2O2 detoxification system(s). Each of these enzymatic systems is dependent upon the action of a peroxidase (GPx or Prx) to directly react with H2O2, together with substrate (GSH or Trx), and a reductase (GR or TrxR) that uses NADPH to maintain these proteins in a reduced state. Pharmacological inhibition was used to assess the contributions of these mitochondrial systems toward H2O2 removal in the brain. As expected, inhibition of catalase via aminotriazole had no effect on mitochondrial H2O2 removal (Fig. 2). GPx inhibition or GSH oxidation via malathion or diamide, respectively, showed minimal changes in removal rates. Inhibition of GR by carmustine decreased H2O2 consumption by 25%, whereas concomitant inhibition of GR and GPx had no further effect. In contrast, inhibition of the Trx/Prx system potently and dramatically attenuated brain mitochondrial H2O2 removal. Specifically, inhibition of TrxR with auranofin proved the most effective by attenuating H2O2 removal by 80%. Additionally, rapid oxidation of Prx3 by phenethyl isothiocyanate (25Brown K.K. Eriksson S.E. Arnér E.S. Hampton M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) caused a 50% decrease in removal rate. These results suggest that the Trx/Prx system is the major contributor to net H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria, whereas GSH/GPx plays a lesser role. Because the greatest attenuation of brain mitochondrial H2O2 removal occurred with inhibition of TrxR by auranofin, rather than the GSH/GPx pathway previously identified for this process (11Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we explored its specificity for these two peroxidase systems. Auranofin-dependent inhibition was tested using an enzymatic assay that measures the coupled reductase and peroxidase activities in response to H2O2. At 1 μm, a concentration with maximal effects on mitochondrial H2O2 removal, auranofin significantly inhibited TrxR/Prx activity with no effect on GR/GPx (Fig. 3A), indicating specificity for the former peroxidase system. We next wanted to confirm that changes in mitochondrial H2O2 removal correlated with TrxR inhibition. Plotting concentration-response curves of the ability of auranofin to attenuate H2O2 removal and inhibit TrxR activity revealed that the two processes closely correlated (Fig. 3B). 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), another specific inhibitor of TrxR with a unique mechanism of action to that of auranofin (26Tonissen K.F. Di Trapani G. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009; 53: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), also significantly decreased H2O2 removal. In a manner similar to auranofin, the effects of DNCB on H2O2 removal correlated with inhibition of TrxR activity (Fig. 3B), although DNCB showed greater maximal effects on H2O2 removal. With nearly complete inhibition of TrxR, DNCB caused over 90% inhibition of H2O2 removal, compared with 80% with auranofin. This difference likely arises from DNCB-dependent induction of O2̇̄ generative activity of TrxR at high concentrations (26Tonissen K.F. Di Trapani G. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009; 53: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as opposed to off-target effects on other H2O2 removal systems (i.e. GSH or non-enzymatic pathways). Collectively, these results demonstrate that observed decreases in brain mitochondrial H2O2 removal rates are the consequence of specific inhibition of the Trx/Prx system, namely TrxR. We can also conclude that TrxR-dependent pathways account for up to 80% of H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria. The absence of EDTA from the incubation buffer decreases H2O2 removal rate to non-enzymatic levels (data not shown), indicating that trace contamination by metals ions prevents the enzymatic scavenging of H2O2 by brain mitochondria. Therefore, changes in mitochondrial H2O2 removal rates were measured in the presence of various metal compounds. Neuronal mitochondria have shown the ability to accumulate, store, and release Ca2+ but are also susceptible to disruptions of Ca2+ handling in pathological conditions such as excitotoxicity, ischemic injury, and neurodegeneration. Excessive Ca2+ levels can also lead to perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore (27Nicholls D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As expected, Ca2+ inhibited mitochondrial H2O2 removal in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 42 μm. Because the effects of Ca2+ on mitochondrial function are widespread with significant changes in the activities of multiple enzymes, including peroxidases, arsenic and copper were used as alternative metals to determine the relative contribution of the Trx/Prx and GSH/GPx systems. As shown in Fig. 4A, sodium arsenite attenuated mitochondrial H2O2 removal by ∼25%. Arsenite also produced significant inhibition of TrxR/Prx activity (75%), whereas GR/GPx activity was unaffected. Copper also decreased rates of H2O2 removal (Fig. 4B). CuCl2 (50 μm) resulted in ∼75 and ∼50% decreases in GR/GPx and TrxR/Prx activities, respectively, and attenuated H2O2 removal rates by ∼25% compared with controls. Interestingly, increasing CuCl2 concentrations to 100 μm caused further decrease of H2O2 removal to only 15% of control rates. This decrease in H2O2 removal rates with increasing CuCl2 from 50 μm to 100 μm was associated with a further inhibition of TrxR/Prx activity to ∼25% compared with controls. However, GR/GPx activity showed no further decreases in response to 100 μm CuCl2. These results demonstrate that inhibition of H2O2 removal rates by metal ions occurs in association with decreased TrxR/Prx activity, providing further support for the thioredoxin system as the major contributor to mitochondrial H2O2 removal. Estimates for the physiological concentration of H2O2 in fluid and tissues vary from nanomolar to low micromolar levels (28Boveris A. Cadenas E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Halliwell B. Long L.H. Yee T.P. Lim S. Kelly R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, a kinetic analysis was utilized to determine if similar mechanisms contribute to brain mitochondrial H2O2 removal throughout this range. Using initial concentrations of exogenous H2O2 from 0.25 μm (which represents the lower limit of accurate detection for the polarographic methods employed here) to 3 μm, brain mitochondria supported with malate/glutamate showed concentration-dependent rates of H2O2 removal, as increased rates were observed with higher initial concentrations of exogenous H2O2 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, these rates were significantly decreased in the presence of auranofin by 50–90%. These results indicate that respiration- and Trx-dependent mechanisms of H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria occur over a range of physiologically relevant H2O2 concentrations. To determine if the observed characteristics of H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria were applicable to other organs, mitochondria were also prepared from rat liver and subjected to similar experimental conditions (Table 2). Interestingly, liver-derived mitochondria showed nearly 5-fold higher maximal rates of H2O2 removal compared with those from brain. Additionally, these rates occured independent of the presence of malate/glutamate, suggesting that liver mitochondria do not depend upon a respiration-driven process to detoxify H2O2. This was confirmed by pharmacological studies, which showed that inhibition of Trx/Prx or GR/GPx systems via auranofin or carmustine, respectively, did not affect H2O2 removal rates. Instead, a 50% decrease in rates was seen with aminotriazole, confirming the role of catalase in the oxidative stress defense of liver mitochondria (13Salvi M. Battaglia V. Brunati A.M. La Rocca N.

A novelty of the 2008 survey was the addition of serological testing to ascertain antiretroviral treatment (ART) use. Methods and Principal Findings We used a validated mathematical method to estimate the rate of new HIV infections (HIV incidence) in South Africa using nationally representative HIV prevalence data collected in 2002, 2005 and 2008. The observed HIV prevalence levels in 2008 were adjusted for the effect of antiretroviral treatment on survival. The estimated “excess” HIV prevalence due to ART in 2008 was highest among women 25 years and older and among men 30 years and older. In the period 2002–2005, the HIV incidence rate among men and women aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 2.0 new infections each year per 100 susceptible individuals (/100pyar) (uncertainty range: 1.2–3.0/100pyar). The highest incidence rate was among 15–24 year-old women, at 5.5/100pyar (4.5–6.5). In the period 2005–2008, incidence among men and women aged 15–49 was estimated to be 1.3/100 (0.6–2.5/100pyar), although the change from 2002–2005 was not statistically significant. However, the incidence rate among young women aged 15–24 declined by 60% in the same period, to 2.2/100pyar, and this change was statistically significant. There is evidence from the surveys of significant increases in condom use and awareness of HIV status, especially among youth. Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates how serial measures of HIV prevalence obtained in population-based surveys can be used to estimate national HIV incidence rates. We also show the need to determine the impact of ART on observed HIV prevalence levels. The estimation of HIV incidence and ART exposure is crucial to disentangle the concurrent impact of prevention and treatment programs on HIV prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2148161164,"The rational design of amyloid oligomer inhibitors is yet an unmet drug development need. Previous studies have identified the role of tryptophan in amyloid recognition, association and inhibition. Furthermore, tryptophan was ranked as the residue with highest amyloidogenic propensity. Other studies have demonstrated that quinones, specifically anthraquinones, can serve as aggregation inhibitors probably due to the dipole interaction of the quinonic ring with aromatic recognition sites within the amyloidogenic proteins. Here, using in vitro, in vivo and in silico tools we describe the synthesis and functional characterization of a rationally designed inhibitor of the Alzheimer's disease-associated β-amyloid. This compound, 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan (NQTrp), combines the recognition capacities of both quinone and tryptophan moieties and completely inhibited Aβ oligomerization and fibrillization, as well as the cytotoxic effect of Aβ oligomers towards cultured neuronal cell line. Furthermore, when fed to transgenic Alzheimer's disease Drosophila model it prolonged their life span and completely abolished their defective locomotion. Analysis of the brains of these flies showed a significant reduction in oligomeric species of Aβ while immuno-staining of the 3rd instar larval brains showed a significant reduction in Aβ accumulation. Computational studies, as well as NMR and CD spectroscopy provide mechanistic insight into the activity of the compound which is most likely mediated by clamping of the aromatic recognition interface in the central segment of Aβ. Our results demonstrate that interfering with the aromatic core of amyloidogenic peptides is a promising approach for inhibiting various pathogenic species associated with amyloidogenic diseases. The compound NQTrp can serve as a lead for developing a new class of disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease."

The concentrated conditioned medium of serum-starved HCT-8 cells was able to stimulate the migration and invasion of non-serum-starved cells, which could be prevented by treatment with an anti-HSP90alpha antibody. Recombinant HSP90alpha (rHSP90alpha) also enhanced HCT-8 cell migration and invasion, suggesting a stimulatory role of secreted HSP90alpha in cancer malignancy. HSP90alpha binding to CD91alpha and Neu was evidenced by the proximity ligation assay, and rHSP90alpha-induced HCT-8 cell invasion could be suppressed by the addition of anti-CD91alpha or anti-Neu antibodies. Via CD91alpha and Neu, rHSP90alpha selectively induced integrin alpha(V) expression, and knockdown of integrin alpha(V) efficiently blocked rHSP90alpha-induced HCT-8 cell invasion. rHSP90alpha induced the activities of ERK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kappaB p65, but only NF-kappaB activation was involved in HSP90alpha-induced integrin alpha(V) expression. Additionally, we investigated the serum levels of HSP90alpha and the expression status of tumor integrin alpha(V) mRNA in colorectal cancer patients. Serum HSP90alpha levels of colorectal cancer patients were significantly higher than those of normal volunteers (p < 0.001). Patients with higher serum HSP90alpha levels significantly exhibited elevated levels of integrin alpha(V) mRNA in tumor tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (p < 0.001).

We examined the mRNA expression of components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling pathway as well as Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) during maturation of myotubes in primary cell cultures isolated from fast myotomal muscle of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The transcriptional regulation of IGFs and IGFBP expression by amino acids and insulin-like growth factors was also investigated. Proliferation of cells was 15% d(-1) at days 2 and 3 of the culture, increasing to 66% d(-1) at day 6. Three clusters of elevated gene expression were observed during the maturation of the culture associated with mono-nucleic cells (IGFBP5.1 and 5.2, IGFBP-6, IGFBP-rP1, IGFBP-2.2 and IGF-II), the initial proliferation phase (IGF-I, IGFBP-4, FGF2 and IGF-IRb) and terminal differentiation and myotube production (IGF2R, IGF-IRa). In cells starved of amino acids and serum for 72 h, IGF-I mRNA decreased 10-fold which was reversed by amino acid replacement. Addition of IGF-I and amino acids to starved cells resulted in an 18-fold increase in IGF-I mRNA indicating synergistic effects and the activation of additional pathway(s) leading to IGF-I production via a positive feedback mechanism. IGF-II, IGFBP-5.1 and IGFBP-5.2 expression was unchanged in starved cells, but increased with amino acid replacement. Synergistic increases in expression of IGFBP5.2 and IGFBP-4, but not IGFBP5.1 were observed with addition of IGF-I, IGF-II or insulin and amino acids to the medium. IGF-I and IGF-II directly stimulated IGFBP-6 expression, but not when amino acids were present. These findings indicate that amino acids alone are sufficient to stimulate myogenesis in myoblasts and that IGF-I production is controlled by both endocrine and paracrine pathways. A model depicting the transcriptional regulation of the IGF pathway in Atlantic salmon muscle following feeding is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1991352534,"Signalling is a key feature of living cells which frequently involves the local clustering of specific proteins in the plasma membrane. How such protein clustering is achieved within membrane microdomains (“rafts”) is an important, yet largely unsolved problem in cell biology. The plasma membrane of yeast cells represents a good model to address this issue, since it features protein domains that are sufficiently large and stable to be observed by fluorescence microscopy. Here, we demonstrate the ability of single-molecule atomic force microscopy to resolve lateral clustering of the cell integrity sensor Wsc1 in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We first localize individual wild-type sensors on the cell surface, revealing that they form clusters of ∼200 nm size. Analyses of three different mutants indicate that the cysteine-rich domain of Wsc1 has a crucial, not yet anticipated function in sensor clustering and signalling. Clustering of Wsc1 is strongly enhanced in deionized water or at elevated temperature, suggesting its relevance in proper stress response. Using in vivo GFP-localization, we also find that non-clustering mutant sensors accumulate in the vacuole, indicating that clustering may prevent endocytosis and sensor turnover. This study represents the first in vivo single-molecule demonstration for clustering of a transmembrane protein in S. cerevisiae. Our findings indicate that in yeast, like in higher eukaryotes, signalling is coupled to the localized enrichment of sensors and receptors within membrane patches."
https://openalex.org/W2028111389,"Hypoxia plays a key role in ischaemic and neovascular disorders of the retina. Cellular responses to oxygen are mediated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) that are stabilised in hypoxia and induce the expression of a diverse range of genes. The purpose of this study was to define the cellular specificities of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in retinal ischaemia, and to determine their correlation with the pattern of retinal hypoxia and the expression profiles of induced molecular mediators.We investigated the tissue distribution of retinal hypoxia during oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in mice using the bio-reductive drug pimonidazole. We measured the levels of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins by Western blotting and determined their cellular distribution by immunohistochemistry during the development of OIR. We measured the temporal expression profiles of two downstream mediators, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (Epo) by ELISA. Pimonidazole labelling was evident specifically in the inner retina. Labelling peaked at 2 hours after the onset of hypoxia and gradually declined thereafter. Marked binding to Müller glia was evident during the early hypoxic stages of OIR. Both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels were significantly increased during retinal hypoxia but were evident in distinct cellular distributions; HIF-1alpha stabilisation was evident in neuronal cells throughout the inner retinal layers whereas HIF-2alpha was restricted to Müller glia and astrocytes. Hypoxia and HIF-alpha stabilisation in the retina were closely followed by upregulated expression of the downstream mediators VEGF and EPO.Both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are activated in close correlation with retinal hypoxia but have contrasting cell specificities, consistent with differential roles in retinal ischaemia. Our findings suggest that HIF-2alpha activation plays a key role in regulating the response of Müller glia to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2040684568,"Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis is regulated by the pantothenate kinases (PanK), of which there are four active isoforms. The PanK1 isoform is selectively expressed in liver and accounted for 40% of the total PanK activity in this organ. CoA synthesis was limited using a Pank1(-/-) knockout mouse model to determine whether the regulation of CoA levels was critical to liver function. The elimination of PanK1 reduced hepatic CoA levels, and fasting triggered a substantial increase in total hepatic CoA in both Pank1(-/-) and wild-type mice. The increase in hepatic CoA during fasting was blunted in the Pank1(-/-) mouse, and resulted in reduced fatty acid oxidation as evidenced by abnormally high accumulation of long-chain acyl-CoAs, acyl-carnitines, and triglycerides in the form of lipid droplets. The Pank1(-/-) mice became hypoglycemic during a fast due to impaired gluconeogenesis, although ketogenesis was normal. These data illustrate the importance of PanK1 and elevated liver CoA levels during fasting to support the metabolic transition from glucose utilization and fatty acid synthesis to gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The findings also suggest that PanK1 may be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders that feature hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia."
https://openalex.org/W2028648297,"Circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) decline during HIV-1 infection, but at the same time they express markedly higher levels of interferon alpha (IFNalpha), which is associated with HIV-1 disease progression. Here we show an accumulation of pDC in lymph nodes (LN) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 patients. This phenomenon was associated with elevated expression of the LN homing marker, CCR7, on pDC in peripheral blood of HIV-1 patients, which conferred increased migratory capacity in response to CCR7 ligands in ex vivo functional assays. LN-homed pDC of HIV-1 patients presented higher CD40 and lower BDCA2 levels, but unchanged CD83 and CD86 expression. In addition, these cells expressed markedly higher amounts of IFNalpha compared to uninfected individuals, and were undergoing faster rates of cell death. These results demonstrate for the first time that in asymptomatic, untreated HIV-1 patients circulating pDC up-regulate CCR7 expression, accumulate in lymph nodes, and express high amounts of IFNalpha before undergoing cell death. Since IFNalpha inhibits cell proliferation and modulates immune responses, chronically high levels of this cytokine in LN of HIV-1 patients may impair differentiation and immune function of bystander CD4(+) T cells, thus playing into the mechanisms of AIDS immunopathogenesis."

Uncovering the genetic architecture underlying mineral ion homeostasis in plants is a critical first step towards understanding the biochemical networks that regulate a plant's elemental composition (ionome). Natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana provide a rich source of genetic diversity that leads to phenotypic differences. We analyzed the concentrations of 17 different elements in 12 A. thaliana accessions and three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations grown in several different environments using high-throughput inductively coupled plasma- mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Significant differences were detected between the accessions for most elements and we identified over a hundred QTLs for elemental accumulation in the RIL populations. Altering the environment the plants were grown in had a strong effect on the correlations between different elements and the QTLs controlling elemental accumulation.

One of the more unusual steps in (bacterio)chlorophyll biosynthesis involves the chemically challenging, stereospecific reduction of the C17=C18 double bond of ring D of the porphyrin protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) 2The abbreviations used are: PchlideprotochlorophyllideChlidechlorophyllideCORchlorophyllide oxidoreductaseDPORdark operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductaser.m.s.d.root mean square deviationAMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateLPORlight-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. to form the chlorin chlorophyllide (Chlide, Fig. 1A).

In angiosperms, a monomeric, light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR) (NADPH Pchlide oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.1.33) catalyzes the reaction.

DPOR consists of three subunits. In chlorophyll-synthesizing organisms, these are termed ChlN, ChlB, and ChlL (1Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13004-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subunits ChlN and ChlB instead constitute a heterotetrameric complex here denoted (ChlN/ChlB)2 that bears two [4Fe-4S] clusters and two substrate binding sites (14Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F.

Some details of the catalytic mechanism of DPOR have been established biochemically. Upon binding of two molecules of ATP, ChlL2 interacts with the catalytic, substrate binding (ChlN/ChlB)2 complex. Ferredoxin provides a single electron to ChlL2 (13Bröcker M.J. Virus S. Ganskow S. Heathcote P. Heinz D.W. Schubert W.D. Jahn D. Moser J. J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of the two ATP molecules results in the dissociation of ChlL2 from reduced (ChlN/ChlB)2. Pchlide reduction is completed after two sequential catalytic redox cycles. Substrate recognition by (ChlN/ChlB)2 essentially involves all functional groups of the substrate (14Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Scheer H. Rüdiger W. Moser J.

Two ChlL2 dimers simultaneously interact with the (ChlN/ChlB)2 tetramer, giving rise to a hetero-octameric holoenzyme (15Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Moser J. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8268-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Residues from three DPOR subunits are presumably involved in the interaction of ChlL2 with (ChlN/ChlB)2 (17Wätzlich D. Bröcker M.J. Uliczka F. Ribbe M. Virus S. Jahn D. Moser J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15530-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the heterotetrameric (ChlN/ChlB)2 complex of DPOR. The structure inter alia reveals an unusual coordination of the intersubunit [4Fe-4S] clusters by 3 cysteine residues of ChlN and a unique aspartate residue of ChlB. The active site cavity is proposed to lie at the ChlN/ChlB interface of each half-dimer. It is characterized by aromatic amino acid residues involved in substrate coordination, placing the substrate ∼14 Å from the respective [4Fe-4S] cluster. The interaction of the dynamic switch protein ChlL2 with subcomplex (ChlN/ChlB)2 was modeled, placing the [4Fe-4S] cluster of ChlL2 19 Å from the corresponding cluster of (ChlN/ChlB)2, ensuring rapid electron transfer during catalysis. Comparing (ChlN/ChlB)2 with the nitrogenase MoFe protein (NifD/NifK)2 reveals significant structural homologies as well as conservation of functional residues. T. elongatus DPOR (ChlN/ChlB)2 subcomplexes were recombinantly produced under anaerobic conditions (oxygen partial pressure <1 ppm) in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI) as described previously (14Bröcker M.J.

Glutathione S-transferase tags N-terminally fused to ChlN were used for the affinity chromatographic purification of 80 mg of (ChlN/ChlB)2 complexes (370 nmol) via 10 ml of Protino® glutathione agarose (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). PreScissionTM protease (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) treatment was employed to liberate and elute (ChlN/ChlB)2 from the matrix (14Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S. Saggu M. Lendzian F.

Gel permeation chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer in an anaerobic chamber (Coy laboratories) followed. The column was calibrated with protein standards (molecular weight marker kit MW-GF 1000, Sigma). Automated Edman degradation was used to confirm the identity of purified proteins and for quantification of individual protein subunits. To validate the quality of purified (ChlN/ChlB)2, proteins were tested for catalytic activity in the standard DPOR assay containing 13 μm Pchlide, 2 mm dithionite, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system. 100 pmol of T. elongatus (ChlN/ChlB)2 were supplemented with 200 pmol of purified Prochlorococcus marinus ChlL2 (in a final volume of 125 μl) and analyzed as described earlier (14Bröcker M.J.

Purified (ChlN/ChlB)2 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml (45 μm) in lysis buffer using a stirred Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Millipore) with a 50-kDa cutoff. (ChlN/ChlB)2 was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 17 °C in an anaerobic chamber by mixing 3 μl of protein with 3 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 9.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 85 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.1, 14.3% 2-methyl pentane-2,4-diol, and 15% glycerol as cryoprotectants or 10.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 85 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 14.3% 2-methyl pentane-2,4-diol, and 15% glycerol as cryoprotectants for selenomethionine-labeled protein. Crystals grew within 3–5 days and were shock-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Synchrotron diffraction data were collected to 2.4 Å resolution at beam line ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France) using non-derivatized, wild-type (ChlN/ChlB)2 crystals.

Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsletter. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The protein model was built manually using COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

All other manual interventions were performed using the CCP4 suite of programs (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19665) Google Scholar, 27Potterton L. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Gruber J. Cowtan K. Emsley P. Murshudov G.N. Cohen S. Perrakis A. Noble M.

DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Crystals of the DPOR (ChlN/ChlB)2 complex belong to the space group P6322 with one half-tetramer (ChlN/ChlB) per asymmetric unit resulting in a Matthews coefficient of 3.3 Å3/Da (solvent content of ∼62%). The crystal packing of (ChlN/ChlB)2 thus incorporates a crystallographic two-fold axis, making the tetramer perfectly symmetric. Following the application of selenium-multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing and solvent-flattening techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”), RESOLVE was used for automated model building (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, phases were clearly of insufficient quality for a complete structure. By overlaying independently phased maps, the RESOLVE model was rebuilt and completed manually in Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22505) Google Scholar). This resulted in a final model consisting of 865 residues in ChlN and ChlB (Fig. 2). Overall, the structure is well defined, apart from a disordered loop of ChlN (residues 163–191) as well as 5 N-terminal and 1 C-terminal residues of ChlN and 65 C-terminal residues of ChlB that are not discernable in the electron density (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Structure-based sequence alignment of ChlN/ChlB. The structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of ChlN and ChlB results in 366 aligned residues and a sequence identity of 13.7%. α-Helices and β-strands are marked as α1–α20 and β1–β12, and the three subdomains are marked by progressively darker shades of green. Ligands coordinating the [4Fe-4S] cluster (Cys22, Cys47, and Cys107 of ChlN and Asp36 of ChlB) are indicated by red shading. Cys95 of ChlB involved in stabilizing the cluster is marked in black. Residues proposed to be involved in substrate and ChlL2 binding are indicated by cyan and magenta boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ChlN/ChlB interface within the asymmetric unit is quite extensive at 2485 Å2. The interaction surface of ChlB with its symmetry-related counterpart covers 1560 Å2, whereas that between ChlN and the second ChlB subunit of the tetramer is 1074 Å2. ChlN and ChlB share a related tertiary structure. The (ChlN/ChlB)2 heterotetramer would thus appear to have evolved from a symmetric tetrameric or even dimeric predecessor. Superimposing the two subunits results in a root mean square deviation of 3.3 Å for 336 aligned residues, whereas the sequence identity based on structural sequence alignments is 13.7% (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22505) Google Scholar). ChlN and ChlB each essentially consist of three compact subdomains each bearing a central, parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 4). The first subdomain is built around a four-stranded, parallel β-sheet covered by α-helices on either side. In ChlN, this domain (residues 21–139) provides all 3 cysteine ligands for the coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The same domain of ChlB (residues 10–127) provides the fourth aspartate ligand (Asp36, see below) to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The strand order of the β-sheet is 2-1-3-4, reminiscent of a C-terminally deleted Rossmann fold. The similarity of these two domains from alternate chains is underscored by a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.76 Å for 89 Cα atoms despite their asymmetric roles in FeS cluster coordination. The second compact domain is built around a three-stranded parallel β-sheet (strand order 2-1-3). In both ChlN (residues 140–289) and ChlB (residues 128–270), this domain appears to largely have a structural role in orienting the other two domains. It is neither involved in interdimer contacts nor in forming the tetramer. Correspondingly, some significant differences in secondary structure are noticeable. Thus both the first and the last α-helices of ChlN extend outward by an additional turn when compared with ChlB. A 40-residue insertion in ChlB following the N-terminal α-helix of this domain is disordered in the current crystal structure, and its precise role thus remains unclear. The third domain comprises residues 290–450 of ChlN and residues 271–494 of ChlB. It consists of five parallel β-strands covered by five α-helices. ChlN contains an additional sixth α-helical element (residues 361–370). Two alternative regions in this third domain appear to be involved in creating the active site channel (see below). An N-terminal stretch preceding the first subdomain of ChlN(residues 5–20) and ChlB(residues 1–10) associates most closely with the third, C-terminal domain. Although the association is not particularly pronounced in ChlB, it includes a β-strand in ChlN that extends the five-stranded β-sheet of the third domain of ChlN by a sixth parallel strand. Each (ChlN/ChlB) half-tetramer binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the interface of ChlN/ChlB (Fig. 5). Overall, the cluster is four-fold-coordinated. Three coordinating cysteine ligands, Cys22, Cys47 and Cys107, are provided by ChlN, whereas ChlB provides a single unusual aspartate ligand, Asp36, to coordinate the fourth iron of the cluster. Coordination distances between sulfur and iron are between 2.3 and 2.5 Å, whereas that between oxygen and iron is 1.8 Å. Again this is a standard distance for oxygen-coordinated iron; however, an aspartate as a ligand for a [4Fe-4S] cluster is rather unusual. In fact, [4Fe-4S] clusters have long been known to be coordinated by aspartate residues in some bacterial-type ferredoxins (29Moura J.J. Moura I. Kent T.A. Lipscomb J.D. Huynh B.H. LeGall J.

In addition, it could be shown that cysteine can functionally be substituted by aspartate to coordinate [4Fe-4S] clusters (33Zhao J. Li N. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A.

However, no structural model demonstrating the coordination of iron of a [4Fe-4S] cluster by aspartate is currently available through the Protein Data Bank. In fact, the only crystal structures showing the coordination of a [4Fe-4S] cluster by an oxygen include those of aconitase (ligand either a hydroxyl or a substrate oxygen), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (glutamine ligand) (35Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the recently described radical SAM enzymes in which the amide and carboxylate group of the methionine moiety directly coordinate the fourth iron of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (36Sofia H.J.

In fact, it has been speculated that some crystal structures bearing [3Fe-4S] clusters, all of which are exclusively coordinated through cysteines, may represent oxidized [4Fe-4S] clusters in which the fourth ligand may be oxygen (42Rousset C. Fontecave M. Ollagnier de Choudens S. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2937-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The identity of the 3 cysteines of ChlN coordinating the [4Fe-4S] cluster at the ChlN/ChlB interface confirms our earlier mutational analysis study that had implicated these cysteines in cluster coordination in DPOR from Chlorobaculum tepidum (13Bröcker M.J.

By contrast, we did not identify the involvement of an aspartate residue in cluster coordination through EPR spectroscopy (14Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S. Saggu M. Lendzian F.

Instead, we observed the highly conserved residue Cys95 of ChlB (T. elongatus numbering) to be crucial for sustained DPOR activity and [4Fe-4S] cluster formation. In the crystal structure, Cys95 is located near the [4Fe-4S] center with its sulfur atom 4.5 Å from the closest sulfur atom of the cluster (Fig. 5). At 5.0 Å, it is also in van der Waals contact with the side-chain oxygen of the iron ligand Asp36 as well as other neighboring oxygen atoms (3.1 Å to ChlN-Thr46-Oγ1, 3.2 Å to ChlN-Thr44-Oγ1, 4.1 Å to ChlB-Thr96-Oγ1). Consequently, the observed inactivation of DPOR as a result of an exchange of Cys95 with serine or alanine might be due to destabilization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster environment (13Bröcker M.J. Virus S.

Interestingly, Asp36 (ChlB) is an approximate structural counterpart of cluster ligand Cys47 (ChlN), whereas Cys95 of ChlB, involved in the stabilization of Asp36, is the structural equivalent of cluster ligand Cys107 of ChlN (Fig. 3; Table 2).

In humans, ACLY is the cytoplasmic enzyme linking energy metabolism from carbohydrates to the production of fatty acids. In situ proteolysis of full-length human ACLY gave crystals of a truncated form, revealing the conformations of residues 2–425, 487–750, and 767–820 of the 1101-amino acid protein. Residues 2–425 form three domains homologous to the β-subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), while residues 487–820 form two domains homologous to the α-subunit of SCS. The crystals were grown in the presence of tartrate or the substrate, citrate, and the structure revealed the citrate-binding site. A loop formed by residues 343–348 interacts via specific hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the prochiral center of citrate. Arg-379 forms a salt bridge with the pro-R carboxylate of citrate. The pro-S carboxylate is free to react, providing insight into the stereospecificity of ACLY. Because this is the first structure of any member of the acyl-CoA synthetase (NDP-forming) superfamily in complex with its organic acid substrate, locating the citrate-binding site is significant for understanding the catalytic mechanism of each member, including the prototype SCS. Comparison of the CoA-binding site of SCSs with the similar structure in ACLY showed that ACLY possesses a different CoA-binding site. Comparisons of the nucleotide-binding site of SCSs with the similar structure in ACLY indicates that this is the ATP-binding site of ACLY.

Lipmann F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 754874Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ACLY is the cytoplasmic enzyme linking energy metabolism from carbohydrates to the production of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA produced in the mitochondria cannot be exported to the cytoplasm. Instead, acetyl-CoA in mitochondria is transformed to citrate by citrate synthase, and citrate is exported to the cytoplasm where ACLY regenerates acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA is an important precursor for fatty acid synthesis. In addition, ACLY has been shown to signal the metabolic state of cells, likely by providing acetyl-CoA for histone acetyltransferases in the cells' nuclei (2Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the enzyme is supported by knock-out experiments in which mice embryos lacking ATP-citrate lyase could not be obtained (3Beigneux A.P. Kosinski C. Gavino B.

ATP-citrate lyase human ATP-citrate lyase isothermal titration calorimetry root mean squared deviation succinyl-CoA synthetase. Our understanding of the reaction mechanism of ACLY has been based on studies of this enzyme and of two enzymes with sequence similarity to ACLY. The first is succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), which catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate and CoA using ATP (4Kaufman S. Fed. Proc. 1953; 12: 704-708PubMed Google Scholar). The second is citrate synthase, the enzyme that generates citrate from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in mitochondria. The reaction catalyzed by ACLY is thought to occur in four steps (Reactions 1–4):View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)where E represents ACLY. Like SCS, ACLY is phosphorylated by ATP on an active site histidine residue to give E-P in step 1 (Reaction 1) (5Cottam G.L. Srere P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Inoue H. Suzuki F. Tanioka H. Takeda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 26: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is transferred to citrate in step 2 (Reaction 2). Citryl-phosphate is thought to remain bound to the enzyme, symbolized by E·citryl-P. Phosphate is released in the attack by CoA to form the citryl-CoA thioester bond in step 3 (Reaction 3) (7Wells T.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the last step (Reaction 4), citryl-CoA is cleaved to give acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, the reverse reaction to that catalyzed by citrate synthase. ACLY, like SCS, is a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase (NDP-forming) superfamily (8Sánchez L.B. Galperin M.Y. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5794-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are five domains common to all members of this superfamily (see Fig. 1). The domains are numbered according to their order in Escherichia coli SCS, because this enzyme was the first member of the superfamily to have its structure determined using x-ray crystallography (9Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10883-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, domains 1 and 2 occur in the α-subunit of E. coli SCS. Domain 1 binds CoA and domain 2 contains the phosphorylated histidine residue. Domains 3–5 occur in the β-subunit of E. coli SCS. Domains 3 and 4 adopt an ATP-grasp fold (10Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and bind nucleotide (11Joyce M.A. Fraser M.E. Brownie E.R. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Domain 5 interacts with domain 2, providing one of the two “power helices” at whose N termini the phosphohistidine residue is bound in structures of the phosphorylated protein (9Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10883-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol.

Groot P.H. Saxty B.A. Hughes S.A. Franklin M. Gloger I.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with all five domains in the N-terminal portion of a single polypeptide chain. The order of the domains is 3, 4, 5, 1, and 2 (Fig. 1). Between domains 5 and 1 lies a stretch of residues that can be phosphorylated on three serine or threonine residues (16Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ramakrishna S. D'Angelo G. Benjamin W.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The second isoform of human ACLY is 10 residues shorter in this region. The C-terminal portion of ACLY shows sequence similarity to the large domain of citrate synthase (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59437) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ACLY is as yet unknown and would be important for the design of enzyme inhibitors. ACLY has been suggested as a drug target in the treatment of excess cholesterol and fat, because it is upstream of the production of both cholesterol and fatty acids (20Groot P.H. Pearce N.J. Gribble A.D. Curr. Med. Chem. Immun. Endocrin. Metab. Agents. 2003; 3: 211-217Crossref Google Scholar, 21Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2007; 9: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been suggested as a drug target for cancer, because cancer cells rely to a large extent on glucose both as their energy source and for the de novo synthesis of fatty acids (22Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 23Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D.

As a step in obtaining the crystal structure of full-length ACLY, we crystallized a truncated form that contains residues from domains 1–5. The crystals were grown in the presence of tartrate or citrate and reveal both the structure of two-thirds of ACLY and the binding site of the substrate citrate. For production of human ACLY (hACLY) in E. coli, the gene was inserted in the pET-42b(+) vector (Novagen®). The gene was obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection of ATCC® as MGC-1812. The pET-42b(+) vector would add a C-terminal His8 tag to simplify purification. A C-terminal tag was chosen, because a previous attempt using an N-terminal His8 tag for purification of hACLY was unsuccessful (26Potapova I.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This was probably because the N terminus of the protein is likely to be buried, as is the N terminus of the β-subunit of SCS. Oligonucleotides KB2.1 5′-CTCTCTCTGCACATATGTCGGCCAAGG-3′ and KB2.2 5′-GCTAAGCTTCATGCTCATGTGTTCCGGAAGAACGTATG-3′ were the forward and reverse primers used to clone the gene. KB2.1 added an NdeI cleavage site (highlighted in bold), whereas KB2.2 was designed to add a HindIII cleavage site (highlighted in bold) and remove an NdeI cleavage site near the 3′-end of the gene. The gene was amplified using these primers and the Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with an annealing temperature of 57 °C and an extension temperature of 67 °C. The PCR product was purified using a 1% agarose gel and the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. NdeI and HindIII were used to cleave both the PCR product and the vector, which was subsequently purified to remove the smaller fragment. The PCR product and vector were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Inoue-competent (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and five colonies were tested for the presence of insert using restriction enzyme digests. Two of the five were positive, and their plasmid DNA was sequenced and transformed into the E. coli strain, BL21(DE3). Sequencing confirmed the presence of the gene, but showed that it still contained the NdeI restriction enzyme site near the 3′-end. Once inserted in the vector, the gene for hACLY had an additional 45 bases coding for the residues KLAAALEH8 at the C terminus of the protein. A previous work where hACLY was overproduced in E. coli had shown that the protein was insoluble unless coproduced with the molecular chaperone, GroEL/ES (26Potapova I.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 25 mg/liter kanamycin and 35 mg/liter chloramphenicol was inoculated with 5 ml of an overnight culture of BL21(DE3) containing plasmids with the genes for hACLY, pET-42b(+)hACLY (kanamycin resistance), and GroEL/ES (chloramphenicol resistance). The culture was grown at 310 K to an optical density at 600 nm (A600 nm) of 0.6, and then the temperature was dropped to 291 K, and protein production was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4–10 h at 291 K, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm in a Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor. Cells were stored at 193 K in lysis buffer containing 0.1 m KH2PO4, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm disodium EDTA, 1% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). When hACLY was to be purified, the stored cells were thawed on ice and lysed by sonication. The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 277 K for 30 min. hACLY in the soluble fraction was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume of desalting buffer containing 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The sample was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column and eluted with 150 mm imidazole. The final column was a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with the desalting buffer. The protein was loaded on the column, and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in desalting buffer. 9% SDS-PAGE gels were used to select fractions to be concentrated for crystallization trials. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and quick frozen in 20-μl aliquots in thin-walled PCR tubes (28Deng J. Davies D.R. Wisedchaisri G. Wu M. Hol W.G. Mehlin C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crystallization trials were begun with the purified protein, but cleavage products interfered with the experiments. To crystallize a stable cleavage product, chymotrypsin was added to the protein solution, and the protein solution was immediately used in crystallization trials (29Dong A. Xu X. Edwards A.M.

The crystals were grown in hanging drops by vapor diffusion after mixing 0.5 μl of the protein solution with 0.5 μl of the precipitant solution. The concentration of hACLY at which the crystals grew best was 5 mg/ml. The precipitant solution that gave good microcrystals consisted of 12.5% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm sodium tartrate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). Macroseeding using a precipitant solution containing 10% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm sodium tartrate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1) gave crystals large enough for x-ray diffraction experiments. Peptide mass fingerprinting was used to confirm that the crystals contained fragments of hACLY. Small crystals were collected and washed with precipitant solution. The crystals were dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and run on a 9% gel. Two bands were excised from the gel and submitted to the Southern Alberta Mass Spectrometry Centre for peptide mass fingerprinting. The polypeptides extracted from the gel were digested using trypsin and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The spectra were used to identify the sequences of the peptides by comparing the masses obtained experimentally to the theoretical masses calculated for trypsin-cleaved proteins (30Traini M. Gooley A.A. Ou K. Wilkins M.R. Tonella L. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Williams K.L. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether the truncated version of selenomethionyl hACLY could also be crystallized, full-length selenomethionyl protein was produced and purified. The protein was produced in the same way that selenomethionyl human succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase had been produced (31Bateman K.S. Brownie E.R. Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14455-14462Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using the method of Doublié to inhibit the production of methionine and incorporate selenomethionine (32Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The only differences from the purification of native hACLY were that the buffers were degassed and the samples were stored under argon to minimize oxidization of the selenomethionine residues. Prior to setting up the crystallization trials, the selenomethionyl protein at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was mixed with chymotrypsin. 0.5 μl of the protein solution was added to 0.5 μl of the precipitant solution to form the hanging drop. The precipitant solution used to grow crystals contained 10% PEG 3350, 75 mm potassium citrate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). X-ray diffraction data were collected at two synchrotrons. The native data were collected at beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA using an ADSC Quantum 315r charge-coupled device detector. Data from crystals of the selenomethionyl protein were collected at the PX beamline of the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, SK using a Rayonix MX225 charge-coupled device detector. Prior to the data collection, crystals of the native protein were cryoprotected in solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 15% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm sodium tartrate, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Crystals of the selenomethionyl protein were cryoprotected in 10% (v/v) glycerol, 15% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 75 mm potassium citrate. The crystals were vitrified in the cold stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K and shipped to the synchrotron at low temperature. The x-ray diffraction data collected at the synchrotrons were processed using the ELVES scripts (33Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and MOSFLM (34Leslie A.G.

For phasing, the best results were obtained using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set collected at the peak wavelength, 0.98055 Å, and processed to 2.5 Å-resolution. The phase problem was solved using the program PHENIX (38Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkoczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.-W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J.

After each round of rebuilding using COOT, the model was submitted to PHENIX for refinement. Citrate and water molecules were also fitted into the electron density. At this point, the x-ray diffraction data were reprocessed to 2.1 Å-resolution, the diffraction limit for this crystal, and the refinement was completed. To determine the structure of tartrate bound to truncated hACLY, the model of the selenomethionyl protein was modified to describe the native protein without citrate, and this model was refined against the native data. Tartrate was fitted into the electron density in the same region as the citrate-binding site. Programs from the CCP4 package (35Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) were used to analyze the resulting models. To test whether the enzyme activity of hACLY is inhibited by tartrate, cell lysate containing full-length hACLY was assayed in the presence of 0, 30, and 60 mm sodium tartrate. The kinetics assay is a coupled enzyme assay using malate dehydrogenase and NADH to reduce oxaloacetate. The loss of NADH is measured spectrophotometrically (46Inoue H. Suzuki F. Fukunishi K. Adachi K. Takeda Y. J. Biochem. 1966; 60: 543-553Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All reaction mixtures contained 0.2 mm CoA, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm DTT, 0.2 mm NADH, 3.5 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4). The concentration of potassium citrate varied from 0.05 to 5 mm, and the reactions were performed in triplicate at 310 K. The low background activity measured using cell lysate that did not contain hACLY was subtracted from each measured initial velocity. Plots of the corrected initial velocities versus citrate concentrations were analyzed using nonlinear regression in the program PRISM 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to determine V and apparent Km values for citrate at the different tartrate concentrations. These values were used to draw double reciprocal plots. Ki for tartrate was determined by linear regression from the plot of apparent Km values at different tartrate concentrations. The gene for hACLY was truncated to produce the 817 N-terminal residues, because this was approximately the limit seen in the crystal structure. In the pET42b(+)hACLY plasmid, a unique EagI restriction site lies upstream of the sequence coding for the His8 tag. A second EagI site was inserted after the region coding for the 817 N-terminal residues using the QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides TS3.1 5′-AGGAGGTGCCGGCCGCAACCGTGCCC-3′ and TS3.2 5′-GGGCACGGTTGCGGCCGGCACCTCCT-3′. Digestion of the mutated plasmid with EagI and re-ligation generated the plasmid pET42b(+)N′hACLY, which codes for the 817 N-terminal residues of hACLY followed by AALEH8, referred to as N-terminal hACLY. The sequence of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein production, the pET42b(+)N′hACLY plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). 1 liter of LB broth containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin was inoculated with 20 ml of an overnight culture of BL21(DE3) containing the pET42b(+)N′hACLY plasmid. The culture was grown at 310 K to an A600 nm of 0.6, the temperature was then dropped to 291 K, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.5 mm to induce protein production. After 18 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium citrate, 1% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The soluble fraction was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column and eluted with 200 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium citrate, 1% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The eluate was dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium citrate, 1% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 6 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) then loaded onto a Q-SepharoseTM Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column previously equilibrated with the same buffer solution. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.75 m NaCl in the same buffer solution. SDS-PAGE was used to detect fractions containing N-terminal hACLY and to judge protein purity. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to detect the binding of CoA to hACLY and to N-terminal hACLY. The protein samples were concentrated and dialyzed against buffer solution containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium citrate, 1% glycerol, 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), then centrifuged to remove any aggregates. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay. A 20 mm stock solution of CoA was prepared and diluted to 1 mm in the dialysis solution. Measurements were performed on a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal) at 298 K. 0.014 mm hACLY (measured as the concentration of tetramers) was loaded into the cell for the detection of the binding of CoA to hACLY, whereas 0.056 mm N-terminal hACLY was used for the detection of the binding of CoA to N-terminal hACLY so that the concentration of active sites would be identical. Each titration consisted of a single 2-μl injection of 1 mm CoA followed by 24 8-μl injections at 5-min intervals. Titrations of 1 mm CoA into buffer were also performed to subtract the heat of dilution. The data were analyzed using ORIGIN 7 (OriginLab). Crystals of chymotrypsin-truncated hACLY contained two polypeptide chains, as shown by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). The approximate relative molecular weights of the two polypeptides were 50 and 35 kDa. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified 10 peptides in the 50-kDa band and 12 in the 35-kDa band that matched (with differences of 1–22 ppm) peptid"

https://openalex.org/W2068205986,"Background Studies have shown that patients suffering from depression or schizophrenia often have immunological alterations that can be detected in the blood. Others reported a possible link between inflammation, a microgliosis and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in suicidal patients. Serum S100B is a marker of BBB function commonly used to study cerebrovascular wall function. Methods We measured levels of S100B in serum of 40 adolescents with acute psychosis, 24 adolescents with mood disorders and 20 healthy controls. Patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV TR criteria. We evaluated suicidal ideation using the suicidality subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS-C). Results Serum S100B levels were significantly higher (p<0.05) and correlated to severity of suicidal ideation in patients with psychosis or mood disorders, independent of psychiatric diagnosis. Patients with a BPRS-C suicidality subscores of 1–4 (low suicidality) had mean serum S100B values +/− SEM of 0.152+/−0.020 ng/mL (n = 34) compared to those with BPRS-C suicidality subscores of 5–7 (high suicidality) with a mean of 0.354+/−0.044 ng/mL (n = 30). This difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion Our data support the use of S100B as an adjunctive biomarker to assess suicidal risk in patients with mood disorders or schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2031456612,"Transcription of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is triggered by the binding of transactivating proteins to enhancer DNA, which stimulates the recruitment of general transcription factors (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H) and Pol II on the cis-linked promoter, leading to pre-initiation complex formation and transcription. In TFIID-dependent activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing TATA-box-binding protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators and cooperates with TFIIA to form a committed pre-initiation complex. However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of TFIID, TFIIA, the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter DNA. These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and TFIIA to TFIID, as well as a reorganization of TFIIA induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of TATA-box-binding protein within TFIID, consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent DNA loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a TFIIA-Rap1 protein bridge that folds over the DNA. These results highlight the role of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the TFIID complex."
https://openalex.org/W2025395369,"A unique hallmark of tuberculosis is the granulomatous lesions formed in the lung. Granulomas can be heterogeneous in nature and can develop a necrotic, hypoxic core which is surrounded by an acellular, fibrotic rim. Studying bacilli in this in vivo microenvironment is problematic as Mycobacterium tuberculosis can change its phenotype and also become acid-fast negative. Under in vitro models of differing environments, M. tuberculosis alters its metabolism, transcriptional profile and rate of replication. In this study, we investigated whether these phenotypic adaptations of M. tuberculosis are unique for certain environmental conditions and if they could therefore be used as differential markers. Bacilli were studied using fluorescent acid-fast auramine-rhodamine targeting the mycolic acid containing cell wall, and immunofluorescence targeting bacterial proteins using an anti-M. tuberculosis whole cell lysate polyclonal antibody. These techniques were combined and simultaneously applied to M. tuberculosis in vitro culture samples and to lung sections of M. tuberculosis infected mice and guinea pigs. Two phenotypically different subpopulations of M. tuberculosis were found in stationary culture whilst three subpopulations were found in hypoxic culture and in lung sections. Bacilli were either exclusively acid-fast positive, exclusively immunofluorescent positive or acid-fast and immunofluorescent positive. These results suggest that M. tuberculosis exists as multiple populations in most conditions, even within seemingly a single microenvironment. This is relevant information for approaches that study bacillary characteristics in pooled samples (using lipidomics and proteomics) as well as in M. tuberculosis drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2088990035,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) has important functions in regulating cellular metabolism including glucose utilization; the expression of the Txnip gene is sensitive to the availability of glucose and other fuels. Here, we show that Txnip expression is down-regulated at the transcriptional level by diverse inhibitors of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The effect of these OXPHOS inhibitors is mediated by earlier identified carbohydrate-response elements (ChoREs) on the Txnip promoter and the ChoRE-associated transcription factors Max-like protein X (MLX) and MondoA (or carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP)) involved in glucose-induced Txnip expression, suggesting that inhibited oxidative phosphorylation compromises glucose-induced effects on Txnip expression. We also show that the OXPHOS inhibitors repress the Txnip transcription most likely by inducing the glycolytic rate, and increased glycolytic flux decreases the levels of glycolytic intermediates important for the function of MLX and MondoA (or ChREBP). Our findings suggest that the Txnip expression is tightly correlated with glycolytic flux, which is regulated by oxidative phosphorylation status. The identified link between the Txnip expression and glycolytic activity implies a mechanism by which the cellular glucose uptake/homeostasis is regulated in response to various metabolic cues, oxidative phosphorylation status, and other physiological signals, and this may facilitate our efforts toward understanding metabolism in normal or cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2161231334,"The membrane-embedded photosystem II core complex (PSIIcc) uses light energy to oxidize water in photosynthesis. Information about the spatial structure of PSIIcc obtained from x-ray crystallography was so far derived from homodimeric PSIIcc of thermophilic cyanobacteria. Here, we report the first crystallization and structural analysis of the monomeric form of PSIIcc with high oxygen evolution capacity, isolated from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The crystals belong to the space group C2221, contain one monomer per asymmetric unit, and diffract to a resolution of 3.6 Å. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the PSIIcc-monomer crystals exhibit less anisotropy (dependence of resolution on crystal orientation) compared with crystals of dimeric PSIIcc, and the packing of the molecules within the unit cell is different. In the monomer, 19 protein subunits, 35 chlorophylls, two pheophytins, the non-heme iron, the primary plastoquinone QA, two heme groups, 11 β-carotenes, 22 lipids, seven detergent molecules, and the Mn4Ca cluster of the water oxidizing complex could be assigned analogous to the dimer. Based on the new structural information, the roles of lipids and protein subunits in dimer formation of PSIIcc are discussed. Due to the lack of non-crystallographic symmetry and the orientation of the membrane normal of PSIIcc perpendicular (∼87°) to the crystallographic b-axis, further information about the structure of the Mn4Ca cluster is expected to become available from orientation-dependent spectroscopy on this new crystal form.

The photosystem II core complex (PSIIcc) is a light-driven water-plastoquinone-oxidoreductase, which is characterized by the unique property of abstracting electrons from water molecules, the primary electron source in oxygenic photosynthesis (1Wydrzynski T.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8567-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The monomers in the dimer are related by a non-crystallographic C2 rotation axis. Each monomer contains 17 membrane-intrinsic and three membrane-extrinsic protein subunits, the latter being located at the lumenal side of the membrane. The redox-active cofactors are harbored by the heterodimeric protein matrix formed by subunits D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD) and are arranged in two pseudo-C2 symmetric branches. This entity, referred to as reaction center (RC), consists of four chlorophyll a (Chla) molecules, two pheophytins a (PheoD1, PheoD2), two plastoquinones (PQ) QA and QB with one non-heme iron located in between, two redox active tyrosines (YZ and YD), and the water oxidizing complex (WOC). Whereas the tightly bound QA acts as electron transmitter, the mobile QB is the substrate of the quinone reductase part of PSIIcc. An additional plastoquinone molecule (QC) of unresolved function has been located next to the QB binding site in the recent crystal structure of dimeric PSIIcc at 2.9-Å resolution. In the RC, light-induced charge separation takes place leading to the oxidation of PD1 to the cation radical PD1+.. The electron is transferred via PheoD1 and QA to QB. PD1+. has an exceptionally strong oxidizing power (1.25 eV (10Rappaport F. Diner B.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2008; 252: 259-272Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar)) and is able to abstract electrons via YZ from the WOC, a heteronuclear Mn4Ca cluster located at the lumenal side of PSII. After the accumulation of four redox equivalents in the so-called S-states (S0, S1, …, S4) of the WOC (11Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), water is oxidized to molecular oxygen. The crystals of dimeric PSIIcc belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and diffract to a maximal resolution of ∼2.9 Å (8Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Their x-ray diffraction pattern is highly anisotropic (the attained resolution depends on the orientation of the crystal in the x-ray beam), which limits the useful resolution range (12Loll B. Photosystem II from the Cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus at 3.2-Å Resolution. Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany2005Google Scholar, 13Kern J. Loll B. Zouni A. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biesiadka J. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This feature seems to originate from the packing of the dimeric complexes in the unit cell, but no other crystal form has been found for cyanobacterial PSIIcc so far. In addition to dimeric PSIIcc, a monomeric form with high oxygen evolution capacity has been prepared (14Kern J. Loll B. Lüneberg C. DiFiore D. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.D. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Zouni A. Kern J. Frank J. Hellweg T. Behlke J. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is therefore attractive to crystallize the PSIIcc monomer in attempting to achieve a more suitable crystal packing for x-ray structure analysis. In earlier work, the monomer was found to aggregate in solution (15Zouni A. Kern J. Frank J. Hellweg T. Behlke J. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was considered to be inappropriate for crystallization. We succeeded in developing a novel method for purifying an intact monomeric PSIIcc that crystallizes in a different form. The new crystals enabled us to obtain the first x-ray structural model of the PSIIcc monomer at 3.6-Å resolution. Based on these data, we address several open questions concerning the role of protein subunits and lipids for the oligomeric state of PSIIcc and the assembly/disassembly of PSIIcc during the repair cycle of photodamaged subunit D1 (17Komenda J.

The initial purification steps of PSIIcc followed the preparation protocol published in (14Kern J. Loll B. Lüneberg C. DiFiore D. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.D. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After two consecutive chromatography steps, the fraction containing the PSIIcc monomer was concentrated to ∼5 mm Chla and loaded onto a third column (diameter of 15 mm, length of 410 mm, ToyoPearl DEAE 650S, Tosoh Bioscience) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.0), 20 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m betaine monohydrate, 0.02% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM). After washing at a constant salt concentration for 6 cv with a flow rate of 3 ml/min, monomeric PSIIcc was eluted in a linear salt gradient (MgSO4, 0–50 mm, 8 cv). The fraction was concentrated in Amicon stirring cells using a Millipore Biomax 100 membrane (Millipore, MA). For further concentration to volumes <1 ml and to change the buffer conditions after ion exchange chromatography, the sample was washed three times with 10 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% (w/v) DDM using Sartorius Ultra Free 100 concentrators in a centrifuge at 3000 × g at 4 °C. Samples were concentrated to 3 mm Chla and either directly used for crystallization or stored in liquid nitrogen. A broad crystallization screen was set up using a robot and the sitting drop vapor diffusion method and yielded conditions that were further optimized. Crystals were grown using the microbatch method by mixing the protein solution (3 mm Chla corresponding to ∼25 mg/ml of protein) with the same volume of precipitant solution. Between 4 and 10 μl of the finally obtained solution (containing 1.5 mm Chla, ∼19% (w/v) PEG 400, 0.1 m PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 m CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) DDM) was placed either in a 96-well plate ([email protected], Greiner-Bio-one, Germany) or in the middle of a Teflon tube (inner diameter 1 mm; YCM Europe) and closed with sealing tape or sealing plaster. The crystals grew in 3 to 6 days at 18 °C in the dark and were directly flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K after soaking with 28% (w/v) PEG 400 to provide cryoprotection. The data set was collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, beam line ID 29), integrated and scaled with XDS (20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). The structure of the PSIIcc monomer was resolved by the molecular replacement method with the PHASER program (21McCoy A.J.

Model rebuilding and refinement were done using COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structure was refined with the rigid-body procedure for the protein part of the complex and the annealing procedure for the cofactors. The final model of PSIIcc monomer shows R/Rfree factors of 0.297/0.308, with root mean square deviations from ideal geometry of 0.013 Å for bond lengths and 2.1° for bond angles. For analytical anion exchange chromatography, a small column (5 mm diameter, 200 mm length, Toyopearl DEAE 650 S) was used connected to an Äkta FPLC system (ÄKTA purifier, Amersham Biosciences) with simultaneous detection at 205, 280, and 680 nm. Gel permeation chromatography experiments were conducted as described in Ref. 15Zouni A. Kern J. Frank J. Hellweg T. Behlke J. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, with simultaneous detection at 222, 280, and 680 nm. Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro Titan instrument with a tunable laser diode at 833 nm wavelength (Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA). The protein was dissolved in 100 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m betaine monohydrate, 0.03% (w/v) DDM and filtered through a Millex sterile filter (0.22 μm pore size) into a 100-μl cuvette. To obtain the diffusion coefficient DZ, autocorrelation functions of 50 measurements were averaged and analyzed using the instrumental software (Dynamics 6.9.2.9, Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA). Pigments of redissolved crystals of monomeric and dimeric PSIIcc were extracted in 80% (v/v) aqueous acetone and spectra were recorded in the wavelength region from 800 to 400 nm, normalized to 664 nm, and the absorbance difference was calculated.

Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4620) Google Scholar)) and β-carotene (144,000 m−1 cm−1 at 454 nm (25Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8981) Google Scholar)) a difference of 1.3 ± 0.2 β-carotene/36 Chla between monomeric and dimeric PSIIcc was calculated (assuming that the absorption of pheophytins at 664 nm is reduced by ∼50% compared with Chla). MALDI-TOF MS analysis was conducted using an Ultraflex II Spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) in the linear mode using sinapinic acid as matrix. SDS-PAGE was performed with a Phast System (Amersham Biosciences) using precast HD-SDS gels. Gels were run and silver stained following the protocol of the manufacturer. Oxygen evolution of PSII samples were measured at room temperature using a home built Clark-type electrode (26Clark L.C.J. ASAIO J. 1956; 2: 41-48Google Scholar). The excitation was performed either with saturating continuous white light from a tungsten lamp passed through a heat filter or with repetitive 1-Hz flashes from a xenon flash lamp. The sample was diluted to 20–50 μm Chla in a buffer containing 20 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.0- 6.0), 20 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm MgCl2. Artificial electron acceptors added were either 2 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone for continuous excitation or 2 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] and 0.4 mm phenyl-p-benzoquinone for single flash excitations. The electrode was calibrated using air-saturated and nitrogen-saturated water at atmospheric pressure. Following the published preparation protocol (14Kern J. Loll B. Lüneberg C. DiFiore D. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.D. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which comprises two ion exchange chromatography steps, we obtained essentially equal amounts of PSIIcc monomer and dimer (the monomer:dimer ratio of 40 preparations was 1.05 ± 0.45). The fraction of monomeric PSIIcc shows high oxygen evolution activity, but contains significant amounts of other proteins (as revealed by SDS-PAGE, supplemental Fig. S1, lane 1) not found in the fraction of dimeric PSIIcc. This contamination is due to phycobilisome proteins, a small amount of monomeric PSI, and ATP synthase. The latter occurs in nearly the same amount as the PSIIcc monomer (for characterization of ATP synthase from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, see supplemental data). The detection of ATP synthase by absorption at 280 nm is difficult due to the absence of bound pigments and its low tryptophan content (∼0.2% assuming a complex formed by α3β3γδ∈-abb′c10 (27Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Ikeuchi M. Katoh H. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Takeuchi C. Yamada M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2002; 9: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). However, ATP synthase could be monitored at a wavelength of 205 nm (Fig. 1), where mainly the protein backbone absorbs (28Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To improve the purity of the PSIIcc monomer preparation, we applied an additional chromatography step using a weak anion exchange matrix. As under the formerly used chromatography conditions at pH 6.0 no further separation between the PSIIcc monomer and ATP synthase could be achieved (Fig. 1), the pH of the applied buffer was varied. Whereas at pH 6.8 the separation of the compounds remains incomplete, a clear separation was obtained by decreasing the pH value to 5.0. This condition was consequently used to obtain pure PSIIcc monomer that enabled us to grow single crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments. We found no indication that exposition of monomeric or dimeric PSIIcc to pH 5.0 has a deleterious effect on the oxygen evolution capacity, in agreement with the reversible inhibition of PSIIcc at acidic pH described earlier (29Schlodder E. Meyer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 23-31Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the oxygen evolution activity of dimeric and monomeric PSIIcc was decreased when measured at pH 5.0, it was fully restored when the buffer was changed to pH 6.0 after long term incubation (4 or 24 h) at pH 5.0. The final monomeric and dimeric PSIIcc samples, as utilized for crystallization, show similar oxygen evolution activity rates ranging from 2400 to 3800 μmol O2 (mg Chla h)−1. Furthermore, measurements of the oxygen evolving activity per single flash using the PSIIcc monomers prepared as described above revealed the same oxygen evolution capacity of (¼ mol O2/(39–68 mol Chla × flash)) as known from dimeric PSIIcc used in crystallographic studies so far ((¼ mol O2/(37–73 mol Chla × flash)) taken from Ref. 14Kern J. Loll B. Lüneberg C. DiFiore D. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.D. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Neglecting double hits and misses (30Renger G. Hanssum B. Photosynth. Res. 2009; 102: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the theoretical limit for fully active centers is ¼ mol O2/(36 mol Chla × flash) taking into account the smaller absorption of 2 pheophytin a compared with 35 Chla per center. A combination of MALDI-TOF-MS (supplemental Fig. S2) and SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1, lane 5) revealed that the PSIIcc monomer contains the same protein subunits as the PSIIcc dimer and is of sufficient purity for protein crystallization. Mass spectrometry also confirmed that the small membrane intrinsic protein subunits of the PSIIcc monomer are N-terminally processed (supplemental Table S1) in the same way as described for the dimeric form (8Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Gel permeation chromatography showed a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 457 ± 20 kDa for monomeric PSIIcc similar to the value reported earlier (15Zouni A. Kern J. Frank J. Hellweg T. Behlke J. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further analyze the aggregation behavior of monomeric PSIIcc, samples were investigated by using dynamic light scattering at different protein concentrations that are in a suitable range for protein crystallization. The use of a laser at 833 nm wavelength avoids disturbance of the measurements due to light absorption by protein-bound chlorophylls and therefore allows for measurements at high protein concentrations. We obtained a monodisperse particle distribution (9.1 ± 1.3% polydispersity) with a hydrodynamic radius of 5.9 ± 0.1 nm that remained invariant at protein concentrations between 0.8 and 6.0 mg/ml (supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, the crude fraction of monomeric PSIIcc isolated without the third chromatography step (as in Ref. 14Kern J. Loll B. Lüneberg C. DiFiore D. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.D. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) forms aggregates with higher molecular mass similar to those reported in Ref. 15Zouni A. Kern J. Frank J. Hellweg T. Behlke J. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. The green colored, diamond-shaped and plate-like crystals of the PSIIcc monomer grew to maximum dimensions of ∼1.0 × 0.6 × 0.2 mm (Fig. 2). The diffraction pattern showed a diffuse background scattering as observed for crystals of PSIIcc dimer (12Loll B. Photosystem II from the Cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus at 3.2-Å Resolution. Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany2005Google Scholar), but was nearly isotropic (supplemental Fig. S4A). We were able to collect and process a dataset to 3.6-Å resolution (Table 1). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell constants a = 119.89 Å, b = 224.69 Å, c = 337.28 Å and one PSIIcc monomer in the crystal asymmetric unit (solvent content, 61.6%). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using one monomer of the 2.9-Å resolution structure of dimeric PSIIcc (8Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat.

Open table in a new tab Although the unit cell contains eight monomeric PSIIcc complexes, its volume is only slightly (∼3%) larger than the unit cell of crystallized dimeric PSIIcc with four dimers. This indicates an almost equally dense molecular packing in both crystal forms. Fig. 3A shows the packing of PSIIcc monomers in the unit cell viewed along the crystallographic b-axis. Three types of crystal contacts can be distinguished (Fig. 3A, circles A, B, and ellipse C). The majority of the crystal contacts are provided by the membrane-extrinsic subunit PsbV and the lumenal parts of PsbB, PsbE, and PsbH. This solvent-exposed region is characterized by polar side chains forming at least 24 hydrogen bonds between monomers that are rotated by 180° against each other along the crystallographic C2 axes (Fig. 3A, ellipse C). Two further contacts are provided by the membrane extrinsic subunit PsbO (Fig. 3A, circles A and B). The extended lumenal loop of PsbO provides two hydrogen bonds with the neighboring monomer (Fig. 3A, circle A), thereby interacting with the N-terminal loop of PsbF (PsbO-Lys112–PsbF-Pro10) and the N-terminal short α-helix of PsbE (PsbO-Ser115–PsbE-Asp12). Another hydrogen bond is found between PsbO-Thr51 and the N terminus of PsbA (PsbA-Asn12, Fig. 3A, circle B). The contacts along the b-axis are not resolved so far (Fig. 3B), but there are two regions, where protein subunits of different monomers approach each other by 5–6 Å. These comprise the C termini of PsbM (PsbM-Gln33, Fig. 3C) and the N terminus of PsbH (PsbH-Arg4) facing the loop of PsbC that connects transmembrane α-helices c and d. Because the monomers are oriented with their membrane normal (corresponding to the non-crystallographic C2 axis of the PSIIcc dimer) perpendicular (∼87°) to the crystallographic b-axis, their membrane planes are nearly parallel to this axis (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). Therefore, the detergent belt may prohibit close interactions between neighboring complexes in this direction. There is enough space between the PSIIcc monomers to accommodate a detergent belt in the form of a monolayer ring of 25-Å thickness in agreement with simple geometric models (31Müh F. Zouni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Roth M. Arnoux B. Ducruix A. Reiss-Husson F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9403-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The only exception is the region close to the C terminus of PsbM, where the detergent belts of the two adjacent monomers are probably partly fused or squeezed. Interestingly, in the crystals of monomeric PSIIcc a crystallographic C2 axis is located between the PsbM subunits of two neighboring monomers leading to an arrangement, in which their dimerization surfaces are facing each other (Fig. 3C). In the following, the term dimerization surface exclusively refers to monomeric PSIIcc and corresponds to the monomer-monomer interface in dimeric PSIIcc. The quality of the data allows the unambiguous assignment of the main chain folding of 19 polypeptide subunits, and no major changes compared with the dimeric PSIIcc structure could be detected. No electron density was found for the peripheral subunit PsbY, although its presence would not lead to sterical conflicts within the crystal. Nevertheless, PsbY could be detected in the majority (80%) of redissolved crystals by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S1). Iron is electron-rich and therefore its position can be easily mapped in the electron density. The non-heme iron is situated at the pseudo-C2 symmetry axis of the RC close to the cytoplasmic side as expected. The positions of the heme groups of cytochrome b559 and cytochrome c550 are in accordance with the above assignment of the corresponding protein subunits PsbE/F and PsbV, respectively. Despite the limited resolution of 3.6 Å, the good starting phases provided by the model of dimeric PSIIcc allowed us to reliably assign cofactors in the PSIIcc monomer. Large cofactors such as Chla and pheophytin molecules are well defined by the electron density (supplemental Fig. S5A). This fact enables us to confirm the arrangement of all chlorins in the RC and of all 29 Chla molecules bound to the core antenna proteins CP43 (13 Chla) and CP47 (16 Chla). In cases where flexible phytyl chains are not stabilized by contacts with protein and/or other cofactors, their assignment is rather difficult. Therefore, the similarity with the structure of the PSIIcc dimer was used as a guide. The reliability of the assignment of each cofactor was probed with the calculation of OMIT maps, which serve to reduce possible model bias problems introduced after molecular replacement. For most of the carotenoids, the electron density is not continuous. Their localization is mainly based on the electron density of the ionone rings and the analogy to the β-carotene positions in the PSIIcc dimer. This resulted in the assignment of 11 β-carotenes. Absorption spectroscopy of redissolved crystals confirmed this number (see “Experimental Procedures”). The β-carotene missing in the structure of the PSIIcc monomer is located at the monomer-monomer interface in dimeric PSIIcc and therefore may detach due to its exposed localization in the monomer. The best defined β-carotene in the PSIIcc monomer is CarD2 close to cytochrome b559. In the PSIIcc monomer, electron density is found at the"
https://openalex.org/W1995873924,"Background The precursor for advanced glycation end products, 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG) is highly upregulated in skin explants of diabetic cutaneous wounds, and has been shown to negatively impact dermal fibroblasts, which are crucial in wound remodeling. 3DG induces apoptosis however; the mechanisms involved in the apoptotic action of 3DG in the pathogenesis of diabetic chronic wounds are poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to delineate novel mechanisms involved with the 3DG-collagen induced apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Using human dermal fibroblasts, we demonstrated that 3DG-modified collagen induces oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation. Oxidative stress was found to be dependent on the upregulation of NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (Nox4), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) Nox homologue, triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as assessed by the ER stress-induced apoptosis marker Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153). We demonstrated that 3DG-collagen activated GADD153 via phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and this was dependent on upstream ROS. Inhibition of ROS and/or p38 MAPK abrogated 3DG-collagen induced caspase-3 activation. Our investigations also demonstrated that 3DG-collagen-induced caspase-3 activation did not signal through the canonical receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) but through integrin α1β1. To further verify the role of integrins, neutralization of integrins α1β1 prevented 3DG-collagen-induced upregulation of ROS, GADD153, and caspase-3 activation; suggesting that 3DG-collagen signaling to the fibroblast is dependent on integrins α1β1. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that a RAGE independent mechanism is involved in 3DG-collagen-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the ER stress pathway through activation of Nox4 by integrins α1β1 plays a key role in 3DG-collagen-induced caspase-3 activation, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds."
https://openalex.org/W2090023607,"Inflammation is part of many neurological disorders and immune reactions may influence neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to the disease process. Our knowledge about the interplay between different cell types in brain inflammation are not fully understood. It is important to know the mechanisms and factors involved in order to enhance regeneration and brain repair. We show here that NPCs express receptors for interferon-γ (IFNγ), and IFNγ activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein-1. IFNγ reduced cell proliferation in NPCs by upregulation of the cell cycle protein p21 as well as induced cell death of NPCs by activating caspase-3. Studies of putative factors for rescue showed that the neuropeptide, Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) increased cell viability, the levels of p-Bad and reduced caspase-3 activation in the NPCs. Medium from cultured microglia contained IFNγ and decreased the viability of NPCs, whilst blocking with anti-IFNγ antibodies counteracted this effect. The results show that NPCs are negatively influenced by IFNγ whereas PACAP is able to modulate its action. The interplay between IFNγ released from immune cells and PACAP is of importance in brain inflammation and may affect the regeneration and recruitment of NPCs in immune diseases. The observed effects of IFNγ on NPCs deserve to be taken into account in human anti-viral therapies particularly in children with higher rates of brain stem cell proliferation."

Cernunnos is part of the ligation complex, constituted by X4 and L4. To improve our knowledge on the structure and function of Cernunnos, we performed a systematic mutagenesis study on positions selected from an analysis of the recent three-dimensional structures of this factor. Ten of 27 screened mutants were nonfunctional in several DNA repair assays. Outside amino acids critical for the expression and stability of Cernunnos, we identified three amino acids (Arg(64), Leu(65), and Leu(115)) essential for the interaction with X4 and the proper function of Cernunnos. Docking the crystal structures of the two factors further validated this probable interaction surface of Cernunnos with X4."
https://openalex.org/W2055597429,"Numerous metabolic pathways have been implicated in diabetes-induced renal injury, yet few studies have utilized unbiased systems biology approaches for mapping the interconnectivity of diabetes-dysregulated proteins that are involved. We utilized a global, quantitative, differential proteomic approach to identify a novel retinoic acid hub in renal cortical protein networks dysregulated by type 2 diabetes.Total proteins were extracted from renal cortex of control and db/db mice at 20 weeks of age (after 12 weeks of hyperglycemia in the diabetic mice). Following trypsinization, (18)O- and (16)O-labeled control and diabetic peptides, respectively, were pooled and separated by two dimensional liquid chromatography (strong cation exchange creating 60 fractions further separated by nano-HPLC), followed by peptide identification and quantification using mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis identified 53 proteins with fold change >or=1.5 and p<or=0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (out of 1,806 proteins identified), including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH1/ALDH1A1). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified altered retinoic acid as a key signaling hub that was altered in the diabetic renal cortical proteome. Western blotting and real-time PCR confirmed diabetes-induced upregulation of RALDH1, which was localized by immunofluorescence predominantly to the proximal tubule in the diabetic renal cortex, while PCR confirmed the downregulation of ADH identified with mass spectrometry. Despite increased renal cortical tissue levels of retinol and RALDH1 in db/db versus control mice, all-trans-retinoic acid was significantly decreased in association with a significant decrease in PPARbeta/delta mRNA.Our results indicate that retinoic acid metabolism is significantly dysregulated in diabetic kidneys, and suggest that a shift in all-trans-retinoic acid metabolism is a novel feature in type 2 diabetic renal disease. Our observations provide novel insights into potential links between altered lipid metabolism and other gene networks controlled by retinoic acid in the diabetic kidney, and demonstrate the utility of using systems biology to gain new insights into diabetic nephropathy."

https://openalex.org/W2018585331,"Background The study of P transposable element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, “TAS”) has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. Phenotypic and genetic analysis have shown that TSE exhibits variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin (including HP1) and RNA silencing. Principal Findings Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE. In addition, we carried out a molecular analysis of TSE and show that silencing is correlated to the accumulation of lacZ small RNAs in ovaries. Finally, we show that the production of these small RNAs is sensitive to mutations affecting squash and zucchini, as well as to the dose of HP1. Conclusions and Significance Thus, our results indicate that the TSE represents a bona fide piRNA-based repression. In addition, the sensitivity of TSE to HP1 dose suggests that in Drosophila, as previously shown in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a RNA silencing pathway can depend on heterochromatin components."
https://openalex.org/W1987616891,"Oxalacetate acetylhydrolase (OAH), a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase/isocitrate lyase superfamily, catalyzes the hydrolysis of oxalacetate to oxalic acid and acetate. This study shows that knock-out of the oah gene in Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus, reduces the ability of the fungus to form cankers on chestnut trees, suggesting that OAH plays a key role in virulence. OAH was produced in Escherichia coli and purified, and its catalytic rates were determined. Oxalacetate is the main OAH substrate, but the enzyme also acts as a lyase of (2R,3S)-dimethyl malate with approximately 1000-fold lower efficacy. The crystal structure of OAH was determined alone, in complex with a mechanism-based inhibitor, 3,3-difluorooxalacetate (DFOA), and in complex with the reaction product, oxalate, to a resolution limit of 1.30, 1.55, and 1.65 A, respectively. OAH assembles into a dimer of dimers with each subunit exhibiting an (alpha/beta)(8) barrel fold and each pair swapping the 8th alpha-helix. An active site ""gating loop"" exhibits conformational disorder in the ligand-free structure. To obtain the structures of the OAH.ligand complexes, the ligand-free OAH crystals were soaked briefly with DFOA or oxalacetate. DFOA binding leads to ordering of the gating loop in a conformation that sequesters the ligand from the solvent. DFOA binds in a gem-diol form analogous to the oxalacetate intermediate/transition state. Oxalate binds in a planar conformation, but the gating loop is largely disordered. Comparison between the OAH structure and that of the closely related enzyme, 2,3-dimethylmalate lyase, suggests potential determinants of substrate preference."
https://openalex.org/W2100135144,"Background Neurexin is a synaptic cell adhesion protein critical for synapse formation and function. Mutations in neurexin and neurexin-interacting proteins have been implicated in several neurological diseases. Previous studies have described Drosophila neurexin mutant phenotypes in third instar larvae and adults. However, the expression and function of Drosophila neurexin early in synapse development, when neurexin function is thought to be most important, has not been described. Methodology/Principal Findings We use a variety of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, and electrophysiology, to characterize neurexin expression and phenotypes in embryonic Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Our results surprisingly suggest that neurexin in embryos is present both pre and postsynaptically. Presynaptic neurexin promotes presynaptic active zone formation and neurotransmitter release, but along with postsynaptic neurexin, also suppresses formation of ectopic glutamate receptor clusters. Interestingly, we find that loss of neurexin only affects receptors containing the subunit GluRIIA. Conclusions/Significance Our study extends previous results and provides important detail regarding the role of neurexin in Drosophila glutamate receptor abundance. The possibility that neurexin is present postsynaptically raises new hypotheses regarding neurexin function in synapses, and our results provide new insights into the role of neurexin in synapse development."

LBPs disintegrate when they contact an air-liquid interface, leading to an instantaneous spreading of material and a decline in surface tension. Here, we demonstrate that the film formed by the adsorbed material spontaneously segregate into distinct ordered and disordered lipid phase regions under unprecedented near-physiological conditions and, unlike natural surfactant purified from bronchoalveolar lavages, dynamically reorganized into highly viscous multilayer domains with complex three-dimensional topographies. Multilayer domains, in coexistence with liquid phases, showed a progressive stiffening and finally solidification, probably driven by a self-driven disassembly of LBPs from a sub-surface compartment. We conclude that surface film formation from LBPs is a highly dynamic and complex process, leading to a more elaborated scenario than that observed and predicted by models using reconstituted, lavaged, or fractionated preparations.

Pulmonary surfactant is essential to form surface active films at the respiratory air-liquid interface, and so to minimize the work of breathing. It forms a continuous network of membrane-based structures, which reduce surface tension and facilitate lung inflation (1Pérez-Gil J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1676-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Surfactant is assembled in lamellar bodies of alveolar type II (AT II) 3The abbreviations used are: AT IIalveolar type IILBPslamellar body-like particlesDPPCdipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholinerHrelative humidity. cells as densely packed membranous structures, which maintain this compact organization after release into the extracellular fluid, constituting what was termed lamellar body-like particles (LBPs) (2Haller T.

Upon adsorption, LBPs transfer surface active components into the air-liquid interface. The mechanisms that have been proposed to promote this transfer include (a) a surface tension-dependent rupture, or unpacking, of the entire particle, followed by a lateral spreading of its contents at the interface (2Haller T. Dietl P. Stockner H. Frick M. Mair N. Tinhofer I. Ritsch A. Enhorning G. Putz G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

At present, all these mechanisms seem possible, but the relative contribution of each of them in vivo is not known (6Perez-Gil J. Weaver T.E.

In classical views of surfactant function, adsorbed material forms a stable monolayer, supposedly enriched in DPPC, able to tolerate high lateral compressions at inspiration, and re-expands after surface relaxation (7Goerke J.

More recently, it has been proposed that interfacial lipid/protein complexes are interconnected with subsurface aggregates (1Pérez-Gil J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1676-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated surface film formation by LBPs at an inverted air-liquid interface (10Bertocchi C. Ravasio A. Bernet S. Putz G. Dietl P. Haller T. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1353-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by fluorescence microscopy of phase selective dyes (Bodipy-PC and DiI). Previous studies had shown that differential partition properties of these two probes permit detection of segregated fluid-ordered (DiI) and fluid disordered (Bodipy-PC) regions in surfactant membranes (11Bernardino de la Serna J. Perez-Gil J. Simonsen A.C. Bagatolli L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40715-40722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12de la Serna J.B. Orädd G. Bagatolli L.A.

Here, fluorescence staining permitted detection of phase separation but also the accumulation of surfactant into multilayers. Additionally, surface topography was mapped by conventional and scanning reflected-light microscopy. The images obtained produced a true three-dimensional representation of the texture of the surfactant film. Beside the methods used, the strength and novelty of our approach is the fact that we used surfactant directly in the form it is secreted (2Haller T. Dietl P. Stockner H. Frick M. Mair N. Tinhofer I. Ritsch A. Enhorning G. Putz G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1009-L1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is important because whole bronchoalveolar lavage, from which natural surfactant preparations are usually obtained, collects structures from different regions of the respiratory tract, and may contain material that is already considerably modified and/or does not necessarily contain the intact functional complexes as they are preassembled within the cells. Furthermore, we performed the experiments at 37 °C and 100% rH. Both factors are normally not considered in traditional surface biophysical measurements because of technical difficulties, except in the captive bubble surfactometer, where optical inspections with high resolution are not applicable (13Schurch S. Bachofen H. Possmayer F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 129: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our measurements demonstrated that LBPs form, through a highly dynamic reorganization, interfacial films with defined two-dimensional and three-dimensional complexities and very limited lateral diffusion. Possible impacts on our understanding of the in vivo situation, as well as differences in the biophysical behavior as compared with other surfactant materials, are discussed. Chemicals were from Sigma, Bodipy-PC [2- (4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine], and DiI [1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate] from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes. The bulk solution contained, in mm: NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10 (pH 7.4). LBPs were harvested from the supernatants of purified rat AT II cells grown on Petri dishes, stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C with intermittent shaking by ATP (100 μm) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm) in bulk solution supplemented with antibiotics as described (2Haller T. Dietl P. Stockner H. Frick M. Mair N. Tinhofer I. Ritsch A. Enhorning G. Putz G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1009-L1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). With this stimulation, AT II cells release a considerable amount of surfactant phospholipids and proteins (14Andreeva A.V. Kutuzov M.A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2007; 293: L259-L271Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Haller T. Ortmayr J. Friedrich F. Völkl H. Dietl P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Screen. 2006; 11: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After collection, supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until use. Morphology of LBPs was analyzed by transmission EM of re-thawed samples (see below). They showed different packing densities and were partially disorganized (Fig. 1A). Tubular myelin was not detectable. Before use, suspended LBPs were also routinely labeled with FM 1–43 and inspected by microscopy for a particulate appearance (2Haller T. Dietl P. Stockner H. Frick M. Mair N. Tinhofer I. Ritsch A. Enhorning G. Putz G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1009-L1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were quantified by phosphorous analysis or by choline determination as described (17Garcia-Verdugo I. Ravasio A. de Paco E.G. Synguelakis M. Ivanova N. Kanellopoulos J. Haller T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2008; 295: L708-L717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Surfactant from porcine lung lavages was purified and separated from blood components by NaBr density-gradient centrifugation (18Taeusch H.W. de la Serna J.B. Perez-Gil J. Alonso C. Zasadzinski J.A. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1769-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This preparation presumably contained both large and small aggregates. Stock solutions of Bodipy-PC and DiI were prepared in DMSO (1 mg/ml). Surfactants were stained, by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, with an equimolar mixture of Bodipy-PC and DiI at a total dye/surfactant molar ratio of 3%. For FRAP, LBPs were stained only with Bodipy-PC (3% mol/mol). For analysis of SP-A and SP-D content, SDS/PAGE was performed using 12% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions, in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer system at 20 V for 20 min. For analysis of SP-B and SP-C, 16% acrylamide gels were run under non-reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) or PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), respectively, using a wet transfer system at 300 mA for 1 h. Blocking, washing, and incubation with the antibodies were performed using a protein detection system under vacuum (SNAP i.d., Millipore Corp.). The primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-SP-B (1:5000), rabbit anti-mature-SP-C (1:7000), mouse anti-SP-D (1:5000) (all from Seven Hills Bioreagents, OH), and rabbit anti-SP-A (1:2000) (kindly supplied by Dr. J. Wright, from Duke University). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (1:10000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated (1:10000) (Sigma Aldrich). Positive controls loaded in the corresponding westerns were 0.1 μg of SP-A and SP-D, and 0.5 μg of SP-B and SP-C. Both hydrophobic proteins were purified from porcine surfactant through organic extraction and gel-penetration chromatography. SP-A was a human protein generously given by Dr. C. Casals, from Universidad Complutense, and SP-D control was a recombinant SP-D form kindly provided by Dr. E. Crouch, from Washington University at St. Louis. LBPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation before being loaded in the gels. They contained, as surfactant purified from lavages, the entire protein spectrum except SP-D (Fig. 1B). A volume of 10 ml of LBPs with a lipid concentration of 32.3 μg/ml was fixed by incubation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (TAAB) for 6 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation and washing with phosphate buffer 0.1 m, the pellet was post-fixed with osmium tetroxide (TAAB) 1% for 1 h and washed again three times with distilled water for 10 min each. Dehydration of the samples was performed with increasing concentrations of acetone from 30 to 100%, incubating each solution for 10 min. Infiltration with the Spurr resin (TAAB) was developed with the following concentrations of resin/acetone: 1/3 for 1 h, 1/1 for 1 h, 3/1 for 2 h, pure resin overnight, and pure resin 1 h. Resin polymerization was performed at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections of the resin-embedded samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope (Jeol). Previously, the inverted interface was used to analyze surfactant adsorption and surface film formation (2Haller T. Dietl P. Stockner H. Frick M. Mair N. Tinhofer I. Ritsch A. Enhorning G. Putz G.

For this investigation, the setup was modified as follows: A glass coverslip (Fig. 2A) confines a space underneath the interface in which temperature and humidity could be kept constant by a slow convective flow of water-saturated air. The interface was thermostatted to yield 37 ± 0.1 °C in the air and fluid sides of the interface, respectively. By filling the chamber with buffered solution, a clean interface immediately formed at the aperture plane below. Thereafter, LBPs were added on top (2 μg into a final chamber volume of 1 ml), and came into contact with the interface by sedimentation. Surface properties (FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9) were probed with micropipettes made of borosilicate, pulled to end with a closed hairpin (< 10 μm), and lowered by a micromanipulator 25 μm beyond the interface. Analysis of meniscus shape was performed by applying a threshold function as described in the legend to Fig. 9.FIGURE 8Stiffening of the surface coat. A, measurement of fluorescent bead mobility. Reflection images (top) illustrate the status of the interface at 0 and 60 min.

Right plot, comparison at time 60 min with purified surfactant (PS) is shown in the bar chart (n = 6). B, a line crossing flat and light scattering regions along which FRAP was performed. Fluorescence recovery (%If) was measured in the indicated regions (n = 5) and purified surfactant (n = 6). C, microtip-induced surface mobility (see also Fig. 9).

A, puncture of the interface by a glass μtip enforces a fluid meniscus whose shape is depending on surface tension, contact angle, and gravitation (wetting is assumed to be complete). Meniscoid curvature can be analyzed by the microscope's image function upon epiillumination: Incident light from the objective is reflected to, or away from, the objective, depending on the angle of the surface. Below a critical incident angle (C.a.), light back reflection into the objective approaches zero (gray region). a and b illustrate 2 different menisci (as a result of different surface tensions), leading to the corresponding diameters a′, b′ of central dark image regions, the areas of which were used to estimate surface tension. B, line scans through the tip center (along dashed line in image) were used to define a threshold level (gray dotted line). Pixels with intensities below were used to calculate the central dark area (indicated by the bright circle) of diameter b′. According to A, a decrease in surface tension (e.g. by LBPs) leads an increase in the area below the threshold (a′). C, evaluation and results of the method, using the calculated dark areas and different surfactants, all at 37 °C and 100% rH. All surfactants yielded statistically different values (p ≤ 0.025) except DPPC compared with purified surfactant. Different concentrations within each group were not different. D, example of a measurement with LBPs. Top, only flat regions were used for C. Bottom, light scattering structures resisted penetration. They were lifted (here: 10 μm), leading to an asymmetric shading (meniscus).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescence and reflected light microscopy were performed by epiillumination (Fig. 2B) with an inverted microscope (Zeiss 100) and a dry objective (Plan-Neofluar, 20×, N.A. 0.5; Zeiss). The light source (Polychrome II, Till Photonics) allowed a quick change (< 5 ms) between 470 nm (fluorescence) and 620 nm (reflection). Light was further filtered by a dualband excitation filter (480/593) and directed by the first dichroic beam splitter (505) toward the interface. Fluorescent or reflected light, after passing the first dichroic, were split by a second dichroic (565) mounted in a real-time dual color imaging device (Dual-View, Optical Insights). Split images either passed a 510 ± 10 nm for Bodipy-PC or a 630 ± 50 nm filter for DiI or reflected light. The two images were displayed on separated parts of a CCD chip (Imago-SVGA, Till Photonics), operated at an acquisition rate of 1 frame/3 s and a binning factor of 2. Using this optical configuration, Bodipy-PC and DiI fluorescence could be recorded synchronously, followed by reflection images taken 10 ms thereafter. Furthermore, crosstalk between the channels was negligible: light reflection did not contribute to fluorescence, nor was DiI emission (red) detectable in the green channel (Bodipy), whereas 3% of Bodipy emission bleached into the red one. However, Bodipy-PC at high concentrations is subject to self-quenching and to an increase in its Stoke's shift (19Dahim M. Mizuno N.K. Li X.M. Momsen W.E. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1511-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both artifacts have to be taken into account. A Zeiss Laser Scan Microscope (LSM 410) equipped with an argon (488 nm; 60 milliwatt) and a helium-neon laser (543 nm; 0.5 milliwatt) and a Plan-Neofluar, 20×, N.A. 0.5 was used for FRAP and z-stacking of the interfacial film. For FRAP, Bodipy-PC was visualized by the argon laser attenuated to 10% and bleached by operating it at full power for 2 min. Emitted light was directed through a > 515 nm filter before entering the photomultiplier tube. For z-stacks, Bodipy-PC was visualized as above, whereas DiI and reflection images were taken with the helium-neon laser. DiI and reflection images were separated by inserting or removing, respectively, a long-pass filter (>620 nm) in the light path. Mean fluorescence intensity (If) indicates the intensity per unit of area (pixels), If-bg denotes background corrected If. Background was determined from a clean air-liquid interface. Thus, If-bg excludes fluorescence from the bulk and scattered light. However, all images are shown without background correction. Image and data analysis was performed with Till Vision, ImageJ, Microsoft Excel and Prism. We used unpaired t-tests, and data are reported as arithmetic mean of three independent experiments ± S.E. (unless otherwise indicated). Within the 1st min after addition, LBPs contacting a clean interface (γ ≈72 mN/m) instantaneously and spontaneously disaggregated (defined as sudden disappearance of particulate fluorescence, Fig. 3A, 1st min). Disaggregation was fast (<6 s in 88.8 ± 7.0% of all events, Fig. 3C), particularly for the very first LBPs (<3 s in 71.4%, disaggregation occurred in 100%). Upon adsorption, phospholipids freely dispersed and covered the interface as unmasked by augmented fluorescence within areas devoid of particles (Fig. 3A, 2nd min). Thus, LBPs rapidly formed a phospholipid-based interfacial layer. Disaggregation of LBPs arriving after the 1st min became less common and slowed down, and terminated completely after the 3rd min (Fig. 3, B and C). LBPs constantly approached the interface for the entire duration of the experiments (1 h), revealed by a nearly linear increase in the fluorescence intensity of both dyes (Fig. 4C). However, after the initial phase (3 min), the organization of surfactant and the behavior of LBPs changed notably: highly reflective structures appeared in form of irregular dots (Fig. 3A, 2nd min, reflection). These dots, probably surfactant in bi- or multilayers, but not compact LBPs, freely moved and by contact with each other or the capillary walls aggregated into coral-like structures that primarily stained with DiI (Fig. 3A, after 3rd min). At this time, LBPs moving through regions of low reflectance slowly associated with the reflecting structures (Fig. 3, A, after 3rd min, B and C). Thus, highly reflective coral-like structures developed by association of material already present at the interface in form of multilayer domains, or by direct incorporation of newly arriving LBPs. Accumulation of surfactant within these structures also led to lateral growth and development of three-dimensional topographies, visible as light scattering structures in Fig. 4A. Within the first 5 min, these textures already occupied a large portion of the interface (26.6 ± 14.6%). Thereafter, their growth abruptly slowed down but still continued, and after 60 min 81 ± 3.5% of the interface was covered (Fig. 4, A and B). The whole process of LBPs adsorption, interfacial transfer of material and its organization into two-dimensional and three-dimensional segregated structures can be seen in the supplemental movie. The three channels, running synchronously, show how the three-dimensional structures (presumably multilayer aggregates; left), Bodipy-PC labeled areas (presumably liquid-disordered states; center) and DiI-labeled regions (presumably liquid-ordered phase; right) appear and evolve in the film within 1 h of experiment (compressed to one frame/15 s). Bodipy-PC and DiI incorporated within light scattering regions (Figs. 4A and 5B). In contrast, the intensities of both dyes in “flat” regions only slightly increased. Fluorescence analyses suggest that light scattering regions were formed by the build-up of surfactant into multilayers whereas flat regions are phospholipid monolayers. Accumulation of surfactant in light scattering regions is also shown by the ratio of dye intensities (Fig. 5C). Distribution of Bodipy-PC between multi- and monolayers plateaued after ∼25 min, obviously indicating equal partition between domains. Similarly, but later (at ∼50 min), also the DiI ratio leveled off. To compare the proportion of the dyes in one region, the background corrected intensities of each dye were normalized for their total intensity at the interface at any given time (practically, values in Fig. 5B were divided by those in Fig. 4C). The results (nIDiI-bg for DiI and nIBodipy-PC-bg for Bodipy-PC) were independent of differences in amounts and/or fluorescence efficiencies of the dyes, which may contribute to the divergence seen in Fig. 4C. As shown in Fig. 5D, Bodipy-PC prevailed over DiI in flat regions, suggesting a primarily liquid expanded state here. However, also in these regions, a coexistence of liquid expanded and ordered phases was observed (Fig. 6A). Conversely, DiI prevailed in light scattering regions, especially during the early stages (<10 min). Thereafter both dyes were nearly balanced (Fig. 5D). A marked phase separation could be seen within multilayer regions (strong light scatter), during their growth (Fig. 6B): DiI accumulated preferentially in spots at the border of these regions, whereas Bodipy-PC distributed more evenly. Moreover, light scattering structures without correspondence in fluorescence were observed, probably denoting surfactant in a gel-like phase excluding both dyes (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Segregation of liquid ordered and expanded phases as revealed by Bodipy-PC and DiI. A, within flat regions at 15 min. B, distribution of Bodipy-PC and DiI with respect to the surface topography (reflection) at 30 min.

Experimental conditions in B and C are identical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to LBPs, surfactant purified from lung lavages behaved considerably different (Fig. 6C). Whereas optically flat regions (low reflectance) were similar, prominent light scattering structures did not develop. Instead, regions of high reflectivity but low light scatter were seen. Moreover, dye separation was more pronounced than compared with LBPs: Bodipy-PC preferentially stained the low reflective regions and DiI, completely absent there, concentrated within the highly reflective ones. As with LBPs, regions in a gel-like type of phase, excluding both dyes, were observed. The lateral and the spatial organization of interfacial structures were studied by LSM. Images from different focal planes (Fig. 7, A and B) demonstrate that multilayers have an extension in the z-direction. Analysis of fluorescence contrast and defocus aberration (Fig. 7, A and C; lines 1 and 2) unveiled that these three-dimensional structures are present in the subphase and also extend into the air. On the other hand, the lateral distribution of the dyes largely corresponded throughout the region imaged in Fig. 7A. Noteworthy, the intensity profiles of DiI and Bodipy-PC (Fig. 7, A and D, line 3) showed a stepwise distribution, again suggesting accumulation of surfactant within multilayer domains. Moreover, it revealed that dye co-localization was particularly high at the border of flat and light scattering regions (right end of line 3), but low toward their center (central and left part of line 3). Fluorescent beads (1 μm) were embedded at the interface, and their random motion quantified by long exposure times (Fig. 8A). Before applying LBPs (at time 0), motions were 19.0 ± 6.8 μm/s, and slowed down during ongoing LBP-sedimentation and almost terminated at full surfactant coverage (0.13 ± 0.2 μm/s). This “stiffening”, similarly observed with purified surfactant (0.46 ± 0.47 μm/s), was further investigated by FRAP (Fig. 8B). Flat regions showed a recovery of 82.4 ± 11.5% of initial fluorescence within 10 min, light scattering regions 10.0 ± 4.0%, and border regions were in between (30.1 ± 13.2%). Recovery rates in purified surfactant were significantly higher (45.2 ± 3.6%) than those in light scattering regions of LBPs, but significantly lower than in flat regions (p ≤ 0.0025). The different results compared with the bead experiments are certainly related to the fact that FRAP is providing a region-dependent information, and that it is more sensitive for molecular movements than video microscopy of almost stagnant beads. Consistent with FRAP, and in contrast to purified surfactant, movements of a microtip inserted through th"

The ANHase structural genes anhA and anhB are separated by anhE, predicted to encode an 11.1-kDa polypeptide. An anhE deletion mutant did not grow on acetonitrile but grew on acetamide, the ANHase reaction product. Growth on acetonitrile was restored by providing anhE in trans. AnhA could be used to assemble ANHase in vitro, provided the growth medium was supplemented with 50 microM CoCl(2). Ten- to 100-fold less CoCl(2) sufficed when anhE was co-expressed with anhA. Moreover, AnhA contained more cobalt when produced in cells containing AnhE. Chromatographic analyses revealed that AnhE existed as a monomer-dimer equilibrium (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C). Divalent metal ions including Co(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Ni(2+) stabilized the dimer. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies demonstrated that AnhE binds two half-equivalents of Co(2+) with K(d) of 0.12 +/- 0.06 nM and 110 +/- 35 nM, respectively. By contrast, AnhE bound only one half-equivalent of Zn(2+) (K(d) = 11 +/- 2 nM) and Ni(2+) (K(d) = 49 +/- 17 nM) and did not detectably bind Cu(2+). Substitution of the sole histidine residue did not affect Co(2+) binding. Holo-AnhE had a weak absorption band at 490 nM (epsilon = 9.7 +/- 0.1 m(-1) cm(-1)), consistent with hexacoordinate cobalt. The data support a model in which AnhE acts as a dimeric metallochaperone to deliver cobalt to ANHase. This study provides insight into the maturation of NHases and metallochaperone function."
https://openalex.org/W2065466405,"Background Thromboxane A2 (TxA2)-induced smooth muscle contraction has been implicated in cardiovascular, renal and respiratory diseases. This contraction can be partly attributed to TxA2-induced Ca2+ influx, which resulted in vascular contraction via Ca2+-calmodulin-MLCK pathway. This study aims to identify the channels that mediate TxA2-induced Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Application of U-46619, a thromboxane A2 mimic, resulted in a constriction in endothelium-denuded small mesenteric artery segments. The constriction relies on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, because removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the constriction. This constriction was partially inhibited by an L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor nifedipine (0.5–1 µM). The remaining component was inhibited by L-cis-diltiazem, a selective inhibitor for CNG channels, in a dose-dependent manner. Another CNG channel blocker LY83583 [6-(phenylamino)-5,8-quinolinedione] had similar effect. In the primary cultured smooth muscle cells derived from rat aorta, application of U46619 (100 nM) induced a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which was inhibited by L-cis-diltiazem. Immunoblot experiments confirmed the presence of CNGA2 protein in vascular smooth muscle cells. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest a functional role of CNG channels in U-46619-induced Ca2+ influx and contraction of smooth muscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W2137836473,"Background Many diseases associated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are caused by transplanted hematopoietic cells, and the onset of these diseases occurs after homing of donor cells in the initial phase after BMT. Noninvasive observation of donor cell homing shortly after transplantation is potentially valuable for improving therapeutic outcomes of BMT by diagnosing the early stages of these diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings Freshly harvested near-infrared fluorescence-labeled cells were noninvasively observed for 24 h after BMT using a photon counting device to track their homing process. In a congenic BMT model, the homing of Alexa Fluor 750-labeled donor cells in the tibia was detected less than 1 h after BMT. In addition, subsequent cell distribution in an intraBM BMT model was successfully monitored for the first time using this method. In the allogeneic BMT model, T-cell depletion decreased the near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals of the reticuloendothelial system. Conclusions/Significance This approach in several murine BMT models revealed that the transplanted cells homed within 24 h after transplantation. NIRF labeling is useful for tracking transplanted cells in the initial phase after BMT, and this approach can contribute to in vivo studies aimed at improving the therapeutic outcomes of BMT."

https://openalex.org/W2098263707,"Aims Atrial natriuretic petide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) may reflect the severity of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). The exact nature and source of BNP, ANP and ET-1 expression and secretion following PE has not previously been studied. Methods and Results Polystyrene microparticles were injected to induce PE in rats. Gene expression of BNP, ANP and ET-1 were determined in the 4 cardiac chambers by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Plasma levels of ANP, BNP, ET-1 and cardiac troponin I (TNI) were measured in plasma. PE dose-dependently increased gene expression of ANP and BNP in the right ventricle (RV) and increased gene expression of ANP in the right atrium (RA). In contrast PE dose-dependently decreased BNP gene expression in both the left ventricle (LV) and the left atrium (LA). Plasma levels of BNP, TNI and ET-1 levels dose-dependently increased with the degree of PE. Conclusion We found a close correlation between PE degree and gene-expression of ANP, and BNP in the cardiac chambers with a selective increase in the right chambers of the heart. The present data supports the idea of natriuretic peptides as valuable biomarkers of RVD in PE."
https://openalex.org/W2057457214,"Background Thyrotoxicosis is conceptualized as an “autoimmune” disease with no accepted infectious etiology. There are increasingly compelling data that another “autoimmune” affliction, Crohn disease, may be caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Like M. tb, MAP is systemic. We hypothesized that some cases of thyrotoxicosis may be initiated by a MAP infection. Because other thioamides treat tuberculosis, leprosy and M. avium complex, we hypothesized that a mode of action of some thioamide anti-thyrotoxicosis medications may include MAP growth inhibition. Methods The effect of the thioamides, thiourea, methimazole and 6-propo-2-thiouracil (6-PTU) were studied in radiometric Bactec® culture, on ten strains of three mycobacterial species (six of MAP, two of M. avium and two of M. tb. complex). Data are presented as “cumulative growth index,” (cGI) or “percent decrease in cumulative GI” (%-ΔcGI). Principal Findings Methimazole was the most effective thioamide at inhibiting MAP growth. At 128µg/ml: MAP UCF-4; 65%-ΔcGI & MAP ATCC 19698; 90%-ΔcGI. Thiourea inhibited MAP “Ben” maximally; 70%-ΔcGI. Neither methimazole nor thiourea inhibited M. avium or M. tb. at the doses tested. 6-PTU has no inhibition on any strain studied, although a structurally analogous control, 5-PTU, was the most inhibitory thioamide tested. Significance We show inhibition of MAP growth by the thioamides, thiourea and methimazole in culture. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that these thioamides may have anti-prokaryotic in addition to their well-established eukaryotic actions in thyrotoxic individuals."
