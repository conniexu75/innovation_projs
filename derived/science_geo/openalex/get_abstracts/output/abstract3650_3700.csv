https://openalex.org/W1995900086,"A protein closely related to SV40 T antigen was purified in a biologically active form from cells infected with the defective adenovirus-SV40 hybrid, Ad2+D2. This 107,000 dalton hybrid protein binds and protects a specific portion of SV40 DNA from digestion by pancreatic DNAase I. Hybridization, endonuclease cleavage and pyrimidine tract analysis of the protected fragments reveal that the D2 hybrid protein binds in a sequential manner to tandem recognition sites which lie within a sequence of 120 nucleotides at position 67 near the origin of SV40 replication."
https://openalex.org/W2007945450,"A computer branching model is used to analyze cellular evolution. Attention is given to certain key amino acids and nucleotide residues (ferredoxin, 5s ribosomal RNA, and c-type cytochromes) because of their commonality over a wide variety of cell types. Each amino acid or nucleotide residue is a sequence in an inherited biological trait; and the branching method is employed to align sequences so that changes reflect substitution of one residue for another. Based on the computer analysis, the symbiotic theory of cellular evolution is considered the most probable. This theory holds that organelles, e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts invaded larger bodies, e.g., bacteria, and combined functions to form eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986167530,"Abstract Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) is an enzyme which acts on asparagine- and lipid-linked oligosaccharides containing five or more residues. Complex oligosaccharides and glycopeptides are completely resistant to the action of the enzyme. We have carried out pulse-chase experiments with 35 S-methionine and 3 H-mannose in uninfected cells and in cells infected with Sindbis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In each case, the labeled materials were analyzed for sensitivity to endo H by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. We find that endo H releases all the labeled from pulse-labeled proteins. Initially, the released material is nearly identical in size to the endo H cleavage product derived from lipid-linked oligosaccharides present in the same cells. During chase periods, 35 S-methionine and 3 H-mannose protein becomes increasingly resistant to the enzyme. Moreover, the 3 H-mannose-labeled material released from the protein during chase periods is smaller in size than the oligosaccharide from the lipid. On the basis of these results and results from other laboratories, we propose that during glycosylation of asparagine residues, a common oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid carrier to protein and is subsequently processed to yield the so-called mannose and oligosaccharides. Since, on the basis of present evidence, the lipid-linked oligosaccharide contains two N-acetylglucosamine, 8–12 and 1–2 glucose molecules, it seems probable that the carbohydrate-processing systems remove half or more of the and all of the glucose residues at sites destined to become complex glycopeptides. Removal of and glucose residues may also occur at sites destined to become mature high glycopeptides."

We have quantified relative potencies of tricyclic antidepressants in competing for the binding of 3H-labeled WB-4101 to alpha-noradrenergic receptor sites in rat brain membranes. Affinities of tricyclic drugs for alpha-noradrenergic receptor sites in the brain correlate well with the capacity of these agents to relieve psychomotor agitation and to induce sedation and hypotension; these affinities also correlate inversely with tendencies to elicit psychomotor activation."

https://openalex.org/W2061971119,"The virion RNAs from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) were translated in a micrococcal nuclease-treated cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes. The predominant polypeptides formed from 35S MuLV RNA were 78,000 and 65,000 daltons in molecular weight, and minor components with molecular weights of 180,000,110,000, 52,000 and 40,000 daltons were also observed. The 30S MSV RNA yielded two predominant polypeptides of 62,000 and 43,000 daltons, and minor components about 72,000, 40,000 and 18,000 daltons in molecular weight. The predominant polypeptides generated by both MuLV and MSV RNA were found to be precursors of the core proteins by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera. The 180,000 dalton molecular weight polypeptide encoded by MuLV RNA was immunoprecipitated both by antisera to the core protein (p30) and reverse transcriptase. The major products therefore appear to be Pr65gag and Pr78gag; an important minor product is Pr180gag-pol. Most of the products of <65,000 daltons synthesized in either system contained sequences from the core protein precursor, but the 43,000 and 18,000 dalton molecular weight polypeptides generated by MSV RNA did not precipitate with antisera to MuLV proteins. When purified yeast suppressor tRNA was added to the translation mixture directed by 35S MuLV RNA, the amount of the Pr78gag was reduced, while the yield of the Pr180gag-pol was enhanced. Amber suppressor tRNA was about 3 times as effective as ochre suppressor tRNA and nonsuppressor tRNA. This pattern of suppression was also seen for an established amber mutation (UAG) in the synthetase gene of Qβ (Qβ aml), suggesting that it is a UAG codon which terminates synthesis of Pr78gag. In the MSV system, the amber suppressor tRNA, and to a lesser extent the ochre suppressor tRNA, markedly increased the synthesis of the 72,000 dalton molecular weight polypeptide with a slight reduction of the 62,000 dalton protein. Since read-through between the core protein and reverse transcriptase genes occurs to a low level both in vivo and in vitro and can be enhanced in vitro by amber suppressor tRNA, these results suggest that a suppression mechanism may control the relative amounts of core protein and reverse transcriptase synthesized from 35S mRNA. Such a mechanism might be used more generally by mRNAs from mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2162463632,"Abstract Three clonal murine teratocarcinoma stem cell lines were studied for susceptibility to infection by a variety of different viruses. When in the undifferentiated state, these embryonal carcinoma stem cells are as sensitive to infection by encephalomyocarditis, Sindbis, vaccinia and vesicular stomatitis viruses as are embryo fibroblasts derived from the same mouse strain. The undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells, however, unlike the fibroblasts, are entirely refractory to infection with murine leukemia virus. If the stem cells are allowed to differentiate to form a variety of differentiated cell types, they become permissive for murine leukemia virus replication at a low level. Several techniques were used to elucidate the block to murine leukemia virus infection. In the one nullipotent cell line which does not differentiate in vivo or in vitro, virus adsorption and penetration are not restricted (as measured by infection with murine leukemia virus pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus), but an integrated proviral DNA copy cannot be detected. In a pluripotent stem cell line, proviral DNA sequences are detected, but neither transcription into viral specific RNA nor viral specific protein synthesis is observed. These findings suggest that control of murine leukemia virus replication in the cells is a function of the stage of differentiation and perhaps also of the genetic composition of the teratocarcinoma stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2114805139,"The genome of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) contains four known genes: gag, encoding structural proteins of the viral core; pol, encoding the viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase; env, encoding the glycoprotein(s) of the viral envelope; and src, which is responsible for neoplastic transformation of the host cell. We have located these genes on virus-specific RNAs in cells productively infected with both nondefective and defective strains of ASV by using molecular hybridization with DNAs complementary to specific portions of the ASV genome. The cytoplasm of cells producing nondefective ASV contains three species of polyadenylated virus-specific RNA, each of which has chemical polarity identical to that of the viral genome. The largest species has a molecular weight of 3.3 × 106 daltons and a sedimentation coefficient of 38S, encodes all four viral genes, and is probably identical to the viral genome. A second species has a molecular weight of 1.8 × 106 daltons and a sedimentation coefficient of 28S, and encodes the 3′ half of the viral genome, including env, src and a genetically silent region known as “c.” The smallest species has a molecular weight of 1.2 × 106 daltons and a sedimentation coefficient of 21S, and encodes only src and “c.” All three species of virus-specific RNA contain nucleotide sequences at least partially homologous to a sequence of 101 nucleotides found at the extreme 5′ end of the ASV genome. This sequence may not be present in the portions of the ASV genome which encode the 28S and 21S virus-specific RNAs, and hence may be joined to these RNAs during their maturation from precursor molecules. The size and genetic composition of virus-specific RNAs in cells producing defective deletion mutants reflect the nature of the deletion. Deletions of either src or env eliminate the 28S virus-specific RNA, leaving a 21S RNA (which contains either env and “c” in the case of src deletions or src and “c” in the case of env deletions) and a 35S RNA which is probably identical to the viral genome. Based on these and related results, we propose a model for viral gene expression which conforms to previous suggestions that eucaryotic cells initiate translations only at the 5′ termini of messenger RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2056405362,"The salient features of this model for oncornavirus assembly are that uncleaved precursor molecules to the internal virus polypeptides possess specific recognition sites both for viral envelope constituents already inserted in the cell membrane and for the viral RNA. After orderly alignment of these components at the budding site, virus maturation proceeds through specific proteolytic cleavage of the precursor components and association of the resultant molecules into the characteristic type C virion substructures revealed by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2091719073,"cAMP is shown to be directly involved in activating the motile apparatus of bull sperm. Triton X-100-extracted, demembranated (modeled) bull sperm are motile in the presence of ATP. Addition of cAMP to motile demembranated preparations of sperm produced a measured increase in motility. Maximal stimulation was obtained with 8–30 μM cAMP present in the mixture. The stimulation is of the same relative magnitude as obtained by addition of theophylline or caffeine to intact (membrane-bound) sperm. Modeled sperm show no sensitivity to theophylline. The response of the modeled sperm to the addition of cAMP was dependent upon the length of storage of the sperm and the condition of the sperm prior to modeling. Although modeled sperm show no sensitivity to theophylline, theophylline treatment of sperm prior to modeling increases the motility of the models produced and eliminates the sensitivity of the models to cAMP. Inhibiting the energy metabolism of the sperm prior to modeling greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the models to cAMP. We conclude that the effect of cAMP on modeled bull sperm reflects a naturally occurring balance which controls the motility of bull sperm, and that cAMP exerts its stimulatory action directly on the motile apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2034309727,"Intracellular recordings were made from trigeminal motoneurons of normally respiring, unanesthetized cats during naturally occurring sleep. The transition from quiet to active sleep was accompanied by tonic motoneuron hyperpolarization. Stimulation of the reticular formation induced a depolarizing potential in trigeminal motoneurons during quiet sleep and a hyperpolarizing potential during active sleep. The results provide a synaptic explanation for the phenomenon of reticular response reversal and insights into the basic mechanisms controlling motor activity during the sleep states."

https://openalex.org/W2086336638,"The frog sympathetic ganglion has been used as a model to elucidate the cellular mechanism of barbiturate anesthesia. Anesthetic concentrations of pentobarbital markedly reduced the fast nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potential while having no effect on the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential or slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential, even though all three synaptic potentials depend on the presynaptic release of acetylcholine. A similar differential effect was seen for nicotinic and muscarinic responses to exogenously applied agonists, while the depolarizing action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was enhanced. These results indicate that pentobarbital has remarkably selective actions on the sympathetic ganglion and further indicate that blockade of ganglionic transmission by anesthetic concentrations of pentobarbital can be entirely explained by a postsynaptic action. The present results strengthen the concept that pentobarbital anesthesia results from a postsynaptic blockade of central excitatory synapses which increase sodium conductance coupled with a postsynaptic enhancement of GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2071924835,"Dispersed pinealocytes have been used to study the role of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the ""turnoff"" of N-acetyltransferace activity. Activity was first stimulated 100-fold by treating cells with 1-norepinephrine. 1-Propranolol acted stereospecifically to rapidly reverse this, resulting in a 70 percent loss of enzyme activity within 15 minutes. An even more rapid 1-propranolol-induced decreased in cyclic AMP also occurred. This together with the observation that the inhibitory effect of 1-propranolol on N-acetyltransferase was blocked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors indicate that an abrupt decrease in cyclic AMP may be the signal for the rapid decrease in pineal N-acetyltransferase activity."

The decline is not caused by lack of nutrition. Instead, these studies suggest that active maternal behavior is necessary to maintain normal polyamine metabolism in brain and heart of the pup during development."
https://openalex.org/W2024136277,"Abstract We have pulse-labeled simian virus 40 (SV40)-infected monkey cells with 3 H-thymidine ( 3 H-dThd) and have hybridized the viral Okazaki pieces (rapidly labeled short DNA chains found during DNA replication, We also measured the size of the Okazaki pieces using gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditons after releasing the pieces from the filter-bound DNA strands. The size distribution of the Okazaki piece DNA from each strand was the same (∼ 145 nucleotides, weight average; 200–250 nucleotides, maximum size), indicating that the hybridization asymmetry resulted from a difference in the number rather than the size of the pieces in each strand. The simplest interpretation of our results is that SV40 DNA is synthesized semidiscontinuously: the strand with 3′ → 5′ orientation away from the origin is synthesized in short Okazaki pieces which are subsequently joined together, while the strand with 5′ → 3′ orientation away from the origin is synthesized continuously. Some models of two-strand discontinuous synthesis, however, cannot be ruled out."

https://openalex.org/W2049622511,"The relation between steroidogenesis induced by adrenocorticotropic hormone and the concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was studied at different time intervals in isolated adrenal cells. Submaximal and supramaximal steroidogenic concentrations of the hormone did not cause detectable changes in cyclic AMP during the first 30 minutes, whereas there was an increase in the concentration of cyclic GMP that was accompanied by phosphorylation and steroidogenesis. It is therefore suggested that cyclic GMP, rather than cyclic AMP, is the physiological mediator of adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced adrenal steroidogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1985187670,"Cellular coupling in the insect epidermis changes in a characteristic way during metamorphosis. In vitro, beta-ecdysone mimics the initial phase of these changes by increasing electrical coupling. Both adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and Ca2+ reverse natural and beta-ecdysone-stimulated changes, which suggests that ecdysone could work on communication through changes in cyclic AMP and Ca2+ levels. The transient changes in intercellular communication before metamorphosis may reflect the timing of the signals that trigger proliferation and the generation of new spatial patterns in the epidermis."

Infected cells were labeled with 35S-methionine for a time shorter than that required to complete a round of viral DNA replication. Mature and replicating SV40 minichromosomes were extracted and separated by zonal sedimentation, and their histone content was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS and acidic urea). We show that the pulse-labeled histones associate preferentially with the replicating DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1598990766,"A heat-stable protein inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatase has been purified to homogeneity from rabbit liver extract by heating to 95 degrees followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The purified inhibitor showed a single band when examined by gel electrophoresis S20, w and Stokes radius values were 1.45 and 25.5, respectively. Using these two values, the molecular weight and frictional ratio was calculated to be 15,500 and 3.40, respectively. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis was found to be 14,200. The inhibition of phosphoprotein phosphatase was linear up to 40% inhibition with respect to inhibitor was constant with time of incubation for at least 30 min. The optimum pH for the inhibition was between 6.8 and 7.6. A kinetic analysis of the effect of the inhibitor on the dephosphorylation of [32P]phosphorylase a by rabbit liver phosphoprotein phosphatase indicated a noncompetitive inhibition with respect to phosphorylase a. Purified liver inhibitor inhibited the phosphoprotein phosphatase activity in all rat tissues examined. Utilizing purified rabbit liver phosphoprotein phosphatase, the presence of inhibitor activity was also demonstrated in all rat tissues tested."
https://openalex.org/W2068609846,"Abstract Derepression of the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes was strongly impaired in a relA strain of E. coli K-12 grown in an amino acid-glucose medium. The expression of the isoleucine and valine operons during leucine starvation was markedly defective in the relA mutant as compared to an isogenic rel + strain. Downshift to a poor carbon and energy source or the addition of cyclic AMP to the glucose medium allowed normal derepression in the relA mutant of one of the isoleucine and valine enzymes, acetohydroxy acid synthase. The other isoleucine and valine enzymes failed to derepress under these conditions, in contrast to the high enzyme levels in the rel + parent. No increase in acetohydroxy acid synthase was found in relA cya or relA crp strains during glycerol or pyruvate downshift. Cyclic AMP allowed derepression in the relA cya mutant but not in the relA crp strain. These data strongly suggest that the relA requirement for normal expression of acetohydroxy acid synthase can be replaced by cyclic AMP."

Analgesic properties of the nucleotide are not reversed by naloxone. Microinjected intracerebrally into different sites, dibutyryl cyclic GMP does not mimic the action of morphine. Pharmacological effects of dibutyryl cyclic GMP suggest that endogenous cyclic GMP modulates an inhibitory pain pathway distinct from that on which morphine acts."
https://openalex.org/W1976791585,"Abstract The kinetics of annealing of the separated strands of the polyoma DNA Hpa II restriction fragments 1 and 2 to an excess of purified short DNA chains isolated from in vitro pulse-labeled replicating polyoma DNA were determined. The results indicate that for each growing fork, the DNA strand which must grow discontinuously is represented about 4 times as frequently in the population of short DNA chains as the strand which could replicate continuously. In addition, the absolute concentration of short DNA chains in the two growing forks is approximately the same. The average size of the short DNA chains from the continuous strand was shown to be very similar to that of the short DNA chains from the discontinuous strand. We conclude that polyoma DNA replication in vitro proceeds by a predominantly semi-discontinuous mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1546339529,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the DNA of simian virus 40. The proceeding report (Dhar, R., Reddy, V.B., and Weissman, S.M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 612-620) presents the sequence of a portion of the simian virus 40 DNA that overlaps the region encoding the 5' end of the minor structural protein VP2. We report here the sequence of the remainder of the genes for minor structural proteins VP2 and VP3. The results indicate that the mRNA for the two proteins is read in the same phase and the initiation site for VP3 lies within the structural gene of VP2. The codons of the COOH-terminal amino acids of VP2 and VP3 are read in a second phase as the codons of the NH2-terminal amino acids of VP1."

https://openalex.org/W1574986110,"Cellular RNA synthesis was studied in mouse L-929 cells and in these cells infected with mengovirus. RNA polymerases I, II, and III were partially purified and their chromatographic properties were analyzed by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography. RNA polymerase II was purified from mouse liver and its subunit structure was compared to that of normal and virus-infected L-929 cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. By these criteria, the enzymes from all three sources were identical. The RNA synthetic activities and capacities of chromatins from normal and virus-infected cells were compared under a variety of conditions. The endogenous activity in chromatin from infected cells was inhibited relative to controls but the residual activity responded normally to stimulation by ammonium sulfate, heparin, and Sarkosyl. The template capacity of the chromatins was compared with added RNA polymerase II and by a rifampicin challenge assay utilizing Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Identical results were obtained in each case. The number of growing RNA chains and the rates of their elongations were determined. The results showed that nuclei and chromatin from infected cells have a smaller number of RNA polymerase II molecules engaged in RNA synthesis than normal cells do but that the active molecules elongate RNA chains at the same rate."

https://openalex.org/W2067427376,"The fluorescence emissions of chrysene, N-ethylcarbazole, and 1,6-diphenylhexatriene undergo large spectral shifts or changes in quantum yield, or both, upon their uptake from particulates by phospholipid vesicles. This membrane uptake of carcinogen and carcinogen-like molecules by model membranes does not result in any disruption of the lipid bilayers. The fluorescence emission of chrysene, when bound to silica, was found to be sensitive to the surface density of chrysene on the silica. These observations demonstrate the feasibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the rates of exchange of carcinogens from particulate matter to cell membranes and to characterize the surface distribution of chemical carcinogens on particulate matter. Comparison of the uptake rate of chrysene from the unperturbed crystal state, sonicated crystals, and the silica-adsorbed state demonstrated that the last condition results in the most rapid transport of chrysene into model membranes. This information should prove valuable in understanding the cocarcinogenic effects of particulates and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons."

Comparison of the sequence with those found in polyadenylated RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells RNA shows that the transcript of sequences preceding the structural gene is more abundant than the transcript containing the codons for the protein. Between the abundant transcript of sequences preceding the coding region and the less abundant transcript of the coding region there is a short sequence whose transcript is not detected.
